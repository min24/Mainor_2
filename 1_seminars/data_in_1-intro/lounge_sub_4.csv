It is a large and very open space. Enough different seating arrangements. A separate space for computers. And a food and drinks counter. Due to the open space one can hear almost every conversation. To make things worse they play loud music. Food is ok. Enough choice but not much of a display. Drinks are also ok. Enough choice. Alcohol you have to ask (except beer). WiFi speed is great and free. Shower room is a strange affair. You get a 'space towel' and some slippers. If you don't bring your own shampoo and/or soap, you are left with only water to wash yourself. The towel is a big paper cloth you can dispose of after the shower. Slippers have the same design. You don't enter this space for a spa treatment, but it does refresh.

Door understaffed & young man at desk very obviously nicer to male clients than myself as a solo middle aged woman. Lounge is poorly set up rather like a bus station where toomany travellers require seats for their bags & coats. Food selection is the worst I've seen in a lounge. Drinks selection is better but they sure do not hurry to put out the bubbly. The latest empty has been sitting on a counter for a half hour now.

The lounge is upstairs and is light elegant and airy albeit with no windows onto the tarmac. Comfy seating a separate computer area wifi throughout and attractive palm trees add a festive air. There is a circular bar that was unmanned during my visit plus a smaller self-service bar with an excellent selection of drinks and classy snacks. There is a separate screened-off TV lounge and another wine bar at the back for paying customers only. Since the lounge was brand-new it was obvious an effort was being made to impress.

Eva use the Air Canada lounge along with a couple of other Star Alliance carriers. It is close (2-3 minutes) to the boarding gates but suffers like some others on T2 in that it's a fair hike from immigration to the gates/lounge. One inside it is very modern and comfortable with a nice bar and service good range of food and good personal space.

If you go to a lesser terminal 2D for example there really is nothing more than a seat coffee and power. It's worth noting that if you do have a long haul flight and you arrive before 2pm you can use the lounge in the arrivals area of 2C.. this has around 6 showers and the usual... not the most comfortable but the staff are polite and it's a hell of allot better waiting for your TGV (Train) in here after a shower.,AIR FRANCE BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Paris CDG Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,3,3,2,1,2,3,0

If you use this lounge after 7pm you might enjoy a light meal . Choices 10 days ago were a nice beef roulade salad and or grilled vegetables. Soup is also available usual cheese and cake for desert. Much better food then before in this lounge and more fun eating here then food served in airplanes at 1 am.

Very large seperated in several areas with a real bar with the usual selection and great wines and a first for any AF lounge a self service Hot food corner including some risotto pasta cold meat and some pastries for dessert.

At a BA or Virgin lounge you get a fully stocked and staffed bar. At Air France the self- service selections at Air France are limited. At a BAR or Virgin Lounge I can order a full sit down meal.

The lounge is used by so many airlines that announcements for flight boarding are going on forever - maybe they should learn from other lounges and make this one a silent one. Food quality is poor and choice is at the same disappointing level. Drinks consist of cans and bottles that are presented in a very small refrigerator - meaning the cans have no time to become col.

Good points - this new lounge is huge has a varied selection of seats including recliners shower facilities are good OKAY selection of reading material and half a dozen internet terminals for free internet access. The bad points are that whilst Air India's website shows alcohol is available to international travellers none is available or on show. In fact there's one small fridge with water pepsi 7 up fanta or fruit juice - that's it. The food selection is similarly limited and the hot selection was particularly unsatisfactory (2 veg 1 meat - however there appeared to be no chicken in this!).

Bad points - except for the shami kebabs the food selection was poor and in the case of the sheesh kebabs revolting. Had the crackers and crisps instead once the shami had run out.

The best you can do is hug one of the little chairs in the front room and use earplugs.

Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new. Once I found a seat I was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where I eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses. There was food on offer as well but I gave it a miss as I did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned.

emirates,/lounge-reviews/emirates,Emirates A380 First Class Lounge - Dubai Airport,H Dalem,Netherlands,2014-02-20,Looks like a very posh lounge at the beginning. Almost deserted. Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet. It is a huge lounge because it covers the whole building.,EMIRATES A380 FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Dubai Airport,First Class,NA,NA,3,2,5,3,3,2,2,2,0

The seating and service from staff was great but like the business class lounge at this airport it was very noisy because the general concourse and duty free area on the floor below is open to both first and business class lounges in the centre and the noise travels up and in. The food was marginally better than the business class lounge but to get toast and butter you had to go into the dining room sit wait to be served and then wait for the toast. All a bit over the top.

While you will be told at check in that flights are not called the reverse is true - some flights are called (very disturbing to sleep when there are no earplugs available!) on a very odd seemingly random basis.

I was disappointed with the lack of food selections some sandwiches rice beef curry and spicy bean curd dish available. Okay selection of drinks and alcohol. I was disappointed by the lack of sweets and desserts only cookies nuts and bite-size cheese available.

Elevator down one level after you enter the reception lobby to the business class lounge area. Plenty of comfortable seating in a variety of configurations lounge chairs sofas eating tables with chairs and work stations with outlets. The free WiFi was reliable and fast but the logon process is a little tricky. Separate food bar and lounge areas. The food area had a very comprehensive buffet both Western and Indian food one of the best I have seen second only to Dubai. Lots of snacks and fruit which you could take with you for your flight. The bar had a full wall video screen showing sports and a wide selection of beer wine and cocktails.

Incheon is a huge airport and so the lounge is necessarily huge too although it is cleverly set up is two areas separated by the lift shafts toilets etc. Comfortable chairs everywhere but largely lined up as if in a waiting room. Fantastic views from massive glass onto the tarmac apron. The catering was astonishing in its pausity. One unrermakable red and one unknown (and don't care too) white no bubbles of any sort a couple of self-serve draft beers water came in juice pouch things reminiscent of 1990s economy class meal trays. There was a non-descript pumpkin soup without bread a couple of unappetising salads a couple of pot noodle things (self-serve) a couple of juices and thats about your lot. Empty glasses and plates hung around for a long time including a beer mug on a table that was there when we wrrived and was still there when we left 2 hours later. Toilets were roomy and clean a must-visit to have a play with the electric flush bidet and warm air arrangement. Wifi free without the need of a password and was quick enough for the few emails and bit of browning I did.

This morning there were two men and a woman to greet guests as they arrived. The two men were completely disinterested in greeting or lending a hand to adjust our seats on the next flight. It was like pulling teeth to have them assign us two seats together even though we already knew the flight was nearly half empty. They really don't belong especially after having just stepped off a terrific flight where every staff member did their absolute best to ensure a restful and pleasant journey for each passenger.

As much as I loved the old premium terminal there were times when it would be so crowded it was impossible to get a seat but that was often due to passengers taking up a table and three chairs for the coats bags or newspapers no such problem now as there is a range of different types of chair and sofas spread around the bottom floor in different areas. The design is exceptional with a very nice water feature. At the time I' usually there the lounge tends to be quite busy when I arrive but after a few hours its almost empty. As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours. Later I tried one of the work stations so I could use the USB charging unit each of the stations has a small bag of snacks and a bottle of water.

A dining area is equipped with dining tables and chairs, in front of a well stocked bar and food buffet. As a nice touch there was a big jug of ready made Pimms (with lots of fruit garnish) available as a celebration of Wimbledon. In the morning the food on offer was bacon, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, plenty of breads, cold meats and various garnishes. At about 11am this changed to hot lunch items: rice, chicken casserole, pasta with sauce, soup and various other items. The staff were very unobtrusive and kept the place clean and tidy.

I can't believe people would pay several hundred dollars a year for access. Food was nearly non-existent. The offerings were limited to a bowl of apples one flavor of yogurt cereal and a handful of shriveled miniature bagels that looked like they'd been recycled from the previous day. Juice was available only upon request at the bar (tips appreciated). Although the club provides wi-fi service it was not working when I was there. Only a few of the seating locations had access to electrical outlets.

At Terminal 1 in Heathrow it is a good 10-15 minute walk about as far apart as you can get in the terminal from lounge to gate. Three time I have been refused access here - you have to go back down the stairs go to the internal desk hope it is manned or the person is free get a pass from them and go back. it is more hassle than it is worth. In Edinburgh twice they said ""no"" then looked at a card document and realised it was ""yes"" but this apparently changes in September and the SQ card is no longer welcome there.

It didn't feel anything special and was quite crowded. The lounge just doesn't feel like a business class lounge - more like a waiting room. We didn't see much food on offer just hot / cold drinks muffins fruit ice cream. We didn't want to lose our seats so we didn't really get to see a lot of the lounge or what food might have been on offer.

When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down.

It was a no brainer and I opted for TG which offers a superior lounge experience to North American carriers. The TG lounge while not as good as BKK was still top quality. There was an assortment of hot & cold foods along with a decent beverage option. The lounge was crowded but there were still some seats available. First Class passengers have little designated private booth type seating areas and again it is less impressive than the TG 1st experience in BKK. I did have a chuckle though as the seating option and lounge experience that the 1st class PAX had was hardly worth the fare difference between 1st and Business.

iberia,/lounge-reviews/iberia,Iberia Sala Vip Business Class Lounge - Las Vegas Airport,James Slocombe,NA,2009-05-04,VIP Sala lounge again disappoints. The general condition of the lounge is still average with a large seating area and a view (albeit obscured) across the runway. Some of the furniture is worn especially the chairs in the popular locations (near the windows). The TV despite being a large LCD is never really utilised - being tucked away in a corner on channel TVEspana without sound. When I asked to hear the TV (the normal lounge lady wasn't on duty today) the new lounge staff didn't speak English so I had to convert to Spanish. My Spanish is pretty good but I do expect the airport staff - especially lounge staff - to understand English and respond to me in that language if that is the language of my choice. It didn't set us on the right footing. I was told that sound would disturb others so she couldn't change the volume. So what is the point of the TV then? I asked. I got shrugged shoulders. I expressed my displeasure and walked off for a coffee. The coffee was cold. So I went back to the lounge staff. She solved the situation by taking my coffee to the kitchen and (I assume) putting it in the microwave. The cup was too hot to hold! Despite the coffee the bar/alcoholic drinks selection is superb. Even the soft drinks shine bright - Coke without caffeine Coke zero Fanta milkshakes fruit juices etc. all being stocked among the usual collection. By far the best collection of cold drinks in one lounge I've seen. However the food is dire. In fact it could be described as peanuts. Not even an apple or a rotting banana. Nothing except peanuts and a tea-biscuit. Compare this to the Sala lounge at TFN a smaller more regional airport serving mostly national Spanish routes and Tenerife North wins hands down. They even have small sandwiches and a selection of cakes at TFN - but in LPA no!,IBERIA SALA VIP BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Las Vegas Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,2,4,0,2,0,1,0

british-airways,/lounge-reviews/british-airways,British Airways Terraces Business Class Lounge - Rome Fiumicino Airport,A Twigg,United Kingdom,2013-02-14,Not very well signposted to the location of the lounge I just happened to look left at the correct time! Excellent lounge though! Reception is staffed is by informative and jolly staff. As the lounge is only used by a handful of flights each day it is quiet and you can easily find yourself in a nice corner with a couple of tables and chairs to spread out. Full selection of wines spirits and beers were on offer with Peroni on draft which is a great addition to any airline lounge. Hot drinks machine was working. A good range of food was on offer with an assortment of finger sandwiches that weren't dry or tasteless. Nice little pasta pots also added a twist to the offerings. A good selection pastries. In terms of comfort the seating was good. The furnishings and little details gave it the signature British Airways lounge feel. Lack of departures screen can make you slightly anxious that you'll see your plane trundle past as you are fully reclined at one of the window seats. But the receptionist insists she will call the flight for you but being British we need to see it to believe it - by using the free Wi-Fi in the lounge keeping an eye on your flights status is possible. Overall a fantastic terraces lounge outside of the UK. Much larger than required but not going to complain!

united-airlines,/lounge-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines Business Class Lounge - Melbourne Airport,Alan Luck,United States,2014-11-19,"This is a low even for United. Buried in the basement of the International Terminal the United Club in Melbourne is embarrassing on a whole new level. From the sad offerings of ""hot"" food to the rarely- looked-after beverage station this lounge disappoints. The walls a soft padded dingy grey relic from the early '90s only serve to bring the mood of the lounge down to a level of murky depression. The worst part of this lounge however is the pathetic ""WiFi service"" that is only provided by Melbourne Airport. Free WiFi from the airport is never good and in the bowels of Tullamarine's transport hub it degrades to ""nearly unusable."" All of this would be fine if not for the lack of chairs. For an international lounge that serves many major continents there are between 25 and 30 seats in the entire lounge. Most of the seats face another so it is more uncomfortable to take an empty seat thereby reducing the most often usable seats by half. Dishes running out food running out and messes left unattended are par for the course at the United Club in MEL. This is by far the worst United Club I have ever been to and Ive been to ORD C LAX T3 Newark and some of the other dregs of the Lounge world.

I've used plenty of the major airline's first class lounges: Qantas Cathay Emirates American etc: and considering this is the First Class lounge at BA's flagship terminal; I was pretty unimpressed. Firstly the breakfast was awful. The scrambled eggs on the buffet were more milk than egg. The coffee was out of a machine: no trained Barista and the menu that was available was very limited. I also had to queue for the toilets: not a shower. Just the toilets. Maybe this can happen in the business lounge but you just wouldn't expect this in first. Then it's the little things. I sat in quite a comfy seat with decent views but I could not charge my phone as there was no USB amenities. Also they had international power outlets but not Australian/New Zealand and I had already packed my adapters in my checked baggage. These are the type of small items that with a little thought can make a big difference to one's comfort whilst travelling. Sorry BA but you've failed.

Overly bright the seating is all out in the open so the sense is of an uninviting space that seems designed to set you on edge rather than relax you. The food offering is dreadful - little plastic wrapped awful cakes cheap wine and reconstituted juices. The staff are rude and officious. One only has to compare this with the BA lounges in Terminal 5 to see where they have gone wrong at every turn. This and the fact that they have now substituted the slow cramped 757 for wider bodied planes on a lot of the London flights just screams this is an airline who couldn't care less about its customers even those who are its premium ones.,AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB LOUNGE REVIEW,London Heathrow Airport,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,1,1,4,2,1,0

qatar-airways,/lounge-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways Business Class Lounge - Doha Airport,A Mendoza,NA,2009-06-04,Premium Terminal is a bit confusing to get to as the bus operator from the plane makes no announcements. Once in the terminal there is a limited duty free shopping area (much smaller than the main terminal's) and a few gates. Upstairs is the lounge area for premium passengers. Service is good as you are greeted immediately upon arrival. From there you can deposit heavy bags in the cloak room use (rather dated) computers in the business centre go to the game room or go to the First or Business Class lounge. The business class lounge has a large dining area with actual table service. Food selection was excellent for a lounge - with actual main dishes and an endless variety of premium drinks. Past the dining area are huge sitting areas for more passengers who just want to relax. All seats are singles though so don't expect to be able to lie down anywhere. There are showers in the restrooms but there are no toilets and sinks in the private shower rooms. This means that one must groom and finish up in the public area of the restroom which is a bit odd.

Recently Delta has been testing new food offerings here including soup cold sandwiches and hot and cold appetizers. The soup and sandwiches are a welcome addition and might quiet some of the criticism in these comments. Other criticisms have been the presence of children in some of the delta clubs. Personally I found the children refreshing and much more interesting than the folk that typically populate the clubs. Delta has solved that problem too as they will soon begin to charge $29 per guest including family members unless you purchase a $700 executive membership. The SEA club has a great staff especially the bartenders. The complementary alcohol though is poor quality and the Luxury Bar drinks are not cheap. The seating in this club is generally uncomfortable except for the quiet room. This lounge needs additional electric outlets in the seating areas.

It is quite a hike there but most flights to Asia and the US depart from there so I guess it is ok. It is quite unique : huge sofas and armchairs impressive chandeliers (like in a palace) and soft carpets. At peak times seating is very limited and I saw people leave the lounge because of not enough seating. There is an open bar with a wide selection of drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) - albeit glasses are very small - and some snacks (puff pastry and sandwiches). There are no showers which is quite a disappointment after a long flight. Bathrooms could be cleaner. There is a business center with free internet access and there are of course muslim prayer rooms.

A simpler more elegant version of Emirates lounge in Dubai. I was there when it was not very crowded so it will be interesting to see what it's like when it is full - that was the worst part of the old premium lounge. The lounge has 2 dining facilities several snack areas and bars lots of seating a business area and as with its old premium lounge a lot of staff being helpful. Big and airy it is open to the new terminal but the noise did not seem to be a problem. There are numerous zones for seating broken up by architectural screen walls interior plantscaping and changes to the floor level.

What use is it to take a shower only to sweat through a shirt before you leave the shower room? At first I thought it was just me because I overheat easily but watching other passengers leave the shower area they were all red faced and sweating. Then there's the obvious issues with cleanliness the showers I've used have all had mould there is no shower curtain so the water splashes out onto your luggage and all over the floor. Add to that no wash cloths one towel and no floor mat and it is an entirely unpleasant experience. I've given them a few opportunities but from here on out I'm just going to go without a shower; remaining dirty is preferable to using these facilities. Then there's the staff on every occasion I've been to this lounge some KLM employees are courteous but most are dismissive rude and not the least bit interested in customer satisfaction. KLM service has been falling steadily over the years and it is apparent that things are near a breaking point as obvious budget cuts and lack of planning/staff training for non-aircraft positions doesn't rank more than a single star.

I'm traveling on Air Canada and originally was turned away because they wouldn't recognize my Executive First ticket and told me I needed Star Alliance Gold membership. Then at the gate the Air Canada gate personnel overheard me saying I needed to find some wi-fi and he suggested I try the lounge. I told him I had been turned away he helpfully called down got into a discussion about the business class eligibility and sent me down. No cocktails - there's a bar but it's unstaffed and the only drinks are a few diet cokes and some bloody mary mix. A few apples and bags of chips complete the offering. Most unhelpfully since I'm not a Red Carpet Club member I had to buy my own wifi access on t-mobile. This contradicts the info on the little placard that says t-mobile wifi is available on a complimentary basis to international customers. Well last time I checked Toronto was in Canada not the US. The bathroom is dingy grey the tiles are dirty and I swear there's graffiti and scratching on the door to one of the stalls. The lounge seating area is nice enough but they need to make more of an effort to make this more than just a glorified waiting area.

tap-portugal,/lounge-reviews/tap-portugal,Tap Portugal Business Class Star Alliance Gold Lounge - Lisbon Airport,Dajo DeCourcy,Portugal,2015-05-10,This lounge is too small. It is always full and difficult to find seating. They have a good selection of magazines if you speak Portuguese. Having just spent an hour in the lounge the coffee spilt on the steps was not cleaned. There were no hors d'oeuvres Pepsi and Pepsi light taps were only pouring water there were no small bottles of water and practically every single table was dirty with dirty dishes - yet there were four people in the lounge kitchen. Apparently all too busy having a morning conversation rather than doing their job and making the lounge presentable.,TAP PORTUGAL BUSINESS CLASS STAR ALLIANCE GOLD LOUNGE REVIEW,Lisbon Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,1,2,1,2,3,1,0
korean-air,/lounge-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air Business Class Lounge - New York JFK Airport,Yana Morris,United States,2014-10-04,Used this lounge as Aeroflot passenger. It was dirty and crowded. There was no food accept for few crackers and some cheese. Plenty of soft drinks that were restocked fast. The communication between the plane and the lounge was terrible. We were asked to proceed to boarding and the plane was nowhere near ready! The receptionist was very clueless. We ended up waiting in line in front of the gate for 30 min Overall a pretty depressing experience.,KOREAN AIR BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,New York JFK Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,2,1,1,1,5,1,0
malaysia-airlines,/lounge-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines Business Class Golden Lounge - KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,Mark Niall,Australia,2014-10-04,We use this lounge twice a year on return flights to Europe. It does the job. However dispte some renovation recently it could do with better and more shower cubicles and also toilets. Quite often there is a wait for both. Food and drinks adequate. They do need to lift the lounge to bring it up to the standards expected. They operate a very good business class in their planes. They may have to spend some money to bring the lounge up to the standard of their aircraft.,MALAYSIA AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS GOLDEN LOUNGE REVIEW,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,3,4,4,4,3,3,4,1
air-new-zealand,/lounge-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand Business Class Lounge - Auckland Airport,Stephen Williams,Australia,2011-07-04,"The first impression of this lounge is that all the colour has been sucked out of the room. The ""colour"" palette is of dull mud brown gum-leaf grey and khaki. To add to the disappointment is that the windows are frosted over - no view. A better view is available in the public areas. The food is very basic simple presentation. Think of simple home cooking rather than restaurant quality. Even though New Zealand produces some excellent wines (and a decent selection available) they did nothing to present these in any way to encourage you to drink them or provide information about them. The bottles where just sitting in the fridge along with beers and soft drinks. The bathroom did not appear to have been updated in the past decade and it was not serviced frequently as there were no hand towels available - empty dispensers. Nothing was presented as a premium lounge of an international airline.",AIR NEW ZEALAND BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Auckland Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,4,3,2,2,4,4,0
vietnam-airlines,/lounge-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines Business Class Lounge - Ho Chi Minh City Airport,A Bencke,Australia,2013-07-31,Slightly shabby and old style chairs no showers for those coming off overnight flights. Food not enticing who eats partly cooked carrots? A curious mix of Asian and western foods meant that for the most part little appealed . The mouse baits visible in front of the plate glass window are not a good look. Staff tried to please but often misunderstood the question. Internet worked well unlike the Hanoi business lounge a month earlier . Charging iPad and iPhones possible at one location. Seemed to be a lot of staff doing nothing behind the bar counter.,VIETNAM AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Ho Chi Minh City Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,3,3,2,3,4,3,0
korean-air,/lounge-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air Business Class Lounge - Tokyo Narita Airport,R Ganbich,NA,2009-07-30,Actually a very poor experience. The lounge itself was fair comfortable seating an ample drinks selection. If one wanted a hot drink one was confronted with a dispenser only labelled in Japanese/Korean staff quite unwilling to help. As there was no catering (only rice crackers and savoury crackers) for this just-after-lunchtime departure. This added to an unsatisfactory experience mostly on the account of the rude and unhelpful staff. I do not consider it a problem to have a limited command of English in a non-english speaking country and working in a mostly non-english speaking place but it is very problematic to combine this with such a rude attitude.,KOREAN AIR BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Tokyo Narita Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,3,3,0,4,0,1,0
american-airlines,/lounge-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines Admirals Club Business Class Lounge - Chicago O'Hare Airport,J Katnic,United States,2013-07-07,Purchased a day pass to use at DFW/ORD/LAX. This review is for the lounge at ORD only. Lounge amenities lacking. The only self-serve beverages are coffee/tea/water. Free food consists of supermarket type cookies and two choices of apples. The latter are acceptable due to the fact that AA flights in Business/First more than make up for this with food/beverage/alcohol service. What was especially appalling about this lounge is the restroom/toilet facilities. AA terminal restrooms are usually crowded and dirty so I though that the lounge restrooms would be clean and inviting: quite the opposite! To start there are not private stalls like the lounges at DFW/LAX. I was carrying multiple carryon bags and tried to find a stall which would accommodate them. The stall closest to the wall was occupied the next one over had a broken lock the next one over was missing the hook in which to hang bags/coats and the handicapped stall had an almost one inch gap between the door and where it is supposed to lock. The lock maybe jutted out 1/16 of an inch and opened several times when I tried to hang my bag on the door hook. Making things worse there seemed to be no air conditioning in the restroom and a male employee kept pacing the area in front of the stalls with a bag of toilet paper rolls loudly conversing on the phone in a foreign language. All of the above factors made me leave the restroom and lounge early (sweating bullets by this point) for the family restroom outside of gate H6. Not worth the money paid and I would not pay the annual membership fees for such discomfort/lack of amenities.,AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Chicago O'Hare Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,4,2,1,1,0,1,0
british-airways,/lounge-reviews/british-airways,British Airways Business Class Lounge Customer - Hong Kong Airport,Fabrizio Ferraro,NA,2009-12-04,This lounge is shared by BA and Qantas and doesn't have many seats. So unless you get there quite early you might find it difficult to find a seat. The seats are old and need a make over. The choice of drinks is limited. Only one red one white and one sparkling wine (not champagne). The choice of food was limited to nuts fruit cold finger sandwiches cheese and crackers and Asian snacks (very tasty). Okay selections of newspapers no TV screens and a limited number of IT stations with one out of order. The lavatories were clean and so were the shower rooms.,BRITISH AIRWAYS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,Hong Kong Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,0
british-airways,/lounge-reviews/british-airways,British Airways Galleries South Business Class Lounge -t5 London Heathrow Airport,C Lambie,United Kingdom,2014-01-29,Use this lounge 2-3 times a month and position is okay subject to which A gates you board from. It is cramped not just at peak times and BA seem to have become complacent about improving this. Toilets can be very risky unless you catch at the moment they have just been cleaned and often filthy and unpleasant. Food is at Travelodge level (UK travellers will know what I mean) and fails to match standards at some better European airline lounges. Staff at reception only want to see a card or boarding pass and I think these must be the ones that didn't make the grade at charm school. Don't get me wrong I like BA but their lounge standards (including First) here at Terminal 5 are now poor.,BRITISH AIRWAYS GALLERIES SOUTH BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW -T5 LONDON HEATHROW AIRPORT,NA,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,2,2,2,1,3,1,0
