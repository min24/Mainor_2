Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly.

adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,Michael Asher,Turkey,2013-06-10,Istanbul-Ljubljana-Munich and return. Pre-take off on all sectors given an individual bottle of water and plastic glass. During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm.

The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket.

Both sector uses the Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ200. Small plane but the 2-3 crews on both sectors were friendly and the service efficient. Seats were comfortable and the planes in good clean conditions. Light meals were served - generally a roll here or a pie there plus drinks. The inflight magazine is surprisingly rich with information on Slovenian culture and way of life and is one of the best I have read.

The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,D Lee,Singapore,2015-05-20,Athens-Prague on 11 May. Online check-in was quick just had to get boarding passes and to drop off bags at the airport. Despite having a bus gate boarding was organised very well and the flight departed ahead of schedule. The seats were quite comfortable and legroom was acceptable for this short flight. There was a small hot meal of pasta on the flight as well as a small dessert and drinks. Sweets were distributed before the main meal service. The red wine served on board was very good. Of note are the cabin crew who were very friendly and went around their work with smiles on their faces - this is rare these days with most airlines. The entertainment consisted of short videos on Greek island destinations and was ok though there was no audio available. Arrival into Prague on time and bags were processed within 15 minutes after leaving the aircraft.

The other male crew member was 'too busy' to bring an infant lap belt once the doors had closed and I was offered neither a drink or a meal.

Departed on time and despite the fact that it was such a short flight a full drink service was offered with a variety of soft drinks napkins ice and a bag of peanuts and everyone was served. Upon landing in ATH the goodbye and thanks you greeting was polite with a smile. An excellent flight. 3 hour layover at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Athens was a breeze.

In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers.

aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2014-10-12,Flew from Belfast City Airport to Palma. The flight was delayed on the way out although it was confirmed that this was due to the airport the plane was leaving to come to Belfast to pick us up and in the end it was only just over an hour due to a speedy turn around by Aer Lingus staff. The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter. Usually some airlines are impossible to deal with after the fact however Aer Lingus were helpful and really gave the impression they went the extra mile to see if they could locate our misplaced shoes.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,0,NA,NA,4,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2014-10-05,Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,4,0,NA,NA,4,1
aerolineas-argentinas,/airline-reviews/aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,B Aldridge,United States,2014-08-26,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,2,0

A below-average airline. Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,2,0

Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish.

The purser knew each of the business class passenger's last names (there were 16 of us) and she was always around to see if she was needed. I fell asleep and she left me a drink and peanuts for when I woke up. Aeromexico staff is usually just OK - they are efficient but are cold and tend to disappear into the galley afterwards.

What is going on with the re-instated check-in / bag drop queues at Brussels? I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter. I think they need some better identification or barriers between the two to snake the queues to make it work better. Or a staff member guiding people correctly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

Both flights were on the newer 737-800s. I was upgraded on the outbound flight. Seats were the standard for medium haul although getting off the seat to walk can be cumbersome for those on the window seats. Meals were OK. Purser was courteous but distant. Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in. New 737s are really modern with PTVs and sky interiors. I don't know if this experience is enough to say that they have really improved.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work.

First time on this airline and I'm a little bit unimpressed with check-in at Porto Airport. No effort to direct passengers to correct boarding desks hence I ended up in the web-check in/bag-drop queue with passengers who had not even checked in online. Thankfully queue was processed within 20 minutes and got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. My seat was next to the emergency exit so I had plenty of legroom. Seat itself was comfy and perfect for a nap. Crew extremely professional and always had a smile on their faces. Flight took off on time and landed smoothly in Paris-Orly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time. Once on the ground we were told by the cabin crew that the captain of this Aigle Azur flight had piloted his last flight so we promptly congratulated him as we departed the aircraft. All in all Aigle Azur was worth the money that I paid .

Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland.

After a recent flight it has me irked. Outbound my designer coat had to be bunched into a ball by a very abrupt FA and put up top for take off due to it not being secure. Inbound my neighbour had 3 shopping bags and a coat on the middle seat and not an eyelid batted? Food service is also always hit a miss outbound I was able to buy a breakfast offering on return nothing was available. Also I note the seat belt sign seems to stay on unusually longer than any other airline probably to keep passengers seated longer in order for service prep. Seats are comfortable for short haul leather but starting to wear slightly. Gold Circle club is a waste of time. At Dublin I attempted to check in at a computer terminal with my passport and told to report to a physical desk for check in. Oh joy huge queues luckily I tried another machine and it worked fine. The only reason I find a lot of people use IE is the route monopoly.

We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on Europe-West Africa routes.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved.

All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard.

At check-in I asked if I could request an aisle seat or one with extra legroom (I'm 6ft 7ins) I was told I had to pay 50 pounds if I wanted it. Of course this made the journey very uncomfortable straight away as on both flights I was sat in between passengers. Both aircraft's were very old especially for the long haul Moscow to Shanghai. Entertainment consisted of a projector and white screen at the front of the cabin - the worst entertainment I've ever endured on a 9 hour flight.

However the seats were comfortable and leg room acceptable. The complimentary light meal coffee and juice were tasty and appreciated. The cabin crew's English was quite good - some of the crew were young and friendly while there were a couple of more experienced and more gruff senior crew who shouted orders. All PAs are given in Spanish first then English. It was very hard to understand the English notices as the English spoken was heavily accented. There are no personal TVs and on this three hour sector no movies were shown - just the route map on the main screens.

I was given a choice to either fly via Berlin and arrive late in the evening in Munich or wait for the 18:30 flight direct to Munich. I opted for the direct flight and then had the five and a half hour wait at the airport. The 18:30 flight was then one hour delayed as they had mechanical problems. So instead of arriving at the arrival time of 16:00 I arrived at 20:30 in Munich. This is the second time this has happened to me with Air Berlin in the last three months. The previous time I was flying to Milan and I had to spend the night in Dusseldorf as I missed the connecting flight. The ground staff in Munich were completely unhelpful and only the staff in Dusseldorf did an excellent job and were very helpful. I will certainly not fly AirBerlin again.

aeroflot-russian-airlines,/airline-reviews/aeroflot-russian-airlines,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Andy Williams,Spain,2011-07-31,Aeroflot are not a bad airline though I do feel that for the most part it's fleet and it's service offerings are several years behind those of the competition. I flew Barcelona - Moscow and was swayed by the price. The first leg was in a fairly new airbus A319 with comfortable seats and a clean interior. The only thing of note was the general demeanour of the crew who did nothing to make me feel welcome and were almost hostile in their dealing with the passengers. The pre-flight safety demonstration was multi-language and clear and I found most of the crew spoke English with no problem. In flight refreshments offered were a variety of fruit juices only. Alcoholic drinks are not available though after almost pleading I did get a diet coke. The meal was among the worst I have tasted in my many years of flying. The second leg Moscow-Shanghai was a real eye opener. The Aeroflot website shows that this flight is operated using one of its newer A330 aircraft with in seat entertainment but checking the entertainment listings I found that they been updated for 4 months. Not important of course but an indication of the haphazard approach to service. When I actually boarded I found that the flight is actually operated by (and has always been) by one of the airlines older Boeing 767 aircraft. Aeroflot Boeing 767's are much older than the rest of their fleet and come with little in the way of comfort or amenities. None of our seats or others around us would recline more than 2 or 3 cms. Walking up and down it was clear that no seats offered any noticeable ability to recline. They also had no adjustable headrests. All in all it was a very uncomfortable 11 hour flight. Added to the discomfort was the fact that there was no personal entertainment offered. The aircraft used the old system of large screens placed above the seats around every 10 rows. There were movies played - in Russian often with English subtitles however the quality of the screens and the placement made it an unpleasant experience. Once again the refreshments and food were very disappointing. The omelette breakfast was the only edible thing I had all other food was very poor. The staff on this second flight were more attentive than those previously. My return journey was merely a reverse of the outbound - equally as uncomfortable and equally poor food. The only significant difference was that I had coffee poured over me by one of the cabin crew who gave me a towel to dry my now soaking trousers but still failed to apologize or help in any other way and finally they lost my luggage and once located failed to get it to me for almost a week.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0

Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time).

Boeing 767 decent in terms of space. Although we managed to get the exit row so I can't really judge the legroom in the regular seats but ours were great. Width of seats also great. Although we couldn't put our personal item (purse) under the seat so that was kind of a pain. A319 seats are decently sized in terms of width but the pitch is below industry standard. I rode the entire overnight flight with my knees pressed firmly into the back of the seat in front of me. I am only 5' 7"". My boyfriend who is 5'10"" found the trip excrutiating. The seat only reclines 2"" so impossible to sleep. The onboard crews on both our Rouge flights to and from Vegas were excellent - friendly, helpful and pro-active. On the way back when trying to load this flight which was supposed to be done on a larger Boeing 767-300ER they anticipated the difficulty they would have with carry-on bags because there was significantly less room and dealt with it brilliantly. The check in folks in Toronto were terrible. Cranky and super unhelpful. We asked where to take our bags to check them and were dismissed with an ""over that way"". Well over that way was about a quarter mile down to the other end of the airport where there were no signs to guide us. We had to pay $25 for each checked bag which is ridiculous. If we had paid for a much more expensive seat we could have taken up to 2 bags free. Seriously you can't even take one suitcase for free because we're flying economy? There was no meal on the flight unless your were in Premium Rouge. We could purchase food onboard which was okay. There was a decent selection and the prices were reasonable. But again, seriously, not even a free snack on a 4 hour + flight? The planes had no in-flight entertainment except for streaming video to their app. This was okay but selection was terrible. All outdated movies and tv shows and not good classics.  I'm not sure what our fare paid for. We weren't paying for a comfortable seat, for space for our baggage, food or entertainment. It seems like we paid to be uncomfortable, annoyed and bored. Why is it that basic things like having enough leg room so your legs are smashed into the seat in front of you or having a snack on a long trip is only for luxury passengers?

Most of the cabin crew on board this flight were the best AC bunch I have had in a while, there was one that was very nasty to a passenger whose English could not be understood easily. Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty.

Overall experience was positive with genuinely helpful and kind cabin crew on all legs decent IFE selection and all flights arriving on time even after one was delayed so they could find a bigger plane to accommodate a previous cancellation! All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,J Taylor,United Kingdom,2014-08-18,LHR to Calgary: Check in at brand new T2 was a complete shambles - not sure if this is AC's problem or T2 teething troubles? Not enough staff around to deal with self check-in problems and only 2 check in desks available - the queue was long and slow! On board in Economy seat pitch and leg room was pretty good for 2 adults and 1 child. Everything else distinctly average. Return leg Vancouver to LHR Premium Economy: Self check in worked fine but bag drop slow and everyone in the same queue with not one AC rep on the airport floor in sight. Seats in Premium OK. Flight delayed for around an hour due to them being unable to get the door closed. Inflight service really poor - food was absolutely dire and meal of choice had run out even before we'd left the ground. Flight attendants completely lacking in attentiveness - no rubbish collection despite me having a nice tidy little bag full of bits which I deliberately left in sight. Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed. Not sure we'll be able to avoid using T2 again in the future but certainly we will not be choosing AC again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,1,1,2,NA,NA,2,0

Check-in very straightforward. Used the Maple Leaf lounge in Terminal 1 close to the E gates. Spacious comfortable lounge but no hot options for breakfast apart from a very sticky oatmeal porridge. Flight was on a B767 with a herring bone 1-1-1 configuration. It felt both spacious and private. The crew were engaging and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast omelette was rather nice. IFE of a good quality but using the headphones was fiddly because you had to put on the sponge ear covers yourself! Seats are lie flat and quite comfortable-managed a nap of a couple of hours. The serving of lunch was delayed by some turbulence over the Atlantic. The Captain was very reassuring especially as he asked the FAs to be seated as well for about 30 mins. Good choice of champagne and 2 whites and 3 reds.

Crew did not check safety measures appropriately: a passenger sitting next to me was using his mobile before take off and it took 3 crew members instructions before he finally switched it off - but they failed to tell him to put his bag in the overhead locker. The bag was on his lap disguising the fact that he was not wearing his seat belt. I asked him to put his seat belt on and his comment was ""relax"". Same thing happened on landing - they didn't check his seat belt. A friend who was seated in a bulkhead seat said a bag was in front of her on the floor during take off and landing. I had to completely unpack my case at check in because the scanner at check in had identified something (it was the plug of my travel kettle!). Check in staff were most unhelpful and officious.

This flight left on time (actually departing the gate a few minutes before the scheduled noon departure time) and we were in the air at 12:09 with no lengthy runaway or taxiing delays. Arrived a few minutes early in Tokyo. To me this flight is a notch above the standard AC product. They seem to be a little more attentive on their transpacific flights and the flights generally have a good on time performance.

FAs were wonderful - a senior crew - very welcoming helpful and chatty. Likewise the pilot was great fully informing and updating passengers of a slight delay due to a technical glitch and later alerting us to a great view of the southern tip of Greenland when we flew over it. After an equally long flight from Mumbai in the rather cramped seating on a Swiss A330 this flight was a spacious delight. Food was OK AVOD was good with a wide selection of movies music and TV shows. The FA selling duty free items undertook the extra effort to locate what I wanted to buy when he could not find it on the cart.

We got to the airport only to find the flight had been cancelled and new flight would be 2 hours late. Then three then four and here's where things went downhill. I was now not going to make my connection in Toronto back to Vancouver. I was advised by a lady who barely looked up that I was now booked on a red eye out of Toronto. I said I wouldn't fly an overnight flight and could I please book the first flight out in the morning. She said no at first but then came back and said I would have to fly coach - I said no as I had an executive ticket. She said it's an aeroplan booking and added if you had a paid for an Air Canada ticket she may have been able to help me. Flew to YYZ - went right to Air Canada relations. They listened and gave a sincere apology for my treatment in Nassau. They ask me when I wanted to leave and although they were unable to give me complimentary hotel stay in they did offer to get me a special rate.

It is cheap and that explains everything bad service bad food old planes and non existent IFE. There was no inflight entertainment between PEK and DEL. Soon after the meal they shove a wrapped sandwich in your hand as a snack for later on. Air China did it to us twice and it is a common practice as we found out from other people that they cancel or delay a flight and pile up passengers in one plane. The result is chaos in PEK. I fly frequently and my experience was the worst. First time I flew with them because of price and second time because I had to book a seat very late and could not find another airline.

Captain spoke excellent English and FA announcements were clear English. Requests to FAs were mostly understood. Service when the call button was pressed was very prompt. Meals were fine. Presentation was a bit naff but food OK. The seat was good the design made me think of J in Lufthansa. I worked the whole trip so didn't try it as a bed. Access to the power point and headphone socket was fiddly under an armrest. The overhead light was not accurately aimed at the table. Amenity pack was OK. Mostly working so not much time for AVOD. Video feed quality was excellent. Headphones not noise cancelling but adequate. LHR-PEK - Departed on time. Good quality pyjamas provided and the bed comfortable. Blanket a bit on the small size. Meal service was fine. Choice of movies was OK. Headphones were very good with noise cancellation. PEK-MEL - First time trying PEK as a transit. Not good. Arrived in T3. After walking about a kilometre reached the transit desk. Half an hour later I was through. Had to take the train then finally get to the domestic lounge. Was called to the gate but stood for 45 minutes waiting for the bus to the plane. Plane to Melbourne was via Pudong. Lunch was OK then arrived at PVG. A man with a flag rounded up all the MEL pax and herded us to the baggage claim area then to immigration. Bit of a queue there. So after about a 750m walk arrived back at the same gate same plane. All in all I came away with perception of 4 star service for the air portion. 2 stars for the transit service at PEK maybe 2.5 stars for transit at PVG.

On this A319 flight I used Altitude upgrades to Premium Rouge which is 6 across with middle seats blocked. Unfortunately I was assigned 1A which has 2 problems: (1) It is a bulkhead seat with less than 20 inches of room between the seat legs and the bulkhead and (2) front row means tray tables stowed in the armrest so even though the middle seat was blocked I was confined tightly into the seat. Onboard service was pleasant with the new crews and the meal that was offered with a menu and choice of entrees was good standard Air Canada domestic J quality. Unfortunately due to the reduced personal space and legroom I will continue to make a point of avoiding Rouge where I am able to select another carrier.

Cabin was a little tired but was still in reasonable condition. The seat cushions were a little firm but the space and width were reasonable. I was worried that the full recline/flat bed was not actually going to be flat but it was and was very comfortable for a sleep. Supplied also with pyjamas and quilt for a snooze. Staff very attentive and there was no need to request drinks or top- ups as these were forthcoming throughout the flight. The Chinese meal was good but a little tasteless. A bit more variety and freshness may have improved it a bit. The AVOD completely froze for my seat and was never rectified throughout. However glancing at the programmes and films on offer I did not miss much as it was very dated. Punctuality excellent. Beijing T3 is not the easiest to change flights within and there is no channels for business class to speed up the process.

Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline.

Other announcements were made but they were so quiet that I could not hear what was said. After 1 hour the food came out while we were still waiting on the ground. The total delay was around 2 hours and 15 minutes before we finally departed.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,Em Vittorio,Canada,2013-09-08,I flew YYZ-WAW with a stop in FRA. The YYZ-FRA portion was operated by an AC 777-300 aircraft. This was on July 23 2013. I was happy with the service I received. I did on-line check-in and printed my boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport. To print my baggage tags I went to the check-in kiosk but the kiosk unfortunately did not want to print out all my tags meaning I could not go to the quick express bag-drop queue. This wasn't really a problem though because as a Star Alliance Gold customer I can use the quick Executive Class check-in queue to drop off my baggage. Check-in agent Heather was very nice and friendly! She actually gave me individual attention to the fact that my baggage should be labelled as fragile. I then went past security and with a friend I went to the Maple Leaf / Star Alliance Gold lounge. Lounge had a calming and not too busy atmosphere very pleasant and recommended! The flight itself was great! Cabin crew were attentive (although not the very friendliest AC cabin crew I have encountered but still very good) and the in-flight entertainment options were actually I think the best part of the flight. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal came quickly and in general it was a good flight!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,S Paice,United Kingdom,2013-09-04,LHR-Toronto-LHR. Day flight from Heathrow wasn't too bad. Check-in painless lounge ok although the time from 'go to gate' to 'closing' in departures is ridiculously short. Inflight meal was ok - child's meal was well received adult's meal perfectly ok and served promptly with additional drinks available on request. Only downside was the bassinet wasn't available. IFE ok when it worked although it needed re-booted at least 3 times. Return flight. Check in at Toronto an utter shambles check in online but to get to bag drop you need to print out all your bag tags. This would be fine but their system can't cope with a booking including an infant. Thankfully the desk agent took pity on us and printed them out. Toronto lounge pleasant. Inflight pretty terrible. AC seem to persist with ancient aircraft without winglets so turbulence is amplified meaning the seat belt light on most of the trip. No food service during 'turbulence' so meal service took hours and the lights were left on so neither of the children (or us) slept at all. Asked for lights to be dimmed and 'we can't dim them' was the reply. Didn't get a drink before food due to the apparent turbulence cutting short the drink run and the never came back until 'breakfast'. At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. 'Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling. AC would have been better with a light snack for dinner (given we took off at 10pm) and a decent breakfast. Some of the staff were quite friendly and chatty but it couldn't describe a truly miserable flight. I could only really describe it as 'United in disguise' expected far better from AC.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,A Pedersen,Canada,2014-06-04,Booked a trip to Vegas and thought we were flying with Air Canada until we got our itinerary that said Air Rouge. The airplane itself was run down and dirty. The seats were uncomfortable but thankfully we paid for the exit rows so we had more leg room. The overhead bins are small and you likely won't get 2 roller cases in the bins. We sat in Row 27 A and C on flight 1851 to Vegas and my boyfriend froze the left side of his body on the flight down. The crew seem very disorganized and no one seems to really know what is going on. There would be an announcement in French only and as an Anglophone I have no idea what they were saying so here's hoping it wasn't overly important. During the flight we had some turbulence and the seat belt sign was on but people continued to use the washrooms and the crew allowed them to do so. Don't think they actually have inflight entertainment as this isn't the case. We downloaded the app onto our Ipad and truthfully it was a waste of time. Their idea of inflight entertainment is to allow you to watch 10 mins of a show and then it crashes forcing you to have to log back on and try and find where you were in the show. This happened to us several times and finally we gave up because a 44 min show would have taken us well over an hour to watch and it was frustrating to have to keep logging back in. One gentleman on our flight even returned his $10 Ipad he borrowed as it's a waste of money when the entertainment doesn't work. We have decided that if we can't fly with Air Canada not Rouge then we will book with another airline regardless of price because this was horrible.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,1,2,1,NA,NA,2,0
air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,J Taylor,Canada,2014-05-12,"Earlier this year I bought a flight pass (an 8 flt SunPass to be used from YYC-LAS) all the flight were AC. My first return booking with my flight pass my trip there is AC with all the regular amenities - and leg room. My trip back however was on Rouge and all further flights on the pass look to be Rouge as well. I am tall 6'2"" and I actually ""upgraded"" to Rouge Premier which is their version of Business Class. My knees still touched the seat in front of me and the seats were no wider. Still 3x3 in ""Business Class"" upfront so if you pay for an upgrade (I used points) be very careful as you can still get a middle seat. Still the same as the back no power no entertainment. but they do offer an iPad with the App pre-loaded which still makes me shake my head. No real place to put it with the exception that it came with a cover and you could sort of hang it from the seat back in front of you where in other airlines the entertainment was supposed to go. Two problems with this. 1) the earphone cable has to stretch over the tray and if you're using that for a drink or food the risk of knocking something off of that with the earphone cable rises sharply and of more concern 2) if the plane hits some unexpected turbulence all of a sudden you've got iPads flying everywhere - at least far more than you would on an AC flt. All this aside I still felt like I've paid for an 8 pass with an AC and got a 'bait and switch' to Rouge with no options. Some of us have to travel (it's not for vacation) and when we do and have paid for and expected a certain level of service (which I felt was fair and competitive with AC) and suddenly you are still paying the same price but the level of service comfort and even safety has dropped dramatically I can't feel but that I got bait and switched.",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,1,1,4,3,2,NA,NA,1,0

Plane took off about 2 hours late from JFK but arrived on time with the benefit of a strong tailwind. No explanation for delay provided but once on the ground in Madrid the cabin attendant gave the typical insincere apology for ""any inconvenience."" The next leg to Venice on time - the only flight segment that was timely. The return to Madrid left Venice about 1.5 hours late and arrived Madrid late by same amount. Madrid to JFK pushed back more than 2 hours late and then immediately halted for a half hour more while mechanics were called on board to fix the air conditioning. We deplaned at JFK 3 hrs late. Again the cabin attendant gave a rote ""apology"" but no explanation for the delay. Air Europa has no info on its rather primitive web site to inform whether flights are on time or delayed. Delays aside the cabin staff were polite animated and professional except that curiously no one claimed to know anything about the cause of the various delays encountered. This is a Spanish airline and most of the passengers seemed to be Hispanic. Important announcements were given in both Spanish and English but the message was often delivered in heavily accented English. The pilots said little particularly avoiding any discussion of delays. I suspect delays are too sensitive a subject for AE to discuss in a forthright fashion. Check the airline's on time record before buying tickets as I wish I had. Avoid this airline if making onward connections is a critical concern. Passenger comfort in Economy was at the lower end of tolerable. I don't travel enough to make a comparison with other airlines but I'd venture that few airlines afford the economy passenger less seating room than Air Europa if indeed that were even possible. For a relatively new A330-200 the seats didn't return to the upright position without some assistance. Stowed baggage was routed through to the end destinations and arrived without problem. Be careful though at the JFK we were charge $50 for an overweight bag. Next time I'll use something more accurate than the bathroom scale. Food and beverage service were OK. One observation: as the low price leader it's surprising AE has not sought to leverage this advantage by more zealous attention to managing flight delays. If so I would have given higher marks for value. For example they might start by acknowledging a problem exists and that saying nothing won't make it go away.

At JFK terminal 1 already looks old and decrepit compared to other new terminals. The AF lounge was closed due to renovation and we used JL lounge which was pretty disappointing. On board service was decent but agree with comments that for a country which prides itself on food AF food was disappointing. Seats were not the new ones but still decent and managed 3 hours of sleep. CDG-NCE and FRA-CDG was a total let down with just middle seat blocked ; no clue why European carriers do this yet seem to think this is a huge service- would be easier to have bigger seats like in US.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Suhail Shafi,United States,2014-10-22,New Delhi to Srinagar and back. While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there. Despite its financial difficulties their inflight product has improved markedly over the years and their Star Alliance membership and modern hub in Delhi makes them attractive to fly with both on short haul and long haul flights. My expectations were low but I was more than satisfied and I would consider flying with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,3,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

Check- in assisted by our 'minder' ensured that all luggage went through with no problems. Seating was better than some other aircrafts flown food - although only a snack was more than adequate for a short journey (and provided free). FA's were efficient and any reasonable needs were complied with. However the IFE consisted of the same propaganda film shown in the airport and must have been on an endless loop. The flight left earlier than my agenda showed although we got there in ample time I was not notified of any change.

IFE on A321 was not good but B787 had great collection of movies and music however most of earphones provided were broken (carry your own earphone).

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-05-26,NCL-CDG-BOG-CDG-NC.L Decent fare during Air France sale and added benefit of avoiding overnight stay in MAD or transit through PTY with KLM. A little apprehensive after reading a few past reviews. Air France treat you excellently in Affaires and it does feel a little like business class used to be - something special. Short hop from Newcastle on time - nice breakfast served and CityJet crew couldn't have been nicer. We'd been warned about transit at CDG with most saying that 90 mins 'wasn't nearly enough' to make the connection. Arrived and left out of 2E which is clean and modern with easy signage. The flight connections centre has lots of screens detailing the departure gate of your next flight. With Sky Priority everything we were through security in 3 minutes and in the lounge at 2E within 20 mins of landing (you don't need to clear passport control as UK is outside Shengen anyway). Lounge at CDG nice although slight absence of food but we weren't hungry as had just been fed. Boarding onto Airbus A340 with Sky Priority was pain free. Welcomed on board by charming and good- humoured crew. Despite the age of these aircraft the cabin looked and felt new. The seats were very comfortable and nearly full flat - just off 180 degrees horizontal. I'm 6ft and had no issues getting a great 4 hours sleep. Food-wise we were welcomed with champagne and juice. Shortly after our on-time take off menus were brought round. The amuse-bouche followed (more champagne) cold salmon starter choice for 4 mains cheese desserts and digestifs. A buffet was set up at the rear of the cabin and crew were on hand if you needed anything. There was an Express option of meals if you wanted it. The only minor gripe I had was that there are only 2 toilets in business class cabin. In Bogota bags off in 10 minutes. Return trip much the same - Air France uses the LAN lounge which was excellent. Crew couldn't have been better and inflight services were all excellent. The IFE doesn't have the range of Emirates but had enough recent films/TV to keep me going. I prefer the personalised service at AF over robotic EK crew. While I can get by in basic French (which was appreciated by staff) my travel partner was English speaking and was treated equally well. I'd recommend AF business to anyone for a long haul trip and CDG was a dream to transit through (although may be a different story in economy).,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

On return flight we experienced bad turbulence (worst we frequent fliers had ever experienced). At no point did the captain speak to the passengers to apologize explain or reassure and as it was night the FAs were nowhere to be seen. Furthermore 3 TVs for my family of 5 were not working and all the FAs did was repeatedly restart the system. We asked to change seats as plane was not full but had to organize with with other passengers to ensure our kids weren't sitting alone.

As always: You see the (always polite) crew the first 1.5 hour of the flight and then again the very last hour. Be it day or night flight. For the first time with AF I saw the cabin-crew serving water from bottles between meals. Hot meal is fine the so called breakfast a joke for us who do not rely entirely on sugar. I have now learned how to go from terminal 2F/E to 2G with the ""on-tarmac shuttle-bus"" and it makes the connection very fast and easy. Recommend AF? Only if price is low.

Cannot fault Air India in any way and loved the Bollywood films onboard the 787. However the transit arrangements at Delhi International Airport are a nightmare which easily bring the spirits down after a good flight.

All flights on time except last leg back to Heathrow that was compensated though by my bag being first off. Lounge quality was varied which I'll review separately. LHR-Delhi on B777 - very good seat for sleeping (slept probably 7 hours) though privacy lacking. Good choice of drink selection but food for business class very poor in both presentation and quality. No amenity kits on board for overnight flight. Entertainment on demand but western choice limited with only 3 recent films. Delhi-BKK. Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky). As noted before chicken or veg should not be the default option for business class and the quality of both was poor even for airline food. No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers. Entertainment system on the A321 from the 1990's - no on demand and a choice of 5 channels 1 English. Ended up watching an Indian cop movie. BKK-Delhi - more of the same but breakfast of better quality. Delhi - BKK - although late best of all the legs with attentive cabin crew calls answered on request for drinks a good quality meal this time. Still could see the cost cutting with the amenity kit in business class being a cheap pair of flight socks and eye mask. No explanation given either of 90 minute delay.

I have enjoyed Air France for several reasons the past few years on these long-hauls and this flight was no different. They are on time reliable and the food is good. Their premium economy seat and benefits suits my space requirements though as many have said the seat bottoms are very hard and there is no recline. If you're awake the entire flight no problem but don't think of sleeping. I upgraded for an extra fee on the return. The seat is much more comfortable and softer but it is not a flat bed and doesn't allow for sleep. The food was even more creative and delicious up in business but the mid-flight ""buffet"" is paltry. Flight attendants are usually very polite and efficient and I've never had a problem with language.

All-in-all a fairly reasonable flight experience for the price although we did suffer a quite long delay on the return flight due to technical issues with the aircraft that needed to be sorted out. The cabin attendants were friendly and responsive both ways however there was insufficient water provided during the return flight which in a warmer than usual cabin was disappointing. The food was only fair to be honest but the wine pretty reasonable. My main issue was the ground staff and boarding process at MRU. A lack of updates on the delay and a temporary breakdown of the boarding card readers slowed things down even further.

Our buggy ended up on the belt in Delhi while we were in transit. Took us 90 minutes and a lot of frustration to find someone who could take the thing off and hand it over to us. Because of delay and short connection time the transit through the DEL airport was awful. Crew just dropped us of at the security check in the transit area and left us there. So collecting the transit passengers made no sense at all. The plane (B777-300ER ) was worn out and looked very tired. Our seats were very hard and uncomfortable. Meals were tasty but portions limited. No bread served. Only after take off a round with drinks was served. Once they served the food the crew disappeared and never came around again.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,E Smith,Australia,2015-04-19,We travelled premium economy Melbourne to LA. It cost about double the economy return. The first leg (to Auckland) wasn't called premium economy although it was in the premium economy cabin and we paid for premium economy. It was called something like 'Works Plus' and you only got economy food. At Melbourne airport we were prevented from priority boarding because of this difference which seemed a bit pathetic. The great advantage of premium economy on Air NZ is that you get plenty of room and the seat in front can't recline into your space. The seats are not great there is no footrest and the seat doesn't flip up to support your feet. On the long flight you are given sort of foot-bean-bags which are quite handy but you aren't given those on the shorter leg. In fact on the first leg I had to be quite insistent to beg for a couple of ordinary cushions from a flight attendant who was very reluctant to hand them over! The seats are actually hard to operate which the staff are clearly aware of. A problem with the seats is that they all face slightly or considerably away from each other. Perhaps this is meant to be for privacy but personally I prefer to sit parallel to the person next to me even if I don't know him/her. It was frustrating not being able to talk properly to my husband on the flights. Another disadvantage of the configuration is that you can't comfortably lie down across both seats if the plane is empty (as it was on the way home from LA to Auckland-we would actually have been better in economy as everyone back there got a row each and could lie down properly! But of course you can't predict that). The food on the longer legs is nice but it seems very odd that they bring out the desserts with the starters and you have to sit and look and the dessert through your starter and main course. As the trays and tables are very small and a bit unstable this is actually a real pain. It is also difficult to get drinks served with your meal. They bring the drinks after the meals and personally I can't eat a meal without drinking something. In general the staff were pretty unhelpful. It was difficult to get a soft drink or orange juice at all times. I was also refused an inflight magazine when I asked. I was told they weren't produced and were 'online'. The safety video (Lord of the Rings-style) was incredibly annoying. So - lots of space but a not very good seat. Nice food but wobbly trays. Snarly staff in the main.

The food quality was at best average comparable to budget airlines servicing Europe. That said the selection of wines offered is very good.

I have flown NZ many times in long haul but this was my first trip in the new Spaceseats and I was pleasantly surprised. On the first leg I was in the front row seat 23A (window) and 30E (middle section aisle) and found the seats private comfortable and with a great deal of width that surpasses any other premium economy on the market (this is a 2-2-2 configuration where other airlines have 2-4-2 in this class). The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ).

Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable.

I found I didn't need them anyway as any chance of catching a few zzzz was impossible as they didn't turn down the cabin lighting until after 5 hours into the flight and then only for an hour. They only used one drinks and food trolley per aisle so it took forever to first get a drink and then be served a pretty awful meal as we were near the back of the aircraft. My friend sitting behind me was left with a choice of pasta or pasta. When she said she didn't like pasta they offered her macaroni cheese as an alternative! At the point where they could have turned the lighting down they didn't and then announced the duty free trolley was on its way.

By all counts it was excellent and would definitely use this class of service again! The seats were comfortable the service and meals were excellent too! On our return flight we flew on the 747 in premium economy - older style - seats 22 H/K. We enjoy the fact that these seats are on the upper level of the 747.

We questioned the staff at the counter about where it was and why it was taking so long. They informed us it was being drug screened. The rest of our flight had gone except those of us waiting for our strollers and golf clubs. So we had a bus of 60 ppl outside waiting to leave but couldn't because of us waiting. Two more flights came in after ours and people were leaving those flights and we were still waiting. After we finally got our items a couple with us got pulled into an extra screening and they were told there wasn't even a drug squad on. This info made me even more irate.

air-transat,/airline-reviews/air-transat,Air Transat customer review,S Williams,Canada,2013-10-22,I flew one way from London Gatwick to Toronto in October 2013. The reason for choosing Air Transat was simply cost - other airlines are not interested in selling one-way fares. Only Air Transat and Icelandair offer reasonable prices for one-way trips and only Air Transat is non-stop. Both Air Canada and British Airways wanted about $1900 from London Heathrow to Toronto whereas Air Transat (from Gatwick) was under $500. The check-in agent at Gatwick was rude but she was the only employee I could possibly say anything negative about and since all other staff went out of their way to be positive I will just ignore this one bad apple. The flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful as were the people at the gate. The flight left and arrived on time to the minute. Food was - well let's just say no worse than any other airline. I think the legroom was a bit better than some others. My luggage was on the carousel by the time I got through immigration. There truly is nothing to complain about. The particular plane that I was on did not have seat-back video but instead had the older style screens with their choice of movies. I brought a book to read so did not really even watch this. Really with all the negative experiences I have become accustomed to when flying I must say that this flight (my first flight with Air Transat) was a rare positive.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

airnorth,/airline-reviews/airnorth,Airnorth customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-07-15,I have to put in some severe criticism of Airnorth's customer service during the ash cloud disruption in June. My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway. However they really can't handle anything unusual and given their monopoly on many routes they probably won't bother to improve.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

air-transat,/airline-reviews/air-transat,Air Transat customer review,A Scott,United Kingdom,2013-10-02,Outbound flight Gatwick to Toronto was fine paid for extra leg room and the cabin configuration was the conventional 242 check in at Gatwick was in the bowels of the building and was tediously slow good in flight entertainment. Return flight was on their new 3x3x3 configuration which was like flying in a sardine tin. Did not get the extra leg room seats we had ordered and paid for the new configuration makes it impossible to get any sleep on night flights the aisles are so narrow that passing passengers stewards and trolleys bump into you all the time. This is the only overnight transatlantic flight I have ever taken where you need to buy or bring your own blanket! This is taking penny pinching to a whole new level. Food was edible but not a lot of it so if your planning to fly Transat take your own food with you avoid night flights and don't forget your own blanket shin and elbow guards!

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Rohit Thukral,United States,2013-10-25,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown.

More luggage choice of meals bottle of champagne bottle of wine with meals and all other snacks and drinks as required. Staff made sure your drinks were topped up and constantly making sure everything was alright. Return flight was an overnight flight and lights were dimmed for those passengers wanting to sleep. Passengers who were sleeping were not disturbed at meal times but were asked on waking if they now wanted to eat which I thought was exceptional of staff.

The check-in was smooth but the check-in counter at Melbourne was overcrowded and the queue ridiculously long. Check-in staff carried out her duty in a rather unfriendly manner and my assumption was because we opted for low cost carrier and hence be seen as substandard. Boarding was painfully slow but it was with other airlines as well. The aircraft was jam-packed and the cabin interior was lacklustre. My pre- order of Pak Nasser's Nasi Lemak was excellent perhaps the only great point about the entire journey. The 'hot seat' as it might sound had plenty of legroom but the seat was equally small and uncomfortable (not worth the AUD 45 at all). It was a relief that there was no delay throughout the journey.

New Sky interior slimline Recaro seats (a bit uncomfortable). On landing at Anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt (squeal on the brakes hard stop) then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around. ANC-SEA-MCI late flight out of ANC substituted a smaller plane which put us in a non-recline seat.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The aircraft on the YYZ-FCO leg was a refurbished A330-200 with personal entertainment systems and decent seat pitch. Flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and arrived on time. I rated a vegan meal (VGML) which was surprisingly good and nutritious and ample drinks were offered including wine. Staff spoke good English and were alright not the friendliest I've had but sufficient. The 3 hour flight from Rome to Tel Aviv was on an A319. Busses took us to the remotely parked aircraft and we departure about 30 minutes late. Nevertheless arrived on time. Food was served on this short flight which was surprising; cold appetizer but you definitely can't complain! Staff was actually friendlier on this short leg. The slim leather seats weren't very comfortable but alright for a short flight. Overall excellent value for the $800CAD round-trip.

The agents were friendly but they were completely oblivious to what a Schengen Visa meant. Anyway once on board everything was fine. Brand new A330 with comfortable seats. Recline and legroom was decent although it did feel very tight once the person in front of me reclined. Entertainment options was decent and they had some recent movies as part of their selection. My only complaint is that the screen was extremely unresponsive. Food was average ordered the Seafood Meal and it was delicious. The pre-arrival snack was a disappointment it was literally the same tuna salad served as the side during dinner but slapped between sliced bread. Crew was professional and efficient but were not warm or friendly. Only complaint in terms of service is the lack of beverage runs during the flight. They seem to be too worried resting in their crew rests area (at the back of the plane) and even turned off my service call without asking me if I needed anything. Appalling.

The planes are relatively new they leave and arrive on time staff are efficient and friendly and ensure that safety standards are met. There could however be more variety in the hot meals offered. Most importantly the airlines provides value for money and offers very good promotional deals. The one problem however is the inability to provide transit services at KL's LCCT airport.

The flights were on time aircraft very clean and well-maintained and service was very friendly and professional. I paid a small supplement for one of the 'hotseats' and it was well worth it. The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket.

Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours; that's absurd) and their MVP Gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers (they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied). Overall I have enjoyed them however and I will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a Seattle-to-Houston trip (there are no nonstop flights going to Houston on Sunday afternoons with Alaska or its partner airlines so I'll have to get there using Continental and come back on Alaska which is fine).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Drinks and snacks on the plane will cost extra, but you can bring your own snacks for free of course if you think ahead.

Just throw away your ticket since you can not make any changes, even for a fee online. We have waited on hold for hours trying to connect on the phone to a customer service agent only to be disconnected when their automated system tried to connect us to a representative. This happened multiple times. So if a Greyhound bus with wings with no service in the air on on the ground works for you, then Allegiant is your airline.

I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo.

We definitely ""unbundled by printing boarding passes at home and then at the hotel (savings: $60) and by packing light (4 carry-ons and 6 personal items (backpacks between us. We also flew with children over the age of 11 and chose not to board early (savings) and not to guarantee seats together. Another big savings even though Allegiant did book us all together on one flight and 3 and 3 on the way to Florida so it was not as if we were scattered all over the plane. We brought our own snacks on board (savings!) and we were able to go directly to the gate. The gate agents did not quibble about the size of the kids backpacks which were technically a bit over the size restrictions but we were processed right through happily. The stuffed toys they won in the theme parks their blankets and their food/snacks were allowed on with no problems. Our flight to Florida was right on time and the service was very friendly. We were even allowed to move seats to find window seats for the kids!! On the return we flew just a day after a massive snowstorm in the NE with multiple cancellations and yet our flight had only a 1 hour and 15 minute delay. During the delay I was astonished to see Allegiant set up a ""drink station"" with cups ice an ice scooper and free water and several kinds of sodas in the waiting area at Sanford/Orlando. Considering this was a weather related and very short delay we were amazed by that gesture. Yes you might be ""nickle and dimed"" but only if you feel you must purchase the 'extras' like leg room or extra bags or snacks or if you need someone to print out your boarding pass for you. If you want to have that service great! But for those of us who don't need that service and would rather spend our money at the theme parks on our children - Allegiant is a wonderful option.

Service onboard very professional with an excellent hot snack (omelette and salmon) for a duration of 2.5h. Transfer at Rome Fiumicino painless using fast track lane and the airport has lots of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia Giotto lounge was packed but the drinks selection was fine as well as the variety of sandwiches. Boarding A330 to Rio quick using Sky Priority lane. The aircraft had the new Magnifica Class with a 1-2-1 configuration. It was half full. Plenty of space in overhead lockers however if you seat in the middle there are none and have to use the ones on the side. Pre-taking off drinks given great selection of appetizers and the best moment was the food. Alitalia won best Airline Food recently and I was very much looking forward to it. Succulent Beef with Roasted Mediterranean vegetables as main course and for dessert a light unctuous Neapolitan Almond Cake. A 5 stars food and the espresso is served in a very beautiful cup and lid. The IFE had a good variety of recent movies but I thought the international selection was lacking. They have Flat beds (Only Skyteam airline in Europe to have these) and managed a good 7h sleep with a very comfortable duvet. The amenities given were a Bulgari bag with lots of toiletries products very much appreciated and high class. Staff very professional smiling and very happy to go for the extra mile for the customers. Breakfast consisted of a selection of Italian pastries and cakes with fresh fruits excellent! On the return leg Alitalia uses Air France/KLM lounge that can be cramped at times but it has great selection of hot snacks (the palm tree heart quiches are gorgeous). Boarding the A330 was painless again and the Magnifica class was full this time. Despite taking off 1h later we managed to catch up 30 minutes. The amenities given was another Bulgari bag and the best highlight was the food again with Pork Milanese as main course. Slept a good 7hours and had a copious breakfast before landing in Rome. The A321 to London was on time and service very good again. Overall a good value for money their new Magnifica class is an excellent product their Flat beds very comfortable and it's the Best Food I've ever had on an airline.

I went through security as usual and then proceeded to the gate written on the boarding pass. At the gate there were very few people there and I saw no Allegiant advertising. I asked someone who worked at the airport and she said yes you have the right gate. Since ever all flights were being delayed due to bad weather in the area I thought mine had been as well. About 10 minutes after the flight was to take off I saw one of the Allegiant employees who had been checking people in when I arrived. I asked if the flight had been delayed. She told me no I had missed my flight. I showed her my boarding pass with the hand written gate number on it.

american-eagle,/airline-reviews/american-eagle,American Eagle customer review,R Hansen,United States,2014-08-11,For the past two years I've been flying American Eagle several times a month between St. Louis and Washington DC (DCA) and the service has steadily declined in quality and reliability. At least half of the flights are late (some several hours) and a number have been cancelled (including several evening flights requiring an overnight stay at my expense). I've tolerated this mediocre service because of convenience (and a distaste for Southwest) but yesterday upon landing at DCA the new gate arrangement has pushed me to Southwest. Now instead of boarding/deplaning at a terminal gate the aircraft parks away from the terminal and passengers are transported to the terminal - a process that takes 20-30 minute (not to mention the hassle of standing outside the aircraft on the tarmac waiting for carry-on luggage). I have also heard flight attendants and gate agents confirm the poor operations of this carrier. Fly with American Eagle at your risk.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,4,4,0,0,NA,NA,1,0

Seats were once again comfortable although legroom was a bit tight but was not much of an issue since I had the entire row to myself. Recline was excellent although it was a little too much that when the person in front of me reclined there was very limited space. Flight attendants on this flight were once again very friendly and professional. Catering was excellent both quantity and quality. Return flight to JFK on a 777-300ER again. This time seated in Main Cabin Extra. Legroom and recline was great there were plenty of space to move around. Flight attendants and catering were once again excellent dinner was one of the best meals I had on a plane. Service on this flight was very attentive. So Kudos to AA!

American did agree to let us travel to Louisville (SDF) instead but had to rent a car with a hefty drop charge. Finally arrived in Lexington 3.5 hours later than planned.

We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare.

The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster.

Personalised check-in through separate lounge area at Narita and use of ANA's stylish Suite lounge go a long way in helping to relieve any pre-flight stress.

Where the service excels though is with the flight crew and the dining experience.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N Smith,United States,2014-08-06,My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products). The flight attendant was also quite attentive and spoke with us by name. We felt very well taken care of.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,9,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

For the first leg of this trip the plane was operated by IBEX and arrived on schedule. I have bad knees so I need assistance. It was offered each time. Plane to Frankfurt was a 777-300 and the flight attendant greeted me by my seat number: 24C. Service was excellent and the AVOD superb. Food was reasonable. For the changeover I had a courier who took me straight through passport control to the gate. Without this assistance I would not have made the connection. Flight to Amsterdam operated by Lufthansa and the difference was rather obvious. Nevertheless food and drink were served on the 50-minute flight. On the return trip the Lufthansa flight to Munich took off late and I was concerned about the connection. I was taken to the ANA plane by car and made the connection without difficulty. Departure delayed 2 hours however while the plane was de-iced and it was here that the superb ANA service was slightly lacking: given relatively little information. After takeoff the flight was good but again I was not told about the arrangements for assistance at Narita. 777-300 arrived well behind schedule and I missed the connection to Hiroshima. I was given a bus ticket to Haneda hotel accommodation next to Terminal 2 and had been booked on the first flight to Hiroshima the following day. I upgraded my ticket to Prestige Class on the 767 and had a pleasant Japanese breakfast. All in all the level of service was very good and I would recommend ANA as my preferred airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

No hassle printing out online boarding pass with aisle seat assigned for free no security hassles at under-utilized ABE airport flight smooth was actually due in 10 minutes early but in fact arrived on time. She was travelling with a personal item only so no extra fees to her rock bottom one way fare. I agree with prior reviewers that their fees do add up quickly so plan accordingly. Also keep in mind Allegiant flies from small airports which generally mean higher fares so at least you get the non stop service with them. Also bear in mind if you suffer a delay which is common with all airlines these days this could have been time wasted with 1-2 hours at a hub airport.

ANA C-class seats and AVOD are getting dated - pitch is much poorer than UA Cathay or Asiana. Cabin service was technically perfect but lacking sincerity. AVOD was spotty partner's AVOD did not work on the return flight. Indifferent attitude from the FAs.

There are many signs that Arkefly is simply not a proper airline but just a charter operator. It goes beyond the nickle and diming that other airlines do although Arkefly takes it to a new level. The fun started a day before flying: a text message that the plane would be departing two hours late. On with the seat assignments: you have to pay for those and in a strange move you can't check in online unless you paid for a seat. At the check-in counter they had to call operations for a half hour to get me a seat only for me to find out on the plane it didn't exist. The other thing I found is that the plane was quite old (no proper overhead luggage storage) and seats were cramped old and hard as a rock. Charter flight so lots of really loud crying kids. Up to you if you mind. I flew economy comfort leg room is pretty good. As others mention everything has to be paid for except one meal and drink. No complaints there I knew that was the case and I feel that prices were reasonable. By the way don't bother to pay for IFE the selection is pretty useless. Less palatable was the fact that we were significantly delayed due to two passengers being not being admitted to the US at Orlando (stopover en-route to Miami) who were promptly put back on the plane to fly to Miami and onward to Amsterdam.

The weather was a bit poor and they do say if there is bad weather the flights might get cancelled so as is was awful we were not to sure if the flight would go ahead. Twenty minutes from departure the clouds broke up and sun started to appear which was a relief but then the flight got cancelled we were taken out of departures and that was it. We were told that according to the metro logical forecast the weather was not good but had Aurigny ops looked out of there window it was sunny and as we were only having a twenty minute trip on the plane And I saw no problem weather wise. However the truth came out accidentally let slip by a member of staff that the plane was needed for the 15.20 Alderney service to depart late at 15.55 which is why the trip was cancelled where as our schedule should have been a 15.45 departure. We were not the only passengers that had travelled from mainland Uk just for this flight and felt let down by the airline after paying to fly to Guernsey for the short flight.

It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly.

If you are lucky to fly 767 or the new A330 in this route you will have a good service from Avianca but not in these smaller planes. AVOD has a decent choice and food service was OK (although I think that travellers would prefer a breakfast before arrival at 6am than a dinner at departure time on mid-night).

On return flights I noticed one transfer and security gate that was almost completely empty while another transfer and security gate a hundred metres away was jammed packed and virtually not moving. Asiana could do well to advise transit passengers of this problem and to seek ways of rectifying it if they wish Incheon to be considered a serious transit hub for them.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,5,2,NA,NA,5,1

austrian-airlines,/airline-reviews/austrian-airlines,Austrian Airlines customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2013-08-05,VIE-BKK-VIE in Business Class. New seats are a significant step up from the previous product. Had 3A on the way out and 7K back and the seats had excellent room lots of space for storage and comfortable for sleeping fully flat and relaxing. Topped off by the excellent food and beverage service with a trolley bringing out soup and 2 other starters 3 hot options and 2 desserts plus ice cream. A standard of food service you don't see on business class elsewhere. Only bettered by the coffee service with about 10 different coffee combinations on offer. The in flight entertainment screens are large and responsive with the only disappointment being the extremely small selection. I didn't mind as both flights left just before midnight so after dinner it was time for sleep. Service from the crew was excellent. Austria's only weak point in the past was the angled lie-flat seats now it has seats that are up there with the best.

Seating is same as economy with middle seat blanked out so could do with at least a bit more legroom. Main benefit is being in front of aircraft and having good quality catering. Service was very good outbound but inbound staff appeared to struggle with a larger business class section (seemed to be about 9-10 rows in business). Food in both cases quite good but unlike previous occasions no choices regarding options you take what is offered or nothing. The inbound trip saw the meals distributed and it taking around 20 minutes before drinks appeared which meant either eating without drinks or letting the hot snack go cold. Finally there was a 45 minute delay in delivering the baggage at LHR apparently due to an aircraft technical failure.

Wasn't the best experience cooped up inside the plane under a 2pm tropical sun while waiting for the plane to take flight. A bottle of water was served for the short journey and there were 2 stewardesses. Service while courteous was bland.

Travelling with an infant on this route is difficult but Asiana made it much easier with attentive service good food for the baby bassinets and good food for us. IFE excellent with programming on demand. First time going to TAS that we did not have to use a bus to get to the terminal. We had to gate check our stroller but at the Tashkent airport you need to pick it up at the baggage claim so we had to carry our baby until then which if you are familiar with the speed (or lack thereof) of the customs officials at TAS you know that it is not a small feat. The return was nice in business but even though we gate checked the stroller at TAS and told them we needed it at ICN they sent it through to the baggage claim. Luckily the ICN staff were wonderful and retrieved it for us quickly. Return was in the new Quadra business lie-flat seats which were comfortable for us but I can see how they might be too narrow for people with a larger build. Also strangely enough the business class bassinets are more narrow compared to the economy class ones. Nice amenity kit with L'Occitane products excellent food and service.

This was the most shambolic boarding I have witnessed. There were no announcements about cause for the delay no apology and 45 mins later we boarded the plane via shuttle bus.

Baneasa airport is terrible has to be one of the worst in the world badly organized Staff unfriendly rude and unhelpful throughout. Only 2 checkin counters for about 5 flights leaving around the same time terminal is tiny and was fully packed. To make matters even worse they have a stupid policy where if you have baggage to checkin you need to pay a fee of I think 20 euro per piece but they cannot take the money at the checkin desk you need to shuffle through the fully packed terminal and then go and line up at another desk with even more people and pay for it separately then return to the checkin desk so they can check you have paid. The whole process took around 2 hours and we never moved more than a few metres the whole time. When we were finally bussed to the plane the staff were rude and someone I was travelling with has a fear of flying so they wanted us to be seated together but they would not allow it even though there was a spare seat at the back which I then moved to after the flight took off. One cabin crew member yelled very loudly at me because apparently my bag was too heavy but no one mentioned it in the terminal. Staff at the airport spoke little English. The plane was old and we really questioned the safety of it. Complimentary water served but then cabin crew at the back of the plane for the rest of the flight they even were not present to prepare the cabin for landing. On landing there were many people (Romanians) on mobile phones making phone calls etc none of the staff said anything. Mentioned it to staff after landing and they said they did not see it happen. I hope never to fly with them again and I urge anyone to have a think before choosing blue air or a flight that leaves from Baneasa but the whole thing is an experience in itself.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

On this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent I have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, I was served the first course. I did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and I was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed.

Boarding on B777 efficient and shown to 2 back facing seats, basically a double bed. Glass of champagne provided as we settled in. Take off a little strange as traveling backwards but when in cruise no problem at all. Several drinks services before and during meal service. Very relaxed and very professional crew. Food mackerel pate and steak quite good but not business class in its heyday which I was privileged to enjoy. The seat was strange. Very narrow and a lot of the time you are looking into a strangers face. BA has 8 across seating, more than any other business class operating the B777 in the World. Entertainment ok. Reasonable screen but hardly World Class. Things going fine until, 3 hours from touchdown they said that champagne was finished as they had to save enough for returning passengers. What about we passengers who had paid a lot of their own money to fly Club as a special treat. We persuaded a very nice first Class CA to raid first Class to provide a glass of champagne. After that we were on our own with the Club Kitchen. What a joke. Packets of crisps and a choice of red or white.  Very poor indeed for business Class. All in all an ok flight with a very good crew but signs of penny pinching throughout.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,D Lee,South Africa,2015-06-11,"This is more of a general review having travelled almost exclusively with BA longhaul as a family for the past 3-4 years. I highly rate BA for families. On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1) To be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants. They have offered quiet areas during service (on the A380) to help settle our baby. Left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) Friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. Crew are not servants to passengers. They have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but I find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak times. They are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. It figures. I am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach Silver tier on an annual basis. Having BC check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. The greatest perk is that as Silver I get 2 bags at 32kg each. Not only that but when I travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as I do and our infant gets 23kg bag. Plus car seats and pram free. That is a huge allowance and makes packing less stressful. BA are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, I have no issues with them and find them value for money. I could not care less what the food is like. I fly to be on time and get good connections. Heathrow T5 is great.",NA,FamilyLeisure,Economy,NA,8,3,5,5,5,NA,NA,4,1

Fortunate to be a silver member so get to allocate seats when booking. Flights on-time out, 1 hour delay on return, reason late inbound aircraft (really useless excuse). On departure no knowledge of which gates would be used for this and many other flights so both main lounges by security in T5 hellishly overcrowded. Assume the remote lounges would have been empty. 747 tired with ancient entertainment system but quiet upper deck, 777 the same except crowded and busy on the only deck - although both did have new first class so some upgrading had occurred, just not all of it. Crew however excellent throughout in both directions so well done, particularly return leg which had considerable number of young children making for demanding work. Food both directions actually quite decent, continual drinks service for first half of flight e/w then help yourself in galley. Good value as we gained big discounts when booking a holiday package. Had I paid full fare would have been very disappointed though, doesn't near match up to the main opposition these days - too many seats in an inconvenient layout. I do wonder if BA have given up going for the business traveller in premium classes on some long haul routes now (as they have for short haul club) and now see the higher spending families as their revenue source - maybe that's why we got the antiques to fly in.",Boeing 747 / 777,FamilyLeisure,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,5,2,NA,NA,5,1

Legroom was in coach was about 33-34 inches the most generous I've seen in recent memory. Food was good and reasonably plentiful and cabin staff passed through the aisles at least once every 30 minutes to refill water cups.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2015-05-31,Punta Cana - Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,2,2,3,NA,NA,3,0
brussels-airlines,/airline-reviews/brussels-airlines,Brussels Airlines customer review,J Taylor,United States,2014-08-26,"Party of two business class on an Avro RJ from Stockholm-Bromma to Brussels. Facilities at Bromma are quite desolate and overpriced though I don't suppose that's Brussels Airlines fault. However they probably have enough influence to put in some more chairs. Despite the fact that the terminal is essentially a re-purposed hangar it is in a great location and for that reason we were thankful that Brussels Airlines flew there instead of the more crowded and less convenient Arlanda Airport. Once we got on board we were somewhat surprised that the business class seats were identical in their physicality to those in the economy sections. However our fears that we had not gotten what we paid for were lifted once we discovered that the seats were quite comfortable and the legroom between the seat and the bulkhead (The Avro’s sole row of business class seats is the front-most row just behind the bulkhead) was more than adequate and the flight attendants were very attentive spoke decent English and served meals that were in their quality above the normality for short-haul flights. Hot washcloths were available at the beginning of the flight and later on upon request. No ""real"" IFE but newspapers in a variety of languages were given to the business class passengers as were various magazines some published by the airline some not. I read the New York Times and the Economist both of which were available in English. The airline also had a magazine in English French and German highlighting its various destinations.

brussels-airlines,/airline-reviews/brussels-airlines,Brussels Airlines customer review,P Alderson,United Kingdom,2014-08-13,BRU-CPH. Economy flex. Brussels airlines operates this route as a duopoly with SAS and it shows in the fares that are charged. My travel plans depended on the weather forecast in Denmark so I was only able to book 72 hours in advance. The cheaper of the two economy cabins had sold out on all 3 flights. The flexible ticket cost about 3 times the advertised minimum fare. Despite this I was charged 8 euros for paying with a credit card (none of my debit cards were accepted by the airline's web site). The ticket allowed fast track security although as this lane was merged into others there was no advantage. Extra cabin baggage was also allowed but as the ground staff did not enforce the cabin baggage policy this was again no advantage. The flight left 20 minutes late as the handling agent had not loaded the bags in time. The seat had no head rest and felt like it had almost no padding a bit like resting on a leather covered ironing board. There was no magazine in the seat pocket. The advertised free light meal/snack was a bread roll with two slices of cheese with terrible coffee served in a small paper cup. The stewardess even had the nerve to tell me to enjoy my meal as she handed me the bread roll. In my opinion this airline provides budget service at legacy carrier prices.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,2,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

As a BA Executive Club member I was able to use the Club bag drop where there was no queue. The Fast Track security staff were disorganised and patronising. The Gold/First lounge was busy and at times uncomfortably hot. Boarding from the C Gates was well organised. On taking my seat I was offered a water or orange juice. The 777-300 has the newish seats that were quite comfortable except for the headrest which does not have adjustable wings. The situation was helped by the fact that I had been able to select an emergency exit row aisle seat (22B). Departure was on time. Bar service was just before and with the meal. I had used the facility available on this route to pre-order my main course. Overall the meal was quite good. The Mixed Fleet staff commendably avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers of closing the window blinds after the meal service. The seat was a bit stiff in adjusting to a recline. The leg support cushions were useless as they did not move far enough to make contact with my legs. Time passed quickly as the entertainment system was very good. A reasonable snack of sandwiches and a scone was served about an hour before landing. We arrived a the gate slightly ahead of schedule.

My intention for this trip had been delayed for that time and needless to say I could not make it back as planned since I had to finish the business that took me there.

The crew are rightfully proud of their new aircraft and could not stop telling the passengers about its status. My seat was picked as 53K Upper Deck. I couldn't believe how cramped it was for this long journey. The divider partition was covered in red wine stains from a previous trip and staff seemed nonchalant about cleanliness. The available width of BA's offering is a big disappointment. Whilst those socially awkward individuals might enjoy the clandestine surroundings I for one do not favour the casket-feel of Club World. The A380 and 787 were a chance to hone the business class offering after much criticism. Execution of the flight was prompt and we pushed back on schedule. I fly a lot for work and am privileged to enjoy the premium cabins but poor attention to detail and very slow service don't inspire a return to a specific carrier. One alcoholic drink was offered just after take off and then the all too familiar menu was wheeled out. BA's menu for this flight was identical to a return LHR-MIA-LHR leg I took back in early December. Lacklustre choices and the infamous warm chicken breast salad. Maybe I was tired and didn't endear myself but it needs to be better. I recently flew the A380 with AF to LAX in Business and that was a role reversal! No limp and greasy bacon sandwich on AF either. LAX Teminal B a massive improvement over the years. From fast immigration to pleasant design it's the leader in aspiring all US airports to improve their standards and get rid of carpet underfoot!

The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour.

Also advised that we would have to pick up our luggage at JNB and check in again at JNB for MUB so we wasted time looking for luggage which was being transferred. We have never liked the premium economy seats on BA but connections in JNB made it necessary to travel BA. Seats have plenty of knee room and general space is good but are far to hard after a couple of hours my backside begins to suffer. Crew were good. As far as airline food goes it was reasonable. Return on BA56 on 29th Jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you.

The food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were very happy. The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine. The leg rest has gone too so I had nothing to stop me moving forward and the space between rows felt a lot reduced.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,3,5,5,1,NA,NA,4,1

BA have quite an ageing fleet now when compared to most European and Asian carriers and it really shows. The entertainment screen was absolutely tiny and the charging point is still that ridiculous adapter for which you have to pay an arm and a leg so pleased I found mine from 7 years back! BA must go and have a look at the AF premium product for a wake up call. The food was okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking not sure if its a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,S Morley,United States,2015-01-19,Washington (IAD) to Heathrow on Christmas Day returning January 5th. I find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA especially considering what they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it was Christmas Day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and I along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. The same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. Again the other airline lounges were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (I was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747. It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. BA seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the Asian carriers. The crew were very good - friendly and attentive. Breakfast before we landed was very average. The bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. Yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which I went for. Check in for the return journey was lamentable at Heathrow Terminal 5. Dedicated Club World positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. Not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending Avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,2,4,4,4,NA,NA,3,1

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Singh,United Kingdom,2015-01-11,Los Angeles - Heathrow - Los Angeles over the holidays. Club world is a perfectly fine business product. Staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. Food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. Portion sizes not huge but I don't need the calories anyway. Plenty of drinks offered. An unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if I was ok and if I would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. In terms of product this is not a million miles away from United business (both even have backwards-facing seats). However the BA cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. United's intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. Just like with the 747 the upstairs on the A380 has side storage which is useful. The upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). But downstairs is light and roomy. On return on Dec 29 I was delayed at the gate at Heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated. These company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in Club and behaved appallingly for 11 hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the A380 from every crew member that passed. They acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. Upshot?

I had been a huge fan of British Airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. I also was curious to see Heathrow's new Terminal 5. British Airway's overall product has improved in that time. On the first leg from Philadelphia to London I was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new Audio Video on Demand (AVOD) entertainment systems. I had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and I enjoyed their World music section in particular. The Asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. My only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. In addition I found the chapatis on the Delhi-London sector to be hard as rocks. Otherwise the meals were very good. Terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the London-Philadelphia sector when I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner. The plane is a marvel. The windows are huge dimmable by button too. The bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. Additionally the legroom on the Dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the B777. And finally a word about the cabin attendants. Their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of British hospitality - informal politeness.

I ran back up to get it and met the gate agent bringing it to me. When I arrived in RUT it turned out my bag got lost.

Early morning flight from T3 so breakfast in lounge. Usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). As is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. Plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. Had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. Managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. Plane had been refitted with the new layout. Beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in Club. Big disappointment. It feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. Not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. Friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. Coffee still poor however. No IFE apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. BUD airport a disaster. No time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. No aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. Very uncomfortable and unpleasant. On return the lounge BA shares at BUD is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. A short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. Priority boarding worked well. Same plane configuration on return. Excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. FAs free with the booze and nuts. Food was again a surprise - I had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. Very tasty.

The entire front row of the World Traveller Plus cabin are bulkhead seats and are also used as bassinets for babies so if children are travelling it is unlikely to obtain a seat in this row. The seat is definitely an improvement on its predecessor and I managed to get over 4 hours sleep due to the recline leg extension and footrest. The meal service has also improved and now has the Club World main course served together with wine in a glass and metal cutlery and a printed menu. There is also a hot towel service and drinks served before take off but in plastic cups and non-alcoholic. The service was very good but the cabin was not completely full and seats 25 passengers at maximum capacity. The entertainment system is excellent as it is the new Thales equipment.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Simon Brown,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,I have flown LHR-BKK many times with EVA Emirates Oman and Qatar. Unfortunately this time I chose my National carrier. Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating arrangement is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok there was a selection on the menu. However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful.

Having travelled this route several times with Singapore Airlines I was interested to see what BA had to offer. Bad move - in fact a monstrously expensive bad move. Unimaginative and largely tasteless meals - the so-called English breakfast looked like it was thrown together by some greasy spoon in downtown Singapore. Trays not cleared away for a very long period of time (ploy to keep passengers in their seats?) no offer of a second cup of coffee/tea disappearance of cabin staff for much of the flight once the meals had been got out of the way (odd since there were loads around during boarding) - so for vast swathes of time passengers were left to their own devices to obtain water - many went off into the darkness in search of refreshment. Peremptory and insincere attention from cabin staff when they did show up - one had the sense that they wanted to get any kind of interaction over with as rapidly as possible so they could disappear again. IFE not at all user-friendly - the touchscreen didn't like to be touched and the range of films/programmes was limited and tired. BA should use some of the money from their exorbitant fares to send someone on a Singapore Airlines flight to learn how this service should actually be operated.

Both flights were on time (more or less) and both were on new A320 aircraft - bright and airy interiors with plenty of storage space for luggage. The drink and small bag of nuts while welcome is nothing to get excited about and seems more of a gimmick these days to distance BA from its budget airline rivals.

Plenty of places to sit and relax; good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar. Priority boarding line worked well for business/status passengers. My main gripes are: old aircraft fairly surly crew and a consistent inability to monitor hand luggage (I saw several cases that were larger than the bag I checked in being forced into the overhead lockers). I was in seat 27A which as an exit row seat had plenty of leg room. Full bar service and a chicken tikka flatbread (and vegetarian equivalent) offered. Arrived at Terminal 5B.

The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as it's the Thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better.

First return trip was perfect - 10/10. Very comfortable business class seat and bed good food and attentive service. Only improvement could be to the choice of movies. First trip from ICN-LHR was particularly noteworthy as the first leg was 2.5 hours late due to a thunder storm in Seoul - flight landed in HKG 10 mins after CX255 was supposed to leave but Cathay held that flight which was very impressive and lucky. The ground staff were excellent. The ICN-LHR trip in May was not so fortunate. Due to ATC restrictions over China all flights to Europe were subject to creeping delays - i.e. 30 mins at a time. With the exception of our flight all flights boarded and eventually left - some were up to 4 hours delayed. For some reason CX255 was the only flight not called for boarding and eventually after 5am (4h30m after scheduled departure) the board stated it was est at 0900 the reason being the mandatory crew hours had been reached. I suspect the decision to hold our flight was more about aircraft rotation as that particular aircraft sits on the ground at LHR for 12 hours so effectively CX255 withstand a long delay without suffering a knock on impact to Cathay's schedule. Eventually the flight took off at 0945. Whilst I accept the delay itself was not under Cathay's control the decision to withhold CX255 was not communicated and all passengers were made to wait in the terminal through the night without any offer of accommodation.

Once on board I was shown to my seat and given an explanation about the seat functions. Service from the mature crew was excellent (there were only one other passenger in First). The food was OK but not particularly exciting. The main disappointment was the seat and amount of personal space with only enough room for shoes and a jacket in the wardrobe.

On the way down from St Lucia BA has an inexplicable outdated crew change. They are the ones from the previous days flight having a two day holiday in St Lucia. Check in at POS is usually unprofessional trini-style. BA shares a lounge which has a colonial style dress code so I had to nip to the loo to change from my shorts to trousers left on time for the 45min trip to St Lucia where the bulk of holidaymakers board back to LGW. I was positive as I heard the new POS-St Lucia cabin crew ask each other if they wanted a beer! They then landed in St Lucia and were busy saying goodbye to each other and the incoming new crew but not saying goodbye to the departing POS-St Lucia passengers! St Lucia-LGW with new crew. Girl came around with newspapers and I said 'FT' please which she had in her hand but she had no clue what the FT was! Did not dare ask for top up to the one glass of bubbly as it is clear as soon as the various jobs are done by various designated crew that's it.

In my humble opinion it just not worth flying premium class for a two hour trip. HK to London (CX255) quite disappointed compare to my excellent flight to HK The seats was a little worn and hard the cabin had a lot of scruff marks one hot towel before dinner and one hot towel before breakfast dinner was good breakfast wasn't. Hardly saw any cabin crew between dinner and breakfast. I really do feel they need to make the premium class a little bit special small touches such as proper cups for tea or coffee proper glass and not plastic cup for drinks armchair style seats perhaps in leather would be nicer the TV was awkward to raise (seat 30G) dinner tray was a tad too small charging point for mobile phone was awkward.

Flight departed on time with an older 777 with broken AC so everyone was roasting inside the plane not good in a very hot middle eastern summer told it would be better once airborne - had to endure twice due to stop over in Bahrain. Crew were fantastic though very welcoming the moment I stepped onboard compensated the lack of AC. Dinner was served and it was good nothing to write home about as was breakfast.

Flight to LAX again on an older 777 but new IFE with AVOD this time crew mixed bag male crew a bit rude. Food - lunch was ok like the dessert but small portions bring lots of food and 2 hours before arrival a sad sandwich and yoghurt was serve other carriers serve full meal as second meal or snack and around that time IFE crashed on half the plane nothing to do about it good thing it was almost arrival time pretty boring flight and full as well arrived on time and bags were out in 10 minutes that is if you can come out of immigration faster.

Check in at Cebu fast and efficient and onto HK in premium class never did like the lounge in Cebu lack of decent food.

OK Good point about premium class it is worth it if you can book in advance as the prices are much more reasonable excellent cabin crews quieter cabin and great food on long haul flights.

Left slightly late due to congestion. Nice breakfast with individual bottles of Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. Bags delivered quickly.

One recommendation is try to avoid flying during the Chinese New Year which is very busy we flew January 19th and return flight was Feb. 4th and both flights were full. Our return flight was on a Tuesday (from Sydney to Hong Kong) and was absolutely chaotic and full. I found the Flight Attendants to be very helpful and extremely nice (compared to US Carriers). Our 2 yo daughter was screaming/crying and they were very attentive. Tried to upgrade to Economy Plus but not available. Economy is not going to be comfortable on any airline you choose (9 hr flight from Hong Kong to Sydney). Plan on little to no sleep on if in Economy with the seating. Most flights are red eyes to and from Hong Kong and Sydney. Food was ok and they do feed you no matter the time. We were annoyed as we flew back from Sydney as they fed us at 11pm we were hoping they would darken the cabin to help our daughter sleep no such luck. Inflight entertainment system was great.

Cathay has rolled out a new ""regional business class"" seat that has partially addressed the upgrade but has totally ignored passenger comfort in the seat. First the seat is hard. On a short sector Manila/Hong Kong I found the seat uncomfortably hard and actually found my back aching. How can they have padded the seat so sparsely? Secondly the seat does offer some recline and an opportunity to snooze although not quite enough especially if one is tall. I'm short 5'8"" and my feet were bumping the apparatus in front of me that housed the next seats. Truly 2"" more of leg room would have been very good and one wonders why Cathay made the pitch so tight. Thirdly the seat has no foot rest - a true failing. How did this happen? In all Cathay's service is good and attentive but the seat in the new regional business class needs a respectable amount of padding 2"" more pitch and a place to rest one's feet when reclined!",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,1,5,2,5,NA,NA,5,1

Flew on the last 747 service from London to Hong Kong on 31st December 2013. We were all given a lovely commemorative postcard set at the gate. As we taxied a firetruck water canon salute was in operation although the fact that it was pouring with rain rather spoiled the effect! Seats were reasonably comfortable and although I know others find these older style 'sliding' recline Cathay Pacific seats not so comfortable at least you don't get problems with the person in front if you reclining their seat all the way back. Food was nothing special neither was the movie selection and crew not the most attentive I was expecting Cathay Pacific in-flight service to be up there with the other major Asian airlines and so was a little disappointed. Return flight Hong Kong to Heathrow was on a 777. It may be my 'shape' but I just could not get comfortable in these seats (economy class) and unlike the old style 747 seats the new 777 seats recline by tilting and so inevitably the person in front of me decided to recline fully for the entire flight. This combined with the uncomfortable seat (no lumbar support and either very low armrests or high seat cushion - I couldn't work out which) made it one of the most unpleasant long haul flights I have taken in recent years. Cabin crew not friendly (aside from one female cabin attendant who seemed to be doing more work than all her colleagues and who was genuinely personable and friendly) and as on the outward leg cabin crew not especially attentive. Very relieved to land at LHR and get off this flight. Disappointed with Cathay Pacific given their generally very positive reputation.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,0

Arrived at Heathrow a tad early and was checking in first class as there was nobody at business check in. The man behind the check-in was a delight. I proceed to the lounge and staff made a fuss of me. The check in staff member came over and said he would escort me to the plane and allow me to board my seat first. Flight delayed 40 minutes but the cabin crew had served champagne and after take off dinner was served. I only watched one film as I was managed to sleep for 7 hours. Breakfast was great. Connecting flight to Cebu on an A340 and it was interesting to be seated in the old style funeral type business seat I can see why most hated it but I am not bothered as it was only a 2.5 hour flight. On arrival a Cathay Pacific staff member was waiting for me and quickly escorted me to immigration - from the moment I got off the plane through to immigration luggage and customs it took 6 minutes. My return trip this year after spending Christmas and New Year was on a much newer business class seats and such an improvement. Tried out the new Bridge lounge the staff are a delight again.

Cathay staff all over the place and did not direct passengers to correct queues especially after call to gate was issued late. Design of Hong Kong Airport doesn't help as queue snaked all the way to the next gate (and thankfully that gate was not open otherwise it would have been a complete mess). Flight departed 20 minutes late. I think Cathay's on ground service at their hub can be so much better if there's better co-ordination between Cathay and HKIA. Anyway once on board the service was much better. Attentive cabin crew served drinks promptly after takeoff and decent early dinner was served one hour into the flight.

Service was excellent all round - champagne and juices before take off and supper service was prompt. Aircraft was an A330 with new regional product I believe. The seats were lovely just what you need when your flight departs at 1am but alas could only take forty winks and not a proper night's rest especially during such a short flight.

Good usual Cathay service in Premium Economy I have found to be remarkably consistent over recent years (I tend to travel on Cathay to somewhere of other about once a month). Premium Economy is excellent if the smallish PE cabin is not full otherwise it can become rather claustrophobic. Cathay Pacific lounges are always first rate in my opinion - great for working or eating. Inflight food also seems to be improving. Only hassles I have is on very long sectors where I seem to have become the target of inconsiderate fellow passengers - getting kicked in the back every 20 minutes all the way from London to Hong Kong overnight is not much fun maybe a function of the seat pitch in PE.

Regular water runs through the cabin. Food was fine and there was plenty of it. Entertainment was varied with several full series of tv shows as well as a wide selection of movies which was welcomed on these long flights. There is also a usb socket for charging your phone etc. If you have an iPod you can plug that in however you'll need the correct plug shame it's not compatible with android etc. Air conditioning was cranked up on all legs so a jumper is definitely needed or you'll freeze!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

First of all got thoroughly duped on their website with their infamously tricky pricing process. When they say 'total price' they still have not added their 15-20% additional carrier fees which they disguise as taxes. After arriving at the airport I am informed the flight is delayed 30 minutes. Once arriving at the gate I am then informed they have changed the gate and that the flight is now 45 minutes delayed. When I arrive at the new gate they have extended the delay by 15 minutes and then a few minutes later they covertly increase it by 15 minutes. So we're an hour and 15 minutes late out of the gate and the captain comes on and blames the typhoon (which was only a T1 and no other flights were delayed that I could see). The aircraft is tired and the cabin crew look about the same. After 15 hours of a very uncharming and shameless money grabbing experience (advertisements everywhere - before every video you watch about 3 of them and about 5 reminders of the duty free items being offered) we arrive at YYZ with the pilots not having made up any time at all likely to save fuel.

The seats were bizarre they did not recline but the seat slid forward a little bit and the support for the bottom of your back is rock hard. Terrible pockets on the seat in front mean if you put anything more than a newspaper in there the seat pocket is touching your knees. Also as with all Cathay flights I've been on there was no personal air conditioning control. Food as always was terrible - 2 meals on a 12 hour flight both of which were not nice at all. Breakfast choice always seems to be an egg based dish or seafood congee. I'd rather just have cereal next time. The dinner is always a choice of an oversalted Asian dish a vegetarian pasta dish or something else unappetising. Having already flown the opposite route we luckily knew to take snacks on board so we didn't starve. With Qantas / Emirates I usually end up feeling almost overfed not with Cathay though where you feel like you're in prison. With 2 or 3 hours before landing when breakfast was about to be served my girlfriend noticed that a child on the seat in front had been sick which had trickled between the seats and gone all over her tracksuit pants which were on the floor in front. We tried to get the cabin crews assistance but they continually ignored us. We ended up just putting them in a bag and then throwing them away. Never again! I'd rather pay an extra $300 to fly Qantas / Emirates than fly with Cathay again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

A few days later I flew MNL-PPS - being the day after the Manila floods the terminal was in complete chaos and the flight was 2 hours late but not bad in the circumstances and again the flight itself was fine. Cebu Pacific fares can look like a good deal but beware of their change fees. Due to the floods I needed to rearrange my travels and change my return flight from PPS. It would have cost me 1977PHP to change my CEB ticket - I chose instead to pay 1837PHP to buy a whole new ticket on Philippine Airlines.

While the new reclining economy seats on its 777s are certainly appreciated service levels continue to be eroded. Online check-in did not open until 12 hours before the flight - I suspect because I was departing from MNL - which meant that there were hardly any seats available to select on the HKG-LHR flight. Food was generally bad and of course they ran out of options. Cathay now serves tap water which would be fine were it not that there was a very bleachy aftertaste in the water served on the flight to London. Cathay seems unable to serve cold drinks. Having recently flown long haul with Singapore Airlines I would say that there is a vast difference between these two airlines' economy offerings with Cathay much the worse.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,3,1,3,NA,NA,3,0

All flights on A330-300 aircraft (Brisbane flights had upgraded interiors). Have flown with CI previously but was impressed with the high standard of food on all trips. Drinks so-so with less variety of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages and cabin crew were reluctant to give the entire can of soft drink unless requested (and had to ask other colleagues for permission to do so). That being said service was great for the most part and most flights departed on time with minimal delay. As an end note I submitted positive feedback to the CI website and received a phone call from the Brisbane office within 2 days thanking me and asking if I had any further comments.

Couple this with the arrogant staff and it is not worth it. After my last trip I have decided that even if Cebu Pacific were free I would not use it. The last flight of my last trip was modified online and changed to a later time and I went through the payment process. When checking in I was told that no record existed and because I had missed my previous flight I would have to buy a new and much more expensive ticket.

The second flight was an hour delayed just boarding - no announcements were made for the reason of the delay. Once we boarded we waited another hour and a half on the plane. Again no announcements were made as to why we were waiting for at least the first hour and no crew were in sight we just sat there. Food was pretty mediocre and when offered a choice of chicken or seafood they then said there was no chicken and I had to wait. It took about 15 minutes for them to bring the food out after serving everyone else and when I asked for it after about ten minutes the crew member just laughed and said you will have to wait.

First Melbourne to Xian via Guangzhou, then Chongquin to Guilin, Guilin to Melbourne via Guangzhou. All flights were on time. I found them not quite as good as Cathay, but still adequate. The entertainment (personal) was quite limited for English but still had a variety of TV sit-coms/dramas and movies. Coming back a bonus was that even for domestic-international if you have more than 6 hours wait (we had 12 hours) they put you up in a hotel room for free including transfers even during the day. You go to international check in, find G17 which is opposite the G's for check in and they check your details and then escort you onto a bus for your transit hotel. Bonus. However the seats we had 51A, 51C coming back from Guangzhou to Melbourne, mine didn't recline and my husband had NO tray table. It was removed some time some how. We mentioned this to the flight attendant who said they would be willing to let him sit somewhere else to eat. Me, well too bad. Not the greatest help. So instead of the hassle he just balanced his meal on his lap. Not really acceptable. Shame as we would have rated this airline much higher if they had done the right thing by us and let us sit in seats that had all their bits working, like a table and a recline (it was an overnight flight).

china-southern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-southern-airlines,China Southern Airlines customer review,G Chin,Australia,2015-01-14,MEL-CAN-LHR. Flight was delayed by a total of almost five hours due to a faulty emergency exit light - not what you need with an original departure time of 11.30pm. This information was only forthcoming when you actually asked the ground staff who seemed reluctant to publicise a technical fault. The airline asked for volunteers to fly a day later (with accommodation and meals provided) and boarding commenced very soon after they had found approximately 20. Apparently the light problem meant a reduced number of passengers could be carried. The volunteers were essentially tricked as at the time it was far from clear that boarding was imminent. We then sat on the plane for two hours whilst the volunteers' bags were unloaded and spent the flight to CAN wondering whether the LHR leg would be held for us. After landing we were quickly ushered through the CAN terminal handed a 100 Yuan note each as compensation for the delay and soon on board the Boeing 787 to LHR. The 787 passengers appeared to have been waiting on board for about two hours. Food beverages and seat comfort were reasonable and the aircraft near-new with slightly below-average IFE. The standard of staff English is much lower than comparable airlines but on the whole they do their best in terms of customer service. Overall not a terrible experience for the price (a quarter to a third lower than the competition) and we were probably unlucky with the technical fault.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,3,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

As usual no recognition of your Gold status with Skyteam no priority boarding no nothing. All in all you get used to it by now that these things just do not work with Chinese airlines.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,J Huang,Australia,2013-01-29,Flew from Brisbane-Taipei-Wuhan and then Xi'an Xianyang-Taipei-Brisbane. Overall impression was highly favourable and an improvement on my previous experiences with CI. All flights were on A330-300 which is starting to look a little aged in economy class. Flights were on time or only slightly delayed and boarding was efficient. Meals were of a very high standard in economy and the mainly female cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I noticed that the fluency of English (though I understand Mandarin) has improved significantly. Inflight entertainment was personal AVOD but selection was not quite as large compared to Cathay or Qantas. Flight from TPE to BNE was on an A330 with upgraded economy cabin. The screens were larger and seat more comfortable so this was a nice improvement. Based on these flights I will fly with CI again and have no hesitation recommending.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1

This is by far the worst in terms of food and amenities. During service for first round of drinks and peanuts the staff did not provide napkins and no I wasn't skipped by accident. The food quality is terrible. What was served was worse than a $2 meal you can get in Shanghai. The rice was hard fish beef chicken all dried out. If you want soft drinks instead of a can you get about 2/3 of a small cup. Selection is extremely limited no ginger ale only 1 kind of beer. Only recommend if this is the cheapest flight you can find. You really get what you pay for in this case. The seats are probably the hardest ever for me on a plane. Only highlight is the inflight entertainment you do get a good selection of movies to choose from.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,3,1,4,NA,NA,3,0

Cannot complain about the food as I do not eat airline food. In general this airline is not too bad. Flights are 80% on time. Very limited English skills both on the ground and in the air. But what do you expect? Even pilots do not speak good English and a pilot announcement from the cockpit is unheard off.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,Brian Smith,Japan,2012-02-16,NRT-TPE-BKK return. Impressed with service and the level of English for most flight attendants. AVOD was good. Seats on A330-300s are fine but recline to a very uncomfortable slide rather than flat. Provided plenty of English magazines though newspapers were scarce. Lounge in BKK excellent with hot and cold dishes. Flight was 1 hr late leaving BKK but were given a meal voucher in the airport despite the fact food in the lounge was ample. Connecting in Taipei was easy as it's not a very large airport.

The plane was delayed 2 hours without explanation. They gave out very sweet drinks in the departure lounge after about an hour. I think that there have been delays pretty much every time that I've ever used this airline. Quite an old plane but it seemed to be in good condition.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,Tony Hall,Australia,2012-01-27,BNE-AKL Business Class Jan 2012. Boarding was well organized and the fight punctual. Food for lunch was good quality although there was no proper dessert. Problem was that the service felt very rushed even though it was a 3 hour flight. A particular problem I have encountered on all CI flights is that the crew seem unable to co-ordinate the service of wine with food and then to keep glasses topped up even in a small business class cabin. Twice I had to use the call button in order to get some wine. Although it was answered instantly this is no substitute for a proper drinks trolley service. Notwithstanding this the cabin crew were unfailingly friendly and helpful in their attitude.

They didn't give us any reason and not even try to find us the alternative route. Although we have the full refund we have to find another airlines in the last minute. Luckily we are able to get on another airlines but it cost us £600 extra due to last minute fare. We are so disgusted with China Airlines and we would not recommend China Airlines to anyone.

On the way back food was nothing to write home about. Even the Asian food choice. C-class flights to Koror in Palau on a 737-800 and back were a very pleasant experience with a small cabin and comfortable old-style business class seats which are okay for a 4hr flight. The flight-attendent addresses you personally with your name (or try to do so) serve you plenty of rounds of drinks (good Champagne the Geman Riesling was to much ""Spätlese"" to go with your main the Californian Chardonnay was a good choice) and make your stay onboard very enjoyable. The transfer in Taipei was swift and the luggage made it back to Vienna with even 1 hour transfer time. Impressed.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,Stuart Walker,Australia,2010-10-14,SYD to LHR via Taipei Business Class. China Airlines use the Qantas Business Lounge at SYD - good food choice of drinks and nice showers. China Airlines Business Class seat is comfortable for sitting but for sleeping it is way off the standard as the seats are not flat or even angled flat. The meals have deteriorated over the last few years. The wine selection is poor amenity kit is a waste of space - why do they bother. IFE is good films are not that up to date but there is a reasonable selection. Taipei Business lounge not great the T2 lounge better than T1 lounge. They use the Sky Team lounge at LHR which is very busy in the early evening but an hour or so before the 1000pm departure it is quiet pleasant. Really nice shower at LHR.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,A Dow,Thailand,2010-08-21,Taipei to Vancouver in Business Class. No alcoholic welcome drinks offered upon boarding only water and juice. They were quick to announce that since this was a late evening departure they would be serving only a light meal - but since it was only 11pm I felt this a bit of a cheap excuse since the flight is nearly 12 hours in duration. Even after take-off I had to ask for a drink as it became evident they weren't going to offer any before the light meal - of which there only two choices (one Asian and one sort-of Western) - wine was ok. As far as I could tell there was no service between meals - not even water trips - though they did hand out small bottles early on. Contrary to other suggestions here and elsewhere this route does not have angled beds in J/C Class - only the old z-style recliner seat. AVOD was pretty good - with a decent selection of both movies and music - didn't go back to Y section so not sure what was available there. Biz class seat was a bit cheaper than others flying the route - but to be honest I would have been much better of flying Cathay in Y class and saving the difference.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

China Airlines gives deep discounts for business travel and at these prices the product is marvellous value. Punctuality on flights was quite good. Staff were keen and attentive but found it difficult to coordinate service of bread and sometimes wine with the meals even though the cabin was small.

All flights take off and landed on time Check in at SYD and LAX are fantastic. I accessed Qantas Business lounge in Sydney and Korea Air First lounge in LAX. I have to say QF business lounge is away better than KE first lounge in LAX. Staff on board are very friendly and professional in general AVOD program are improved from my previous trip with CSA. Food and drinks are pretty good. PJ was distributed for CAN-LAX-CAN legs pretty good quality PJs as well. First suite with A380 is fantastic very private staff did great trip on LAX-CAN leg toilet cleaned every time after passengers used bed was made every time I left. Transit in Guangzhou is also significantly improved you don't have to go through security or immigration for international transfer at CAN. Airline stamp on your boarding pass and you can go straight to lounge or boarding gate.

AVOD with over 700 programs of films and games is more than enough. During the night flight crews came around regularly with water and soft drinks.

On our return, I was injured a day prior to our flight and we contacted Condor to reschedule our flight and to request a wheel chair and was refused due to their rules for needing at least 7 days notice for any request changes. Flying business class and not having any customer service was astonishing. We had to contact the airport to arrange our own services.

I'm 6ft 3ins tall and on the Heathrow to Guangzhou leg my knees were up against the seat in front even before the person in front reclined his seat. Anyone over about 5ft 10 needs to ask for seats in rows 41-37 these seats have the same leg room as premium economy without the inflated price. Not much choice for English films and they didn't change on the way back despite the inflight magazine saying that they had. I agree with other people that the staff's level of English is poor this needs to be addressed if they are seeking to get a bigger share of the European market.

The girl on the desk said ""It's always like this""! Why don't they do something about it? Once on board we realised why - it was a bun fight for overhead locker space.

There was no information stating this in-between. I then legged it to the departure gate and proceeded to stand on a shuttle bus for a further 20 mins whilst there was a delay in fuelling the plane.

Given that it was 30+ degrees outside this seemed a bit ridiculous. I mentioned it to one of the crew and was given a blanket promptly. One of our party was told in Port of Spain that 'due to a computer issue in Panama' one of our travel party - who had been unable to check in online - would have to have a standby boarding pass for the connection to Lima but that she would definitely be able to travel on the flight. This was not true. In actual fact the flight was massively oversold and the airline had suspended check in that morning.

delta-air-lines,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,E Berman,United States,2015-03-09,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort.

delta-air-lines,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Brian Smith,Japan,2015-02-18,NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall. Hard to come down from business class with a lie-flat seat and good food.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

Bag drop at Copenhagen T2 was fast, and our carry-on bags inspected for number and size. easyJet use the low-cost terminal F at Copenhagen airport, which is pretty sparten but well lit and clean. Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight –  wonderful. BRS to CPH. Bag drop opened 3 hours before the flight time which is a boon. The inbound aircraft was slightly late, and therefore we could witness the arrival passengers struggle across the tarmac against heavy rain in their scanty holiday clothes. Luckily we had our travel umbrellas as, in addition, we were held up on the aircraft steps for a minute or two. Again, a cheerful crew who dealt with their cabin duties in a professonal manner.

The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run.

Checked in and printed my boarded passes at home so just had to drop my suitcase at Birmingham which took around 5 minutes. I like that Easyjet now allocate your seats although they still call the flight very early presumably to ensure everyone is at the gate ready for boarding. Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1

Probably the most uncomfortable easyjet flight we've ever had (A319). Had seats 20 E & F which were extremely cramped.

Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,8,5,3,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche.

The aircraft is an old 747 but renovated a few years back with the lie flat seats and if you're in the upper deck very nice indeed. It's quiet two toilets for less than 20 passengers and two flight attendants. The entertainment selection is excellent. My vegetarian meal was OK nothing special but not bad. It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,K Fraser,New Zealand,2014-08-03,LGW to INV. 1) 'Bag drop' and online check in a complete joke when you still have to join a mammoth snake like queue and basically 'check in' anyway! What's the point? 2) Those passengers who do pay extra to check in their hold baggage are only discriminated once on board. The new cabin baggage policy means most passengers take trolley bags on - fair enough. However those who don't and have a small bag or daypack are expected to forfeit their leg room so trolley bags go in the stowage bins. 3) Nice new clean aircraft attentive crew. Pity the magazines were stained torn pages missing and out of date. Basic service. If you can't be bothered replacing them please don't have them in the seat pocket. I gave up looking for the 'menu' because the magazines were filthy. 4) Sorry bring back full service airlines.

By booking early we got a very good deal for return flights to Corfu: in fact we would not have chosen Corfu but for the good flight prices. The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg. I hope these uncomfortable seats do not become standard in the future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,4,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

The cabin crew were rude unapproachable non-existent and rude. They quietly moaned about the passengers within earshot and acted as if cabin baggage was an inconvenience (even for their frequent fliers - including us). As there was insufficient room in the overhead bins for others hand baggage they pushed them in front of the empty seats behind us; as this caused discomfort to myself I made the crew aware and they repositioned it.

If it were not for easyJet we would not be able to afford so many foreign trips. Moreover we have always found easyJet staff efficient friendly and helpful. Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through ""manually"" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue. The introduction of allocated seating seems to have made the whole boarding process more relaxed though it does mean that you can no longer vet the passengers in your immediate vicinity before sitting down: on one of our flights we had to suffer seat kicking children behind us with parents who took no notice.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

The leg room was also good having said that I am 5'6 but my knees were not banging against the seat in front.

At LGW Easyjet has a sort of add-on terminal which is at least 400 yards along endless corridors from the exit into the main terminal.

Hard product is great, excellent legroom, seats had decent recline and cabin was in good condition. IFE is top of the industry and is the best. Not only do they have a plethora of TV series but they have entire seasons. My biggest gripe about Emirates is the inconsistent service. Some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. Service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. They had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. For example, during the breakfast service, a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. Trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when I tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart, I was met with a shrugged look. Catering was a disappointment and options easily ran out and were unimaginative, not what it used to be. DXB is also a mess and would try at all cost to avoid.

After waiting some time we along with two other people were told the lift had come and gone. The crew told us it had been recalled and would arrive shortly. It turned up about an hour later. It then went to another flight before depositing us at the terminal some ž hours after arrival. At this point we should have been met by our tour representative who would have our visas. We found out the visas had been purchased for all our group of 39 but could not find the representative. After some time we purchased new visas and the wheelchair attendant set off at high speed for the plane which had been considerably delayed.

The system was rebooted 3-4 times from the shoe holder from the rack alongside the seat from the control area of the aircraft and separately by another to physically try and push it down each one extending for up to 15 minutes and me forced out of the seat for the majority of this period and this went on for about 3.5 hours of the 7 hour flight. Until then I was not moved to any other seat with the rebooting I couldn't use the entertainment options for a couple of hours as well. After the Chief Purser heard about this she immediately took action and moved me to another seat. I was for approximately 2.5 hours of the flight moved to seat 4K on the flight thereafter. The electronic console handset which is connected to the seat did not power on and didn't work. There was water clogging in the shower in the bathroom on the right side of the aircraft. I had a vegetarian oriental meal requested and instead it was an Asian Vegetarian Meal that got loaded. Once again we are now in the 21st century and still Emirates Business Class does not have a single (out of four) main course meal options in the menu which are vegetarian. Often last minute travel options have to be ticketed and this means I will not have any assurance of a vegetarian meal option on Emirates. Seems odd and not befitting an airline such as Emirates which has fantastic infrastructure and options available to it as well as world renowned chefs.

Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late. In similar situations at Changi/Singapore SQ staff is there to either get you to your plane in time or if it too late altogether make immediate arrangements to get you to your destination as soon as possible.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2014-10-12,HKG-DXB-VIE and the same in return using A340 B777 and A380 aircraft. Three out of four sectors were fine: Excellent service and very clean and quiet aircraft. Big disappointment was in Business Class on the A380 due to one main factor: the fact that there is a fully serviced lounge bar area at the rear of Business Class. This sounds rather special until we realised that loud mouthed yobbos can stay in there for the entire journey (in this case Dubai to Hong Kong) and walking up and down the aisles with their drinks and abusing staff for not being fed lunch on time (even though they were all in the bar) and so on. I had to move further to the front of the aircraft to avoid the noise coming from this bar lounge area. This made for a very unpleasant experience and I could understand why some staff were very sad and quiet in going about their duties. Perhaps Emirates should seriously consider getting rid of this little so-called luxury as the concept seems to have backfired badly. The A380 flight was otherwise remarkably smooth partly due I suspect to the design of the aircraft but also the route take for this sector. Food and service on the remaining flights was superb but I could not recommend Business Class on the A380 for the problem of the bar-lounge section.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,A Jones,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,LHR-DXB-BKK / BKK-DXB-LHR. My first experience with Emirates and it was an impressive one. All flights on time with no issues with connecting flights. Outward connection at Dubai for 3 hours was a bit too long followed by another 6 hour flight to Bangkok would have meant feeling shattered on arrival but it was a brand new 777-300 and it was empty I counted 10 pax in our section so climbed on the 4 seats and slept uninterrupted until woken for landing. How anyone can not be impressed by the A380 beggars belief. We had seats in the rear on outward front section on return and it's incredibly quiet compared to the 747! Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft) and comfortable seats. Food quality was good too I've flown Thai quite a few times and the food as been excellent every time for me Emirates was not far behind. Plenty of drink runs and flight attendants were helpful and courteous. The ICE system needs hardly any mention it's simply superb especially on the A380. Online check-in and seat selection made this experience an effortless one. We landed at LHR at a busy time early Friday evening we were off the aircraft through border control and collected our luggage within 50 minutes! All in all can't fault Emirates. Would recommend and certainly fly again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,B Walker,Singapore,2014-09-17,My wife and I live in Singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit family/friends. Emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. It is therefore with sadness that I have to complain about the in-flight service received on flight EK37 on 10th July which was the beginning of a tour of the UK. We have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. However on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chit-chat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. Throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an ever-growing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. Furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. During meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong ‘end’. Consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other ‘end’. This has somewhat clouded our view of Emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,1,2,2,NA,NA,2,0

Food good particularly on return leg and staff were welcoming. They were happy to provide passengers with additional drinks beyond the trolley service with dinner on the return leg. Entertainment fantastic and undoubtedly the best (had flown on Etihad in business the week before and struggled to find things to watch). Flight back to Sydney was 25 minutes early.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,2014-08-28,DXB-JFK on the A380. Boarding and departure was delayed by nearly an hour due to the late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seats were comfortable but worn out. No footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. Entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. The choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. However this was the only exceptional part of the flight. Flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. I've never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. I've had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the United States and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. Service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. It took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. Catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. Omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast? So basically it's a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. Also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. Only good part was the cool mood lighting. Overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but Emirates' customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,2,2,5,NA,NA,2,0

Outbound was first day of Eid loads in Y could not have been more than 60 people. Very pleasant flight cabin crew friendly and efficient. Hot towels and a menu with 2 options lamb kofta or chicken. Seats were okay for a 3 hour flight but definitely not as comfortable as on the Qatar Airways or Egyptair 77Ws. On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests.

Every time I fly this airline I swear I never will again - things have not improved. The planes are good but the cabin crew are just horrendous. Without doubt Emirates is the rudest airline I have flown and they are not improving. Instead of asking passengers to do something they demand it. Instead of asking if people would like a landing card they say ""where are you from?"" I think in the entire flight I heard one please or thank you. I really don't care if they don't enjoy their jobs but it would make for a pleasant experience for the pax if they weren't abrupt surly and clumsy.

Had business class seat in Row 8 the bulkhead. Rather than an A/V screen as part of my seat my screen was bolted to the bulkhead. Made for poor viewing experience. Also found the handheld controller to be ridiculously slow. Getting from my window seat to the aisle was a mountain goat experience when the adjacent seat was in sleeping position. Was also surprised to learn the 777 seat was not a 180 degree fully lie flat. Staff were pleasant and attentive but not any more so than British Air or Lufthansa. Food the same as BA and LH.

Turns out the plane was full on every leg so they could have saved me time and angst. The crew in economy looked unhappy without exception and were overworked and brusque.

IFE was excellent on the Dubai-Singapore leg but quite average on the Abidjan-Dubai one. Both legs were on B777 and the 3-4-3 seat configuration is quite uncomfortable especially for a 2 times 8 hours journey. But the main setback remains the transfer at Dubai with this incredible and uncomfortable 20 min bus drive from the plane to terminal 3 a bit problematic if you have a short time connection and have to queue to security check and walk across those long corridor to reach your departing gate something Emirates whose traffic is mostly longhaul transited through this Airport should fix.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,2,4,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

When we arrived in Dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood queuing for about 6/7 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At around 12/12.30 so after nearly 6/7 hours (standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet) we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 (further 11 hours wait) we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside Dubai airport and although we waited so long Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. The food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunch/dinner we were told that they were all finish so We had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. Worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers.

Having booked with Emirates legs were actually with Qantas (partner airline). This was made clear at booking. However Qantas schedule changed prior to flying which gave a very short connection in Sydney then the Wellington-Sydney plane was late but Qantas air hostess rang through and arranged for a buggy to meet me at the terminal and fast-track me to the gate for the Emirates flight. They closed the gate immediately after I arrived for my flight which I appreciated. However I was seated at the very back of my flight and knowing my predicament no effort was made to help me off the plane first to make my connection. I arrived in Bangkok to discover that though I had made the connection my bag had not and would not come for another 17 hours. The Emirates staff person at Bangkok informed me off this but gave no apology. They promised to deliver the bag to me but as I was two hours out of Bangkok and in a rural area my host had little confidence that a courier would actually make the delivery so we decided to come back to the airport ourselves to collect the bag. Effectively I lost a day and extra money for taxis etc and have still had no apology from the airline.

Phuket airport was confusing as the terminal is not well signed. Again business class so whisked through security and passport control so no need to queue. Coral Lounge at Phuket is very small and serves First and Business class it is also a lounge were you can pay to enter.

Very friendly and welcoming crew they seem to love the A380 and explaining its features to passengers actively inviting you to come for a drink in the lounge bar. Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar. Massive screen but I remain un-impressed with the range of films and TV programmes on offer. Red eye service cabin lights nice and dim throughout the flight. Full dining service offered despite the 1am departure time with a breakfast served before arrival. Skipped the meal had drinks and canapés at the bar. Nice feature of the Emirates A380 but bar seems to have little space for stock and they constantly run out of things and the poor crew are backwards and forwards from the galley constantly. Lie flat bed was extremely comfortable more so than the 777-300ER beds and combined with the seat liner and nice blankets it was brilliant. Best sleep ever on long haul. Breakfast prior to arrival was decisively average yet again tried the cold cuts and cheese as had enough of the hot offerings and the meat was off poor quality with tasteless cheese.

Upper deck boarding via air bridge. Crew friendly and welcoming on the whole some perhaps just business friendly. Menu for flight looks far more enticing than previous sectors. Extremely friendly and efficient steward from Dubai himself was looking after me. Very attentive throughout. Seat again is fantastic but this time a LH window seat with minibar to the window and seat more to the aisle - does not feel as private. Under window stowage is also hard to access. Variety of appetisers and sweets at the bar was great on this sector and the Manchester born girl manning the bar was chatty and genuine. Skipped breakfast and snacked at the bar on and off. Dinner service before arriving in Manchester was lovely Nice soup Beef Steak and a Cheese board to finish. Best meal in 4 flights so far and probably the nicest crew . Overall impression of Emirates after a 4 leg trip aircraft well kept A380 stands out 777-300 are getting overhauled crew attentive and professional and immaculately turned out. Food and beverages - food quite average to be honest only 1 dish got me excited. Choice of drinks good with good quality wines too.

Found all staff both inflight and on ground extremely friendly and helpful. Meals on all flights were excellent with a wide variety of choices - all accompanied by some excellent wines. The ICE - entertainment system offered incredibly varied options of entertainment. My only complaint was the angled lie flat bed on the B777-300 - I have a real thing about angled lie flat bed.

All flights left on time and arrived on time or early. Seats were comfortable enough as to manage some hours sleep and seat pitch adequate it didn't feel that cramped as stated in previous reviews but I guess because I picked the two seat row at the very end of the cabin. All seats I preselected were honoured which was nice. Outbound I did online check-in which worked fine and used the dedicated online check-in counter at Madrid which permitted me to skip the long queues for economy check-in. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working specially on the NRT-DXB leg. All requests were promptly met and you could ask for any kind of drinks and snacks between meals. Food was nice and tasty and portions adequate with several options to choose from I missed breakfast service on MAD-DXB leg though.

As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated. The tickets were cheaper than the other airline by quite a few hundred dollars and did have a couple of little nice hand-outs the other airline does not.

As I was travelling with a family member who is wheelchair bound, we requested to be provided special assistance. There was a ground staff assigned to help us when we landed in Abu Dhabi from Kuala Lumpur.  He simply pushed my wheelchair bound family member as if it was a 100m sprint. Later we had to line up to cross security check, however he led us to cut the line which the security officer was not agreeable to and everything was such a mess and the experience was so unpleasant.  The flight attendant was impolite as well. On the flight, there were a group of travelers that seemed new to flying. One of them was struggling to adjust his inclined seat while the stewardess spotted him. At first the stewardess asked him politely to adjust the seat. The man answered that he had already adjusted the seat by pressing the button. At the end of the situation, it was realized that the adjustment button was not functioning well, however the stewardess did not change her attitude. On the journey back to Kuala Lumpur, the flight from London to Abu Dhabi was delayed and caused me to miss the transit flight. There was a group of 20+ of us from the same flight stranded. The airline arranged a hotel for us, inclusive of shuttle and meals.  However, the arrangement was poorly done. Little assistant nor direction was given and after we cleared custom, we were just left waiting in the lobby. It took 2 hours for the airline to arrange the shuttle to send us to the hotel and by the time we reached, it was already past 4am! Similar poor coordination during the pick up from the hotel as there were 2 sedan cars picking up 8 designated passengers and later the same shuttle bus arrived.

When we travelled back from Istanbul the flight was worse. Once again seats that did not recline without a real struggle and crew that seemed indifferent to the needs of passengers and they seemed to operate in a chaotic manner at meal times. We waited ages for the meal then didn't get the bread roll and after the meal were completely missed when it came to the longed for cup of tea. I had to ask for a drink of water once as they did not regularly come around and I felt like it was an imposition. Some of the crew seemed unfriendly and cold and it didn't make you want to use that airline again. We missed our connecting night flight due to a delay and the next day Etihad didn't put my name on the passenger list for the next leg home only my husband which wasn't ideal and took a long time to sort out leaving us to rush to get on the plane without breakfast or anything.

Both flights were late (although not significantly) with no explanation. The seats are quite comfortable although a bit narrow and clearly it is better than flying economy. But the service was very below par. On the first leg the crew were pleasant and attentive but got several things wrong (eg bringing the wrong meals). On the second leg though (a long one) the crew were awful. In my view we didn't even get economy class service. Nobody introduced him or herself they staff were off-hand to the point of rudeness the meals took forever to come and the staff didn't respond to any minor requests. For example I wanted a little sugar to sprinkle on my breakfast cereal-I was told that only sugar lumps were available and it wasn't until I suggested that I could go myself and collect some from economy that some appeared! This is just one example of the inadequate and even offensive service. My main course at dinner was almost stone cold and because I had waited so long for it I didn't send it back but it was really horrible. This has never happened to me in scores of long-haul economy flights. Also our trays did not have the correct cutlery on them so we had to keep asking for appropriate utensils. Again this doesn't happen in economy! Another issue was that when one pushed the button for service nothing happened. On two occasions we waited for over ten minutes and nobody appeared.

Security check as always long queues since AUH airport has not been able to catch up with the growth in pass anger numbers. Boarding chaotic and unorganized. Flight departed an hour late due to heavy traffic. Seat the usual hard and narrow affair. The very busy FA's tried their best but they were clearly understaffed on this full flight something I've noticed on another flight a month ago. What really upset me was the ""breakfast"" they served. I opted for the Asian option beef congee. It was about 100 ml of rice soup with a drop of Soya sauce and a few pieces of ginger. Beef could not be found. This was the most disgraceful meal I ever had on a flight and I fly a lot.

The excellent service started with the superb app and website, which you can use to check-in, add your ticket to the Passbook app, select your seat and meal from a large range of options and keep updated about flight changes. The gate changed, but the flight was on time. I was greeted by a friendly and professional cabin crew who provided sufficient and tasty food and beverages as well as hot towels, ear plugs, pyjamas and a nice EVA Air amenity kit from Rimowa and kept the cabin spot clean. The seat was comfortable with enough leg room and turned into a fully flat bed, it was also large enough to fit my long legs. I had a hard time sleeping because of some turbulence, but the artificial sky helped me get some good rest either way. The only thing that lacked on this flight was a WiFi connection that EVA Air has on some of their 777-300ERs but the Star Gallery, with a large selection of recent Western and Asian films and music, kept me entertained throughout the whole flight.",Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Bangkok,9,5,5,5,5,5,NA,5,1

I avoided using EVA until they joined Star Alliance. Based on the two trips this month I believe of the three direct carriers (EVA BA Thai) as they stand today (pre Thai A380) EVA offer the best business service. The seat is comfortable spacious and at 6'3"" tall I can sleep fully extended without having to bend my knees. It's a comfortable sleep with a reasonable duvet thrown in and fully flat. Service is nice and polite English fair and a decent screen to watch videos on. The music selection is poor and film selection fair only - there's better out there but there is enough for me to get through a 13 hour flight with sleep.

Of course I was not offered any voucher not even for a drink of water! The worst was my recent flight to Morocco from Abu Dhabi. The flight scheduled to leave at 2 am finally left at 7 am.

The company was not to blame with the delay the airport was experiencing a failure of the lighting system on the runways. The Etihad service desks were swamped with stranded passengers needing to be rebooked. It was madness to try to get to the desks. Etihad staff was trying their best not to been seen.

This segment was in business class (Premium Laurel Class) on the 747-400. We had seats 7H and 7K. Boarding was fast and efficient. The seats were in the lower forward section of the 747 and were lie-flat angled seats. The service and food was very good. We pre-ordered our meals on-line. The IFE had a good selection of choices. This was my first experience with the angled seats and it was comfortable but I would opt for the 180 degree lie flat when given the choice. The flight arrived on time and our connection in Taipei was smooth we were greeted by name and shown where to go for our next flight. Our flight to Hong Kong (HKG) was on an MD-90 in seats 2A and 2C - Business Class. Service and meals were very good as well! Our return was slightly different flying from Bangkok Thailand (BKK) to TPE on an Airbus A330. Our seats (24F and 24G) were in economy on this flight and the service and seats were very good. My only complaint was that our seats were changed within 24 hours of our trip moving us away from friends we were seated next to. This also occurred on our next flight in business class but one person offered to switch seats once we were on the plane. Our flight from TPE to Los Angeles (LAX) was on the 777-300 ER in Royal Laurel Class - their newer designed business class seats - lie flat. We were in seats 5D and 5G aisle seats. The boarding process was swift. Once again we pre- ordered our food on-line. The service was excellent throughout the flight. The food was probably the best I have had on a plane! I slept well too!

The staff were extremely unfriendly - not one smile from any of them until the point at which we all left the plane.

As a result I got to try out the herringbone life flat pods which are an excellent product. TPE-HKG (which is the shorter of the 2 flights) was the regular Premium Laurel. For Business class you can pre-order your meals in advance on the EVA website and both meals were of a high standard. Cabin service also was professional polite as is typical on most Asian airlines in a premium cabin.

IAD-AUH (A340-600) - flight only 20% full and I had the bulkhead seat with an open seat next to me. Had a great experience with in-flight food entertainment and service. I chalk that up to the empty flight and minimal stress on FA's. Bulkhead seats are normally 75$ per leg but was able to get it during online check-in. Bulkhead had plenty of legroom and you don't have to worry about reclining seats. IFE is slightly smaller and with lower graphics quality. Cons: seats are quite hard halfway through the 12 hr flight my tailbone was so sore I had to sit on a pillow for the rest of trip. Transit AUH - first time at airport and transit in evening was a breeze with minimal lines for transfer/secondary security. I had a short layover so didn't check on the facilities. Food options are limited and expensive. AUH-BKK (777) - completely full flight and boarding process was very chaotic. Basically a complete free for all boarding. They boarded by rows but gate agents were not enforcing it. I will avoid flying on 777 especially with the 3-4-3 set up and the poor seat pitch. Cabin was very hot even though I was just in a T-shirt. FA's did their best scrambling around with the full flight. Seats again were very hard and not comfortable. BKK-AUH (777) - same experience as the inbound flight. Cabin too warm and breakfast food was pretty bad on this flight. By far the worse on the trip. Boarding in BKK still very chaotic. AUH transit with US Customs pre-clearance - 3 hour layover in the early morning and airport was very busy. Secondary security had long lines and had to wait 30 min. Food options is still terrible. US pre clearance at AUH was a mixed bag. No dedicated lines for US citizens. AUH-BKK (A340) - another full flight and a complete reversal in my Etihad experience. FA had difficult time communicating with mostly South Asian customers. Meal service was a zoo - I have never seen so many different special meal requests. There's a 30-40 min lag between special meal service and regular meal service. Special meal customers ended up holding on their meals for 1 hr. Some flyers had to take their own tray back to the FA. Cabin temperature fluctuated a couple times from cold to warm. IAD luggage took forever. Waited for a full 30 min at the carousel from the first bag to my bag. Probably would not fly Etihad economy even with the lowest price. Seat pitch way too small for intl long hauls.

Seats on 747-400 in Elite Class have been replaced with the same seats used on the 777 allowing for you to recline slightly and raise your feet. I found it comfortable and was able to sleep. IFE had numerous movies and music. Meals were advertised on a menu card. Amount was enough to keep me full and they offer snacks if you ask for it such as instant noodles. Alcohol is served if requested but not offered as readily as done on domestic US flights. Flight attendants speak English quite well. For the TPE-BKK segment there were attendants that spoke Thai and Thai newspapers are offered as well. On SEA-TPE segment a comfort kit is provided. Bathrooms are kept clean and well stocked. Flight attendants were polite friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airline to Thailand or Taiwan if flying Elite Class.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,5,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

A good trip although check in staff member seemed not to speak English. Flight was a little late leaving Moscow and arriving in Abu Dhabi which made the transit a little stressful as it was not clear that I and my luggage would make the second flight. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive but no one spoke Russian on the Moscow - Abu Dhabi sector. Food and wine were good but the service a little slow especially on the Abu Dhabi sector where I was trying to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Both planes were good and clean and with seats being fully flat beds were restful and spacious. The IFE was good on both planes and we were permitted to use the IFE until we had landed. The airport in Abu Dhabi was undergoing extension/renovation and a bus was used to transport passengers to the terminal. The lateness in arrival meant that the plane was about to board so it was not possible to eat in the lounge and then only sleep on the second flight. Here supper rather than dinner was late being served so valuable sleep time was lost.

Flights on time new aircraft and reasonably comfortable trip. Service efficient if lacking slightly in a human touch however staff courteous and helpful. Food was a bit bland but I don't expect much more from air travel.

Not sure why this is so given that they charge to change dates (which I expect from a cheap ticket) and EVA didn't seem to know either when I called them.

The flights were on time, the A340 planes form SIN - HEL though aging were fairly well kept. Service, though not as slick as QR or SQ, was attentive and more relaxed. No complaints. The seat was comfortable but not a flat bed. IFE adequate and food was good. Excellent lamb dish out of HEL. Of course they don't serve gourmet coffee or tea, but overall, no complaints. The HEL lounge for the international flights side was good with vintage wines and good quality supper food. Very good showers and Helsinki Airport is very easy to navigate.

We requested to change to the newer planes hard enough to entertain a 3 year old for 17 hours but we booked as they said they had personal screens. Would help if they worked.

I have used the other airline on the route on a regular basis. The flight was late by about 50 minutes probably due to poor weather conditions. I never understand why these short haul airlines don't allow for more slack in the timetable for their evening flights which are bound to pick up delays during the day. The slogan on the front of the Embraer E195 jet plane “ yn falch o wasanaethu Cymru proud to serve Wales was a nice touch. The flight duration was due to be 50 minutes but we appeared to be placed in a holding pattern close to Dublin so probably the same flying time as the competing turboprop plane on this route. The aircraft itself was very good spacious relatively quiet comfortable leather seats and a smooth flight considering the weather. This is in contrast to the aircraft used by the competition. Upon arrival in Dublin the plane did not park at a remote stand and require a bus transfer which made it easy to connect with public transport.

The connecting flight from Amsterdam was fine. A tiny curtained off Business section with economy seating with middle seats left vacant. A pleasant dinner good Champagne and on time. From Helsinki to Singapore was one of the old A340s (OH-LQA in this case). First impressions were favourable with the cabin being spacious and clean. We had pre flight drinks and a snack and left on time. Once seated I tried the seat out and it's more of a recliner but seemed ok. Menus drinks and dinner all happened smoothly and quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed my supper. It's a bit of a no frills offering but enjoyable and had nice wines also. IFE is poor. The screens are tiny and the offering is limited and old. Didn't really matter as I wanted to sleep as much as possible and despite the seat being at quite an angle I managed a few good hours. Breakfast was simple but tasty. So overall the experience was a good one - on time fed and slept well.

Finnair uses an old leased Air France Aircraft on these Routes and they have not been updated or refurbished for years. The seats are old and worn and certainly could use a bit of TLC. On the outward flight the inflight entertainment system in my seat was not working and the lights in Business Class could not be switched off during the night.

Lounge at Helsinki was fairly quiet but this obviously depends on the time of day. On HEL-SIN sector we had seats 6 A and C bulkhead in the A340. We got some rest but the seat is not conducive to sleep. Why on earth any airline serves a meal at midnight defeats me so we declined and tried to get some sleep. On arrival at SIN we had use of Qantas lounge for our ongoing flight with BA codeshare. Overall the flight and lounges for the outgoing sector were fine. The return was awful: Finnair uses Plaza Premium lounge at HK which is poorly equipped uncomfortable old seating and it's a very long walk to the gates. No announcements were made (and we were told this) but the only flight screen info is one which scrolls through the next 24 hrs flights. With no help from the lounge staff we decided to make our way to the gate about 45 mins before departure: a good thing we did since the flight was not showing as boarding as we left the lounge but the extremely long walk to the gate meant that we were some of the last to board. Although the flight was scheduled to be on an A330 with flat bed seats it was an old 340 and sleep was difficult. Staff are pleasant but not particularly proactive. Not sure I'd fly with AY business again unless I was assured of a flat bed. I understand they are upgrading most of the fleet this year.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,3,3,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

Use of the Finnair lounge in Helsinki is an excellent attraction. The return flights arrived into Helsinki Vantaa close to midnight and I was surprised to see so many Flybe and Finnair flights arriving and departing at this time including into northern Finland.

Crew seemed friendly and efficient but not as warm as other airlines. Quality of food was very low - greasy and small in quantity probably because Finnair sells snacks in between meals. Return flight of six hours in the night was packed and crew did 4 hours of service for dinner and breakfast interspersed with announcements so ensured passengers did not get sleep.

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,Jennifer Bentley,United Kingdom,2012-02-08,LHR-HEL-BKK and SIN-HEL-LHR in Dec-Feb. Service was good staff language skills outstanding. IFE is poor in comparison to other major carriers. A330 has lie flat seats but if travelling as a couple avoid the left hand seats as there is less room than in the middle paired seats. A340 on return was awful for sleeping: the low back shell design means limited space in footwells and the seat does not go flat. I'm 5ft 8 and could not fit into the space to lie down. European leg was economy seat with middle seat vacant. We'd booked flights to Australia so the onward connections were with Qantas (on Finnair codeshare) who have great seats and lounges.

I can however tell you about their horrible customer service which is almost non-existent. Trying to get a flight during the snow at Heathrow we were left standing at the check-in for 6 hours before we received any information from the 1 Finnair staff member who had stayed at the airport as all the others went home and left all the passengers stranded. When the announcement went over the loudspeaker that the flight was cancelled they told us to consult the check-in staff. By that time they had all gone. The UK Finnair customer service number was closed all weekend and the only 24-hour number was all in Finnish. There was no information about the delays anywhere on the website and although we had been told to come back the next day to the airport we found out from other sources that the flights were again cancelled. We then spent 2 hours on hold to finally be told that there were no flights available until a minimum of 4 days later. When I asked why other passengers who had booked on later flights were taking priority over us the customer service rep just kept reading the script 'Sorry we are fully booked'. Even after I explained that we had to make a connecting flight or we would miss our non-refundable trip in India that we had been saving for 6 months for there was no attempt to help and a refusal to upgrade us even though there were seats available on business class. I have to say this is the worst run airline I have ever encountered with the least helpful staff and the most shambolic management of any airline anywhere.

They were on time friendly bathrooms were clean and the flight was comfortable. In September of 2013 I flew from KC to PDX with a stop in Denver. On the way back to KC we did miss our connecting flight by about 5 minutes. They hadn't taken off yet but they wouldn't let us on because they were to leave the dock in just a few minutes. While it was a bit annoying they got us on the next flight to KC which left about 90 minutes later and I understand why they couldn't let us on that original connecting flight. Of course we didn't have to pay anything extra for the next connecting flight. With the changes in carry-on costs I'm not sure I will fly with them again because it all really depends on where I can get the best deal but if they are still the cheapest I have no qualms with flying Frontier again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,0,4,NA,NA,4,1

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,R Carter,United States,2013-12-21,On October 24 2013 my sister and I began a long-awaited vacation with flights from SLC to Denver and one from Denver to Fort Lauderdale. SLC to Denver leg of the journey went without a hitch. We were not questioned about our carry-on bags or our purses. When we went to board our flight in Denver we were rudely told we could not take our carry-on bags because they were too large and would have to pay an exorbitant charge for it ($100). The Customer Service person told us to go to a kiosk several gates away and pay for our bag knowing full well that if we did so we would miss our flight. We were forced to pay the charge of $100 per bag. I observed at least 15 people on the flight that had bags two and three times larger than the size of my bag. We were then put into seats that had the least amount of leg room that I have come across. When we finally got to Fort Lauderdale out of curiosity I tried the pre-formed compartments that several airlines had in front of their check in gates. My bag fit easily into each of them with room to spare. At least we were finally able to go on our vacation no thanks to Frontier. On November 4 the trouble started again. When we checked in at Fort Lauderdale we were told that the flight was delayed by one hour because of mechanical problems. That delay would mean that we would miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. They said they would get us on a partner airline. A gate agent had put us on an American Airlines afternoon flight. When we tried to check in at American Airlines we were told that the gate agent had not called and confirmed us. Fortunately for us American was kind enough to work with us and find us a late flight to Dallas that then connected on to Salt Lake.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

Very disappointed to discover that my seat turned out to be nothing of the sort - it was in fact the very last row on the aircraft right next to the noisy galley and toilets which made it difficult to sleep. Other than that the flight was quite good - a small late-night snack was served and a decent breakfast before landing. There's a rather modest offering of movies/TV shows - OK for a 7 hour flight.

I read the mixed reviews here before booking business class to Bangkok via Bahrain after seeing Gulf Air has started to refurbish their cabins. First leg LHR-BAH was on a refurbished A330. Seats were excellent far more comfortable than they look. Service was good and food was plenty and above standard for business class. The let down was the AVOD system which was quite limited. After a stay over in Bahrain the second leg to BKK was in a non-refurbished cabin (travel tip: get a set in row 1 or 2 as these seats are better). The cabin was old worn but clean. Service and food matched the first leg and was excellent. The old entertainment system was next to useless but a tablet like device was handed out which was well specked with movies and series and the selection was better than the AVOD system in the refurbished cabin.

While this was only a 2.5-hour flight full IFE was available when I flew with HKA on the even shorter route to and from Shanghai in 2012. Beverage selection was good but food consisted only of a bun wrapped around some meat on both flights. Perhaps HKA expected its passengers to have eaten right before boarding? What HKA could do right before boarding is to board passengers by row number so that they won't have to form a long queue well before boarding begins and get in each other's way inside the plane.

I gave the porter a tip but still did not get a priority tag. No information given about lounge access had to find lounge on my own. Overall a very chaotic unfriendly check-in process. Lounge at HNL airport very basic staff ok not overly friendly. On board the service was good and so was the food and wine. The seats however have only minimal recline and were not very comfortable in the upright position. Overall ok for a 5 hr flight but longer flights would be a problem.

Gulf Air offers cheap rates compared to with Emirates. The day of departure they suffered a London Heathrow T5 problem with their computer system so my flight was delayed and I had to wait 6 hours in Bahrain for a connecting flight to Dubai. Gulf Air was very good in communicating the delays via SMS. All flights are old style business class but much better than European short or medium haul business class. Service and food was excellent Larnaca to Bahrain average on other flights. Good wine selection. Business Lounge in Bahrain is excellent but I pity the economy passengers who must transit in such poor airport.

The flight out of HKG was delayed about 20 min and they bussed passengers to a remote boarding location rather than using a jetway. The flight was fairly full. As a rather tall Western man I'd have enjoyed another inch of pitch or an exit row seat. FAs attentive starting drinks and meal service shortly after takeoff. Throughout the flight they made frequent rounds with drinks. B737 was clean no personal IFE though. The flight back was extremely uncomfortable because the temperature in the front of the economy section was too hot. When I went to the lavatory I noticed that the rear of the cabin was much cooler. Not sure what was up with that. The verdict: not a bad regional airline good crew potential to be improved in a few areas but fine for a short flight if the fare is right.

Food is great, views of the terminal are excellent, there are showers, resting areas, TV watching areas, and a couple of beverage stands at both ends of the lounge. Boarding was conducted in a very organized form using two bridges: one for Business Plus and one for the main cabin, and allowing families with children and elderly to board first which is always a great gesture. Cabin was clean, and flight attendants welcomed passengers in a friendly way. The new seat is superb: private, comfortable and lies almost flat allowing for a reasonable sleep. Entertainment system also had a great selection of movies, games, and TV shows. Food selections were good quality, although portions were a bit small. Flight attendants were able to suggest wine and were quite generous about serving it. Once service concluded, a self service bar was set up in front. One thing I liked about Iberia is that flight attendants are not intrusive, which can be confused with uninterested. This is probably a cultural misunderstanding, because while other carriers have an almost prying and intrusive service, in Spain, it is considered respectful to let people reach out if they need something.

On the short hop to San Salvador all the lights - secondary lighting exit signs included went out leaving the cabin in total darkness for two or three minutes which was a tad alarming. No apology or explanation given. No seat back screens only a large screen at the front of the cabin which was obscured by heads in the rows forward of me making both the security demonstration and any entertainment offered only partially visible. Overnight the cabin crew could not be found to bring water for the necessary taking of pills. To cap it all my bag did not make the transfer to my ongoing flight MAD-LHR.

At the European airports, everyone was asked to board at the same time. When we confronted Icelandair, they said they didn't have the facilities to do this. You don't need facilities.

At the airport (SFO) there was no gate information we had to ask our way through to find out which the departure gate is. When we started boarding there was still no gate information.

If it was larger or heavier than the allowed size/weight for carry-on items you had to check it in (and pay of course).

Another annoying experience is the lounge in Reykjavik for stop over flights. It is before passport control and US gates. In the lounge no one tells you when to leave or how much of a queue there is for passports so I went when boarding started but was far too early at the gate just standing around. The other time I went later but there was enormous queues for passport control so I had to run afterwards to the gate.

The Lounge at MAD pier was OK. The service on board was abysmal. They brought around papers and magazines but there were no English publications only Spanish. Secondly not a smile from any of the crew at any time in fact they all bordered on rude. It is obvious that the customer is in the way of them enjoying themselves. Drinks were not served until 1 hour after take off. No welcome drink. The hot towels were cold and damp. The food where do you start? Starter tuna salad 2 small strips of tuna on lettuce and cold soup out of a packet. The main was veal 2 thin strips and some spinach. There was plenty of bread and wine but the food left you feeling hungry. The snack bar was not replenished. I asked for a diet coke and was sighed at by a crew member and did not get it. This is not business class food nor service. The seat was broken and did not extend. I reported it to a crew member but nothing was done not even an apology. The AVOD system had 8 B rated films that were years old. Overall it is pathetic excuse for a business class experience. I can only thank my lucky stars I am flying BA Club home.

A mixed experience flying Icelandair but generally great and decent value for money. Crew were professional and courteous on all flights aircraft clean and modern and flights on time. One of the perks of booking Economy Comfort Class is often the ability to reserve seats in the Saga Class cabin - ie business class seats for economy prices. I was sat in these seats on all 4 sectors which made for a relaxing and comfortable journey. Icelandair seems to oversell economy pushing these passengers into the Economy Comfort cabin and the Economy Comfort passengers moved to the rear of business class. Other benefits were priority check-in - a huge bonus in Reykjavik where as a previous report states early morning is total chaos in the check-in area. Saga lounge was good and a welcome place to spend transit time. One negative is the onboard service. They promise meal service on all flights but the reality is you get a free sandwich or snack from the buy onboard economy offering as they pass through to serve economy - not really as advertised.

In my experience I have never heard an airline flying to THR cheaper than Iran Air does and the pilots are obviously very skilled. But there are negative sides to flying Iran Air. First of all although their Aibus fleet is one of the safest in the world their other aircrafts (Boeing747(SP)727 and Russian aircraft) are one of the oldest and most dangerous - so my advice try to avoid these aircraft when flying Iran AIr. Luckily most European flights are with the Airbus fleet. I also know that the poor shape of their Boeing fleet is not caused by neglect but the fact that the Iranian government can't buy spare parts for these aircraft from the US (politics and stuff). Also inflght entertainment is almost non-existent (not even in their Business class) especially if you don't like Farsi spoken movies shown on a projector so bring a book/magazine/walkman or whatever.

It took the ground staff 2 hours to sort out our new flight the next morning iand arrange for our airport hotel in Paris (Sofitel - they paid) but we were not able to retrieve our luggage so no fresh cloths the next day. Our return flights had ticketing/computer problems which caused delays with our check-in and none of the special meals we ordered through their website were ever delivered for any of our flights.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,C Martinez,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,I have never met a group of cabin crew so unwilling to help passengers. I though I was unlucky on my flight from London to Mumbai but the crew on the return trip were possibly worse. Clearly passengers are an inconvenience that should just go to sleep and not bother the crew. I was refused a coffee as we were an hour from landing (even though they still hadn't finished clearing from breakfast so it should have been a simple ask). Another major annoyance were the tannoy announcements all through the night telling us we were entering turbulence so should fasten our seatbelts. Most humane airlines mention at the start of a night flight that passengers should keep their belt visible so that they don't have to wake us. There were only 15 movies on offer of which only 2 or 3 are new releases. I won't go into details on the food I handed it back and got extra bread instead (though the guy was reluctant to even provide this).

I generally like Japan Airlines especially the exceptionally high service standards and generally good food. However on recent Premium Economy travel through from Sydney to Frankfurt and return I found the shell seats almost impossible for sleeping (were these cast-offs from the similar old Cathay Pacific seats one wonders?) and due to a promotional fare offer the PE cabin was packed with noisy passengers and became claustrophobic which tends to negate the benefits of flying PE in the first place! Also this must be the only airline I can think of that allows passengers to keep their window shades closed during the take-off and landing phases of the flight - half the cabin was in darkness from before taxiing and then for the entire flight including the landings. Isn't this a safety hazard when passengers are unable to see out of the aircraft in case of emergency? On the other hand I like the JAL First lounges in Narita and use of the Qantas First lounge in Sydney - excellent. Overall however a mixed experience saved by an upgrade to business on one sector - a different experience entirely.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,2,5,3,3,NA,NA,5,1

Reviewing on behalf of my son and parents who flew from Prague to Manchester after joining us for a weekend there. They comment that the plane look old and very worn out inside the air system was very loud and the toilet door would not shut having to be repeatedly slammed throughout the flight. The plane was in fact no spring chicken at 28 years old. My parents were last aboard as there were large groups of young fit men aboard and in their 70s they can't move like they used to. This shouldn't have been an issue as they were booked on the front row. Unfortunately Jet2 seem to be of the opinion that people on the front row don't need an overhead locker. Whilst they only had two very small bags (not roll on cases) they asked the stewardess to help them find some space. At which pointed she shouted at my tiny assuming mother in law that she should have got on the plane earlier. Frankly my mother in law was astonished by this rhetoric. Someone is always going to be last on the plane does that mean they don't have a right to stow their luggage. Of course their luggage ended up miles away so getting off was difficult. As usual Jet2 ran out of sandwiches and of course as usual their flights were booked at convenient times at a premium compared to other airlines and changed to an inconvenient one with no refund.

How refreshing after the take-it-or-leave-it attitude on most US- based carriers! 787 was a nice experience with the oversized windows which darken at the touch of a button and the ride is slightly quieter than other aircraft's but cannot see that the individual passenger experience is greatly improved.

International legs from London to Delhi were both on 777-300 but the difference in service out and inbound was notable. I'm 6""2 and on the way out my legs were touching the seat in front the attendants were fine but nothing great and the food servings were really below par. The breakfast was particularly paltry. On the way back the leg room was capacious and I could stretch out with plenty of room to spare meals were healthy and decent quality with choice of western or Indian service was good with drinks served throughout the flight and they even kept the toilets clean. Couldn't fault the return leg I guess it's just luck of the draw on which plane you get. Range of movies was ok with a decent number of western and Indian to choose from. We had seats 57A&B both ways and this gave us 2 windows on the more spacious seat layout. The internal flights between Delhi and Madras were average with little leg room no IFE and they ran out of blankets though they did at least serve free food.

jet2-com,/airline-reviews/jet2-com,Jet2.com customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,NCL-TFS-NCL. Booked as part of a decent package deal for some last minute winter sun. We've often flown with Jet2 in the past and have often found them excellent and this was no exception. Their flights were very well timed so we weren't arriving into Tenerife at some god-awful time of night. The pre-flight add-ons weren't horrendously expensive and the website easy to navigate. We printed boarding passes at home which meant check in was a breeze. You can both outward and return well in advance but most passengers appear not to do this for reasons which are beyond me clearly preferring a lengthy check in queue rather than the (no queue) fast bag drop. Boarded and departed on time. Onboard warmly welcomed both directions by friendly experienced crew. The seats are not like sitting on a cloud but at 6ft tall they were fine even for me for 4.5 hrs. The additional god-send is the inability to recline which made the whole thing very bearable. We pre-booked hot food both ways which was very good and filled a gap. Bags waiting on carousel in Tenerife. Return much the same with zero queue at bag drop lovely staff and on time departure. The only slight snag was a 40 minute wait for bags in Newcastle.

Departure delayed 12 hours from 11.05am to 10.55pm and during that time we were shown appalling customer service. Kept on board in fairly high temperatures for 3 hours with a small cup of water handed out and very little information. Eventually told plane would not be flying and so we had to get off. Put in a hot 'holding room' without sufficient seating and with no vending machines for food or water. We had all gone 9 hours without food and one small glass of water. By 4pm the plan was to schedule another flight meanwhile they planned to put us all on a coach to a hotel. At 8pm we were back at the airport and despite promises of a 9pm flight we didn't get on the (same) plane till 9.30pm only to discover once on the runway that there was now a fault with one of the doors and we had to return to the airport. This was fixed but then we were told we had lost our take off slot and had to wait another 30 minutes. In the end it was 10.55pm. Staff were nice enough.

Simple Web site but functional easy to navigate book and buy - however in Portuguese only. Seat allocation can be reserved only by phone. Decent fares no surcharges transparent rules frequent promotions. Very friendly and efficient staff both on the ground and aboard; one can see they were very well trained and enjoy their work - a rarity today. Immaculate plane inside (in spite of a few worn paint spots on the fuselage) seat pitch better than in Gol or TAM. Announcements in English for foreign travelers. Food is a cold sandwich small but not microscopic and a small sweet - both very good. No alcohol but plenty of soft drinks fruit juices and mineral water. Punctuality was impressive - not a single flight delayed on the airport panels on both legs. The only real minus I saw was a very long time on the ground in stops (50-60 minutes) while one waits inside. My flights were nonstop but were it not so I'd be annoyed with that.

Boarding by seat number and fairly easy. Adequate leg room in 737-800 but the tiniest most uncomfortable arm rests imaginable (I had a constant battle with my neighbouring passenger for the use of the arm est!) good and pleasant service and with plenty of information from flight deck. Landing aborted about 1 mile from touch down after a very bumpy approach which certainly shut up the noisy drunk a few rows in front of us but the second attempt was smoother with a competent landing given the conditions. On return we were bussed to the aircraft this time a 757-200 which must have seen service in the Far East as the second language on the passenger warning signs was either Chinese or Japanese. Quite an old aircraft and comfortable enough but with the terrible arm rests. Twenty minute delay on departure with very little information from the flight deck throughout but arrival in Glasgow only a few minutes late. Good and pleasant service from the cabin crew and plenty choice for snacks and drinks. This was our fifth experience of using Jet2 and we would be happy to repeat the exercise.

Check-in and boarding at Luton was incredibly easy and personal and the private terminal was very comfortable and spacious with very nice shower facilities (food not worth mentioning). This makes up for the headache of accessing Luton airport from Central London. Onboard food was below par. The cabin although comfortable and new was nearly empty on this flight. Arrival at the VIP terminal in itself almost makes the entire trip worth it as there is no hassle or waiting in Dubai's notorious passport control queues. However there was some confusion in finding where to go as this is currently the only commercial airline that uses this terminal and Silverjet staffing here was sparse. After wandering into a private waiting area a few of us were ushered upstairs by a non- Silverjet employee to the correct facility. Agents casually take your boarding passes and return them to you as you relax in the very upscale facility. However their Dubai lounge inconveniently lacks shower facilities and the staff is not subtle about rushing you out as they have shift focus to greeting departing passengers going back to Luton. Silverjet has some issues to iron out but overall is a product worth giving a try.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

A couple then came onto the plane last minute and were told to sit in the extra leg room seats in front of us. It quickly became clear that the lady obviously worked for Jet2 in some capacity they got their drinks first which duly happened as soon as the plane was in the air. We were sat in the seats directly behind and it was over an hour before refreshments were offered to us! I have never experienced such shoddy and slow service on a flight in my life.

On both flights 10 bags had no space and on MAN the cabin crew began writing surnames on paper hand towels before handing bags to the ground crew. Only a few baggage receipts were returned. Staff at BUD were much more professional but this still adds a 30 minute stressful delay to the boarding process.

And at just under £800.00 including tax it was a no brainer! I got a further discount from invegas.co.uk. The flight takes a bit longer than Virgin but this is probably due to the smaller plane.

Flight was 2/3 full and departed on time from Penang. Same seats and usual food and duty free sales service as inbound flight to Penang. Arrival at Changi at 11.40am and swift disembarkation from aircraft - this time a crew member was at the exit to say a simple ""bye"". Overall the fare I paid was value for money especially at the last minute but it is clear to me that Jetstar Asia needs to severely improve for its customers especially when Qantas is going to rely more on them in future for intra-Asia connections and the sole direct from Singapore to Western Australia - clearly something needs to be done in the area of service quality.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,3,0,0,NA,NA,5,1

The downside was that I felt like being served without a personal touch why? 1) No second pre departure drink. 2) I was asked what I like to eat without receiving the menu first and the FA forgot to ask which appetizer I want (normally that is fixed). 3) During the flight it was hard to get snacks and drinks (I had to walk to the economy class FA's and ask them). 4) In preparation for landing I had to bring my hand luggage back in the overhead bins on my own (FA asked me to get up and do it while she was standing next to me without helping me). The good stuff was the taste of the food and the good wines/drinks as well as a comfortable lie flat seat with an angle (only a few of the 25 KLM 777 are lie flat without an angle today). Speaking about the FA's on board they where always smiling and the economy FA's have been very helpful fast and with a personal touch.

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,G Cook,Australia,2014-10-12,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary. Next time we pay more and fly with anyone but Jetstar.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,5,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

klm-royal-dutch-airlines,/airline-reviews/klm-royal-dutch-airlines,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,D Cassius,Netherlands,2015-04-01,Rio to AMS in EcoComfort. KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible.

Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service.

Ground staff less than helpful and claimed that this type of service is to be expected from budget carriers. They appear to be over-anticipating passenger demand on some routes and when supply outstrips demand simply cancelling flights and disrupting passengers by either flying them the next day or transferring them to flights to other airports on sister airlines and bussing passengers to their original destination.

A330-200 for AMS-HAV means much better seat-width than sister-airline Air France's 777-300 used on CDG-HAV a far more comfortable 2-4-2 seating than the 777`s 3-4-3 and of course only half the amount of passengers making arriving formalities in HAV much faster. Still the success-key is the cabin crew and the in-flight service standard. First pre lunch drinks with pringles then a hot towel followed by a good hot lunch (choice of main) and after collecting meal trays: coffee/tea with cognac/liqueur. Ice cream was offered with coffee (and/or drinks) mid-way + several offerings of water/coke/juice through flight and a hot towel again before a new hot snack/meal in good time before landing. All this offered by crew members who seem to enjoy their work. Who can ask for more in economy?

Although I'm a Flying Blue member I do travel with other airlines so I think I can assess KLM position to other benchmarks. I am actually quite satisfied with KLM. Service is above average too often it's the passenger being rude. Food is ok not better not worse it's an airplane after all. Personally I think KLM is ahead of many competitors when it comes to online check in and self-service luggage drop-off (at least at their home-base AMS) it's far more advanced and smooth than most airlines. Although my last flight was in a 737 without entertainment I know that their entire long-haul fleet now has proper personal entertainment systems so that's good. They were a bit late on their 747s though. I will use them in the future.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,G Cueto,United States,2015-04-26,I live in DC but flew out of NYC to MNL and TPE via Incheon to take advantage of the lower fares offered out of JFK and to fly the A380 on the NYC route (vs 777 on flights to Dulles). I had flown EVA Air 777 JFK to TPE a few months prior and Y class seats on the Korean A380 definitely felt more spacious both in terms of pitch and seat width. And the more generous headroom on this aircraft was also noticeable. I also appreciated that the Korean lunch/dinner option (usually a pretty healthy bibimbap or some variation thereof) always came with soup and the snacks between meals - fruits chips chocolate hot ramen and/or hot sandwiches - were filling and tasty. The attendants treated customers with respect. Flight attendants were proactive helping parents with babies. I also thought the attendant uniform and the overall branding and color scheme of the airline were quite stylish and appealing. The AVOD movie selection was comparable to EVA but not as good as Cathay or Singapore. The only downside to the journey was the horrendously long and slow-moving check in line in Manila. Online check in was out of commission so I arrived at MNL a full three hours before the flight and completed check in with only 50 minutes to spare. But I suspect this had more to do with the poor infrastructure at this particular airport/terminal than Korean Air.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,C Chapman,United States,2014-06-04,LAS-ICN-MNL-ICN-LAS. The flight left late Friday night which is great as it allowed me to work all day and still eat dinner and head to the airport for my flight. The aircraft was fairly new or at least it seemed new. The interior was clean and spacious. What I liked was that there is a channel that allows you to get a pilots view of takeoff or you can see underneath the aircraft while taking off. This channel does not stay on the entire flight but it is a pretty cool thing to see. During the flight they gave us a little travel kit with eye cover and slippers a toothbrush a a little thing of toothpaste. I know this is pretty common but it's a nice touch. On the Vegas-Seoul flight I had the Korean meal. They have a selection of Korean beers. The inflight entertainment has many options in English/Korean and Japanese. I was able to watch some pretty new movies. Each seat also had a USB outlet to keep your phone or tablet charged during the flight. I had this on all 4 legs but I guess is only on certain flights. I found the crew very friendly and full of smiles they are quick to assist if you need help or just want a drink. They come through the cabin frequently with water/OJ or juice and are pleasant to talk with if you aren't shy with them. My only complaint is this it's not Korean's fault as I also had this issue on ANA and EVA but the 777 is not designed with an overhead seat vent so I always get very hot and sweat on these flights as it's controlled centrally within each area of the cabin. Throw in 12 hours in the same seat and it can get pretty uncomfortable All in all I'd say a good experience on a high quality airline. I love that they fly directly to Vegas.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Disappointed by the baggage allowance of 1 bag per pax (except to USA) additional bags $100. Flight attendants were direct and the food service was too long leaving finished meal trays on our laps for over 30 minutes.

kuwait-airways,/airline-reviews/kuwait-airways,Kuwait Airways customer review,John Doe,United States,2014-08-06,I flew JFK to LHR return in July 2014. With transatlantic fares being extremely expensive these days I was left with Kuwait Airways being my only viable option without spending $1000+ per person. I considered flying this airline to be somewhat like flying Ryanair - expect nothing except basic transportation from point A to B and everything else is a bonus. The Boeing 777 used on this route is old and clearly in need of an upgrade. PTV entertainment screens worked for virtually no one. However in my opinion the dated interior can be somewhat of an advantage. I found the legroom and seat width to be quite generous compared to other airlines especially the newer 777s with a 3-4-3 layout in economy (Kuwait uses 3-3-3 in economy). The flight attendants were definitely not highly trained or overly polite but I also didn't find them to be rude and they served the meals efficiently. The food was surprisingly some of the best food I have had in economy class. Indian fare was served on all flights and was quite tasty. The JFK-LHR leg included a full hot breakfast I don't believe many other airlines still serve this much food in economy for a transatlantic flight. My outbound flight was just about on-time while my return flight to JFK was delayed by about 1 hour. If you take a look at Flightaware or other flight tracking software for the flight you will see that this flight is on average about 1 hour late so plan accordingly. However given the price paid and the fact that this is a direct flight to LHR I would fly Kuwait again if savings is substantial over other airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,C Martinez,United States,2015-04-16,"We traveled from LAX-LIM LIM-SCL and return. Several flight attendants were friendly but a couple wouldn't make eye contact or smile. I don't have a huge issue with those that don't smile or are too troubled to say hello but the following was certainly unacceptable: The seats are below average in legroom. I'm 5'5"" and thought that it was tight legroom for me! The flight attendants were on a mission to complete tasks and be done with attending and I can give several examples. On a 3.5 hr leg we flew Premium Business and the attendant didn't come through until she had finished prepping the meal - no drinks were offered beforehand. She came through in one swoop returned once to retrieve and another final offer of service. On a 9hr day flight the service was similar swooping through to be done. We had 5.5 hrs of absent flight attendants. An overhead compartment opened mid-flight and remained open for 1.5-2 hrs until a passenger closed it. This not only a safety issue but just another plain example of the laziness that seems to omnipresent with flight staff. On this flight we had to get up 2-3 times to get water from galley and they flight attendant couldn't be bothered to poor the water into the glass. He motioned to the water bottle on the counter and seemed annoyed when I asked for ice. Again the minimum work.

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,Chris Beck,United States,2015-03-04,I flew LAN on Feb 14 from JFK to MVD via SCL. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8pm. However it snowed (not heavily) that afternoon. Arrived at JFK with plenty of time. Flight shown on departure board as being on time. I was at the gate at 7pm and the flight still showed on time however there was an Air Berlin plane at our gate. According to the agent the flight was still leaving on time even though the plane was not there. We finally left the gate at about 10pm and had to wait to be de-iced. Took off at 11pm. Plane was a Dreamliner and other than the having little room between seats was great. Food service on LAN was much better than on American which I usually use to go to MVD. Flight attendants were young enthusiastic and had good rapport with the passengers. Dinner was a choice of beef or pasta and I chose the beef which was quite good. LAN still uses regular cutlery for meal service (no plastic ware) and glass for wine (no plastic cup). Breakfast was also a choice of two different meals cheese sandwich or eggs and sausage which I chose. The eggs and sausage came in s ceramic dish. Far cry from American's minuscule continental breakfast. Arriving at SCL all transit passengers went to transit area LAN had already printed boarding passes for connecting flights and also provided voucher for food while waiting for the connection. I don't think that any US carrier would do that nowadays. Flight from SCL to MVD was on A320 which was more comfortable than seating on Dreamliner. LAN offered snack service (sandwich and beverage) on 2.5 hour flight which most US carriers do not do any more. Return from MVD to SCL was also on A320 boarding pass issued at MVD showed Gate 5 however departure board showed Gate 4 (which was correct gate). Again LAN offered snack service to SCL. SCL to NYC was a nightmare. We were scheduled to leave at 11pm but did not depart until midnight. The plane was full with families with children onboard many of whom cried screamed at night. Perhaps airlines should keep a stock of pacifiers on board. After take off dinner was served and again the offerings were much better than American's. We were scheduled to land at 8am at JFK as we began our approach and landing gear and flaps were down the captain announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather conditions and we would go to Newark instead. Landed at Newark at 9.30am and waited for an hour on taxiway for gate to be made available. Disembarked at 10.30 and by 11 was through passport control. Then we had to wait for 90 minutes for the luggage to start coming onto the carousel. Left the airport at 1pm. LAN had no one there for assistance except some of the flight attendants who did no have that much information.

Nowadays there is not much differences between the main airlines and LAN offered what is expected in Economy Class: Two full meals (somewhat more basic than on main European carriers but portions a little larger) good IFE system and professional service from the staff - less personal but on European carriers but nothing to complain about. Main complain was the hard narrow seats on Boeing 777-300ER as in other carriers using the 3x4x4 option seats are much less comfortable than formerly and make long-distant flights something of a challenge but TAM is not alone here.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2014-12-31,SCL-MVD-SCL booked in premium economy but happily placed in the business cabin of their A320s that are used on these sectors perhaps because of my Oneworld status. LAN provided a good on-time service complete with some basic but tasty meals and wine. Emerald status which meant straightforward access to their business lounges in both Santiago and Montevideo and use of wifi etc. My only complaint was that as I'm not much good with Spanish it was occasionally difficult to follow what the flight attendants were asking. As they are part of Oneworld they will be getting more and more non-local speakers on board so they should focus on language skills even on regional and local routes.

Was quite nervous travelling with this airline after reading some reviews on here but was pleasantly surprised with the service. Both flights on time and actually arrived at the gates early. No queues for check-in at Heathrow and a very small 10 minute wait at JFK. Boarding a little messy in Heathrow due to the small number of seats available but this is BAA's problem and not Kuwait's. Hot snacks and a hot meal served on LHR-JFK leg with a hot meal and cooked breakfast with fruit served on JFK-LHR. In flight entertainment is seat back TVs on Boeing 777 can be a bit hit and miss we were a party of four and only half the screens worked.

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-05-23,BOG-CTG Quick hop between Bogota and Cartagena one way for about £60. There's always a slight issue when flying internally from the capital's airport as neither airline or airport websites taxi drivers nor some employees seem to have consensus on which terminal anyone flies from. The issue with this is that the old terminal has no physical connection to the new so transit between is a bit of a bother. Thankfully all LAN flights currently go from the new El Dorado terminal which is clean and modern. Even though it wasn't that busy it still seemed to take around 45 minutes to get to a check in desk - large numbers of employees chatting rather than working seemed to be the problem. Once checked in quickly through to domestic departures which has a few bars and shops. Warm welcome onboard a brand new A320. Very comfy seats with decent legroom. Minor altercation as we approached the runway as a gentleman behind me had brought a chicken onboard with him unnoticed by the crew - or indeed by any security personnel on the ground. Incredulously the captain elected to take off anyway. Smooth flight with complimentary tea coffee and juice as well as a small snack box of chips and cookies - nicely presented and perfectly adequate for the 60min flight.

Online check-in in London only results in you getting an online check-in receipt and nothing else not even priority check-in desk at LHR. Aircraft are dated IFE almost never works. Food is pretty bland and nasty aircraft dirty and crew can be quite rude and snappy. Safety is low priority with no real checks prior to departure passengers wandering around whilst taxiing mobile phone on throughout the flight lots of passengers listening to music on headphones during takeoff and landing. The only good point is in KWI if you go landside there is plenty to do whilst there is almost nothing airside.

Although the seat pitch on the Peru domestic flights was acceptable the pitch on the international Lima to La Paz flight was so narrow that I couldn't even open my laptop (and it was a very expensive flight!). Also long queues are to be expected for the morning flights in Lima and Cusco (Lan used the web check-in as a way to reduce their staff not as a way to increase the speed of the check-in) however they will call the passengers for the flights which take-off shortly. Snacks for the domestic flights are also of the cheapest sort and they only serve orange juice (no apple no tomato nothing...). As a conclusion LAN Peru is well organized and provides punctual and efficient service but they definitively are on a profit spree enjoying their monopoly to cut some corners without fear or shame while charging quite high prices.,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Lan Peru from SCL-EZE was the only flight available that day for our ticket and was an OK experience. Flight on an older 767-300ER with no personal TVs but the flight is barely 2 hours. The crew were polite and food was good. EZE-LIM was 2 hours 45 minutes late with no explanation meaning we didn't arrive into Lima until 2 am. However we were given a free meal at the airport. We discovered that we had not been sat together so asked the gate agent to move us and were moved right to the front which was great.

However we massive legroom at the front in the middle so we were able to get some sleep. The cabin crew were good actually making sure people watched the safety video and food was fine. LIM-MIA however was great. It left roughly on time which was good as we had a connection at MIA to LHR (our bags did make it the whole way). The plane was a refurbished / new 767-300ER so it had the excellent new seats and AVOD ""IN"" entertainment system.

LAN expect you to be at the airport 3 hours before departure for international flights. They are not joking. Passengers like me who had already checked-in and printed their boarding cards were made to wait outside the cordoned off check-in area. We were admitted after airport security complained about the queue getting in the way of other passengers. After 50 minutes waiting it was my turn but the agent just held his hand up and got out his mobile phone. He was still chatting after I had finished leaving my bags with another agent. Boarded in strict priority of cabin class frequent flyer status and row numbers - then all got on to the same bus! Cabin crew too busy having coffee to check the boarding cards. Crew surly with no smiles or good-byes. Usual economy class type snack. Arrived on time with fairly quick bag return.

A few days after booking we received an email stating that our SJU-DOM flight had been canceled and we would be rerouted through ANU at no additional charge. Inconvenient but we sucked it up. After all it would only be one more hour. Arrival in SJU was stressful. We had to find a LIAT employee to check in and get boarding passes. The transfer service desk was unstaffed and personnel from other airlines told us that they had no idea when a LIAT representative would show. Exited the secure area and checked in at the painfully slow and incompetently staffed check-in counter. The other half waited at the customer service desk inside the airport and checked in when a LIAT representative finally decided to show her face. At the check-in counter I checked in without issue though the computer crashed multiple times. Our 14.50 flight ended up leaving the ground around 16:40. Needless to say we missed our one-hour connection in Antigua. We were livid. Our plane was the largest in LIAT's fleet - an ATR-72. Nice enough clean and comfortable. No beverage or food service but at this point that was not unexpected. Landing in ANU we were informed that although we had missed our ANU-DOM flight the airline ""graciously"" scheduled another flight to take us to DOM. There was a single LIAT employee or so it seemed in the entire terminal – we initially encountered her at the desk that dealt with passengers in transit. There was a line at this desk that reached out the door of the terminal and onto the tarmac as people needed to get boarding passes for this new flight. The new ANU-DOM flight was scheduled for 18:30 but we were not surprised when we took off at 19:00. The plane was on an old Bombardier.

Check in at Lufthansa at new Terminal 2 Heathrow at 06.00 in morning chaotic and lengthy - lots of passengers, too few check-in staff, check in equipment seemed not to be functioning well. Transfer at Frankfurt is complicated and long, compared with for example, Schipol, but better than Paris. All flights pretty full - but full compliments to Lufthansa cabin crew, very friendly and attentive given busy short haul flights. Complete punctuality. Also, a nice touch that pilot comes out of cockpit to say goodbye to passengers at end of flight. In contrast to Heathrow, check in at Barcelona extremely quick and efficient.

Some flights were with City line subsidiary some with Lufthansa mainline. City line is better in terms of seat comfort (2-2 on Embraer aircraft plus good seat pitch) but no hot meal service. Lufthansa serves hot meal but seating is crowded and provides less comfort. Also City line crews mostly look disinterested. Ticket prices looked excellent value for money. A big letdown was Frankfurt airport experience. Not a single time had we embarkation or disembarkation via finger. Long bus rides only. To add insult to injury when boarding via bus they never used bus gates. We had 5 flights downstairs from Z gates designated for A380 only to stand for 25 minutes on the apron waiting for the bus to pick us up.

Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller.

Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.

All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the A330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the A380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. MAS now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their A330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for MAS would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money. I would not hesitate to fly with them.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

meridiana,/airline-reviews/meridiana,Meridiana customer review,A Smith,United Kingdom,2012-09-03,Disgraceful to tell people with children and babies to check in two hours before a flight to keep them waiting one hour for staff to turn up which ultimately delayed the flight. Found Meridiana staff disinterested in passengers and more concerned with how they were looking in as much as they allowed the passenger sitting outside of me to keep two large bags at her feet which made it almost impossible for me to get out. This happened on our flight to Florence and back to Gatwick where this practise seemed the norm. Curtains used to divide classes were not drawn back before landing and the passenger in front of me was not reminded to bring his seat upright on landing.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,2014-10-31,KUL-ADL return out on 18 Oct and return on 25 Oct. Outbound flight was a red eye. On the outbound sector service was generally good albeit a little perfunctory by a male flight attendant who was occasionally a little rushed and gruff. Otherwise the rest of the staff were great. In contrast to previous journeys there was no rush to get the meal service over. There was a good choice of wine and spirits. Inflight entertainment was extensive but not to my liking but that's a personal choice. They supply you with a duvet pillows and a rather sad amenity bag which is embarrassingly cheap and tacky (apart from the creams and moisturizers). The seat is angled flat and is terrible for sleep. I am 183 cm tall and was constantly sliding down and ended up setting the chair at an armchair recline to try and get some sleep. The return flight was great just 6 people in business class so there was lots of attention and the attendants were truly warm and friendly . They got it right in that they were unobtrusive but yet managed to keep their eye on your glass and plate offering second helpings of food and topping up wine regularly. I used the book-the-cook service and my main meal of nasi lemak was just okay nothing special. Bear in mind that nasi lemak out of Adelaide is not to be recommended! Generally I was quite satisfied apart from the angled-flat seats. MAS do something about these seats in your A330's!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,2,5,3,3,NA,NA,5,1

Old 340-300 no USB chargers a terrible screen late departure and arrival without explanation and dinner was served by only 2 teams for the entire economy class one by aisle which means that we in the back (row 42 of 27 or so) got ours an hour after they began. This also meant on a 7 hour flight that there was little time between dinner and breakfast. In flight entertainment is pretty poor - 3 weeks between the flights and they were still showing the same episodes of TV shows.

We have just arrived back from Hurgada - 'Gatwick'. The outbound flight on 13 March was fine only a few issues namely the severe lack of entertainment on board for a five hour flight and the ever changing price of an extra leg room seat which went from £30 online to £ £7 in the airport then back up to £15 on board. Our return flight was where the major issues started. Firstly the flight which took 5 hours on the way there was now going to take nearly 7 hours to return. We then sat on the tarmac for around 45 mins before finally taking off. After all of the waiting we then were told rather abruptly that the runway was closed at Gatwick and therefore we had to fly to Luton! We found it hilarious that all other flights managed to land at Gatwick with the 'runway closed' and also that Luton is Monarchs head quarters. We believe they had absolutely no intention of ever landing at Gatwick. Monarch staff were not present once we arrived as I imagine they simply couldn't be bothered to help us in any way. The handing agents Menzies were to organise the coaches. We were made to queue at a check in desk and told two coaches were ordered but that we would be taken to Gatwick on a first come first served basis! Bearing in mind there were 300 people on our flight. At no time were we given any vouchers or even a cup of water and we couldn't leave the queue as this may mean we would miss out on a place on the coach. When the coaches did arrive we had been waiting for over an hour and then had to tolerate the hour and a half coach trip to Gatwick. We were due to arrive at Gatwick at 9pm on Friday we actually arrived at 2am on Saturday. We have never experienced such a thing and we travel up to 7 times a year.

Flight was delayed by an hour which although it sounds bad we made up time and landed only 5-10 minutes late. The plane although it is old it was perfectly fine and the seats were in brilliant condition. You are supplied with a clean fleecy blanket and pillow which are very comfortable. The flight was good meal service was served twice and rubbish collections were frequent. The only negative would be the in-flight entertainment as there are no seatback TV's only in the aisle movies are old and bad quality. But I brought my tablet and watched some movies on there which were perfectly fine.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,J Singh,Australia,2014-01-20,Melbourne to Paris return in Business. First time in Business on Malaysia. Previous experiences with airline had been mixed. Overall their Business product doesn't have the polish of Emirates or Singapore but is a satisfactory alternative given the price. 777 MEL-KUL A380 KUL-CDG-KUL and then A330 KUL-MEL. 777 is aged but found it very comfortable (more so than the much newer A330). A380 was spacious and seat was good. A330 seemed more cramped than either 777 or A380 and lacked privacy. All flights had good service. Food varied from good to excellent and there was always plenty of it. IFE was a weak spot with not much of any interest to me. Lounges too were mediocre even in KLIA which surprised me being home base. However despite all this given that the cost of the ticket was substantially less than any other carrier and comparable to China Southern it represents good value and would happily fly them again.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

On the flight out the aircraft was clean but the seats were very hard and on the flight out the staff had a poor level of English (no manners). The worst part was the new inflight system the touch screen was poor at responding to input on both flights. Regarding food they only had pasta left by the time they had reached us.

The seats are narrow not cushioned no legroom nowhere to store anything eg sweets magazines. I am 6"" and 13.5 stone. My head was above the seats my knees touched the seat in front and there is just no room.

I specifically booked a flight which was supposed to be leaving Manchester Airport at 2pm on 11th May 2014. A few days before we were due to fly we received a telephone call to say that the flight had been put to 5.30 pm which we were not very happy about. When we arrived at the airport we were informed at check in that the flight would not be leaving until 7.40 pm. We eventually departed at 8.45 pm 6 hours and 45 minutes after our original time. Most of the other passengers were grumbling and it seemed pretty clear that the original flight of 2pm had been taken off. We finally arrived at our hotel at 2 am local time after setting off from our home at 2 pm the previous day. The seats were so closely packed together that my knees were up against the seat in front we could barely get the trays down in front of us and it was impossible to recline the seats as that would have given no room for the people behind us. To add to this the stewards wheeling the trolleys met right against our seats and were there for about 20 minutes constantly opening the metal doors to get out items and letting the doors bang against our seats.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,2,4,0,NA,NA,2,0

In fact there seemed to be more babies and toddlers in this cabin than elsewhere on the aircraft! Overall the flight was fine which is probably about as much as you can hope for in Y class. Crew were efficient food was adequate although I'd have preferred sandwiches and a piece of fruit in the snack pack rather than peanuts and cookies.

I fly with Monarch once or twice a year on this route and have for over 5 years. Cannot fault the airline planes are clean comfortable and more or less new. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. About 3 years ago my flight was cancelled due to snow in the UK which is understandable. Monarch dealt with the situation well and put me up in a hotel free of charge for a flight the next morning; brilliant.

I wasn't expecting luxury but when the lady in front of me reclined her seat immediately after take off my journey became very uncomfortable. This wasn't helped by the seat pitch being very small in the first place and the pocket on the seat being bent and broken and digging into my knees for the whole flight. This was a morning flight so there was no need to recline. I would suggest to Monarch if they insist on packing so many people in and having small seat pitches to follow in the steps of EasyJet and have seats that don't recline as unfortunately it seems that many people can't get to grips with good manners and common decency. Just think would you be happy if somebody did that to you! Easy really.

ORD-FRA was supposed to be on 747-8 and I booked this flight specifically for this aircraft but they downgraded to normal 747 in the last minute. This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines. Arrival at DEL was a mess with business and first class bags off-loaded last which annoyed premium paying passengers. Only highlight really was LH Senator Lounge in FRA which was very nice.

SYD-KUL flight was on an aged B777-200 with small television screens and old broken seats. KUL-SYD flight was on a fairly new A330-300. The return flight landed 30 minutes late primarily due to the fact that it took the ground crew an hour to board the plane. On both flights the cabin crew were rude surly and inefficient. The food was generally appalling especially the sausage roll served two hours before landing and poorly planned with wine served mid morning and tea served in the afternoon. Drink runs were lacking on the both flights especially the return flight where I had to suggest that the cabin crew make one and even then they missed several rows of seats. The KUL-LGK-KUL flights were both serviced by extremely old B737-400. The fact that MAS still operates these planes is a disgrace. The interior was extremely dated the seats were broken and the air conditioner works poorly on the ground. The return flight landed 45 minutes late in KUL due to problems with the air conditioner. The cabin crew were younger and generally more pleasant on these flights. Overall MAS is inconsistent the cabins are dirty and I am baffled how it achieved the 5 star airline status.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,1,4,NA,NA,2,0

KL-BNE was day flight. Took off at 10am and the first meal service was 2 sandwiches and some fruit. There was then no other food served until 2 hours from Brisbane. What food was served was of a good quality but why it wasn't the other way around in terms of meals I really couldn't understand. Considering it is a reasonably new product I was very disappointed by the seat on the A330. It is narrow hard and doesn't got flat which on the night flight back from Brisbane makes a huge difference I think MAS are good and the value for money was very good but this is not a 5 star airline not even close.

There were a few issues with leg room my other half is 6' 2"" tall man and his poor knees were rubbing against the plastic of the chair in front. We had to return early for health reasons and I booked seats over the phone for that day to get back home and insisted that he have an extra leg room seat.

The plus side of this is we complained to the crew on the plane that we paid for an extra leg room seat the ladies were fantastic and gave him a seat up front. The flight was much more comfortable for the 3 of us because my daughter and I had the middle 3 seats to ourselves. I do have to say that the crew on both flights were very pleasant.

Little information from the airline and all of it conflicting including the reason given by the captain once airborne. No apology of course. After some hours at the airport most passengers bussed off like livestock to a dismal meal in a barn of a dining hall at a local resort hotel.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,J Teoh,Australia,2013-11-10,LHR-KUL-SYD in Business class. LHR-KUL on the A380. Check-in agent at LHR very friendly and advised of fast-track through security and location of lounge. First class lounge (due to OneWorld Emerald status) very nice with great views of the tarmac and having a good selection of food at the buffet stand. A-la-carte menu was of excellent quality. The staff at the lounge were very helpful friendly and accommodating making the experience a complete pleasure. Priority boarding not quite what it should be as there is a boarding gate for business class passengers and economy passengers on the upper deck who board together and a separate boarding gate for first class passengers and economy passengers on the lower deck. Despite this boarding was relatively quick orderly and efficient. Non-alcoholic pre- departure drinks offered. Flight was delayed due to a crew member being injured prior to departure and they had to wait for a replacement crew to arrive. Seat was very comfortable in both the sitting and flat positions. There was also plenty of storage space for personal items. Good selection of IFE with a reasonable amount of latest releases. Cabin crew were excellent on this sector. They were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Pre-ordered meal through their Chef-on-call service was honoured. Quality of meals on this sector was quite good. Flight arrived late into KUL but some time was made up in the air. However it meant that the connection for the flight to SYD was still a bit tight. KUL-SYD was on a new A330-300. This flight was held back to ensure that connecting passengers and their luggage made it onto the flight which was much appreciated. Cabin crew again were great on this flight. My pre- ordered meal was honoured and it was excellent. This was probably the best steak I've ever had in the air! The satay of course was excellent. IFE similar to what was on offer on the A380 flight from LHR to KUL. The seat is comfortable in the sitting position but not so much in the angled flat position. Storage space for personal items is very poor on these seats. Flight arrived an hour late into SYD. Check-in luggage did make it through but did not come out first. However I was just glad that the luggage made it to SYD.

I discovered I could use QF first lounge in SYD as a Emerald member great experience as always. service between SYD KUL SYD are better than medium haul such as KUL-PEK and PVG-KUL. KUL-CGK-KUL legs are okay but nothing special. For 2 hours flights it is okay. No toiletry bags was distributed for 6 hours flight from KUL to PEK. PVG-KUL leg was not great one of staff in business class was really unprofessional. I ordered chef on demand when I booked my ticket but seem they mixed up my booking. Never mind the staff member was really unprofessional could not care less it is airline mixed up the meals. The flight could not land in KL due to the bad weather. We have to land in Penang and waited for two more hours. First lounge in KL is good but so dated. I think MH is going to do some renovation. Seats are not great you can only have 3 positions and not designed for lounging only for sit and sleep. It was a much better trip than my previous trip with MH.

First flight cancelled with minimal notice - was emailed 8 hours in advance but did not see and arrived Don Meaung with option to go via Ubon or get money back at later date and make own way there. Chose Ubon option with a handful of other passengers but Nok did the bear minimum of point to point transfer so people were being dropped off in Buriram airport with no public transport and 35km from town 3.5 hours later than due. We ended up taking another passenger to town in our car as a courtesy to him not the airline as he would have been stranded. Return flight learned lesson and checked email evening before. Flight brought forward 2 hours with no explanation. No contact on issues other than email so if not had checked would have missed flight. Catching a flight on Thai Air Asia (on time) from Don Meaung to Chiang Mai later that evening all 7 Nok Air flights departing i noticed had various delays from 20 minutes to 65 minutes.

This was the worst flight I have experienced. Only one check in for 400 people at Barbados plane left one hour late and all boarded at once up one set of steps. Evening meal serves at 10.30pm and no second cups of tea or coffee available. Very cramped seating and aisles so narrow you had to walk sideways. Sudden diversion for emergency landing at Santiago Spain to get medical assistance for sick passenger.

nok-air,/airline-reviews/nok-air,Nok Air customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,3 flights over Christmas/New Year between Bangkok and Buriram all had problems. Nok Air have increased their frequency to daily on this route but as a result have over stretched themselves if any issues occur. Flight 1 - originally booked for 23/12 emailed 3 days before to say flight was cancelled due to weather forecast but managed to get rebooked on to next day flight instead. However flight was full and found last row of seats in saab plane has reduced legroom so not happy. 2/1 - Buriram to Bangkok. Flight due to take off at 3.30 took off 5pm. No information provided about delay to any passengers from Nok air staff about delay or when incoming aircraft likely to arrive - dependant on information on internet instead. Buriram - Bangkok 5/1 worst of the 3. No information about issues until arrive at airport. Told flight cancelled - after much arguing between all passengers and staff offered alternative of flight to Ubon and then minibus back to Buriram with cost of ticket refunded. Originally scheduled to arrive 3.10 arrived Buriram at 11pm instead. Very disappointed with Nok Air this trip not only with issues but with lack of honesty about cause and information on delays being provided in an accurate manner. The issues have arisen due to one of the leased aircraft developing a major fault causing numerous cancellations and knock-on delays but would like to have been told this. Being a big supporter of Nok Air previously I am disappointed by this.

No queue for check-in due to very few people in the airport. Slightly dubious the luggage scales were correct given a subsequent Air Asia flight and had to pay 400 bht for a couple of kilos extra luggage - not a big deal given the price of the flights booked (1100 bht all in) but disappointing none the less in hindsight.

No consideration given to people with babies and young kids. Boarding was a free for all resulting in congestion once on the aircraft. FA's were efficient but that was all. No smiles no interaction just the bare minimum. Food was good but the portions were small. Since it was a night flight they took too a long time serving the evening meal and that cut down on sleep time in what was a flight of 6 hours and 45 minutes.

Not a long queue for check in at Gatwick and staff were all friendly and polite (even no problem with overweight baggage)! I had read some bad reviews on the Dreamliner 'technical problems' and substitutions of old Euro Atlantic 777 planes but was relieved when I got to gate 19 and saw EI-LNB Dreamliner sitting there. No delays at all and cabin crew very welcoming. Window dimming system is a nice idea and blocks out the sun quite well. Inflight entertainment is pretty good couple of older films and not that much for kids though. All flight attendants were great and reassured us during turbulence. The LED system was used well. The food was really good but for the 'snack' the cheese and onion sandwich didn't tempt me (the muffin was tasty though).

Finally at 1.30ish we got news that the flight was delayed as the plane was broken and they had to wait for another plane to take us to Las Palmas. They were hoping to get us boarded by 3pm. Got the call to go to the gate at 3 when we got on the plane we sat on the runway for 2 hours cause they had to wait for fuel. The staff were nice enough on the plane but by that point everyone on the flight was annoyed and irate after being delayed for 9 hours. It was meant to be the Dreamliner but of course it wasn't. Coming back we were delayed by 20 mins which was fine considering what we had entitled on the way there. If you get the Dreamliner it's a really nice plane with comfy seats and plenty leg room but I for one will never be flying with this company again.

I really wish I could give Porter Airlines a better rating. They have nice planes great staff the lounges are wonderful but their reliability makes me hesitant to use them again. More's the pity because it could be the best airline in North America. The flight from Newark to Toronto was on time and the service was faultless. On arrival in Toronto all looked okay for the next leg to Sudbury but then that flight was cancelled because of maintenance issues. I was shifted to a later flight scheduled to depart four hours later but was delayed by a further two hours. Many other flights were also delayed. Credit goes to the cabin crew on this flight for maintaining a positive demeanour despite being faced with a very grumpy passenger load. Based on comments I heard on the aircraft and have read on here cancellations and long delays have become commonplace at Porter. I think this airline is perhaps growing too fast and its aircraft inventory is too small to cope with anything but one of those extremely rare days when nothing goes wrong. It really needs to focus more on reliability.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,5,5,0,NA,NA,4,0

The flying experience is a great improvement the check-in counter and flight crew were professional. My only suggestion for PAL is to make seats more comfortable and to place personal built-in IFE on every seats at least on international flights if they want to compete with other international carriers. The iPad IFE doesn't look like a good idea especially at long haul ergonomically. Traditional seat-installed IFE is still the best way to go.

The IFE was extremely limited with small grainy screens and within 40 minutes of the 11 hour flight one of the few lavatories was shut down due to the sink facet stuck to the on position. All the above can be somewhat expected with a low cost charter airline however what was must alarming was their flight attendants. On such a long flight they only appeared in economy about every four hours. Of course they were present for the pre-flight speech and then reappeared about an hour later to ""toss"" box lunches to each passenger then quickly pick up the trays (I say quickly because the majority of passengers took one bite and knew instinctively to not eat the meal). After that we did not see another FA for four hours. There was no drink service but we saw many passengers going to the empty galley and figuring out how to open the cabinets searching for water bottles and soda. There were children running and playing tag in the aisles and around the lavatories. Our flight two weeks earlier on a Norwegian 787 from FLL-CPH was wonderful. Great service free wine in economy (we did pay for the seat/luggage/meal package) and a nice IFE system.

It was my first trip on them and I would fly them again. For starters my ticket was very inexpensive so that is always a plus. It was actually less expensive on Philippine Air than some of the other local budget carries and I got to check a bag for free. Departed Manila on time and arrived in Osaka about 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Meal was Japanese Curry Beef which was tasty and the mango jelly that came with it was delicious. The one disappointing thing is only one drink service but they did give me the entire can of soda so can't complain about that. During my stay in Osaka I got the news of typhoon heading towards the Philippines so I decided to change the ticket last minute to get back earlier and the change fee was only 100 USD which in this day and age is amazing. There was also no increase in fare. The crew on the flight home did a really commendable job as the circumstances they were dealing with could have been trying. I have never been on a flight where the seat belt sign was on almost the entire time it was 4 hours of bumps turbulence and grabbing the seat handles but the crew despite being interrupted 3 times and having to return to their seats were able to complete their meal service clean up and duty free. I had the pork dish which wasn't bad and the fruit platter was refreshing and quite good. I am a big fan of their inflight entertainment concept - they don't have the usual movie screens (at least not on the A330) but instead you can stream from their library right into your tablet laptop or MAC however their library left a lot to be desired. I really think their system is the new way to go but they need to improve the selection of films. They also offer in flight WiFi but I did not use. I'm not sure what their selection is like on their long haul flights but they could upgrade to some more modern movies on the short international routes. They're not the best airline in Asia I've flown but they're not that far behind either. The food was good service good and planes clean.

After further delays she eventually left Thunder Bay on Porter flight 638 at 21.29 and was diverted to Hamilton during the last stages of landing just minutes before 23.00. The diversion is due to a curfew on landing and taking off from Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport. Our issue is that Porter Airline did not communicate to passengers that the flight would be diverted. Porter did not inform those waiting to pick up passengers at Billy Bishop Airport. Airport was closed at 23.00 and no staff were present. The family member sent to Billy Bishop Airport was left searching for our daughter. We eventually found that the flight was diverted to Hamilton and that our daughter took a shuttle bus to Union Station in downtown Toronto. Sometime after 02.00 am a local hotel was arranged where she stayed for a few short hours before making her way to the Billy Bishop Airport for her connecting flight.

precision,/airline-reviews/precision,Precision Air customer review,Nick Francis,NA,2007-01-09,Precision is a subsidiary of Kenya Airways and operates flights out of Dar Es Salaam and Nairobi. Recently flew with them (as offered by our travel agent) connecting between Nairobi and Zanzibar. I was pleasantly surprised on both occasions having never heard of them before. Trip out of NBO left bang on time. Invited to identify our bag on the tarmac before boarding (it really is a massive weight off one's mind to see your bag being physically loaded onboard)! The crew while not the most friendly of ladies were nevertheless very efficient. Flew on an ATR-72 which was a little bit noisy and with leg-room at an abolsolute premium I wouldn't want to be stuck onboard for too long! However outbound was mid-morning and we were offered soft drinks and a very generous pack of cashews. The return was early morning so we had a really very passable continental breakfast box (croissant roll honey butter juice) and plenty of tea coffee and soft drinks. We were able to check our luggage right through to Heathrow in Zanzibar which was a real blessing. Do note though that if begining a long-haul journey out of a more rural African airport connecting in Nairobi it's almost ALWAYS necessary to collect a boarding pass at the transit desk at Jomo Kenyatta (NBO). Tip: if flying with Precision try and nab a seat as near to the rear as possible - you'll get off first and beat the masses to the desk! Would definitely travel with Precision again for the excellent time-keeping if for nothing else!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

philippine-airlines,/airline-reviews/philippine-airlines,Philippine Airlines customer review,D Jones,United Kingdom,2014-08-20,I am a regular business class traveler on the London - Manila sector and was happy that Philippine Airlines introduced a direct flight from London to Manila. Travelled on the London - Manila - London sectors several times from early December 2013 and was generally happy with the 777 comfort. However my recent journey from Manila to London was terrible. Evidently Philippine Airlines started using 15 year old A340 planes on the route in early August that appears to be part of the problem - slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality Middle Eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the in-seat media system - understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. Very basic food compared to alternative carriers. Philippine Airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for $500 which is then $500 less than a business ticket purchased online. Advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full - presumably passengers took the $500 check in upgrade. Philippine Airlines need to decide whether it wants to be a budget or premium player in the airline business. Needless to mention that I will not travel again with Philippine Airlines on the London - Manila route.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,2,2,2,1,NA,NA,1,0

I flew Philippine airlines Jakarta to Manila and Manila to London on July 5 2014. The latter leg is a 14.5 hour flight. Having read some of the reviews on this site I was an exceptionally reluctant flier and in fact protested belatedly at the choice of airline. I will be apologising to my agent for my complaints. The service on the flight was exceptional staff were professional courteous and always helpful in spite of some difficult requests (I chose to anticipate change in time zones by sleeping and eating at all the wrong times). The food was great wine was good cabin and toilets spotless. Although the seats don't recline all the way it is flat bed at a slight angle and perfectly acceptable for sleeping. They have a relatively sparse choice of inflight movies and shows only somewhat compensated for with loan iPads for the flight with additional choices so if are a big consumer of inflight entertainment it may be worth bringing your own especially given the length of the flight. Both flights were on time transfer at Manila faultless if surprisingly personal (escort for most of it) - this in spite of only a 1hour 10 minute layover. Check-in at Jakarta is through a dedicated business class channel which includes immigration. In all a great experience.

I had lamb kofta one way and lamb tagine the other. Even ice creams and chocolates were distributed after the main course - nice touches for economy class. Inflight entertainment better than average. Negatives were that both flights left around half an hour late with limited announcements and no obvious cause for delays other than the ""late arrival of the incoming flight"" mantra which airlines love bandying about these days. I'm not aware of being late to your last appointment being an acceptable excuse for being late to your next one in any other form of human activity. The other negative is the Qantas approach to pre-booked online seating. The tactic seems to be to open up very few seats in the hope that you will select an emergency exit at extra cost. I am happy so long as I have an aisle seat which took a bit of negotiation both flights and meant sitting next to the rear toilets.

The flight was of course late out of GLT but at every intermediate port there was no effort from flight or ground crews to make up time.

They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port!

Had pre-booked at a cost of 25AUD per person to allocate seats 75D and 75E. Checked in with no problems but at boarding gate were advised our seats had been re-allocated. We made the point that we had actually pre-booked and paid for the seat allocation and were a bit put out that we had been selected to be moved when in all probability there were other passengers on the flight who had not gone to the trouble of pre-booking seats. Apparently a family wished to be accommodated together. The clerk at the counter gave us our new boarding passes row 88. We said we were happy as long as they were not next to the toilets. We don't make a habit of sitting near toilets in restaurants or airplanes hence the reason we paid the money to pre-book allocation. The clerk checked on his monitor and categorically assured us they were not next to toilets. Having boarded the aircraft we realized we were duped. Row 88 is the farthest row back and is sandwiched between two toilets. Furthermore the seats have limited recline. They are also immediately in front of a bulkhead behind which is situated some form of noisy refrigeration unit for the self service galley area immediately behind us. We were not provided with equivalent seats for which we had paid. More to the point they were arguably the worst seats on the plane. The constant noise from the flushing toilets and refrigeration unit made it impossible to intelligibly listen to any IFE. My partner was very upset at the reallocated seats and credit to the cabin crew they were sympathetic towards our situation and indeed was not their fault.

Also in the car before my the previous flight (Sydney-London) I was delighted to receive an expletive-laden tirade across the driver's radio - apparently from one of his colleagues having a bad day.

On arrival in Sydney mine were among the last (both turning up on the carousel a full 50 minutes after landing; I do not remember the timing in London). 3) The breakfast. Scrambled eggs were dry. Avocado was unripe. Pancakes were also dry and overcooked. Coffee was weak and burnt. That is all. 4) The champagne. Qantas advertises three varieties.

Both legs delayed by at least an hour though boarding on-time. Was worried about connection at Doha but assured nothing to worry about as we had made up the lost hour. At Doha circled for over 30 mins before landing. Airport (state of the art new Hamad hub airport) in chaos due to smog. Face masks required all though airport! I have never experienced this in my life time. In-flight entertainment system excellent as are food and drinks services. This is an airline where staff appear happy in their jobs. On both legs one cooked meal (delicious) then one snack ( a wrap or a pasty) handed out. During flight soft drinks and snacks available. Good choice of free alcoholic drinks too including champagne by request.

The aircraft the Saab 340 was really comfortable and ideal for the 40 minute flight. I was really delighted to be greeted by the captain and solo flight attendant at the entrance of the aircraft and on both sectors.

I used to live in Wagga Wagga and regularly used Rex and it was fine then. Now I only use it to fly from Moruya where we have a second home to Sydney and it is always a really unpleasant experience. The check-in and gate lounge staff are really rude at Sydney (every trip it is the same) and the flight attendants are unpleasant and seem untrained. At Moruya the ground staff always seem very unprofessional. Last time (late January 2015) we had to fly to Moruya via Merimbula and were told to leave our hand-luggage on board and so I left a magazine on board. When I returned it had disappeared. I went up to speak to the flight attendant anxious whether cleaners might have removed it and taken it into the terminal and we might take off without it. She ignored me for several minutes before finding it (she had removed it - although we had booked the same seats right through of course - and the plane wasn't full so she should even have remembered us!) and returning it without a word of apology. I am hanging out for the day when another airline services Moruya and I never have to fly Rex again. We could get to Moruya from our home airport of Melbourne via Merimbula and a drive from there but instead we choose to fly to Canberra with any other airline and drive from there as we hate flying Rex so much.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

rossiya-airlines,/airline-reviews/rossiya-airlines,Rossiya Airlines customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2015-06-07,I used Rossiya around 30-35 times within last 12 months due to frequent trips to St Petersburg where Rossiya has its home base. Some good things happened due to integration of Rossiya and Aeroflot ground handing. Aeroflot is a quite civilized business so they taught Rossiya check in staff how to organize check in and how to politely serve customers. Ticket office services even despite coming to Aeroflot brand remain slow and helpless with insufficient staffing. Online services have all migrated to aeroflot.ru so all work fine. For some reason Rossiya still maintains its own website (quite shabby though) but clicking to check in or ticket purchase will all lead to aeroflot.ru. Inflight experience is well deserved 2 star with every effort put not to allow it to become 3 star. Meal service is the worst in the air (inedible sandwich plus cup of tea/coffee that are better not to taste). Bring your own food and drink from the airport. Their aircraft are second hand A319 with median age about 20 years or same aged B767-300 where seat configuration is 2-4-2. Toilets are old type (non-vacuum) so some terrible smells have accumulated within their lifetime. Legroom is non-existent on every plane type so I always try to get seat in emergency row. Seat comfort is the worst part of travel with them. Unbearable and painful if you're on a long flight. The crews are old soviet style. Even younger ones miss normal modern communication skills. Their English is usually incomprehensible so I don't get how foreign passengers can get flight info or even being communicated with. But there is one strong reason why this company is 2 star not 1 star. They are always on time. Not a single flight I was on have been more than 5-7 minutes late. Never. So that's why they fairly deserve their strong 2 star rating.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,3,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

I like the Saab 340 and also now generally prefer REX to Qantaslink partly because of the use of pop music over the PA system on Qantaslink these days. Remarkably quick baggage collection at REX in Terminal 2 at Sydney Airport partly because I suppose one has to travel by tarmac bus from the aircraft parked at very remote stands from this terminal and that takes some time.

Unlike another airline that completely mishandled my bookings Qantas called me regularly rescheduled flights quickly and allowed free changes to connecting flights that I couldn't make because of a problem with a different airline. That's generally the biggest plus about Qantas - their customer service and ground organisation is efficient and problems are generally resolved quickly. Inflight the experience was good with nothing special. Medium-quality food. Service appears to improved drastically compared to a few years ago.

This new position was noisy (engine) and dreadful in turbulence because you are so close to the tail. I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request ""for technical reasons"" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen. My guess is that as a solo traveller I was probably moved to accommodate a group of two or more travellers that left there checking in and seat reservations until the last minute.

I had to go back to my hotel and come back the following day only to find the flight times had been changed twice. When I did eventually get on the plane the interior was in a pitiful state and the flight staff were appalling. Never again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0
qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,J Keep,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,LHR – DOH – MAA return on 21st – 31st December ’14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It’s fair to say that our impression of Qatar’s in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average – all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha – Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we’d been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it’s 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats. The fact that its such a small section of economy makes it feel pretty exclusive too. In economy? Fly the A380 if you can!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,4,1

Fast and efficient check in in Bangkok the Express Lane saved a lot of time getting through Immigration and Security. Everything went well and was on time. Cabin attendants were attentive and the food and presentation up to my expectations for Business Class. Good meal and friendly service between Bangkok and Brunei (Cabin was full). From Brunei it was the new Dreamliner with its comfortable and a flat bed. Dinner was good and the movie selection was OK but not outstanding. At around half the cost of Thai or Qantas Business Class it represents exceptional value. Royal Brunei does not serve alcohol on the flights so have a drink in Melbourne or Bangkok before the flight. The will allow you to take a small bottle on board and drink it on the first sector.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,G Thomas,Australia,2014-03-28,QF35 Melbourne to Singapore. I have been travelling this leg with Qantas for over 15 years and normally travel business class as I did on this occasion. I can tell you that the seats have improved but that is about it. The amenities kit is a waste of money. I do use them normally but compared with the past Qantas could save money and not start to replicate the type of services that they use on jet star. I would also suggest they get back to basics with the menu and ditch Neil Perry. The inflight entertainment range is getting smaller and smaller and if you are a regular traveller like me it starts to become tedious. My loyalty to Qantas once rock solid is I'm afraid no longer. Emirates is now my first choice. I should add the staff on this flight were great but only as good as the tools they are given to use.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,5,5,2,4,NA,NA,3,0
qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2014-03-28,BNE-SYD-SCL (Santiago) -SYD-BNE. Superb flights. Qantas seems to me to have recently undergone a 'mood change' with a noticeable enhancement of service. Best aspects of this particular trip were the First Class Lounge at Sydney the American Airlines Admirals Club (which Qantas uses) at Santiago the excellent food and wines but above all the superb service despite a very full aircraft. If you get a good Qantas cabin crew you will get some of the world's best. Perhaps a word should also be said for the level of engineering and technology that we take for granted these days: it simply amazes me that an aircraft (747-400 in this case) can transport us accurately for 14 hours non-stop over the remote Antarctic Ocean in absolute comfort and safety and also arrive at destinations within one minute of scheduled times - incredible.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Use of lounges and fast-track service at both airports due to OneWorld elite status. Seat for day flight to SIN was comfortable. IFE system a bit on the old side but there was a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Meal was tasty and of a good portion. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Return flight to SYD was an overnight flight. Seat not great for sleeping as legroom not quite enough. Maybe another 1-2"" of pitch would have made all the difference.

CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER quite a new plane great IFE with very big screen on time departure and early arrival in Doha very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600 to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple) due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777 service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed.

The real bonus was flying in the B787 Dreamliner which was operating all the way from London Heathrow to Melbourne and from Brunei to London. The service on the B777 was also good. The staff were on the move providing water and fruit drinks to pax all night long.

Good service free wine and reasonable food for economy. On one flight I boarded with an upset stomach and the flight attendant brought me some quality white wine from business class which helped enormously. Generally very full flights but on-time departures. I especially appreciated the careful route track selection to avoid headwinds on the westbound flights and to take advantage of these strong westerly winds for the eastbound flights meaning all flights either arrived exactly on time or were early. The Perth Qantas Club lounge is huge but at peak hour is still somewhat difficult to find space to sit down. Qantas have very annoying and intrusive people mover buggies sounding their warning sirens while moving around their Brisbane terminal (also the same in Sydney and Melbourne) - and mostly just transporting crew and friends about - what's wrong with a bell or soft honking horn as is the case in terminals such as Hong Kong?

Once it was time to board the line was ridiculous. Once on board the Boeing 767 I sat down and the seats were comfortable and reclined reasonably far. About 1hr into the flight they served dinner.

Huge difference from the superior A380 that used to ply this route - seats on the A330-300.were old IFE sets small and mine was not working properly for some reason. Upgrades are needed quickly lest Qantas loses out to other airlines on this route. Supper and breakfast service was ok nothing special. Cabin crew professional throughout. Coffee was atrocious. Arrived in Melbourne on time and bags on the luggage belt within half an hour. All in all decent service but could be much better.

Our only problem was the stopover in Casablanca on the outward flight as the transit lounge facilities are very poor insufficient seating and availability of food and drink was very limited. There are improvements being made at present but in the meantime we would avoid the route via Casablanca and book direct flights both ways. The staff were are all time polite and available.

Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all honesty isn't the best I’ve been in but as it was almost empty its OK to while away an hour or so plus they come and tell you when your gate is open. Unfortunately the usual carryon once in the departure area of people standing directly in front of the doors despite being told to sit down and wait for the announcements a few passengers tried to follow the wheelchairs through the doors. Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around.

I met cabin staff outside the restricted area and they told me that the glasses had been found and how to get them back. I fly with Royal Brunei once to twice a year to Bangkok and then return.

The Trans-Tasman service was the early business shuttle with a Jetconnect 737-800. Firstly the IFE itself was fantastic same provided on the A380. For a 3 hour flight it was more than satisfactory. The screen itself was large and at the perfect height for viewing. The seat itself was rather narrow and the seat pitch was rather narrow (and I have a height of 5ft 5!). However we can attribute this to the size of the aircraft. The Flight Attendants themselves were fantastic and were overall bright and cheerful for the early flight time despite one haughty young woman (no more than 20) who was leering and smile-less for the entire flight. When I merely asked her for a blanket and pillow she gave me a scowl as if it were the hardest thing for her to do. However the overall flight was great. On to the A380 service to HKG. The seat pitch was more than sufficient and the width was great. The IFE screen was large and had more than enough entertainment for the 9 hour flight. The Flight Attendants were bright and cheerful for the whole flight and the catering of lunch and pizza bread refreshment was hot and fresh - probably due to the introduction of induction ovens on the A380.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2014-01-09,Flew First from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai on A380 and was impressed by nearly all aspects of the trip. Check in at Sydney was a little chaotic as the First Class check-in area was overwhelmed by large families of Platinum members using the facility but then having the usual priority immigration and security available to premium travellers I enjoyed the Qantas First Class lounge. An enjoyable spa treatment. The food at the sit down restaurant was one of the best lounge restaurants I have been to. On board service was indeed First Class with staff making sure they knew all passengers by name and able to respond to any queries. The seat itself is comfortable and infinitely adjustable although the controls for it are rather complex and take a little time to get used to. Made up as a bed it is easy to get sleep with adequate privacy and space to sleep on one's side and upright it is good for relaxing eating and working. Inflight pyjamas were better than those provided by other airlines and the amenities kit more useful as well. The massage function is enjoyable although a bit noisy. Quality of food for dining was excellent although it would have been helpful to know that the supper menu either side of the Dubai transit was nearly identical. Large range of food items although I thought the dessert selection was rather poor and the champagne in the lounge was better than that inflight. Inflight entertainment system excellent with a good choice and high quality screen and headphones. Transit at Dubai is pleasant at the enormous Emirates First Class lounge although at the time I travelled the spa was closed and it wasn't entirely clear when the boarding announcement would be. On arrival at London we had the same experience as other travellers and it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive - hardly priority. As an added touch it was good to be able to use the AA Arrivals lounge for a shower and a quick cup of coffee before heading into town. An excellent experience competitive with others but unclear if it is good enough to justify the price premium over business.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,9,5,5,4,5,NA,NA,3,1

This leg room issue is made worse by the passenger in front of you if (s)he pushes the recliner back. With the recliner pushed back there is little space to enjoy the food. No wonder the movie monitor has great viewing tilt angle (top-bottom) as the screen gets so close to your face. 2) There is a rectangular shape power box on the floor between the middle seat and the aisle seat which forces your leg to be tilted while resting. You will need to place your foot at an off angle. (4) Rest room was very small so small that I couldn't even bend over to wash my face. No more Qantas!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,2,1,3,NA,NA,1,0
qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,R Mortara,United Kingdom,2014-01-02,HKG-SYD on an A380. Departure delayed due to an ill passenger having to be off loaded but the cockpit crew kept everyone informed of the situation. Seats are not the newest design but the airline supplies a duvet too fit over the cushions as well as pyjamas which really aid sleeping. The crew were very friendly and efficient making the trip all the more enjoyable. For example they got some balsamic vinegar for me as I could not use the dressing provided. My main gripe is about the food. The salad is just a few leaves and the main course I had amounted to a fancy Panini sandwich. Nice as it was it did not fit the business class image. Nor did breakfast which was a choice of either fruit one cinnamon cake or a spinach/cheese tart. Rather poor given you often get more in economy class on some routes. Baggage delivery at Sydney was quick which was good. All in all not bad for a first experience of Qantas but I think they really need to look at improving the food offerings on long haul judging by this flight.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,5,5,2,3,NA,NA,4,1

Additional baggage costs a rip off with other airlines you can pre-book an additional 23 kilo at reasonable cost or even pay a reasonable charge at the booking in desk.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2013-12-16,Santiago and back on Qantas (BNE-SYD-SCL-SYD-BNE) Premium Economy - another unusual and not very satisfying experience. Service was very mixed - some flight attendants excellent some seem to have been in their roles for too many years and were keen to show it. Food and wine very good on Qantas PE possibly the best globally. The Big problem was the domestic connection on return in Sydney - what a shambles. The return flight from SCL was just 10 minutes late but already being aware from their schedules that I had about 70 minutes to make domestic connections I made special effort to ensure I only had carry-on luggage would utilise my APEC card to assist rapid immigration and have an Express Pass as well. Despite being a Platinum Frequent Flyer having my boarding pass properly checked at the International Terminal Transit Area as being valid for my next flight and then arriving at the new departure gate at least 35 minutes before the scheduled boarding time (an hour before scheduled departure time) when I was finally boarding I was then abruptly bumped off the flight 'as the Qantas computer advised it would normally be too late for someone to make my connection and so they had allocated my seat to another passenger'. By then I had been 27 hours without sleep and had to struggle to find a seat on that flight or next flight. It was an awful experience overall and one wonders how the IT programming and scheduling guys at Qantas develop such a program that causes such a problem. A final point is that maybe it is time globally for it to be acceptable to tip airline flight attendants for good service if they provide it. Although we are all aware flight attendants are primarily on-board for safety reasons surely it would be possible to tip the service component of their duties and perhaps make them happier.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,3,5,3,NA,NA,4,0
qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,P Martin,Singapore,2014-06-08,Singapore-Athens via Doha return. Mix of aircraft 777-300er and A330-200 outbound returning on A320 and 787. Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand.

Qantas International First Lounge wonderful as always with excellent quality catering and very friendly staff. Priority boarding honoured on both flights. Seat was comfortable and there was a reasonable amount of legroom and recline. On-board catering was pretty good. Meals were of a decent portion and also tasty. Both flights were on time. Qantas Lounge in Singapore was nice with very friendly and helpful staff. Cabin crew reasonably good on the SYD-SIN leg (QF81) but they were great on the SIN-SYD leg (QF6). IFE was AVOD.

Online check-in was fine and worked well at LHR and the Premium Lounge at Heathrow is good with good service and decent food. LHR-DOH leg was on new Dreamliner and all-in-all pretty good. DOH-JNB leg was on a quite new Boeing 777. Service on both legs was very attentive and the food and drinks not bad if uninspiring and not as good as Emirates or SAA on the same LHR-JNB trip. Wine selection wasn't wide but acceptable. Seats were fine if a little narrower on the B777 and didn't fold into a completely flat bed which is disappointing and again not as good as Emirates but we did manage to sleep reasonably well. IFE was pretty good on all legs. Standards and aircraft on the return trips were the same but both departures from Doha were delayed; by 50 minutes on the return leg and by 55 minutes on the outbound 50 of which were spent sitting the tarmac. Doha airport is a mess with a quite long ""luxury"" bus trip from the Arrivals and the Premium Transfer Terminal. The Qatar lounge in the Premium Terminal at Doha is good if rather large and impersonal and Qatar use the Shongolo Lounge at JNB which is pretty good although a little in need of decoration at the far end near the windows.

First leg was a tired old A330-200 that has clearly seen better days. PTV is older- generation and is not touch-screen. The control buttons were built into the armest making it very difficult to use them. System was very slow and kept crashing. In the end I could not watch a movie. Dinner was a choice of chicken or fish and not bad at all. Drinks were a selection of soft drinks juices and alcoholic drinks. Service was very good. Crew were friendly and dedicated assisting passengers with young children. The second leg DOH-DXB was operated by an A320. Service was very rushed (usual chicken or veggie wrap and water or juice) but on the shorter legs no one cares. Overall a good experience despite the old A330-200s which should get refitted as soon as possible.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2013-10-29,SYD-HKG-SYD in Premium Economy - two of the most unusual flights I have ever had but which don't seem to fit the Travel Experience categories. Qantas has a great premium economy product: very good food and wines and generally excellent service in this part of the cabin. However on this set of flights I had unhappy experiences: for SYD- HKG I did not get my usual window seat preference even though I am a platinum frequent flyer. This is sort of ok but after take off I was asked to swap seats with someone who couldn't get his IFE to work which I was pleased to do but then found myself surrounded by a bunch of passengers who were it seems trying to drink as much alcohol as possible and who invited their mates up from the back of the plane to join in the party which generally took place in the isles or at the front of this cabin. This made for a terrible flight experience as one could neither work nor sleep due to the loud talking and calls for more drinks - which I was slightly surprised to see Qantas staff obligingly provided. On the return travel the staff at the boarding gate insisted on changing my boarding pass to give me one for someone of another name (it was a woman's name as well and I am not a woman) and then arguing with me that this other passenger was me! A bizarre and embarrassing experience to say the least especially as this also held up the boarding process for some time with other passengers glaring at me as if it was all my fault. My guess is that this boarding pass was for a woman who they had given my original seat to. Thankfully the situation was sorted out by a senior staff member as it turned out I was to be provided with a business upgrade - which was excellent.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,1

Staff were extremely professional towels and sweets handed out before take off meals promptly served upon departure cabin crew brought drinks regularly to customers etc. Touch screen IFE on the 77W was excellent though not as many choices as their Mid-East competitor Emirates. Smooth landing in Doha before midnight. Connected to QR 009 four hours later onto a A346 - service was once again excellent with regular drinks services and meals served promptly. The IFEs on the A346 were older but choices of movies the same as the 77W. Seats were once again comfortable but this time there was less legroom and seat width.

Boarding was fast at CDG and flight left on time. Service on this flight was excellent - crew brought drinks regularly meals were served as soon as flight departed Paris and snack was give before landing at Doha and always a smile on the faces of the crew as they went around the cabin. There was leg space and seat width on the A346 but luckily for me the flight was not full and I had a whole row to myself. IFEs were older but nevertheless selection of movies were good. Extremely smooth landing at Doha before scheduled arrival time transfer to the terminal took about 10 minutes but once inside was able to connect to my next flight to Singapore with time to spare (I had a 1 hour 25 minute transit). QR 938 to Singapore on newer B77L flight was even emptier than the last so another row to myself as well. Seats wider on this aircraft with lots of legroom. Service was excellent once again towels and sweets passed around drinks came regularly breakfast served after takeoff and snack served before arrival in Singapore. Flight landed ahead of time.

Late leaving Melbourne by 2 hours we missed the connection at Doha. Waiting at Doha airport gave me time to check the departure boards and every single plane was late departing. At times there were nine planes waiting to takeoff. We boarded our plane on time but then waited 70 minutes before it took off. It was a tired old A330 clean but hopeless AV system with controls fastened to the side of the seats which were difficult to operate. Immigration at LHR was prompt but we waited for more than an hour for our bags! Doha Airport just cannot handle the increased number of flights as Qatar Airways increases the number of flights.

As always when Qantas service is good it is unbeatable. Excellent service for the full business cabin from the mature crew especially the CSM.

When I checked in for return flight I used my Qmiles to upgrade to business class from Doha - Manchester so checked in at the business counter and discovered I'd been upgraded to Silver level so I was given access to the priority customers clearance and a pass to the business lounge a nice surprise. Just after boarding the senior cabin attendant came to see me and explained she was aware that my next flight was in business and that prior to landing in Doha she would move me to a seat closer to the business cabin so I could go on the business class but direct to the premium terminal. I spent 8 hours in Doha that the reason for the upgrade to business had a nice dinner followed by breakfast before boarding the flight.

Aircraft pretty clean seat pitch acceptable and no problem with understanding the public announcements which I have experienced differently on other airlines in the region. Safety demonstration okay although I wonder if the life jacket should have been shown as the flight was passing right over Victoria Lake. Flight left almost on time for the 70 minutes flight. Snack (sandwiches fruit salad muffin) served on board. Quality was okay for the length of the flight. Alcohol served free of charge. Professional and hard working crew (partly western) doing their job with a smile. Arrival and immigration procedures at KGL were efficient. KGL – EBB on a DHC8 previously operated by a Ethiopian carrier. Aircraft was clean. Only the seats were a bit older. Flight left even before scheduled departure time. Once again a professional crew serving drinks and peanuts on the fifty minutes flight.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2015-07-24,"Second round trip with Ryanair this year and all went fairly smoothly. Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members' assistance. Ryanair certainly seems to be more passenger-friendly these days but it is still advisable to be aware of the rules to avoid any possible pitfalls.",Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy,Liverpool to Malaga,7,3,3,NA,NA,3,NA,5,1

The interior quality of the planes were poor 2/3 times and the seats in economy class do not easily accommodate someone taller than 5'10"" (too tight for the knees). The staff and crew seem unapproachable and disinterested. It is also irritating that if you book online you then have to be pulled aside at check-in so they can verify your card. I understand the concept but the fact that they force you to step out of line and then wait in line again after they finish is really frustrating.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2015-06-01,I opted for Ryanair due to needing a direct flight from Gdansk to London. I read all the small print and rules to be able to pay the correct price for bag fast boarding and emergency row seat. These extras added up to about 100% to the initial price tag but even then it was quite cheap (some 70USD one-way all inclusive). There was no trouble with booking as well as with online check in. I was even able to download mobile boarding pass through the app. At the airport I only spent abut 10 minutes for bag check and visa verification. At the gate my experience was not overly pleasant with some 200 people with screaming children left on the stairs leading to the apron for about 20 minutes. Then door opened and crowd went to the plane. Since I booked priority boarding I had no trouble reaching my seat and accommodating my bag. The crew were polite and helpful. Since their hand baggage limit is strict there was no problem finding space for bags. We took off on time. The inflight experience was up to expectations but not as annoying as some wrote here. No seat recline but plenty of legroom in emergency row. The plane was very tatty but clean. Toilet was ok. We landed 10 mins ahead of schedule. Then usual labyrinth of Stansted terminal and unbelievable immigration lines for EU citizens. Due to being Ukraine national I was directed to the non-EU line which consisted of some 15-20 people so it took me 10 minutes to pass border control. My bag was already on the belt I was off the airport 20 minutes after landing. Absolutely bearable experience; you'll have no trouble if you carefully read their instruction and spend extra 10 minutes on booking process.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2015-05-22,MAN-PMI-MAN. Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for £200 per person in low season.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1
ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2015-05-13,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,1

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2015-04-22,"Over the past month I have been on four FR flights. The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow.

I am travelling on this route every week and fly both BA and SAS depending on price and schedule. This morning I was booked on SAS and suffice to say it was not one of their finest moments. The flight was delayed and it turned out to be a two hour-delay before we finally reached London. The staff working onboard today's flight must have been through an unusually rough patch before getting onboard this flight. I have rarely seen a slower and more disengaged team of employees in any line of work. It took almost 45 minutes to dish out a few sandwiches and drinks. Need I say that at that pace the crew did not have the time to clear the trash before landing. Compared to BA and their upgraded cabins I think the SAS Airbus 321 is looking shabby. There is no finer way of putting it. If I am not mistaken this aircraft has not really been revamped since it was put into use about 15 years ago and it shows! I think it is high time for SAS to take some action here. All in all SAS are generally more expensive than BA on this route and I know this after flying every week on this route for a while. However paying more to go with SAS also means that you have to pay extra for food and drinks travel in a run-down cabin and may run into the team I had to endure today.

If you want a budget airline with no frills substandard food at premium prices that charges you every time you blink then this airline is for you. I can understand extra for food drinks (even water) entertainment but to charge you for checking in early is a pathetic money grabbing option. Only $5 but no mention of fee at early check-in sign at airport after queuing in line for 20 minutes and many complaints from other passengers a staff member came from behind the counter to tell you of the charge when you are two passengers from the counter and by the time we got to the counter we were only 5 minutes early.

Usually fly with easyJet but Ryanair had a more convenient time for our return from Malaga. Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,4,3,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Copenhagen airport was very quiet when I got there on Tuesday. SAS is constantly upgrading passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting through the airport to your gate. Their latest development is a self-service Bag Drop. Fairly simple to use. The bag is put on an unmanned luggage conveyer belt which the machine registers and weighs. The passenger then uses a bar reader gun to pick up the details from the luggage tag. The bag is then transported away. Any problems/machine errors are sorted out by a member staff on call.

I would rate Silk Air Business Class equivalent to a good premium economy but still quite satisfying. The wine was good FAs were charming.

We went return from Luton to Marrakech and would not do this journey with them again. In fact we'd only think about it for very short flights for weekend breaks and to be honest that would be pretty desperate. Where to start? They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat. After all who wants to gallivant around an unfamiliar foreign city looking for an internet cafe that may or may not have a printer. The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows! They couldn't even be bothered to give out landing cards either which just prolonged the bad experience at the airport. I reckon that after all the add-ons it would have been cheaper to fly with BA.

singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,V Sitaraman,India,2015-01-14,I am a very satisfied frequent traveler on SQ and this review only covers the way they serve their special meals in general and the inconvenience this procedure causes on short flights. I noted down the exact service timings on a 75 minute flight (SQ959) between Jakarta and Singapore on 4 Dec 14. Flight take off 15.05 special meals service started 15.15 I was served at 15.50 and my tray was taken away at 16.03 when I had not quite finished the meal. If you order a special meal you will be embarrassed to receive it too early when your neighbors have even not received their drinks. The tray-by-tray special meal service takes so much time that those receiving a standard meal have very little time to eat it at least on short flights. In the glory days of Malaysian Airlines (which I almost exclusively flew between 1998 to 2009) somehow they would bring the special and regular meals together so that all passengers were served at the same time. Wonder if SQ could think of some way to reduce the time lag between special meal and regular meal service? This is not a complaint but a suggestion.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known!

The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed).

Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again.

The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work.

For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that.

Assigned seating is a nice new addition though boarding leaves much to be desired - flight departed 20 minutes late due the slightly slow boarding process which prompted some passengers to buy overpriced priority boarding from Ryanair staff hanging around the gate.

We were advised at check-in that there had been a change of aircraft and our hearts sank when we boarded it was an ancient 777 surprised that Singapore Airlines still uses these dinosaurs. I have never experienced such old uncomfortable business class seats (you could select either seat recline or leg raise not both at the same time). I am only 5 ft 4"" and I felt scrunched up. There was no storage around the seat area for personal belongings on this very old plane really not good enough for a five star airline on a long haul route.

What has happened to Singapore Airlines? The standard of the aircraft was just not up to today's standards and that's not because I usually fly Emirates which is in another class altogether compared to this flight at the same price! The whole interior of the aircraft was that of the 1980's. The seats were old and didn't function properly entertainment screen was tiny dim (even on full brightness) and blurry. I flew economy but felt sorrier for business class where seats looked like they were out of the 1970’s. Yes there are some other airlines that are as bad but you pay for what you get and this flight was not cheap. Note: even low cost airlins these days have new fresh interiors albeit basic.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,3,2,1,NA,NA,1,0

First and last time I'll use this airline - total rip off. Stood for an hour at Edinburgh check in then another 45 minutes at the gate in the hope my wife and I would get a seat together (why should we pay extra for this?). On board is a joke leg room and general scope of the seating is ridiculous. All cabin crew were rude and only wanted to sell things. We heard about the seat belt signs coming on for turbulence just before the trolleys come out and sure enough this happened twice on the way out and back apparently an old Ryanair trick. Return check in at Tenerife was ridiculous 5 Ryanair flights being checked in at one time through 3 desks that's nearly 700 passengers. No Ryanair staff on duty and no one is interested in what you have to say. Usual stampede for seats together again why should we pay for that privilege? Its standard with everyone else.

It is impossible to reach an agent and any attempts to do so are met with having to allow the phone to ring more than 30 times to then listen to a recording to tell you to call back or be prepared to be put on hold to then be put on hold for up to 20 minutes to then be automatically disconnected if an agent does not take your call before the time limit is up. Very frustrating and the money saved is little compensation for the time spent in trying to reach an agent.

I was hungry half way through the flight and wanted a snack but was told there was no snacks and had to wait for the meal service several hours later. Next time I will book Qantas.

Flight on a new 737 but legroom was tight but the seats were ok for a short 3 hour flight. Service was extremely inefficient it felt like the cabin crew did not go through proper training. It took them more than 2 hours to service the entire aircraft and we were lucky enough that we pre-ordered our meals beforehand. Also they served our meals first before our drinks which should have been the other way around. We nearly choked waiting for our beverage. Food however was of excellent quality. The quality and quantity were great and while it was just a basic meal the taste far exceeds that of other major airlines like Emirates. Overall a mediocre flight.

Remains a solid product with a friendly professional crew. Seats: comfortable enough suggest centre aisle. Good duvet and real feather pillow so able to get some sleep. Meals: excellent quality for airline food and adequate portions and complementing wines. Movies: Did JFK-JNB-JFK in the same month so I was hard pressed by the end of March but it is a good on demand system. Value for money: SAA has monopoly on the routes to South America from SA so they can and do charge what they like. Worst Part: SAA continues to use low grade cheap instant coffee in Business class which is not acceptable when so much attention has been paid to other aspects of the product. Additionally JNB-EZE is day time flying during comparatively 'normal' hours either side of the south Atlantic yet SAA insists on blacking out the cabin with all window shades down. 11 hours is too long to sit in artificial blackout especially since I have never been in SA226/7 when Business class is more than half empty.

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,A Roberts,United States,2014-07-17,When and if Southwest changes its seating policy I will consider flying it again. Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest. I can fly into JFK pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a Southwest flight to ISP costs.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,2,4,0,NA,NA,NA,2,0

I have never experienced such poor Customer Service in the 13 years I have been traveling with this airline. I have been getting the feeling that the service had lost its world renowned status for the last few years. I stayed with this airline for their frequency and on time performance. Despite having a huge incentive voucher from Alaska Airlines I will say that after this experience I have completely given up on Southwest Airlines as a competitor. I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. The chaos that ensued was unreal. Before I knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers.

Not only did they change the departure time 3 times from 10am to 8am to 6am (which was an issue with us by the time the final departure time was set) but the direct flight Bangkok to Colombo was changed on the date of travel to be non-direct through heir new airport Hambantota with no communication to passengers - whatsoever - with the entire flight getting up to depart and having to be told that it had now stopped. It therefore left us with 6 hours to pass in Colombo because of the earlier departure time (from 10am to 6am) and staff were rude!

They had overbooked the flight by about 7 people and everyone showed up some people volunteered to give up their seats for the usual compensation package. My partner and I checked in online in the morning prior to the flight. We arrived to the airport and waited at the check in counter as they were getting another couple checked in printed boarding passes checked luggage and sent those passengers on their way to the gate. They however denied us help denied offering any customer service or compensation because they said we had arrived too late to print off boarding passes but they did admit to use that they had knowledge of our online check in. Then while we were standing at the counter with 4 other passengers Spirit Airlines proceeded to book flights and offer hotel and ticket compensation to the other passengers.

Check-in was straightforward staff were ok onboard not great but certainly much more courteous than other carriers! Unfortunately the flight was a let down. The plane really needs updating. The overhead CRT screen rattled above us for the whole 10 hour flight. The entertainment system was archaic. The headphone jack for the entertainment system doesn't allow you to use your own headphones the audio didn't work anyway so no entertainment on a 10 hour flight. The food was ok. They didn't have landing cards - luckily I was in transit.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,R Smith,United States,2014-08-15,Did a round trip from Dallas to Portland Oregon the weekend of August 9. Decided to upgrade to the front seats which for my brother and I it was worth the extra cost of $50 per seat. The front seats do recline. The only hitch on this trip is that upon returning to DFW we could not get our checked luggage for over 1.5 hrs. It was very frustrating. But if you need a cheap seat and you can pack light and either pay the carry on charge for you luggage or just put everything in a small backpack then Spirit may work for you. We also had to wait once we landed for a gate to open up so we sat on the ground an extra 15 minutes before our plane could get into a gate. I also brought my own snacks so make sure you do that. I chose to purchase water after passing through security and getting inside the terminal. I took my bottled water in my small backpack along with my snacks onto the airplane and this was not a problem. Other than these problems it went relatively well. I checked in online and printed my boarding passes online from my home. The Spirit staff and the airport and on both flights were acceptable. Also Spirit was one of few airlines that offered DFW to PDX non-stop which for me is important because I don't like multiple flights. Bottom Line. Spirit Airlines is a inexpensive airline with no frills. I really don't think I would book Spirit for a long flight or for anything out of the USA.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,4,4,1,1,NA,NA,4,1

It looked like something my 2nd grader did for a class project. The site did not include a phone number either. I had to get the number through CheapoAir which is the site through which I booked the trip. The seats did not recline (not even an inch). Those 'big seats' they mention are only a little larger than the average seat. The food selection was very limited and costly ($3 for water). $50 for checked or carry-on (yes you have to pay for a carry-on). This is $50 both ways. I will admit the crew were very funny and nice.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,S John,United States,2014-07-03,I recently flew from Chicago to Minneapolis. I paid for the base fare which includes one personal item. Since I was staying for 4 days with friends I didn't need a large suitcase or carry on bag I was able to fit everything into a bag which meets the free bag policy and fits on the floor under the seat. The money I saved was enough to purchase one of the large seats in the front and I was quite comfortable and the seat in fact reclined and was not set to a fixed position. If you read carefully at the time you book you will see the baggage policy. If you want to use the overhead bin there is a charge of $35 at the time you book. When you check in online it will ask you if you need to check more bags and you will pay a little more then if you had your act together when you booked. If you just ignore it all and take your carry on to the gate and you didn't pay in advance yes to get to pay $100 that's on you you should read as you book. My flight was delayed an hour and a half going because Air Force One went to Minneapolis the same day and about the same time not Spirits fault. Also the trip back was delayed 15 minutes not too bad. If you want to drink water or soda being it on or you have to buy it. Do your homework if you are taking a long vacation with baggage something like Southwest may be better. But if you are going a short distance don't need a free half can of soda and tiny bag of peanuts and can pack light and know how to check in o line and print your boarding pass then Spirit is a good alternative and not nearly as bad as people here say.

I joined the $9 club and had everybody I booked tickets for split that cost; our trip there and back was a couple hundred less than any other airline I looked at. The complaints about the lack of free food/drinks and high baggage fees are ridiculous to me. There is a reason the base price is so low so understand what you're buying first because I had zero surprises when I showed up at the airport. I wouldn't want to be on a Spirit plane for any kind of international flight (unless I made the seat upgrade) but for a 2-3 hour trip the savings are worth it. This is especially true if you're traveling light. My only legitimate complaint was they lost my bag from Vegas back to Chicago but they shipped it to my house within a few days.

I was a little worried after reading all the negative reviews but I thought that Sunwing was great. The flight crews on both our flights were very nice and provided good service. Granted the food onboard wasn't great but what do you want for airline food. We booked the Elite Plus and I am happy that we did. The extra leg room was a huge bonus. We also avoided the long lineup at the airport coming home. The only things that I didn't like were that the transfer bus from the airport didn't have a list of names of people that should be on the bus. I have no idea how they knew when they had everyone of if someone was missing. I also didn't like that you had to see the Sunwing reps the morning after arriving to book the shuttle back to the airport. We ended up waiting quite awhile to see a rep as people were booking excursions. If hotel transfers are included in the package price you shouldn't be required to talk with a rep.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,5,5,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

Do your homework lower your expectations and enjoy your cheap airfare. They charge for everything water to check a bag to stow your carry-on in the overhead compartment to choose a seat print your boarding pass at the airport. Do your homework and figure out what makes the most sense for your trip and don't assume you'll get anything for free. For 2 of us checking one bag and purchasing our seats was still $150 cheaper than 2 tickets on Delta. You are allowed one free carry- on bag but it needs to fit under the seat and must meet the dimensions set by Spirit we each had computer bags and were just fine. Checked baggage must weigh less than 40 lbs - 10lbs lighter than most airlines. There is no wifi on board. There are no inflight magazines bring a book or buy a magazine. The seats are smaller than normal coach. If you are uncomfortable in coach seats on Delta don't fly Spirit. I'm 5'5' and 6 months pregnant with an aisle seat on a 3 hour flight I was fine. They will try to sell you a credit card they're not super pushy but it's a little annoying. We checked in online within 24 hours printed our boarding passes with no problem. We went in with super low expectations and arrived at the airport 2 hours early. If you check in online you qualify for ""quick check in"" so we actually bypassed the line when we flew home. In MSP we waited 15 minutes. The ticket agents in MSP and Ft. Myers were friendly and helpful. Our outbound flight was a bit delayed because the inbound flight had to de-ice.

That didn't happen. The party plane was in full swing from the moment they closed the door halfway through they reported that they had run out of alcohol. Needless to say the small seats were that much smaller when everyone around you is drunk. Fast forward to our flight home this flight (from Las Vegas to Philly) was cancelled due to weather. After booking another night at our hotel we learned that they had put us on a flight leaving in a few short hours.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,J Wang,United States,2014-02-21,Round trip on Spirit with one-way duration of 3 hours. The reason I chose Spirit Airline was price. On the outbound trip I had to pay $45 because my suitcase was 0.5 inch wider than their measurement. This suitcase has been used all the time for carry-on baggage with many different airlines never with any problems. Once on board the flight attendants one male and one female never smiled. Neither did they provide a single complimentary drink not even tap water for 3+ hours. They simply force you to buy their merchandise. Before the end of the trip the do-not-know-how-to-smile male attendant made three announcements to urge travelers to sign up Spirit credit card and how many benefits you would get with those cards all within half an hour. On my return trip things get worse. Though I gave away my half-an-inch-larger suitcase to avoid the $45 fee and my stuff in a plastic bag fits well in the free personal item measurement. The Spirit gatekeeper insisted I pay $100 for my things by calling out to close the gate - he knows perfectly well the mentality of a weary traveler and he hits them right on spot. I was the last one there trying to avoid this $100 expenditure out of nowhere. But I don't want to be left behind so I gave in. On board again not a single drop of complimentary water. At least this time the flight attendants smiled. They simply paraded with an empty trash bag to walk back and forth. In summary extra $145 expenditure for nothing complimentary except air and one smile. That is called Spirit - an ironic title.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,3,0

syrianair,/airline-reviews/syrianair,SyrianAir customer review,John Doe,United Kingdom,2009-10-23,"Daytrip to Aleppo on day one outbound was a domestic leg of an international flight that continued to Stockholm. Aircraft was filthy but on time. Was quite concerned when airline staff took our passports to be returned in Aleppo - to identify domestic passengers or give us an incentive not to stay onboard for the long flight to Sweden (and civilisation). Return was on decades-old Tupolev 134 although this aircraft was very clean. Day two was a round trip on the same aircraft to Deirezzor and back to fly on a Yak 40 (very unusual old Russian commuter jetliner gone from service everywhere else in the world). While the Yak was a novelty I am sure for a regular airline passenger it would be quite scary as the plane was in fairly poor condition. Our flight unlike the previous day's ALP/ARN service left from the domestic terminal a real third world mess with puddles of water and ash on the floor no signs or shops or anything. Smoking was encouraged though. On arrival at Deirezzor my travel partner and I were arrested because (we assume) it was unusual for pax to fly-and-return in the same morning. Released and allowed to rejoin the flight back to Damascus but on arrival back at DAM were arrested again and spent the entire day being interviewed by scary ""security"" officials who were not only sinister but also incompetent eg: photocopied our passports but inadvertently gave us the photocopy then searching their own paperwork for the photocopies etc. Perhaps our travel plans were out of the ordinary but if it was an itinerary unfavourable to Syrian security concerns why sell us the ticket in the first place? Eventually released shaken. Day three was a day trip to Latakia beach resort. Old Yak 40 again shabby service smoking cabin crew smoking refuellers etc. Waiting at small Latakia airport for return to DAM many plainclothes cops pacing like circling sharks due to a VIP passenger. Same at international departures (TK to IST and on to LHR) - circling security agents in shiny suits everywhere hanging ceiling panels frayed wires broken luggage belts broken destination indicators with hand-written signs taped over them (complete with spelling mistakes! our flight was to Astanbul). Never been so happy to leave a country. Some of this doesn't relate to Syrianair but our troubles revolved around the Deirezzor flights which again Syrianair were quite happy to sell us.

It was a very bad flight mainly because of the worst crew I have seen. This crew were arrogant incompetent with inadequate behavior. As soon as we got the plane there was no welcome. They did not give us blankets and pillows we had to ask for it. When they start serving the dinner they brought everything on the same tray. Starters soup and main dish and of course when we started the main dish it was already cold. No dessert coffee tea offered. Just after they served dinner a small bit of turbulence began the seat belt sign was turned on. Turbulence last for about 5 minutes time for the crew stop the service and started their own dinner leaving everything on the tables. I have been complaining about this flight because it was an absurd. The crew are paid for doing their job.

New terminal in Mumbai was a pleasure to use and lounge facilities were still under construction so had all C class area in a converted area which was fine and had great selection of food. I found the flat seat good overall didn't like how it sinks all the way to the ground but sill was flat and not angled which makes all the difference. ORD-ZRH were good multi course and offered cheese and dessert. Wines were excellent. Negatives: Cabin service between the two flights very different BOM-ZRH flight leaves early morning and crew serves light one tray snack which is cold then disappears until 1 hour before landing and serves a one-tray breakfast which was abysmal at best. Crew were cold and looked tired. Cabin also showing signs of age with small stains here and there.

No waiting at the dedicated business check-in quick courteous service with informative advice on fast track and lounge location.

Swiss badly let down by the standards at the Thai Royal Orchid lounge at D Concourse.

Slight delays on 5-10 minutes created absolutely no problems. All in all TAP is superior to other carriers from Denmark to Iberian peninsular far better than both SAS and Iberia where you have to pay for meals with poorer quality than on TAP.

I had chosen seats via the TAM call centre in advance and they showed on my booking online but for some reason on check-in the system had allocated totally different seats which irritated me. Boarding in Frankfurt for GRU was chaotic with different groups being called at the same time. Seats onboard have a footrest which folds up meaning if raised it sticks into my shins but when dropped it is too high for me to put my feet on. Departed on time and soon dinner was served. No menu choice - a small salad a roll and a small pasta box. Not really enough for 12 hours. One drink was served then rubbish cleared away lights dimmed for the night and the crew vanished. It was only about 10.30 European time. The only drinks available were glasses of bottled water so if you fancied a nightcap or something else it was hard luck. AVOD is average but there was enough to keep me entertained. Breakfast was a reconstituted ham and gouda panini with some fruit and a tiny polystyrene cup of coffee. Horrible.

Upon boarding was told business was full and was not going to happen. Strangely enough there was over 4 empty seats in Business when all passengers were seated. FA when asked said it was out of her control. In Economy - cabin was full and seat space is very compact. IFE is on demand however I found the screens even at the lowest brightness to be still very bright. Earphones painful after an hour. Food was acceptable however there was no choice only chicken provided. Breakfast was a croissant and yoghurt and the FA did come around again with a second batch of croissants. FA on our aisle was young and very friendly. However on occasion some of the older crew would come by barking orders at customers. Seat quality for sleeping is terrible new Recarro seats they should not be used for long haul. No possible way to get comfortable. The cabin temperature dropped massively during the night.

The seats were so small that it was not possible to hold a book normally but to have to hold it up much closer to your face and with so little space that they did not have space for a normal tray which meant when food came round there was not space to also have anything to drink. The food was awful and struggled to eat any of the hot meals which were of course an extra charge. There was no entertainment full stop.

Another problem was that every time we flew through any slightly unstable air the back of the plane yawed from side to side sufficiently to spill drinks.

When we questioned this at the gate we were told there were no other seats and there was nothing they could do (even after I had told them how difficult I find flying alone). The lady said they had seated us as close as possible but when we got on the flight there was a row completely empty which we eventually got moved to when we asked again. Entertainment system was broken for most of our flight and when it did work it the quality was awful. Seats were uncomfy the blankets and pillows smelt horrible and there was dirt down the side of the wall. We were charged to use headphones adapters and even our credit card. Next time I will pay the extra flight money for some decent service.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Flight slightly delayed due to all toilets being out of action took off with 1 toilet out of order coped with that but food on both inbound and outbound was disgusting crew indifferent. Delayed on return from Cancun on October 25th check in computers went 'down' with 75 of us still waiting to check in. We were left standing for 2 hrs while they tried to sort out problem despite asking for info numerous times we were treated with utter contempt telling me personally to get back in the queue when I asked why we couldn't be checked in manually? The staff offered no explanation as to when we could board the pilot knew of the problem because when he & the crew checked in we had already been waiting for an hour. The staff were a disgrace and Thomson should look into their customer service approach. Eventually we checked in with minutes to spare and straight onto the plane no duty free shopping for us unfortunate 75 customers. The flight home didn't have enough duty free purchases the food was awful as stated & the mood lighting? What mood lighting? No apology from the pilot just a cursory sorry for the delay due to technical problems! I wasn't aware I was a technical problem just another upset customer left in limbo for 2 hrs with rude staff. On arriving at Birmingham we couldn't lock up with the departure tunnel & it had to be relocated to another door more delays. On leaving aircraft my husband said to 1 of crew 'we had trouble getting on plane and trouble getting off' his reply was 'just one of those things liking having problems with a new car'! If I had a new car with that many problems I'd be furious and staff who don't give a monkeys only added to the problem on a lighter note the plane did have better leg room and more choice of movies but apart from that no better than any other Thomson flight and I've been on plenty.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,5,2,2,5,NA,NA,2,0

I carefully booked in advance seats on all legs so I could choose seats with a lot of space (27J on the routes from Europe to Brazil and back). 27J has a lot of extra room for legs since it is near the emergency exit and is the first to be served. It is also close to toilets. The A340 is old with practically no IFE and food is very basic. However I found seats to be reasonably comfortable and could sleep in both flights. In the leg from Lisbon to Rio the flight was practically full; in the way back less than 50% of seats was occupied. European legs were also fine: food served is also very basic (including an uneatable sandwich) but at least there was some IFE with flight information. Overall all flights were not that exciting but always on time and transfer within Lisbon airport is pretty fast.

Boarding was reasonably orderly with a warm welcome. The angled lie-flat business class seat was fine for the SYD-BKK afternoon-evening flight as it is comfortable for relaxing reading watching movies and snoozing but found it difficult to get much of a sleep on BKK-SYD between the cabin being too warm and sliding down the seat. Service from cabin crew was friendly and efficient. The meals were adequate although not outstanding. All but one of the main courses and desserts were mediocre but the starters and range of drinks were quite good. Inflight entertainment system had a wide range of movies and reasonable TV and music selections enough to keep me occupied. Only downside was an excessive level of high volume announcements so loud that it is deafening through the headphones.

I choose to fly with Tiger as they are cheap and no frills. However when you purchase your ticket or tickets via the Tiger Airways official website it asks if you would like to choose your seat and some seats with more ""leg room"" cost more. On the seat selection page it shows which seats are empty and which seats are booked. Generally the seats with the added leg room are an extra cost and generally always the first booked. I always skip the seat selection and let Tiger assign me a seat at no extra cost. Now whenever I go to check in at Sydney airport or Coolangatta airport the check in staff often ask me where I would like to sit. So I ask for the seats with extra leg room which are the emergency exit rows and generally I'm assigned a seat with extra leg room despite the fact that I didn't pay anything extra and despite the Tiger Airways website stating that those seats which cost more and were ""booked"".

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2014-06-02,Gatwick - Cancun - Gatwick. This was in the new 787 Dreamliner. Premium Economy has a 2-3-2 configuration and a 36” seat pitch. All flights on time. Meals rather ordinary but drinks dispensed generously. A good selection of films and other entertainment on the IFE system stored in the armrest. Two toilets in the Premium cabin one in the forward galley and one at the rear of the cabin; on the outward leg I was rather brusquely asked to sit in my seat rather than wait in the galley for the toilet to become available this seemed a bit unnecessary and over assertive for the sake of it since I wasn't in anybody's way but other than that service was generally good. Regarding the Dreamliner cabin air is apparently of a higher quality than other aircraft due to greater cabin pressure and humidity difficult to say for sure how much difference this made but I disembarked both flights feeling in good shape. The cabin ceiling is comparatively high and the overhead baggage compartments are generously sized. A few issues though. As many others have noted there is a serious problem with the design of the seats / armrests; even with a 36” pitch if the person in front has reclined their seat then it's very difficult unless you have an aisle seat to exit your seat without climbing over the passenger next to you. Also although the aircraft have been in service less than a year the seats are already looking the worse for wear; some of the plastic trim in the armrests is coming loose some of the IFE screen mechanisms were also very loose (on the outward journey I noticed that someone had needed to jam bits of cardboard in the mechanism of my IFE system to keep the TV screen upright) and on the return journey the footrest on the seat of one of my party was jammed in the extended position. Finally although we were given a nice printed menu of all the beverages supposedly available on the return journey we were told that several of these had been withdrawn so the variety of soft drinks is actually rather less than Thomson were advertising. On the whole pretty good and I think the 787 sets new standards but for the extra we paid for Premium seats we expected a bit more.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1

However on 3 occasions when the flight was full passengers who had not paid the extra were given free access to to the front row making the paying passengers regret their decision.

You have literally no room to seat plus passengers can recline leaving you no room even to move. The snack service was pathetic with peace of bread in plastic.

We purchased extra leg room seats at the airport and these were located at the front of the plane. Immediately upon boarding the cabin manager exclaimed that Thomson really shouldn't sell those seats as they were in her workspace so we could get a lot of disturbance - very professional of her! 30 minutes into the flight a cabin crew member was taken ill and was seated in the kitchen area in front of us and opposite the toilet. We were then all told we could no longer use that toilet because it impinged on her privacy and had to use the one's located the other end of the plane. Okay but the way the crew spoke to passengers who were queuing was an utter disgrace they were so rude. We had paid over £1000 for our seats and were spoken to as if we were just a complete nuisance for wanting basic needs to be met. There were 2 crew members looking after the one taken ill and service in the cabin was severely inhibited because of this and passengers were unable to obtain food and drink and told to stay seated. The Cabin manager told us that the reason her colleague had been taken ill was because she had been doing a fasting diet - very irresponsible when she had duty of care to hundreds of passengers at 37000 feet! When we were due to land I was told I needed to move from my seat so that the ill crew member could be seated near the exit for landing and I was hurriedly escorted to a crew seat at the back of the plane and told to leave my belongings because I could get them later. I was given no assistance to get back to my seat my husband and my belongings when the plane landed and this was virtually impossible to do with all the passengers blocking the aisle. My husband did not realise I had put the books purchased at the airport to enjoy on my holiday in the overhead locker and subsequently they got left behind.

tunisair,/airline-reviews/tunisair,Tunisair customer review,Adam Taylor,United Kingdom,2015-04-19,This is not my first review on Tunis Air but since the closure of the London-Tunis flight on BA this is the only scheduled direct service from the UK right now. Departed on the TU790 on the 06th April. The flight was over 2 hours late arriving into London on the inbound so did not depart until some time after the STD. Outbound aircraft (TS-IMH) was very old (1994) and extremely dirty inside. The cabin crew were not very happy and showed this in the service or lack of during the flight. Meals were simply a piece of bread with cheese and chicken and 1 service of drinks. The most memorable part of the flight was going to the rear cabin once the food and drinks service was concluded. The cabin crew (6 members) were having a wonderful time socialising with no regard or interest in the passengers. The return flight that I took on the 13th April as the return leg (TU791) was operated by a much newer (2013) aeroplane (TS-IMV). However again clearly Tunis Air have either a very poor outsourced company which do the aircraft cleaning in Tunis Airport or they simply do not clean their planes in order to save costs? At least 1 cabin crew member was on board who operated the flight a week earlier. Unfortunately again the service was a complete repeat of the earlier flight. Tunis Air are under increasing pressure I am informed to perform as an airline who frankly have not for some time. However if this is an indication of the measures they are taking to improve the service then I do not hold much hope for the airline going forward and once EZY start their service from STN-MIR in June I will be switching my business to them.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Negative: only in-flight entertainment was UIA's magazine; two flights on old 737-500 aircraft; meal service on my 90-minute morning flight from Kiev to Istanbul was one terrible sandwich - one slice of cheese smothered in far too much butter Kiev's Terminal D needs better food services.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

What's happened to Thomson Airways? - It seems in the space of a year it has become a flying cash register. We were unprepared for a 4.5 flight as I had not read or seen anywhere that inflight entertainment had been cut from the budget for this year. Apparently no-one watched it according to the cabin staff however on both inbound and outbound I counted the 18 seats around me and only one person had anything to do. The past inflight meals were garbage but at least edible on occasions and were actually something you looked forward to but the simple thing is its paid for as part of your initial holiday cost - it just does not feel right paying cash at inflated prices for something that represents less value than the old style inflight meals. Seats are small you can see where the rows are altered against the window alignment.

There were still a line of about 10 to 15 people waiting to be checked in at the two counters that were open. After a ten minute wait we were checked in. Despite not reserving a seat in advance we were allocated a complete row of six seats. The flight was about 85% full. We boarded about 15 minutes before flight time. It was drizzling and we were offered an umbrella for the short walk to the stairs to board the aircraft. On board the seats were leather-covered. There was a five minute delay in push back and we took off at 1045 am. Once air-borne the crew began buy on board service and well as duty free sale. Service was fuss free and it was a short 80 minute ride to our destination. We landed five minutes behind schedule and proceeded for our holiday. For the return flight we arrived at 1015 am at Krabi Airport for the 1135 am flight. There were queues at the two counters opened for check in. We waited about ten minutes before it was our turn. The flight was full but the agent managed to offer us 6 aisle seats that were not too far from one another. The aircraft arrived about fifteen minutes late from Singapore and that delayed our departure from Krabi as well. Service on board was similar to the inbound flight.

Total door-to-door travel time for this flight was about 14 hours. All staff was courteous, pleasant and efficient. WiFi entertainment system that streams TV and movies over tablets worked well, and provided lots of options. No problem finding my flights. The planes are so packed (this is industry wide, not just United) there's no flexibility in the system for weather delays. This also makes them uncomfortable. When I got annoyed enough that I tried three times to upgrade to Premium Economy hoping to score an empty center seat, United's App steadfastly refused to take my money, so I stayed wedged back in the back of the plane. Would I recommend United? Yes. They're no worse than any other carrier.  The benefit of United though, is you can get their service at more locations than just about any other airline.

turkish-airlines,/airline-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,Michael Asher,Turkey,2014-07-01,Travelling from Alanya/Gazipasa to Istanbul via Ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in. At the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesn't allow it said the young lady on the desk. No lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it. In fact the Turkish Airlines printed timetable doesn't even list the flights there. I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available. My luggage was the last up - seems they don't use priority tags at Alanya either. But at least I was able to go to the airport shop and buy a can of Coke for TL 1.75!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,3,3,3,1,NA,NA,5,1

The flight from Houston to Austin was on a brand new regional jet with nine first class seats. Unfortunately several sensors were showing and everyone needed to exit the plane. Within 30 minutes another new regional plane with the same configuration was waiting a few gates away and the plane was only 45 minutes late getting into Austin. Good job United. Unfortunately returning was a different story. I arrived at the Austin airport several hours early and inquired about an earlier flight to Houston. I was told that there had been no late flights all day. The plane arrived in Austin late and by the time I boarded it was 30 minutes late. Then it began raining in Houston so the plane had to wait another 20 minutes in Austin. By the time the plane arrived in Houston my flight to West Palm Beach had left and it was the last flight of the day. Most passengers on the full A319 flying east had to find a hotel for the night at their own expense because United is not responsible for weather related delays and it is usually raining somewhere where United flies.

TK turned out to be very good on all four sectors: all flights on time or ahead of schedule all aircraft quite new with great legroom and good IFE that had many interesting options. Moreover the hot meals by DO&CO were of high quality compared to any big European competitor - I still prefer proper food on flights over 3 hrs instead of a sandwich if a meal is served. Human interaction is always a matter of personal taste: for us the cabin crews on these full flights were perfectly fine with good command of English - plus many smiles all the way.

They even arranged my vegetarian meal from business class as it was not loaded. TK serves fresh orange juice and lemonade which is perhaps the best drink I have had on onboard! Meals are always tasty and crew are friendly and helpful although I have to say that Chef-onboard service is absolutely useless. Chef did not even know what the vegetarian meal was on TK flights but thanks to the crew who got me something to eat although it came an hour after the service.

No other European carrier serves this amount of meals on intraeuropean flights and service about the same on intercontinental. As a regular flyer on THY in recent years I would recommend changing the meals a little - on all 4 flights food was the same as before always delicious but perhaps a little tired compared to some years ago.

The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The “sausage” that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles.

From beginning to end, it was such a hassle for a 25 minute flight. At BWI, they insisted that you check in at a kiosk to obtain a boarding pass prior to check in. Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair, they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts, wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in, the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally, she relented, printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in. On the short flight, there was no beverage service but that is a small matter. On the whole, I will do everything possible to avoid US Air in the future.

Arrived at the airport at 5pm for check in for 6.30pm flight. After several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time. After an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available. Finally boarding was announced at around 8.30pm after which it started to rain. We were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain. We sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather. It was now after 10pm. On disembarking I was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for re-booking but I later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night. I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late). I had to push and push to be offered alternative options (e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc). Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full! I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on. After much persuasion a seat miraculously became available at 11am the next day. Bizarre.

The TPA-ORD leg was the usual 'bus' service you get used to for US domestic trips but the international leg was beyond terrible. The aircraft was old - decor of a bygone era. The TV screens were the sort I remember for a decade ago - tiny no personal controls. The food was stingy and poor quality (a slab of meat resembling a chicken breast at some time in the past). The cabin crew were surly and long past retirement age (who knows what would happen in an emergency). Surely they could stump up at least one complementary alcoholic beverage like other transatlantic carriers. Next time I'll pay more for a much superior service.

At the gate I was told I would need to check my bag because the flight was very full. After boarding it was discovered that there was a malfunction. Whilst waiting we were told there was another malfunction and there would be a 90 minute delay. We were let off the plane and then re-boarded. Put on another flight this time connecting through PHL. Another delay but we did get to PHL and left FLL prior to the reported time of departure. Got to PHL to find out that there was another delay a gate change and the flight we were set to take was no longer even on the departure board. Told to check the monitors for flight changes. Ended up sitting in PHL for another 90 minutes and the gate was filthy. Upon getting to PHL at approximately 1.45am we were told that our bags never left PHL.

This year we traveled as a family to Paris and will be using them again in August as they now have a direct flight from Charlotte NC to Dublin Ireland. Have never had any trouble with this airline. Luckily no bad weather so flights have always been on time. My only complaint is on domestic flights they let people with huge carry-on luggage board and they fill up the available overhead spaced. I have had to check my regulation size carry on bag on a couple of occasions for lack of room. They don't seem to care what size your carry on bag is.

Not sure if the fault was with poorly trained agents or a lousy system but the wait time was inexcusable.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2015-07-27,"LGW-CUN-LGW. Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.",Boeing 747-400,FamilyLeisure,Economy,LGW to CUN,7,4,5,3,3,4,NA,4,1

Overall the attention to detail let down the flight and was indicative of some underlying attitudes. Cabin Crew did not appear to check everyone's seat belt was fastened prior to take-off nor stow hats and coats that emergency row passengers had placed on an empty seat. A passenger decided to get up to use the toilet just after take-off when the Fasten Seatbelt sign was still illuminated but no comments/instructions from the cabin staff to return to seat! The final point was that the seatback pockets were not cleared out after the fights or even overnight as both my travelling companion and I found old boarding passes and other rubbish stuffed in the pockets - clearly the attention to detail is missing and needs work if the airline is to be truly successful!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,2,1,0,NA,NA,0,0

On my occasional previous flights with Virgin I'd noticed that they're inferior to Qantas in every way but not by much. Now that I've flown at a peak time I've seen what cost-cutting at check-in does. There was a queue for the small number of self-check-in kiosks (at least one was broken) then you can't drop your own bag like at Qantas so the queue for the measly 4-5 bag drop counters (they kept closing them due to baggage system problems) stretched to the terminal door. There were 5 proper check-in counters so some people took a punt on those being faster than kiosk + bag drop. 30 minutes to check-in should not be expected for a domestic flight (Qantas will take 5 minutes even at peak times). Given the price difference is usually small I'll avoid Virgin at peak times.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,2,2,2,NA,NA,3,0

In my view there is an issue about using a 737 with only 8 business seats for 5-6 hour international flight. My seat was wide but had restricted recline. As this was an evening flight I found it acceptable but would not have wanted to be in it for an overnight flight. The service was personal polite and attentive throughout.

Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat.

I arrived early at the airport plenty of staff on hand and baggage was accepted without a wait. Flight was packed without a single empty seat. Boarding is done by Cabin Special needs and zones and quickly turned into a scrum. The seats while stylish looking are very close together. They are much more narrow than they look. I'm a big guy at 6'2"" 235lbs and just getting into my seat I found it an impossibly small space. With a small personal item under the seat there is zero space. Thankfully during flight I could take it out from under the seat and it was not so bad. The crew for this flight mostly male with a single female serving were on top of their game. The Red inflight system for entertainment and ordering was brilliant. First service is rather awkward traditional front to back then it's all on demand. The food I purchased was a great Pastrami Sandwich. Nothing seemed too much trouble for this crew. They politely advised in advance when they would shut down the ordering service so people could get last requests in. Flight was only a few minutes delayed in departure and landing.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,S Jones,Australia,2014-11-06,Flew Virgin Australia AKL-MEL-AKL after a hiatus of about four or five years following some bad experiences with them. What I can say is that the flight was perfectly fine for a low cost airline although VA now position themselves at similar costs to full service airlines. The good - the crew on both flights (NZ based crew) were lovely and came through the cabin regularly to offer water. Complimentary tea and coffee was a nicer touch than what they used to offer (nothing for free). Straight to a check in counter at AKL this morning and the lady there was lovely. Both flights left on time and the flight crew gave us clear and helpful updates. Exit row seat purchased at a very reasonable price so happy to have the legroom. The bad - huge queue to check in at MEL due to 3 flights departing at similar times. I was travelling with cabin baggage only but since there was no online check in I was in a queue for close to an hour. I booked the light fare and thought I would like to add baggage. Couldn't be done unless I paid $120 at the airport or booked an entirely new flight. With a 7kg allowance I was fine for a quick trip but the laptop and other things I would have liked to take stayed at home. Some flexibility is desirable. They didn't have the gate number on any of the screens at AKL on departure despite the flight boarding. Advised the ground crew and he didn't care much for my advice. The inflight menu is poor quite frankly. I always eat on planes and am not afraid to hit the user pays menu. I took my own lunch from the airport on the way back to AKL. Just not appealing. All in all I got a cheap flight but for someone marketing themselves as being above a budget airline VA won't be getting me onboard again soon.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,1,2,NA,NA,4,0

I have to say the staff were great on both legs always checking and always present. The food was great and served quickly along with refresher towels and plenty of water. The inflight entertainment was circa 1980 however the flight was so short it did not really matter. If there was a disappointment it was the seats. No sooner had we taken off and the person in from reclined their seat and I was flashed back to economy. The seat hit my legs and that was a real disappointment.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,C Knapman,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,Flew from Manchester to Hong Kong and returned Shanghai to Manchester via Heathrow both ways. The little red service is great quick efficient and perfect for connecting it's a shame this service is being discontinued as even though BA service is fine enough connecting from Terminal 5 is always a nightmare I find terminals 2 and 3 much more comfortable. As for the long haul service I struggle to understand how Virgin can put an ancient A340-300 on a 12 hour long haul route the entertainment was shocking the old Vera Reel system should of been replaced years ago. I could tell they had put there most battle hardened cabin crew on this route obviously to deal with this I have never seen a cabin manager talking to so many passengers mid flight though it must be said she did a great job. Luckily the return flight from Shanghai was on a newer A340-600 and the on demand entertainment was much better. The crew on this flight though were clearly struggling with the majority Chinese passengers and while there were Chinese crew to help there was no communication between the British and Chinese crew. I find the crew on Cathay Emirates Qatar and other long haul airlines to have a much more professional attitude. Overall though the flights were on time comfortable enough for an economy ticket and I would fly Virgin again luckily they are retiring the old A340s because flying on one of them again would be the deal breaker.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Helpful check in staff who gave me the seat I wanted. No problems with a slightly overweight bag (problem coming from International Business to Domestic Economy as far as weight is concerned).

Both planes were new and clean. Check-in at both airports was fast and easy with priority lanes. Priority lanes for security at both airports provided. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew generally friendly. Ample legroom in MCS with free AVOD food and beverages. No hot meals available on short flights. Mood lighting upon boarding was interesting but definitely made it harder to see seat numbers especially on evening or night flights. Both flights generally on time. Can't comment on luggage delivery as I only had carry-on. Overall a great product and definitely the best domestic US airline out there.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2014-01-21,MEL-SGN-TPE-SGN-MEL with breaks in between various legs for business meetings. I can only say excellent all round. Vietnam Airlines offer close to 5-Star Service in Business Class if my own previous experiences with other airlines are any guide. I found check-in on Vietnam Airlines can occasionally be rather chaotic mainly because so many apparent first time and naive flyers seem to crowd into the business class check-in or boarding areas with their relatives seeing them off and with no idea of accepted boarding processes. Nevertheless on-board food and wine first rate with an amazing 4-choice main menu on some flights which were all on-time unless airport control dictated otherwise. Superb service from extremely well groomed flight attendants. I would prefer more in-flight comment from the flight crew especially as the flight map on some flights was not working. The Business Lounge in Saigon is quite good and adequate with good views of the tarmac and shared lounges (VN Airlines use the Qantas lounge in Melbourne and China Airlines in Taipei) - quite good. My only gripe was that management of in-flight turbulence and warning seemed poor as was the management of some passengers who completely ignored safety instructions (the guy next to me on one sector put his seat into the fully flat bed position during taxiing for take off which would have meant I would not have been able to quickly leave the aircraft in an emergency). However to be fair to the cabin crew they could do little to solve this problem as they were required to be strapped into their crew seats at the same time of take-off anyway. Very good inflight reading on Vietnam Airlines.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

I enjoy flying VA and service is always excellent. However I have mentioned this before. The airline is starting to recruit male flight attendants with attitude. Reminds me of a competitor and hence why I regularly boycott them. VA has certainly changed it's formula when it comes to their recruitment.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Tung,United Kingdom,2014-12-04,London Gatwick to Cancun return in VS economy. First time with this airline. Check in at both airports were easy and stress free. I purchased “seat plus” on the way out so had to use the check in counter. There was no queue in Gatwick. On the way back I did online check in so just needed to print out the boarding pass then proceed to bag drop. The airplane was a refurbed B744. It has a nice interior. Seat was comfortable and was better than I expected. However pitch and width were tight if the passenger in front reclines. The entertainment is up to date although the choice of movies / TV not as good as other airlines. The on demand system with a touch screen will keep you busy throughout a long journey. Personally I still prefer the touch screen but with a remote/console so that you don’t feel the person behind you is constantly “pushing” your seat back. Food onboard was a weak point. It was a nice touch to be given a menu but the food quality was poor. On the way out I pre ordered low fat meal but was served normal food. I noticed the crew who said they would try to see what they could do but then disappeared entirely. There was no sandwich or drink in the galley so in my case it was a 10 hour journey without food. On the returning I was served normal food again and I had to remind the crew that I’d pre-ordered special meal – that didn't seem normal in my experience where all other airlines will give passenger their special meals before others so they don't get confused. Breakfast was also poor – an orange juice a yoghurt and a very dry croissant. Service was overall friendly but not as professional as other airlines. Toilets weren't cleaned and some were out of order. Overall an acceptable flight experience but I will still choose BA over Virgin.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,2,2,4,NA,NA,3,0

Good flight from Adelaide to Melbourne - on time. Comfortable seats and very polite cabin staff. Melbourne to LAX left on time. The service in business class is very good and the staff are wonderful but the seats are not the most comfortable when compared to other airlines in that class. The seats aren't much wider than economy seats and are a little hard on a 14+ hour flight. I was in a window seat and was trapped when the person on the outside went to sleep. They squeeze a third seat into the middle group which I'd never seen on other international business class flights. Your pay more for business class to get comfort and privacy and unfortunately the seat configuration doesn't give you this. The inflight entertainment system could do with a revamp as there aren't many choices. The lunch services was great but the breakfast food was most odd and everything seemed to taste of five spice which was a little off putting - sometimes plain and normal is better than over the top. I like that they have a ladies only bathroom!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,2,5,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

From this experience I think I shall look to use VN Airlines for business travel again.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,5,0,NA,NA,5,1
virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,A Gibson,Australia,2014-01-13,HTI - SYD - 2nd Jan 2014. Had a great time on Hamilton Island with the family. Arrived at the island airport to travel home and the check-in line went out the terminal down the ramp and into the car park. After about 35 minutes we made our way up the ramp and into the check-in area. One person to check-in 150 passengers. I did notice another Virgin staff member coming and going waving a radio around check a passenger or two and then disappear again. We had now been in line for 1.4 hours and it was apparent there was no way this plane was going to leave on time. 30 minutes before scheduled departure the staff member waving the radio around and another staff member arrived and the check in intensity increased. The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crèche. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight. We downloaded the app but alas the entertainment system on board was not working. Being in the 2nd back row the food cart eventually arrives and there is only a few crumbs left that that the other passengers didnt want. All the decent food had gone. Maybe they could start the service at the back of the plane and then move forward or carry enough of the good stuff for all. We were offered a complimentary noodle dish but it was too spicy for the kids. Once the food service was completed they started the rubbish collection I tried to hand over the rubbish to the flight attendant as they passed me but was told to hang onto the rubbish until they got to me later. The procedure seemed to be collect the rubbish from the front then push the cart to the back and collect the rubbish front to back. When we arrived in Sydney our bags arrived quick and we were on our way.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,3,0
virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,Mark Simons,United Kingdom,2014-08-15,LGW-Barbados return. Issue with on-line check in not working was frustrating in that you went through the whole process entering passport details only to get a message on completion that the system was down. Also happened on return. A message at the outset would have been much more helpful. Check in agent at terminal was very jovial and pleasant and seating as requested was honoured. Outbound flight delayed by an hour due to passengers disembarking an AirNas flight. It was not possible to board the Virgin flight as there was insufficient space in the walkways! Seated in row 23 Premium economy. Friendly cabin crew handed out pre-flight drinks and menus. Good entertainment system with good choice of movies. Pre-dinner drinks served promptly. Meal service commenced and I was disappointed that my choice had already run out by time they served me leaving me with the vegetarian curry. I did not expect not to be able to have my choice in Premium economy. Uneventful flight which made up some time across the ocean. Return flight departed on time and landed early at Gatwick. Dinner was a creole chicken dish which was actually quite tasty. Cabin was far too warm making for quite an uncomfortable flight and too hot to sleep. Breakfast was pretty good - choice of continental or full English. Having landed early the gate was occupied so we had to sit on the aircraft for half an hour which was quite frustrating.

Cabin crew did nothing about it. Inflight entertainment good only it kept freezing. Seven bucks for internet access was steep so I decided to watch TV instead.

All flights were on time and used fairly new Airbus aircraft. Legroom was quite limited but no worse than other short haul flights. Inflight service was limited to a small bottle of water on the domestic flights; we got a small meal on the international flight but the quality was very poor even by airline food standards. I suggest eating beforehand - though not at the airport as options for food/drink at airports in Vietnam were surprisingly bad for a country with such great food.

First flight was on a 737-800. Very clean interior but seat pitch is tight. Second flight on an E-190. Once again the cabin was spotless and comfort on a par with other airlines which have this aircraft. Both sets of crews were efficient but not overly friendly. In economy you get free tea coffee or water and can buy other drinks and food prices of which are average for an LCC anywhere in the world.

Had plans to do things in Sydney and Adelaide. Trip was a disaster! At check-in in Melbourne was given another persons boarding pass despite girl checking my ID. Baggage labelled with other passengers name. I had to point error out and girl attempted to get bag retrieved. Promised it had been fixed. Luckily other passenger also going to Gold Coast as on arrival bag not on carousel. Found it at baggage services still with other passengers name on it. Meant I spent 45 minutes waiting for bag. Flight to Sydney delayed nearly an hour by fog but no delay information. No entertainment on any flight and food very poor! Has anybody actually been on a Virgin aircraft that has their mysterious entertainment system? A very small cold chicken pasta salad with a revolting chocolate mousse is not what I would call a Gourmet meal as Virgin describes it. Email then sent to my home address whilst away rebooking my flight home as direct at different time with arrival into Melbourne 5 hours before connecting bus home to regional Victoria. No phone call despite Virgin having my mobile number. Had to ring them to get flights changed. Would not put me back on flights I had booked and very insistent I flew on flight they wanted me to! Ended up being rebooked on flight via Sydney but still had to wait over 2 hours for bus. No way would they offer any compensation such as an upgrade to business class.

Stood there for 5 mins totally ignored whilst the attendant made a barrage of calls to remedy the situation without even a 'sorry to keep you waiting'. Flight OK but I find the Fokker 50s poor and noisy in comparison to the 146s. Overall the same level of mediocrity and couldn't give a stuff attitude that affects so many airlines these days.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,C Kinnear,Australia,2013-10-09,"Melbourne-Bali return in September. Probably won't use them again internationally. Flight leaving Melbourne was very delayed boarding. The flight was then delayed in departing by an hour - we sat on the tarmac for that time in a hot stuffy aircraft because 6 people had to have their luggage removed. Whilst the pilot was apologetic about this we were not offered any refreshments while we waited and the crew seemed to care less about passengers irritation at the delay. Check in itself at Melbourne airport was an exercise in inefficiency. 4 check in staff allocated to economy class passengers but with 4 international flights being checked in all at the same time the wait to check in was well over one hour. Very poor. The lady who checked me in appeared to be unsure about procedures and had to refer to her supervisor standing behind her. No ability to check in online either so check in was time consuming. I received a txt from Virgin before the flight saying that the wireless inflight entertainment would be available on my flight so I downloaded the app in anticipation - but the IFE did not work on the plane - the stewardess told me so when I asked. No apology from the captain or the head stewardess. It was a long boring flight up to Bali with no entertainment options and hungry passengers who expected to be able to purchase some snacks or food on board but there was nothing available for purchase. The meal was not served until 1pm (4 hours after the flight was scheduled to depart) - with nothing provided earlier in the flight other than a drink and with only 2 meal options one of which they ran out of early on. Why not have snacks available for purchase on flights of this length. Coming back on the redeye at 10.10pm was slightly better as the meal was served promptly departure was relatively on time and the IFE worked. Check in at Denpasar airport in Bali was a shambles. Virgin insist on your arriving at the airports to check in at least 3 hours' prior to departure time they do not have ground crew available to check you in until 2 hrs 50 mins prior to your flight. Long queues eventuated as a result. Check in was slightly quicker than in Melbourne however. Seats on the planes were comfortable but Virgin should be ashamed of using such small planes on these flights. There were only 2 toilets available at the rear of the plane to economy class passengers (there was one at the front but the crew refused to allow even ""desperate"" passengers to use this saying it was for business class passengers. There were ridiculous queues for the toilets as a result. The crew on both flights were generally not particularly friendly or helpful.

volaris,/airline-reviews/volaris,Volaris customer review,R Graham,Australia,2014-12-31,LAX-GDL then GDL-MEX. Nice modern aircraft on both legs. Flights were cheap which is why we went via Guadalajara - which is a pleasant airport for a quick layover. Boarding system is among the strangest I've seen - each seat is assigned a group with which to board (1-4) but the group assignment seemed completely arbitrary and not related to place in the cabin as would be expected. Also they make you line up in your group rather than just call one group at a time felt like primary school. Legroom is absolutely horrendous. I'm 6'2 and my knees were banged up against the hard back of the seat in front even before it had reclined. Would have been somewhat forgivable had the seat back not been so hard. The seat itself is also quite uncomfortable. I'd actually say this is probably the worst airline seat I've sat in. Staff are expectedly inattentive for a low cost airline. They're also very inconsistent with their decision to translate from Spanish to English - some announcements are more important than others obviously? The lady next to me on one of the flights ordered the buy-on-board nachos which looked awful (canned cheese plus corn chips) so I didn't bother with any of that. No inflight entertainment to speak of outside their magazine. Would recommend avoiding Volaris if you value legroom.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,2,1,1,NA,NA,3,0

No magazines or newspapers available on boarding.

I would happily have paid extra for more/better quality food. I would strongly recommend eating before boarding (as we had). Reasonable drinks selection. Decent range of inflight entertainment but handheld control had one broken button which made it very difficult to select options. Overhead locker space limited due to failure to enforce baggage rules (very large trolley cases allowed on board).

Padding on the seat was pretty much non-existent resulting in a rather numb behind after a short time into the flight. Also it's worth noting that it seems seats in A and K mostly have something under them for the in-flight entertainment system. This meant I had even less space to stretch if needed due to that being under the seat in front of me. The headrest was incapable of keeping the position of the wings that are on it collapsing the second you put your head against it. If the person in the seat in front puts their seat back it makes the experience even more claustrophobic - not to mention making it hard to use the screen for the in-flight entertainment. Not that that matters as the screen quality is so bad you won't want to use it anyway. Then there is the food - it's tasteless overcooked and there's not a lot of quantity to it.

The IFE was ok - the choice of movies was limited but what was available was pretty good (probably worth the $15 if you travel on saver). The food though on both routes was absolutely disgraceful. On the way over I was served with a Luke Mangan egg lettuce and mayonnaise wrap. It tasted disgusting and the label said that it was 5 days old.

Having had poor previous experiences with Vueling we were not relishing this trip and we were prepared to write another negative report. However this time we were not too disappointed. Yes the leg room is appalling and made even worse since the seats recline but I'm only 5-10 and I could cope for two hours. This trip was no better or worse than other ""no frills"" carriers. Check-in at Gatwick was very poor and the staff were slow and disinterested. Boarding was chaotic to say the least and this caused a delay. On the return leg it was much better. Easy (and early) check-in at BCN with a very pleasant young woman. Better organised boarding meant an on time departure. Cabin staff were pleasant and the catering was OK if a little expensive (captive audience !). We will be using Vueling again in September and we know what (and what not) to expect.

The outward trip was OK and only 20 minutes late arriving. However the return trip was pretty horrendous. At the prescribed departure time the screen at the gate just went blank. No Vueling staff to be found and no information. After about an hour and a half we eventually saw on the airport information screens (not from Vueling) that departure would be about three hours late. We eventually departed 3.5 hours late. When we boarded we found what must be the oldest plane in the fleet. Most of the seats around us were broken - every time the person in front moved the seat automatically reclined in our faces and crushed our knees.

Boarding for both flights was well handled by gate staff in both LGW and UVF and both flights departed and arrived on time with very little turbulence en route. Contrary to many comments I was very impressed with Virgin's new long haul economy seating as it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom. In addition I even managed to sleep for 6 of the 8 hours on the inbound flight to LGW which was great as I usually never manage to sleep on long haul flights. Amenity kits were also given out on the UVF-LGW night flight which was a nice touch. I especially liked the new IFE system offered on the new A330s as it is touch screen operated and is also very simple and quick to navigate with a good variety of films and music to choose from. Throughout both flights the cabin crew were friendly and were eager to go out of their way for you. Furthermore call bells were answered promptly and the service felt more personal than on previous airlines that I have flown with. However the only thing that is letting Virgin down is the quality of their catering. On both flights the food portions were far too small for long 8-9 hour sectors so I'd suggest bringing extra food with you if possible. In addition there was very little to choose from on both flights unlike other four star airlines such as BA and the snack service offered on board was very limited. All in all our first experience with Virgin Atlantic was by no means disappointing and we would certainly consider flying with them again. The new A330 is an excellent aircraft to fly on as it offers Virgin's latest long haul product and is also extremely quiet compared to similar long haul aircraft.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

We were upset about this and left to consider our options. We did not know that Vueling had cheaper fares if you paid cash. The person at the ticket office was very indigent and unhelpful stating that the check-in counters open at 4.00am! When we returned to purchase the ticket which was the only way that we could get to Malaga we were told by another person at the check-in that the offer was no longer valid as we only had an hour to accept her offer the ticket. We could not believe the response because under no circumstances were we told this information by the previous check-in person and because we did not go back within the hour we had to pay a much higher fare.

However Wizz Air urgently needs to restructure their boarding system at Luton people were pushing and shoving and there was a lot of confusion and mis-communication as to where we were supposed to line up. I think Wizz Air would benefit from establishing a seat allocated boarding system like Easyjet as this would put an end to the 'free for all' pushing and shoving issue. If you travel through Luton there are delays to almost every flight there are far too many Wizz Air flights leaving and arriving at the same time and as such this airport cannot cope with the huge surge in early morning traffic. Cabin crew were helpful as always. As usual there is now very little seat pitch on their latest A320's so you might want to consider paying for an extra leg room seat as there is virtually no room for your legs. TSR-LTN: Flew back to Luton on a new A320 as on outboard flight. The way boarding was handled in Timisoara was noticeably better than we experienced in Luton. Departure was on time and like before the crew were excellent. All in all Wizz Air is a good low cost airline much better than the likes of Ryanair and we will definitely continue to fly with them on our future trips to Romania.

Vueling managed to cancel one with three days notice and alter the other three. One flight they altered left us at BCN at 0130 on a Monday morning. Another they altered from Saturday to Sunday. To make matters worse we tried to rebook to different days and they wanted another 156 Euros. No reply to e-mails so eventually rang them on their Premium Rate phone line which cost £10. It cost an extra £400 to use this airline for our holidays this year in rebooked flights and additional accommodation and all without the slightest apology. I would have been cheaper to fly Club Class with BA. Use this airline at your peril.

Boarded fine got the seats plenty of room. Plane pushed back on both trips dead on time and left without a hitch.

Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed?

In business I was hoping for a much better experience. I'm a broad fella (and carry a few pounds) and found the seats a bit narrow. They reclined fairly well but the sleeping position was on an angle. Even with the foot stop folded out at the bottom I found myself waking up after having slid down the chair a bit and had to readjust. Satay at the start are nice the meals were a little ordinary. Cabin were friendly and attentive. Entertainment / movies were perfectly fine though there are better ones about with different airlines. The fold out TV and awkwardly positioned tray table head phone jack and power outlet are a sign of the old business class seat design more than anything else. In the end it is ""ok"" and I suspect that business on the A380 would be much better due to newer seats. I am convinced that the catering companies in KL (departure point) are not too flash as the standard of food on all my inbound flights in the past (including this occasion) has been better than my outbound flight.

scoot,/airline-reviews/scoot,Scoot customer review,M Fitzgerald,Australia,2013-05-07,Last Sunday morning we went to Gold Coast Airport bound for Singapore. On arrival we were greeted by a cheerful woman behind a separate Biz Counter who processed our details within a couple of minutes. When boarding was called the usual crowd surged to the front. As advertised there was a special entry aisle for Scoot Biz Class but it was hard to see because of the crowd. We were actually first on board and our seats were as planned. As soon as we sat down we were served with cold water with a friendly greeting. A lot has been said about the Biz Class seats and some of it sadly is true but travellers must remember the fare is about a quarter of what other Australian airlines charge and half of that charged by rival Air Asia. They don't leave a lot of elbow room and don't recline to the floor but they are on the whole fairly comfortable for the money we paid.

I have always been a big fan of Thai but have to say was left feeling disappointed on this occasion and will consider other carriers for our next trip. 747's are very old and looking worn out going out my IFE was broken. Food service has gone down hill with no extra little touches provided anymore and quality has diminished. Service - what has happened to that Thai Smile attitude - service was functional and once dinner was served cabin crew just sit in Galley chatting until breakfast service. I can see why Thai is losing out to the Middle Eastern airways and if someone from management actually reads these reviews I urge you to invest some of that amazing Thai hospitality back into your airline!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,2,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

Recliner would be ok but the width is very poor for a 12 hours flight in Business Class! Team great food - in case of the Shanghai trip very ""Chinese oriented"" and not typical for ANZ hopefully.

Meals were good (I was on Works which includes meal seat bag) when I went for the full meal deal. Cabin crew are a different story. These are disproportionately young (based on the equipment they're recent hires) with good intentions but not quite there. On one flight a passenger dumped his entire scotch and coke on me and the FA was too ""chilled"" in getting something to clean it up. Reeking of booze was not how I intended to arrive at my destination. Only an hour later I was offered a complimentary drink for my troubles. On another journey my seat light didn't work; the row in front had no IFE. We were all moved to new seats and required to move back for landing.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Williams Mark,United Kingdom,2014-06-20,MIA-LHR 16 June 777-200. Used miles to upgrade from economy. Call centre staff very helpful with this. Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight.

My complaint concerns insufficient overhead luggage space. As you know the passengers board from the back of the plane. I was in aisle #23 about mid-way on the plane. Yet by the time I boarded all the overhead space was taken. This is due to the incompetence of airline personnel who routinely allow people to take luggage on the plane that clearly exceeds the size limits.

On the outward flight we were at least presented with an aircraft that had rear seat entertainment facilities however the inward flight provided nothing more than drop down screens and sub-titled movies. Refreshments were scarce unless you wanted Sprite Coke Water or Orange Juice. Alcoholic beverages were nigh on non-existent. On the inward flight I couldn't eat the breakfast provided as it was neither aesthetically pleasing tasty nor appetising.

Our return departure was moved up by one hour due to time change. We were sitting in our room. They did not call us. The biggest part of this problem is the way the Sunwing rep handled the situation and told me I'd have to take a taxi to the airport. Made it to the gate just as boarding was starting. Sunwing needs to provide more time to get through the airport - seat designation as well as security takes a long time - there are a lot of people going through these vacation spot airports!

The flight to Barcelona at 10am was also cancelled due to ""technical fault"", they were taken to a hotel as were not leaving until next day. A thunderstorm that morning stopped planes from landing. Our plane went to Split instead. There was no announcement from airport, as airline didn't contact them- instead they emailed and texted passengers that morning and most had no wifi and phones were off. In the next few hours all the other airlines landed and took their passengers but not Norwegian. Instead of vouchers for food and drink were had one meal at 1pm (pasta and bottle of water) that was all, and we left at 8.30pm. We were told the plane would be leaving at 12.40am Thurs, I have since heard that it was delayed again to 6pm Thursday and passengers went to a hotel.

Flying Business Class has access to the Aer Lingus lounge in Dublin. Comfortable seating areas with the usual selection of snacks and drinks. Pre-clearance into the USA is an absolute positive if you fly via Dublin as once you arrive in the USA you pick up your bags and you're all set to go. Inflight service was excellent both ways. Attentive cabin crew who seemed genuinely happy to greet you. Pre-flight drinks were followed by hot and cold canapés and a substantial 3 course meal. Cabin crew continually topped up wine and water glasses without request. Seats are great in recline position and my only minor criticism would be that the flat bed is at an angle. Feels like you're about to slip of the seat however this is only a minor complaint in terms of the great service provided.

Transit at Minsk was impossible because the airport has no facilities to process transit passengers. All passengers with connecting flights were herded into a hot, stuffy room for an hour, until the man in a green uniform who had the key to the door to the main Minsk terminal decided to appear. By that time, most connecting flights had departed, including my flight to Kiev. Belavia staff tried hard, spoke little English, said I would have to sleep in the airport as my passport was ineligible for a transit visa on arrival, and travel on the morning flight to Kyiv 14 hours later. Nothing offered, not even a bottle of water for the inconvenience. To be fair it was the fact that Minsk airport does not work for transit passengers that was the issue, but Belavia must be aware of this and should not sell connecting flights.

I had the opposite experience to N Jeram though regarding crew - I thought the London based crew (of whom were comprised of several 'aussies' as well as other nationalities) far superior to the Melbourne based crew who were extremely indifferent and did not seem to want to be there.

We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment.

I chose business class and left the flight feeling that the customer care food and cabin comfort was good. The food which was better than previous flights. My return flight JQ23 from MEL to Tokyo NRT - a very disappointing experience in 20 years of business travel. Check-in was the best customer handling that I had experienced with Jetstar. Two hours later at the gate the boarding process was mismanaged and turned into a stampede of economy and business class passengers jostling for access at the same time. Staff were flustered and lost control. The cabin crew communication customer handling and courtesy was very good. I appreciated their efforts and acknowledge that Jetstar standards has improved. The worst Business Class meal - 3 choices chicken and noodle pea and cheese soup or Hamburger ""raked"" sliced pork. The meal arrived - the hamburger was a dry reheated toasted sandwich with two pickles and mustard. Not a hamburger. One thin slice of pork between soggy reheated toast and pickles. This was not an optional snack this was the main course standard for business class. It gets worse the desert was two shortbread cookies and no tea or coffee. The breakfast was good with fruit yoghurt juice. I requested tea which was cold. I hadn't realised that Jetstar had included an inflatable neck cushion in the the comfort pack - a thoughtful and beneficial improvement however when I tried to brush my teeth before landing the tooth paste was missing and there was no paper cups in the toilet. These basic products are important. I can't brush my teeth so the comfort pack became ineffective. Jetstar is a budget airline it is not Singapore Airlines so fair assessment is needed considering value-for-money. Jetstar has made many improvements with cabin crew and ground staff customer handling skills. As I confirmed in my flight ex-Japan Jetstar can provide good food that meets business class expectations. However the toasted sandwich and cookies main course has me questioning whether my next flight to Australia in August should be with another airline. Jetstar's weak point - it cannot sustain a basic standard the difference between the two flight experiences was huge.

wizz-air,/airline-reviews/wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,F Eriksson,Finland,2013-12-09,My family and I travelled Turku-Gdansk on Dec 4th and Gdansk-Turku on Dec 6th. I have only positive feedback to give to Wizzair. Cheap flights (GDN-TKU only 9.99€/passenger). FA friendly and very aware of security issues. Of course you get what you pay for. On GDN-TKU we actually paid more for one piece of luggage (15) than the cost of one passenger ticket. Flight to GDN on time. GDN-TKU took place on the day winter storm Xavier hit Poland so we really didn't know what to expect. However the flight took off about 30min delayed and landed in TKU almost on time. We believe that our WizzAir flight must have been one of the few flight that managed to take off almost on time in Gdansk that day. No worries about security during take off either.

air-mauritius,/airline-reviews/air-mauritius,Air Mauritius customer review,B Vancurova,United Kingdom,2014-01-07,We flew LHR - Mauritius in Business Class and back in Economy. Business class - nice lounge in Terminal 4 with plenty of food and drink. Boarding was separate to economy and very efficient. Seats comfortable with plenty of room and drinks offered before take off. There was option of 3 mains. The seat does not convert into fully flat bed but once I found comfortable position I managed to sleep for 8 hours. Economy class - seats have interesting shape but I found it comfortable. We were lucky that the people in front of us did not recline their seats so we had plenty of leg room. We did not watch the TV (as it was night flight delayed by 4 hours) so we just had food and slept for the rest of the flight. The crew were friendly and helpful.

Pillows and blankets waiting on every seat on the long leg (from Denver to Iceland). Bottled water to pick up on entry into plane and usual drinks served during flight. Luckily I read a review that mentioned you have to purchase food in economy seating so I brought my own. They should mention that more prominently when you book your flight. Also did not know about option to stay over in Iceland for a few days supposedly at no extra ticket cost but I didn't see this offer when I was booking. My only complaint was how little leg room there is on the Boeing 757-200 which is the long leg of the flight. The shorter leg (Iceland to Amsterdam) had the normal amount of leg room; it was a Boeing 757-300. You could always ask for more beverages as much as you like.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Vitalij Zabelo,Lithuania,2015-02-18,"I have no idea why they call travelling United ""flying the friendly skies"". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not. Since United has obviously different point of view in this regard I will avoid flying them next time.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,1,1,4,NA,NA,2,0

When my husband couldn't sit down there was much flurry of activity to find him somewhere he could fit.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,J Dean,United States,2015-01-11,"Tallinn to Milan first and last time flying with Ryanair. Ryanair is by far the worst airline I have experienced in terms of customer service fees and travel experience. This was our first time flying with Ryanair and after booking our flight we were traveling often without internet service when we got to the airport to check-in 2 hours before our flight we were informed that there would be a 70Euro fee/person! We had no email from Ryanair about the need to check-in online 2 hours before departure. The online check-in cut-off time is arbitrary as it serves no purpose other than a deliberate tactic by Ryanair to extort additional funds from paying customers who at that point have no alternative but to pay and board the flight. We then were forced to wait in a crowded gate area and our flight departure was delayed by over an hour. During our time at the gate several Ryanair ""customer service"" agents made their way through the crowd demanding that some passengers must check their carry-on luggage. Almost every passenger with more than one carry-on item was ordered to leave their additional carry-on at the ground by the plane to load in to the hold. After making our way across the runway in freezing rain and snow we slowly made our way up the outdoor stairs to the plane only to be met with a surly male steward who was talking with a staff member instead of greeting passengers. All of the staff were rude and only spoke to passengers to ask to purchase items. Every item including water was provided only for a fee. We arrived in Milan only to be told that we had to sit on the plane to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal. One bus came and filled with passengers. We were in the back of the plane so we had to wait another long period for another bus. Bottom line - this was the worst travel experience in my 30 years of global travel. Yes the airline industry has changed significantly to cut costs and keep fares reasonable but there is no need to intentionally make customers feel worthless. I will gladly pay more for a flight to not be extorted for additional monies and to have a smile and a friendly hello delivered by the airline staff.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Compared to 7 toilets for 288 passengers in Economy. The food was good but it is an Economy main course with different entree and dessert. However you are served first so there is no chance of running out of your preferred choice and your meal tray is collected as soon as you finish your meal whereas in Economy you have to wait. I really loved the staff both flights they were enthusiastic lovely and friendly and they came through the cabin through the flight I lost count how many times they came through with water or other drinks snacks more snacks. Very attentive staff! Could not fault them. If you were not too lazy to get out of your seat there was also the self service bar which was full stocked and was restocked throughout the 14hr flight with roast beef/chicken sandwiches soft drinks alcohol potato chips nuts etc. The entertainment was good because you can start watching TV shows or movies as soon as you sit down you don't need to wait until the plane is at cruising altitude.

Once the announcement had been made we were given a voucher for food and drink at one of the snack bars in the departure lounge. We took the voucher to the snack bar - only to be told that it did not include coffee. We returned to the Jetstar check in desk - only to find there was nobody from Jetstar around. We kept checking and there were no Jetstar representatives in the departure lounge from the time of the announced delay to the time of the eventual boarding time of 19.50. To make matters worse the return flight was also delayed. It was due to leave at 16.15 then an announcement was made informing us that the new departure time was 16.30. 16.30 came and went. No departure and again nobody from Jetstar around. We eventually took off around 17.00. I know this is much better than the previously mentioned delay but it's still a delay with no representatives of the company and no information.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Triton,United States,2013-07-23,VS007 and 008 from Los Angeles to London Heathrow and back. Overall very impressed. Service is excellent. Staff keep you well fed and hydrated even in economy. Obviously it's still airplane food. However the entrees were hot the salads were cold and everything they gave us was filling and edible. Seats are a mixed bag. On the way to London (on board an A340-600) I had a bulkhead seat. The extra legroom was nice but the seat was extremely narrow because it had the tray table and TV in the armrest. In addition to that the seatbelt (for some inexplicable reason) was extremely thick and padded. Between the thick armrests and the thick seatbelt I easily lost 3 inches of seat width. Spent the whole flight with my knees jammed together it was miserable. However on the flight back I was on a 747-400. I sat in the back of the plane where there are fewer seats per row giving more room overall. On top of that my seat had extra legroom for some reason (I'm not exactly sure why...) - I just know that it was one of the first flights I've ever been on that my knees weren't touching the seat in front of me. Entertainment was very good. The only problem I had was that on the flight out (in the bulkhead seat) the TV was stowed on the floor and the extended up in front of me. The screen had been repeatedly kicked and flickered in and out and the remote stopped working halfway through the flight. In the end I highly recommend Virgin. My recommendation is that if you choose to fly Virgin avoid the bulkhead seats. The extra legroom is not worth it.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1

As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see. Except for that minor thing, I would have given them 10/10, but I can only give them a 8/10",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,LHR to Manila via Doha,8,5,5,5,5,4,3,5,1
vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Nikki Maxwell,Australia,2012-08-19,Flew Melbourne to Paris return in business class. Extremely mediocre food and service on all legs bar the Paris back to Hanoi flight where they attempted to offer you your next course only once you had finished eating the one before. On all other flights the trays were presented in their entirety with offers of a first glass of wine along with tea or coffee - this on an 11 hour daytime flight. Still the cost was cheap and much lower than other airlines. It still wouldn't convince me to travel again with Vietnam as on every sector my arm rest was held together with duct tape on one flight part of the overhead panels were also being held together with duct tape and on the 2 different aircraft's I flew on the seats were uncomfortable. The foot rests only raised off the ground marginally so even when the seat back was in full recline your body is at a crazy angle - not conducive for sleeping.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2014-01-13,"IAH-DOH-MAA in Y. Check-in line looked horrendous at first but it moved well and we were on our way in about 30 minutes. I found it strange though that you first had to queue up for a baggage weight check then go to the counter and have your bags weighed again. IAH-DOH was in a B777-300ER. The 3-3-3 configuration that QR uses is far superior to the 3-4-3 setup that more and more airlines are using today as the extra inch or two of width provides a feeling of much more personal space. Seat pitch at 33 inches is also better than many long-haul carriers and as we had seats directly in front of a bulkhead had unlimited recline at our disposal which made for a more comfortable flight. I was able to get about 5 hours of sleep. Two meals are served with decent taste and quality and free wine beer and spirits available. I had heard horror stories about the transit procedure in DOH but found it quite painless and it took just 35 minutes to get from our plane through the bus ride and security and to our onward gate. Boarding process for our DOH-MAA leg was a bit chaotic. Boarding starts very early more than an hour before takeoff and you are initially herded into a holding area with far too few seats compared to the number of people. You are eventually boarded onto a bus followed by an extremely long ride to the plane at which point we were held for a further 5-10 minutes. Once on board everything was fine though I found the A330-200 considerably more cramped than the 777. The IFE box didn't help but the seats were also an inch narrower and with an inch less pitch. On both legs the IFE system is excellent with a wide variety of AVOD shows/movies and games along with a customizable flight map. Meal was the typical ""veg/non veg"" option you get headed to India and quality was not nearly as good as on the IAH-DOH leg. Service by the FAs was consistently excellent with every request attended to promptly and with a smile. Qatar offers a very good coach product overall and is a superior alternative to Emirates if you are headed to Asia or the Middle East.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

The single seat is extremely private and very spacious though was a little too hard to sleep comfortably on. The crew is extremely polite and efficient though so no complaints there.

Going out was no problem but coming back became a nightmare for him. His suitcase weighed 15.9kg at check in. His case was weighed on 3 different machines which all gave different weights. The person behind the desk was not helpful and told him he would have to pay 70 euros for excess my son informed the assistant that he had no hand luggage which would have given him a further 10kg. But all this person wanted was money from him my son's teacher then became involved. In fairness to him he himself refused to allow my son to pay the excess.

Also my travel companion was at the end of the queue but was allowed to take his bag same size as mine on board without problems. There was no logic at all.

One flight attendant abruptly placed the food tray stating 'only chicken' when another flight attendant actually had pasta. When questioned we were spoken to rudely. The toilets were not cleaned on other airlines they clean as you go. My wife mentioned to the flight attendants and their reply was 'you should see the rest of China' - we actually live in Beijing. They also said that she should wait until Beijing when it will be cleaned. Also in years past (18 years I have been flying with UAL) United had been much better.

Meals were ok but service was average. Didn't really see attendants that much. No inseat entertainment. you can rent portable DVD style players though. Cabin crew ran out of customs forms so you had to wait to land before these could be filled out which caused a delay at customs.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Clifford,United States,2015-01-28,MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,5,5,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,L Monks,United Kingdom,2015-04-06,We have flown with Emirates more than 20 times. In the last 4 months we flew Business Class 8 times and First Class once. We have experienced 2 great flights with them but 6 awful flights. Emirates call centre were disorganised and provided conflicting information when we called to try to make changes. The crew in general are by far the worst we have experienced on any airline (including budget airlines). On 4 of the recent flights my wife was pregnant. Emirates made very little attempt to make the flight any better for her. We have flown with Emirates various times over the last 7 years and have found the experience increasingly worse. The food in Business Class has been paired back so much that it is almost inedible. They have chosen to use extremely cheap bread and pastry products as filler. The food at Singapore Business Lounge was inedible I say this as a statement of fact not a complaint. I returned to the main terminal and purchased food and drink from there and brought it back into the lounge. The chauffeur service is also highly variable. At Singapore we were collected by an 8 year old souped up mini van (replete with flashing lights inside and worn out interior) instead of the limousine they promise. We fly a combination of Business and First Class when we use Emirates our reason for this is to try to avoid undue stress when travelling to or from a holiday destination. Unfortunately we have found that for 75% of the time we come home feeling frustrated. We are going to try BA and Virgin for our future trips - I would highly recommend avoiding ever using Emirates airlines.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,3,1,2,3,NA,NA,2,0

The seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. The service from the cabin crew was excellent. The leg from Heathrow to Toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. The seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. Whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. Unfortunately BA were let down by the attendants on the return leg from Toronto to Heathrow.

We had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this.

The steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. This had not appeared by the time I had finished eating my meal so I gave her the bottle from mine (My daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day) Shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,S Neuhauser,Austria,2014-12-04,Vienna-Dubai-Manila and return in Business all on B777. Emirates is decent 4-star airline. The night flight out of Vienna was as one would expect - quick dinner service (good meal but nothing special) friendly staff (always addressed me with my name) but seats are far too narrow for business class because Emirates squeezes a middle seat into the centre row. On arrival in Dubai we were bussed to the gate (out of 4 arrivals/take-offs 3 were from bus gates and the bus ride takes quite a while). The business lounge was a disappointment. It is fairly large as it stretches across almost the whole first floor of the terminal but it is rather narrow and dull it overlooks the shopping concourse below (noise) there are showers but they are tiny. Strangely I had to ask for a non- alcoholic beverage at the bar as only juice and water are freely supplied but all hard drinks are self-serve. The onward flight to Manila was on a noticeably older 777 in a two-class configuration. The staff performance on this flight was outstanding. On the return flight one of only two washrooms for C-class broke which lead to queues. The plane was spotless and new but cabin crew performance was below par. Coats and jackets were handed back some 30 to 40 minutes before landing some pax had to keep them over their knees as the adjoining seat was occupied. Drinks and snacks were taken away all of a sudden without warning due to landing (still some 30 minutes away). Generally I would recommend them although I still prefer Qatar or Turkish when travelling into Asia.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,3,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

On-time both ways (although I know this is not common for CEA). Plane was a new 330-200 with a well-equipped IFE. Very clean very nice. The flight was only about 40% full going to SFO and maybe 60% coming back. The stewardess told me that this was pretty normal for this flight maybe a combination of it being a new segment as well as the low season? I don't know but it was lovely. The regular economy seating seemed to have fairly spacious legroom but I didn't have to experience it since I was able to switch to the exit aisle on both flights. The gate attendant in PVG told me that there were no exit aisle seats available but they were clearly all empty when I got on the plane so I moved myself. On the way back the attendant in SFO was able to get me into an exit aisle seat with no fuss whatsoever and no additional fee either (looking at you US major airlines and your ""economy plus/economy comfort"" seat class). The Chinese on the flight preferred to try to get an entire empty row to themselves allowing them to lay down across the economy seats so there was no competition for the exit aisle seats. Service was friendly and polite (I speak Chinese so I can't comment on their language ability). Food was just average but not a deal breaker. Looking forward to taking this flight again. Also in SFO I was able to switch my return flight from SFO-PEK to SFO-PVG without any change fee since the original Beijing flight had me transferring in Shanghai anyway. Class!

We were told by the gate crew we would be reimbursed for cab fare or hotel fare and then had to go down and wait for our bags and then go through the whole check-in procedure the next day. Alitalia denied our request for reimbursement. While I understand weather is unavoidable I can't accept being lied to and shabby treatment. I think Alitalia could have handled this better especially since we had a 9.5 hour flight ahead of us with very little sleep. To add insult to injury there was a ground delay at ORD the next day which kept us on the tarmac for 2.5 hours after leaving the gate.

virgin-america,/airline-reviews/virgin-america,Virgin America customer review,A Skidmore,United Kingdom,2012-07-15,MCO-SFO 7/11/12. Not sure what I was expecting from this flight I guess being English I expect a 5+ hr flight to be treated as long haul and the service to match. Surprised when I saw they were using an A320 on this route by the end of this flight I struggled to straighten out. If you're over 6 feet tall I'd recommend paying for additional leg-room. Other than the leg room the seats were comfortable and the interior of the plane was very trendy. Mood lighting and condensation keeping the cabin relaxed with music whilst boarding gave a relaxing ambience. Entertainment system was impressive with a large range of on demand TV and movies (albeit at a charge). Being able to use the entertainment system throughout taxi take off and landing is a nice sensible approach. WiFi is pretty good and fast seems a little overpriced but it is a very fast service compared to other airlines carrying this feature. Main disappointment was that nowhere on my reservation did it mention there was no meal or snack provided during the flight so having boarded hungry I only managed to last 3 hours before purchasing a meal. Meals come as a large snack box which is very competitively priced at 7 dollars. Free soft drinks is a nice touch but alcohol is overpriced and being able to order drinks on demand from your seat is also handy when you're settled. Generally cabin crew were friendly and the pilot giving his announcement stood in the cabin adds to the edgy nature of end airline. Dressed down uniforms and a relaxed approach is a little different to other airlines but I think Virgin have found a good balance. All in all I would use them again but I wish they'd make a few of the inflight charges more obvious prior to ticket purchase. And 5 hours is a bit too long to be in such a small seat!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

The middle seat in a row fields down into a table but the seats don't recline any further than in Economy.

Fairly chaotic at Kiev - it was necessary to go through security again. Boarding was by bus - there was no special arrangement for Business Class. Food was OK but not exciting.

They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change.

Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers.

After that hour delay the captain stated that there was some issues with the plane's log so could not leave until that was fixed. Another hour passed and we finally pushed back from Gate at 8pm. We ended up sitting 15 minutes waiting for traffic to clear. We finally got in the air by 8.15pm. I have been flying for 25 years and never heard of a log book issue delaying a flight.

I used these last year on easyjet and Ryanair with no problems. This time on the outward flight all went fine. Things were very different on the homeward journey. At Budapest airport a very abrasive Wizz Air employee ask to see my boarding passes and then informed me that my bags were too large and that I had to pay £70 extra for them. She had a very unfriendly attitude and there was no discussion to be had. If I wanted the bags on the plane I had to pay £70. This was almost as much as our fares cost. A very unhappy end to a nice trip away. I don't consider Wizz to be a good airline to fly with. Any airline who set the case sizes fractionally smaller than the standard set by everyone else do so for one reason and one reason only. To catch out their customers.

I was in the window seat on row 50 (no windows) for two of the flights. Avoid these seats if you can as the side of the aircraft encroaches on your space and became uncomfortable.

Much to everybody's surprise there was a plane at the gate 5 minutes later. Upon boarding the plane our flight attendants showed their true colors and lack of professionalism of Allegiant Airline. They made light of the life preserver located under the seat in the event that ""the flight turns into a cruise"". That is not only an extremely unprofessional comment but it certainly did not sit well with an already anxious flyer. For our returning trip we arrived two hours ahead of our scheduled departure as instructed. When we attempted to check our bag we were kicked out of line along with everyone else on our flight because Allegiant could not ""handle"" us at that time. We waited another half hour before being allowed to re-enter the line to check our single bag. We hoped that was the worst we would have to deal with that day but sadly we were wrong. After boarding the aircraft we proceeded to sit on it for an hour and a half with no idea what was going on.

This actually makes online check-in a bit useless. The short flight to Zurich is not very pleasant as I really don't like to be flown on those Avro planes. Service is ok for such a short flight even though there was a lack of standards like napkin with the drink or even a cup with the water bottle. They don't serve snacks in economy on a 40 min flight. Unusual for somebody used to the local carriers excellent service. Zurich airport is fantastic! Quiet well organised and nice to look at. The long haul flight to MIA was of good standard. IFE is slow and a bit old fashioned. Service and food was ok for a 10 hours flight. The two girls on our side of the plane were very friendly courteous and helpful. I have to point out the impeccable state of the restrooms throughout the flight! Arrival in MIA was hassle free as we were the only international flight arriving at that time (6pm) and all immigration officers were there only for Swiss. Return from LAX also no drop-off zone for baggage again pre- checked-in online. Treated ourselves to a paying upgrade into business class. The seats are nice and good. Not my favourite though. The food concept is ok and especially the service routine for breakfast was confusing to me: No information about the options on the menu card which makes it even harder to pick a choice from the service cart and it all was on demand. Espresso service is great! All of the cabin crew were really nice caring and friendly. The downturn was the 'maitre de cabine' who was rushing down the aisle with her service cart and lacked proper service enthusiasm and should have taken her team as role models.

The flight attendants were rude and treated us without much respect. If you ask them a question or if you ask them for a service they give you a look as if they have been insulted. When paying for a drink the selection of liqueur is extremely poor. Their website is of substandard quality and lacks features of many other airline websites. For example when checking in online from the US it won't allow you to send your boarding pass to your mobile phone to check in with. It won't allow you to put your pass ID for TSA pre-check so you won't be able to use the TSA pre-check lanes at security check in. When asked them why they don't offer these features now standard on all other North American airlines the answer was a simple ""we just don't"". On the plane the seats are extremely old and worn out.

Also no AC when the plane was on the tarmac in Cairo. All passengers should be asked before being allocated an emergency exit seat. The entertainment was almost non existent. I am not quite sure why they bother to distribute head sets. The food was also just average. All in all a rather nasty experience.

On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,3,2,1,NA,NA,2,0

I always take UO622 dep HKG 7.10 to go to Japan and UO623 dep HND 1.10am coming back. I used to fly CX to HND but prices have really gone up over the past year. Overall I'd give 3 out of 5 stars for my experience. Prices are of course much cheaper than CX and I appreciate that. 2) Flight attendants are professional courteous and the service is good (not that there are many opportunities to get ""served"" since HKE doesn't offer complementary beverage/food service nor does it offer inflight entertainment). 3) The HKG-HND-HKG flights I've taken have always been on time. 4) Flight times are much more convenient than the CX flights. However 1) Seats are uncomfortable - it's an LCC after all! This doesn't really bother me for the inbound flight which is 3.5 hours but I do end up feeling exhausted after the outbound which is a 4.5 hour redeye. I find the ""sweet seats"" located in the exit aisles a really bad deal - you get the (slightly) extra leg room but your seat has zero recline. 2) Baggage fees: I've noticed that more recently they've started to enforce their baggage rules much more strictly. Hand baggage may not be more than 7.7kg. If you don't sign up for checked in baggage in advance (online when you buy your ticket) you will be charged an arm and a leg at the airport. This happened to me during my last trip and wouldn't have bothered me (rules are rules after all and these fees are part of the LCC business model) had it not taken 1 hour to receive my bags at Hong Kong airport. 3) Long wait for baggage - This last point is apparently an every day occurrence with HKE at least at Hong Kong airport. They are working with a small staff and small planes so your bags will routinely take an hour or so to arrive at Hong Kong airport baggage claim. This is needless to say frustrating though not the biggest deal in the case of UO623 since you have to kill an hour or so after the flight lands anyway (the first Airport Express to Hong Kong station doesn't leave until 5.54am and UO623 lands at around 4.40am). 4) No mileage programme.

Flight was delayed by an hour due to weather in the Philadelphia area but we were kept informed of changes which was good. Boarding was nowhere near as stressful as I imagined (compared to the UK low cost carriers) and managed to get a window seat. Seats are very comfortable with adequate legroom certainly as much as any other airline in economy. Crew were very friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Free soft drinks and as many snacks as you wanted were given out though no IFE. This flight had WI-FI which was good.

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,H Yaacob,Singapore,2015-05-11,SIN-HEL-AMS. HEL sector was operated by a refurbished A343. Seats were fairly comfortable with sufficient legroom and width (I'm a 5'10 for your reference). IFE selection was nothing special but had a good spread of films and TV shows to keep one entertained for 11 hours. Muslim meal consisted of local Singapore food which was alright. My main complaint would be the lack of beverage service throughout the flight. Attendants came out sporadically offering cups of water. Security and passport control in HEL took 15 mins. AMS departure was delayed for 40 mins. Explanations were only given prior to boarding which I felt was unprofessional. Irritatingly it seemed as if there was no effort to speed up the boarding process to make up for lost time. Flight was operated on a new A321. Felt like a low-cost carrier as there were no amenities whatsoever except for free water and juices on this 2.5 hour flight. CDG-HEL-SIN. HEL sector operated by an A321 with no flight amenities again. Flight departed on time and the connection in HEL was very quick. SIN sector operated on a refurbished A343 and was similar to the outbound flight. However the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to broken ground equipment. Updates were given by the captain which was nice. Food was extremely bland. The muslim meal consisted of the same dish for both dinner and breakfast. Overall the experience was nothing to shout about. Finnair got the job done at a significantly lower price. However the delayed flights on both journeys and the no-frills intra-Europe flights may make me hesitant to fly with them again as they were not that much cheaper. Nonetheless if you are on a tight budget I would recommend Finnair.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,3,2,4,NA,NA,3,1

I made sure to read all the FAQs and policies and had no problems whatsoever with Spirit. The folks who complain about the price don't read. With the base price and the charge for the check-in bags my son and I flew from LAX to Houston at a cost that was far less than other airlines. And it was a very good experience. I don't care to pay for any extra frills so Spirit works best for me. This year I am flying with Spirit again to Houston.

On the KUL-HKT sector an old 737 was used. We were served the most disgusting soggy roll. At least on this sector the cabin crew were a little more friendly. On the return from HKT to KUL a newer 737 was used the food was quite nice and the cabin crew were friendly. The last flight from KUL to MEL was on an old 777-200.

With Spirit a carry on (not check in that's more) costs 50$ each way if you pay online and $100 each way if you pay at the gate a small water bottle costs 3$ and poor quality snacks even more. The worst part was when I checked the flight status before heading to the airport the flight said on time. When I got here I found out that it would be almost 6 hours late. Even now over an hour and a half after the scheduled departure time the Spirit airlines website is still showing that the flight is on time.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Seah Wy,Singapore,2014-09-10,"I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). ""Can you please wait"" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger's seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you'll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you'll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because ""we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice"". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get.

We got a full meal and a sandwich going one way and a meal a sandwich and ice cream going the other way - all several steps above edible. Free booze on the longer legs too! (Various little bottles of spirits plus the house red/white wines. Wines merely drinkable spirits were fairly classy considering we were in coach and they were free.

Zurich airport by contrast is surprisingly a bit of a madhouse but while the lines there were long once we figured out which line to stand in it also moved remarkably quickly so we weren't in line for too long. I would definitely fly with SWISS again unless one of the other small handful of respectable airlines were way cheaper. That said not everything was perfect: their website was having issues all the time (we had to call to get our confirmation numbers and to reserve seats because their web reservation system was all kinds of buggy).

The first flight from Amsterdam to Barcelona was canceled and we never received notice that it was to be cancelled until arriving at the airport. Another flight was not available and they did absolutely nothing to provide any support or help. A long line of angry and displeased customers got the same ""we can't help you"" position after 45-60 minutes in line. Then we had already booked another flight with them from Barcelona to Naples a week later. I checked in advance and it was on schedule before we left to the airport. We arrived at the airport and sat waiting. The intercom announcement to go to the gate was heard by us and other passengers about 4 minutes before the departure time now maybe 30 minutes late. A long line of passengers stood in line until past the departure time only to learn from one of the passengers who called Vueling that the flight had been cancelled. They actually called the passengers to the gate and then left them there without telling them the flight was cancelled or anything nothing no word. This is one of the most ridiculous airline experiences I've ever had. Then the airline could not help us get out of Barcelona to Naples for another few days no offer of a refund or anything. One of the clerks for the airline even had the audacity to tell me that I shouldn't expect more as it is a discount airline.

Seems rather clear that the company does not put customer service first in it's training and is focused instead on maximizing the income generated from each passenger. My biggest problem is the poor attitude of the check-in staff at DFW airport. There is a women who protects the gate opening to the ticket counters who should not be employed anywhere let alone in a customer facing role. I wanted to get a seat re-assignment which could not be done at a terminal and i was questioned and probed as if I was up to no good.

Yes sometimes the attitude of the staff can be not up to expectations or the food not comparable with some of the Asian airlines but the price you pay for a business class seat with BA is unbeatable. And for me a flat bed on an overnight flight is what matters the most. Contrary to general recommendations when I travel with a companion I prefer the middle seats on the main deck and not the upper deck because by using the screen you can have your own little intimate cabin. And if the flight is not full is so much better than the claustrophobic upper deck. Strongly recommended for a discounted ticket.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

One reason we chose the carrier was for the Dreamliner service on the 10 hour flight to Europe and we decided after adding on all the extra charges to take the plunge and go for the Premium seats. I can't really say how bad 'Norwegian Air' was as we never flew them except for the leg from Copenhagen to Nice. Instead of the Dreamliner we ended up on a Portuguese charter 777 run by Euro Atlantic Airways. We got nothing the antiquated system on this plane didn't work. When was the last time you had an ashtray in your armrest? The food was inedible - even for airline food. The crew were on the verge of hostile and the seats were worn and uncomfortable.

Flew to SEA on American Airlines code share first class. Check-in with American was very busy and the luggage conveyor belt was broken at first class check-in. The agent knew nothing about Hainan but managed to check my bag through. Arrived in Seattle and went to the British Airlines Terraces lounge where I was told Hainan hasn't used the lounge for over 4 months and that their lounge was in the other terminal about twenty minute walk each way. The Hainan gate agent first said that she wouldn't recommend that I go to the lounge because of the distance but then wrote me out an invitation. The business seating on their A330 is 2-2-2 in two cabins. We were served snacks and non-alcoholic welcome drinks pre-departure. The seats are lay flat and they do make up the seats with pads sheets and a fluffy comforter. Additionally they offer pyjamas - nice touch. Although no menus were distributed and the English language skills of the flight attendants is very poor the food was good both Western and Asia selections. Beverage service and selection is extremely limited. It took over one hour after reaching cruising altitude before any beverages were served. The beverages on offer were extremely limited. One type of champagne white and red wine. No premium brands. Liquors were also extremely limited. Transfer in Beijing was horrible. Hainan ground agents told me that I had to clear immigration and customs and collect and recheck my check bag. While waiting a general service agent came up to me and in perfect English said that I should go to the departure counter as my bag would not be coming off. It was checked all the way through but Hainan agents are all too new to know this. The lounge on the website is not one that was offered. They only show the first class lounge and business class is contract hosted in a rather dated lounge. The only food on offer was soup or pastry and beverages were also limited. There was a shower facility with limited amenities. The A330 had the new staggered business class seating. Again no menus and the flight attendant English poor. No premium cocktails available only two types of beer one red wine and one white wine. No champagne. No Fast Track access provided. The fare was cheap but you get what you pay for.

Booked via Austrian Airlines to VIE as part of a trip to Macedonia. 6am departure meant an early arrival at Heathrow. Had printed boarding passes so straight to fast bag drop which never lives up to its name with any airline. People in front had problems with excess overweight baggage children or groups trying to sit together. Eventually get to the desk and have my printed out boarding passes replaced with proper ones! Not much open at Heathrow and was worried about food onboard. At T1 the first shop you see open is a Costa and its likely to have a long queue. Walk deeper into the terminal and there is a Pret that was also open with no queue. Gate was miles away. Boarding was slightly later than anticipated but handled by rows. Comfortable seating onboard. Once airborne there is a drink run and food service - a hot egg cheese and tomato panini which would rank as one of the most tasteless meals I've had on an airline. Given that this was a 2 hr breakfast flight more could have been provided. I remember flying BMI from LHR to AMS and they served a full hot breakfast in 45m of flying time. Here there wasn't even a second drinks run. The crew seemed intent on clearing up before most people had even finished their breakfast! Crew were fairly robotic. The service aspect of flying seems to have departed this airline on its race to the bottom. Marginally better than my first easyJet flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1

Our flight was supposed to take off at 5:45 got delayed to 7:45 delayed again until 8:30 and we finally took off round 10:30pm. This was not due to weather or any unforeseen circumstances it was all SATA's doing. The flight was half full so we think they were trying to get another feeder flight into the flight from Lisbon to make the flight more profitable. Apparently the same thing happened to the flight earlier in the week. They covered dinner at the Ponta Delgada Airport which was nice but they did not cover anything else. We missed our connection in Boston had to stay overnight (at our own cost) and pay higher fees for new tickets the next morning. They said that is was not their policy to cover any other travel issues for any of their customers even if the issues were caused by SATA. Interesting that they promised to upgrade us to Business Class if it was available but when the time came they said they could not - even though seats were available. They said that there were not enough Business Class dinners and as a result they could not let anyone sit in those seats (even if the passengers didn't care to have dinner or were OK with a Coach Class dinner). We were both surprised and astonished but could do nothing since they are the only carrier that goes to the Azores. We will try to avoid this airline at all costs.

The electronic seat adjustment device of a great number of seats did not really work so you had to put up with some awkward seating positions. The most unusual sight was a passenger nearly lying flat on the seat during landing after several staff tried in vain to put the seat in an upright position. Another highlight were the attempts of several cabin staff members to unlock dining tables with spoons. In the end they succeeded. The meals did not really offer inflight dining experience it was more business as usual - nothing worth mentioning. On the whole we had the impression that for this unimportant route written off aircraft's are used whose cabin maintenance leaves a lot to be desired.

Understandable and thank you for looking out for our safety.

American Airlines had opened seats so we chose to pay $1200 to fly home on December 29 rather than spend so much just waiting for Continental to be able to get us home - to our surprise Continental was selling tickets to new passengers and was able to get new passengers on a flight out the following day from when ours was cancelled but they were making us stay another 8 days to be able to use our original ticket.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

We will never fly with them again! The middle of July comes around and we receive a phone call from US Airways saying they cancelled the flight we booked so we needed to choose a different flight. The only two options available were to either leave and come back the same dates but the travel time was 2 days worth each way or to leave a day early and get a hotel to be able to make it on the next flight leaving the following morning. The second option was our only reasonable choice out of the two. By leaving a day early this meant that my husband and I were going to have to miss an additional day's worth of work. We asked the agent if we could be compensated with a free hotel stay or for our bags and her answer was no. When we get to the baggage check in counter they tell us that we still need to pay for our bags. We stood there arguing with them that we already paid for our bags online. 30 minutes later this was finally straightened out. On our way back from Aruba we ran into the same issue with baggage fees (which we ended up having to pay for twice). We fly into Philadelphia to find out that our flight to Chicago has been delayed 5 hours which puts us getting into Chicago at around 2.00 am.

I would describe Icelandair as an international equivalent of Southwest: one gets a basic but honest service. Two checked pieces of luggage are included in the ticket price so that passengers don't have to scramble for space in the overhead bins. I allowed myself the luxury of an overnight stay at the Icelandair Hotel in Keflavik. This added to the price of the trip to be sure but I arrived relatively rested and without jet-lag.

Also they recently changed their US/Asia route to also require payment for alcoholic beverages for those not in business or first-class. Travelling from China to the US quite often the 13+ hour flight seems even longer now that I have no control over what I can watch and no free drinks to ""shorten"" the travel time. In addition to these new changes the United crew has always been less than pleasant. It seems that the passengers are an inconvenience and I have heard the crew yell at each other on more than one occasion.

Out of Amsterdam it was very good. The sole was one of the best meals I have had on an aircraft in years. My only negative is the departure gate in Schiphol. Security is cleared at the gate. This meant the flight was called an hour and a half before departure. All the passengers were squeezed sardine lik in the tiny waiting area. There was not enough seating.

It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,Dennis Haggett,United Kingdom,2014-07-27,Travelled to the Dominican Republic on 25 May 14 premium cabin seats 1g and 1j on the Dreamliner both ways. These seats yes had more than adequate leg room but that's all not comfortable the recline is not adequate very worn out for such a new plane TV screens lose and dirty. This plane really has not a lot to offer and all the hype given to it is not justified. The food choices both ways ran out so you didn't get what you preferred to eat drinks selections again ran out. There were people coming through from economy to use the toilets in premium and staff weren't able or bothered to prevent this which meant that there were lines of people waiting. To top everything off on the inbound flight on the 8th June to Gatwick there was no water so no hot drinks or hand wash facilities in all this was supposed to be an experience for my partner who had never flown long haul to remember. It certainly turned out that way for all the wrong reasons and was not worth the near £600 it cost for the upgrade. Never would I recommend upgrading to anyone and in fact will never use Thomson again no customer support or service when we raised our concerns with them.

The food was good service was good and although there was not tons of leg room I was comfortable enough (I am only 5' 2""). The way back to Chicago from Narita was a nightmare. I had a seat next to my husband and all was fine at first till the Asian woman in front of me reclined her seat over halfway. On the flight there I had mine reclined about 1"" and when asked by a Stewardess to move it for the man behind me I did even though it was not mealtime. This woman would not move at all and the Stewardess would do nothing and even as a short person I was uncomfortably cramped. I asked the woman and the Stewardess for help but was ignored by the woman and told by the Stewardess she could do nothing. Then mealtime came they made her move and after the meal I put my pillow against the window and went to sleep. When I woke up (because I was in pain) her seat was all the way reclined and my legs were all cramped up. I asked her and the stewardess again with no result. I finally went and stood in the back of the plane and refused to sit in that seat unless the woman moved. I talked to the Stewardess explained that when asked to move I did explained I was in pain and said I paid just as much for my ticket as the other inconsiderate woman did. After standing there about 20 minutes they finally gave me a seat on the other side of the plane (which was a lot more roomy and the people over there were considerate). Nothing would have been done had I not forced the issue and I did not appreciate being treated that way. I will not fly JAL again not even in a higher class that was hands down the worst experience I ever had on a plane.

The first flight was delayed by over 3 hours due to technical issues with the plane which was falling apart and must have been at least 20 years old. There was no apology from the surly crew who wanted to do absolutely anything but their jobs. After finally taking off we were served some stringy stew which left much to be desired (although beers/wines were provided free of charge). Seats were horribly uncomfortable and the leg room unacceptable for a 5 hour flight. During the hours spent on the tarmac at Luton the crew were completely unwilling to help us in our attempts to contact Atlasjet reservations - we'd realised by this point that we'd be missing our connection and needed to re-book. Upon landing in Istanbul 3 hours behind schedule we found we'd missed our connecting flight - we had already accepted this would be the case and so were unsurprised but when we went to Atlasjet's ticketing desk to ask to be moved to the next flight we were told it wasn't their problem and as per their terms and conditions we would have to pay for a new flight. We couldn't believe that despite our delay being entirely their fault they were unwilling to move us to the next flight. We ended up forking out over £100 per person to continue on to Izmir with another airline.

B777-300 in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new. Very tasty meals were served in both directions and the Turkish Delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch. Good choice of drinks offered with the meal although it's true to say that they don't regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley (to be honest there aren't many airlines that do these days - especially in economy) all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! The AVOD offered a good choice of TV and movies - the 4h flight passed very quickly. It's worth remembering however that some of the flights from London use smaller B737 or A320 family aircraft and may not have personal TVs in economy. The 11.40 and 16.10 flights from LHR generally use A330s / 777s. We have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the 777.

However the inflight catering was abysmal tiny portions of barely adequate food. The complimentary glass of wine was almost undrinkable. The inflight entertainment was hopeless and immediately forgettable. Return flight was in the older version of the A330 with screens in the middle of the plane every ten rows. No escape from inadequate films. Trying to sleep was impossible being woken every 20/30 minutes with some announcement or other. Again there was a prohibition on the consumption of duty free drinks - alcoholic or not. However there was seemingly no limit to the amount that could be bought from the trolley as evidenced by a group of youths occupying two rows of seats.

The first was on October 2013. This review is about my last flight in August 14. I was flying from Houston Texas to LAX. There was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about 2 hours. I understand there are natural disasters out of the airlines control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they could use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate peoples needs. Once we were in the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out! That was pretty much my only option. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn't work. So we waited once again to be let out. Finally it was time to go get my luggage which was taken from me in Texas because there was no more room for my bag. I was the last one on the flight because they had a computer glitch and they couldn't find my seat. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the problem. They didn't tell me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once I arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seem to be many other problems last night. Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told to go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane! It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another Inited employee where I could get my luggage and again with an attitude she said ""Obviously it's right there can't you see it?"". I told her their screens are broken so no I can't see it. Most United Airline employees are rude disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job.

The same issues noted on previous reviews existed - cramped seats old shows/movies minimal cabin service inconsistent temperature aisle space must only barely meet standards reading lights not working (quote from an attendant ""working reading lights are not an airline safety requirement"" which was the response I got when I finally tracked down 2 attendants who initially both said they would check out why the lights weren't working or get me a mobile reading light and who never got back to me). We have decided to use our remaining Aeroplan miles on non- Air Rouge flights and then book with Westjet or US airlines for future trips.

For a low cost airline I was impressed with the online booking system inflight comfort (leather seats good legroom free IFE (bring your own headset or buy one on board) and connecting flight service. The shows/movies were a mix of Arabic and English as was the audio channels (x2 English only). All flights left and arrived on time. The area I found a bit inconsistent was the cabin crew. On some flights the crew were attentive and knew what they were doing. By contrast on other sectors the cabin crew had an ""I don't know"" attitude. Of particular concern was on the flight out of SAW whereby the safety demonstration was still being played on the IFE as the plane took off! Can't blame the pilots here but begs the question as to what an Earth the cabin crew were doing! For a young airline they have an excellent product but need to make their service a bit more consistent. The product comfort in terms of seats and IFE are amongst the best I've seen on any narrow body aircraft and provided they keep the prices low I'd highly recommend them.",NA,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Boarding in Amsterdam was the horror - more than half an hour at the business class check in and total mess in the departure area. AMS-SVO was okay. Old B767 clean but worn no entertainment nice food the crew unengaged and strangely non-relaxed. Transfer in SVO had slightly improved since the last time but the same one has to get all the luggage travel with it about 1 km and check in again. The navigation system in the terminal is confusing but manageable. Business lounge in the domestic departure terminal D is small heavily smelling with tobacco and a strange selection of food - basically only rolls and cookies. A bit more food is available from the bar for extra pay. SVO-KJA a new A321; the seats were standard economy class with standard pitch which was a bit painful in the overnight flight food good the crew was slightly more attentive to passenger needs. The return flight was the same with the only comment that business lounge in the Terminal F is way worse than in the Terminal D - not clean even stronger tobacco smell and no food at all but Terminal F is terrible in itself so no big surprise. It is a recommendation for this route but only because this is the only option available.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,3,3,5,3,2,NA,NA,2,1

After arrival back in Manchester the two captains and first officer were happy for me to join them in the cockpit for some photographs and a brief chat about the aircraft.

It was like watching a grainy black and white picture that was so dark you had to strain your eyes to see (when the cabin lights were off when they were on it was impossible to see!) It wasn't just my seat my colleagues was the same and I could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of TVs in your cabin not just a problem with mine. The tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. The table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight - it wasn't even turbulent. Power sockets on a flight originating in the UK and run by a UK airline should be UK sockets not US sockets! The food was adequate but nothing special I've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this! Furthermore my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold but frozen solid! It had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit! Finally when the Club World cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry there's none in this trolley so you can't have any. All in all this isn't the level of service that I expect when paying nearly £3000 for a flight.

The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin.

When I arrived to the airport 2 hrs in advance I could not find my flight in the list. On information desk they said tha my flight was rescheduled from 17.20 to 20.35. There was no sign of delay on the schedule screen and at 14.00 there were no notices about the delay on the company's site - it appeared much later. The contact center could not comment the delay and sent to the company's representative in Varna Airport. In the airport they could not provide any information either. Later on we discovered that due to the low volume of passengers our flight was combined with the flight going from Tel-Aviv to Varna via Burgas (which of course, the company was aware of much in advance). No services were forseen for the passengers in delay. A lot of passengers were with small babies and with connecting flights to other destinations from Moscow. There were at least two options for such passengers to depart earlier with other companies but Bulgaria Air refused to change tickets saying that the flights were fully booked and there were no tickets (while there were tickets available on the sites of these companies). After a 1.5 hours of battle with Bulgaria Air representative, they agreed to provide water and a sandwich. But they provided no sitting places for the passengers and no check-in till 18.35. So that the passengers had to organize on their own at least to safeguard the luggage (so that single moms and other travellers could go to bathroom or caffeteria without bags). Just some time before 20.35 they re-scheduled the flight again - till 21.00. But at 21.00 the only airplane in the airport departed for Minsk (not for Moscow) leaving small kids and their families on the ground on their feet for over 5 hrs by that time. As a matter of fact the company organized additional juice and water distribution to passengers - this was instead of hot meals and hotels which the company refused to provide.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,M Ishwara,Malaysia,2014-12-22,KUL-MEL-KUL. The outbound flight to MEL was perfect and in-flight service was top notch. However the inbound flight to KUL was less than ideal. There was at least a 75 minute delay out of MEL. I think this is to do with day-light saving time (1hr) in MEL plus a bit more. I think it is the airlines responsibility to adjust and advertise the correct departure times in cases such as this. I was not informed when I checked in over the web or the counter staff at the baggage drop. However given the price out of KL I would fly this airline again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,4,5,3,NA,NA,4,1

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Analise Fagan,United States,2014-08-08,I booked a straight flight from Washington Dulles to Toronto CA. Keep in mind that this was a weekend trip and I was supposed to return Monday afternoon. My departing flight was scheduled for 3.20pm and we boarded around 4pm. The pilot announced that the door could not close completely so we had to wait for an Engineer to fix it. We waited on the plane for an hour. The Engineer came and it took an additional 30 minutes. We got on the runway then the pilot announced that Toronto had issued a no-fly restriction due to severe thunderstorms. We waited on the runway for an hour. They took us back to the terminal and after about 2 0minutes it was time to take off again. We got back on the runway went to the same spot to prepare for take-off when the pilot announced that Toronto Intl. issued another no-fly restriction and we had to wait 30 more minutes. So we did. Then later they called the plane off the runway and cancelled the flight. It took 2 hours to get to customer service so they could help me get on another flight. The Agents were so rude and barely attempted to help me find something that would take me to Toronto that night! Ended up booking me on a 5.45am flight Saturday morning. I left Washington Airport at 11pm. Saturday morning I got on a connecting flight through Texas. What was supposed to be a straight flight to Toronto took 6 hours! To make matters worse my new booking was out of Reagan Airport so I had to adjust my return flight. They gave me a flight back on Air Canada (the Toronto to Chicago leg). I stood in line to check in and learned from the agent at Air Canada that United never officially reserved the seat for me. I had to run to United get them to reserve the flight give me a print out so that I could return to Air Canada. I connected in Chicago. The United flight from Chicago to DC was hour late. I lost time money and sleep. United had no compassion and was unapologetic.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

jetblue-airways,/airline-reviews/jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,C Walsh,Canada,2015-01-19,Flew jetBlue Mint class New York to LA and return. Overall a great experience. Was seated in 2A one of four 'single suites.' Very comfortable and private especially when reclined with the suite door closed. The only picky comment is there tends to be some wasted space owing to the single seat configuration and the design could have accommodated a greater seat width. You're also removed from the window so mindless gazing is not really an option unless you unbuckle and lean. The perks in Mint are outstanding not just the lie-flat seat with massage feature but the food and beverage selection amenity kit service from the flight staff and the large video screen. As mentioned in previous reviews not touch screen but that didn't really detract from the experience - you couldn't even reach the screen necessarily when fully reclined. Okay selection of feature films but not VOD. The DirecTV feed is great however and really gives no reason to claim you're bored. The wi-fi complimentary at the moment was hit and miss; fairly good responsiveness when working but did suffer from numerous interruptions. Personalized and attentive service was prominent on both legs and flight time seemingly flew (no pun intended) by. At the current introductory price point Mint is outstanding value. Inevitably jetBlue will adjust their fare pricing to reflect the reality of what is offered however even at a higher cost Mint class should be seriously considered before looking at intercontinental business class on other airlines. jetBlue and its staff should be proud of the Mint product and I will look for any excuse to fly Mint class again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,Richard Moller,Canada,2014-09-24,Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked “Priority” were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,4,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

Cabin seemed new, leather and seats reclined nearly but not completely flat. Food was a disaster and my expectations had been raised by the greeting. I ordered the veal (a mistake) and it was tough as I expected but the sauce that was on it was so salty that it was inedible. My traveling partner did not eat as he was asleep. When I asked for something else, I was told that only pre-made cheese plates were left and they all have blue cheese on them to which I am allergic. After that, it seemed that everyone was busy and no beverages or anything else was offered for the remaining four hours of the flight. When the plane was landing, I was asked for feedback and I said that I was hungry since they had no other food. The FA said they did have more food, and offered me something but at that point the trays had to be stowed, etc. I am not sure why this was handled so poorly, I was polite and understand that the crew does not make the food. Even some bread or any other option would have been appreciated and since the person I traveled with did not eat and some seats were empty, it seems odd that they thought they ran out of all other food options.",A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Abu Dhabi to Venice,1,4,2,1,3,3,NA,2,0

I've done this journey once a year for three years now and have to say this year almost felt like a whole different airline. Last couple of years the journey has been ""acceptable"" but you did feel they were happily benefiting from a route with few competitors. This year it's like they've completely refreshed their service offering. Really impressed and for the first time I felt it really lived up to the idea of a ""boutique"" airline. Experience started at check-in in BKK - great ground crew and changing to an earlier flight was effortlessly carried out with a simple $20 surcharge. A Bangkok Airways branded bus took us out from the gate to the plane which turned out to be once on board one of their new ATR-72s - Immaculate and comfortable. Crew professional friendly the mini-meal was interesting and fun - a scaled down version of a long haul meal served on a tray with three courses - Cold but you can't have everything. Followed by a tea/coffee service. For a 55 minute flight! As it was the flight turned out to be 1 hr 45 mins long due to bad weather in Siem Reap so we circled for ages - Flight deck kept us informed throughout. Flight back again a great experience - asked at check in if they could check me through to my final destination since my connecting flight in BKK was on a code-share partner. The agent promptly and gracefully did even issued me boarding passes for all my return segments! Very grateful for this service.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,A Kupferman,Thailand,2015-05-27,Flight EK375 Business Class from Bangkok to Dubai on May 23 2015 on a A380. After viewing all those promotional videos from Emirates I decided to use that airline to fly to Riyadh via Bangkok and must confess that I am somewhat disappointed. The lounge in Bangkok is quite plain and sterile with a very limited choice of food. As to the flight itself seats are not ergonomic: the armrest is very short due to the separation panel between seat and corridor and the table is difficult to pull out if you are very slightly overweight. Emirates is quite stingy with amenities and even socks are taken away at the end of the flight if unused. Service was efficient but it cannot be compared with the one on Etihad where you can wine and dine anytime and where the choice of drinks and the quality of food is far superior to what is offered on Emirates. Flight attendants were relatively indifferent. The bar of course is very nice and that is the best thing on that flight. The cabin decoration is reminiscent of a hospital corridor. All in all a flight without surprise but next time I will go back to the friendly Thai people or to the excellent Etihad performance.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,3,3,5,NA,NA,0,0

Onboard I began to look for the headphone plug and I was shocked to find out that there is no entertainment system available.…No TV movies or music for a flight that is over 8 hours long. Only option was to rent an iPad and connect to the plane's WiFi but what do you do when you travel with all your family? You rent many iPads? Moreover what happens when your battery is empty again you are left with nothing to do but sit in the uncomfortable limited space that you have. Other bad points for Rouge on the flight back the overhead light was not working so we could not even read a book. Rouge does not offer individual climate control so if you are too hot there is nothing you can do to get a little more air. The crew wasn't so good they seem very disorganized and service was bad. When the meal service got to us we had no choice. We got our beverage long after the meal and again they ran out of a lot of selections. I would accept a lot of those inconveniences for a short/medium length flight but I cannot accept such conditions for long flights. Our experience with Air Canada Rouge was a disaster and I would never recommend Air Canada Rouge to anyone. And I will do all I can to avoid it in the future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,Steve Smith,United Kingdom,2015-03-09,LHR-MIA and IAD-LHR all in PE. A busy morning at LHR check-in but staff were there to minimise the queues and I was checked in at an Upper Class desk within 5 mins of arriving. A full cabin on the day flight to Miami. We left on time and a Bloody Mary was mixed at the bar for me (a nice touch) with lunch following drinks all presented on a try with real crockery and cutlery. Plenty of space around me although the old IFE system was used on the ageing 747. We live in a touchscreen digital age now and negotiating screens with a sticking cursor keypad was somewhat archaic and annoying. Crew were pleasant and helpful with regular rounds of water and orange juice (or any other drink if you wanted). We landed 20 mins ahead of schedule and my luggage was one of the first out another reason I like PE. The flight back from Washington was on the new 787 and the difference in seat style and IFE against the 747 was immediately noticeable. Flight was only a third full so I had the window and isle to myself. Dinner served promptly after take off but I wanted a drink first so they put my meal back in the oven and I had it when I wanted it - a more business class level of service from a personable professional team. The IFE touchscreen was great and I stretched out and thoroughly enjoyed the movies snacks and drinks all night long! A full English was served an 90 mins before landing. We arrived an hour early due to strong tailwinds and my bag was out within two mins of me arriving at the belt. I don't mind paying what was nearly double the economy fare when the experience was as good as this. Well done Virgin I'll definitely be back again - just upgrade your seats and IFE on the older aircraft (I really only want to fly on your A330s and 787s from now on) it's the only reason this review isn't 10/10.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

air-madagascar,/airline-reviews/air-madagascar,Air Madagascar customer review,Jeremy Irwin-Singer,NA,2006-09-27,CDG-TNR-FDP-TNR-CDG The outbound flight was fine but CDG was awful. The queues at check in were a bit long but after an hour we were checked in. The food was nice tea and coffee were served often along with a choice of soft drinks. The seats were quite cramped but there was just enough legroom. The choice of films were not up to much but the music channels were fine with some good Malagasy music in there as well. The aircraft was a 767-300. Flying from Tana (Antananarivo) to Fort Dauphin was an experience. We had to wait for 3 hours at the airport being served coffee with horrible sweetened condensed milk and being handed week old newspapers with payment demanded. We checked in all right though. The plane was an old second generation 737 with no allocated seating. The announcements were in Malagasy and French and some sort of inconprehensible English which just sounded like the air hostess reading some English off a card. Almost no inflight service just a drink of orange juice. Fort Dauphin Airport is interesting no luggage belts so your bag number is shouted out and you have to hand them your ticket to reclaim. The return trip was much the same as the first. At TNR we were delayed for 2 hours for some technical fault which seemed to make no sense whatsoever. It was claimed that Engine number 3 had some sort of problem but there are 2 engines on a 767. As neither of the engines were started when we got on the plane the airconditioners weren't working. There are no vents above your head on this 767 either. Some people fainted as we waited for 2 hours on this sweltering plane before we departed. We missed our connection at CDG too.

Admittedly the seat on the Bangkok-Tokyo segment on a 777 was not comfortable. The leg extension was rather short and my feet extended over the edge of the leg rest. I am not a particularly tall person. The flight to JFK did have lie flat seats but I found them to be quite narrow and felt more comfortable sleeping at a slightly angled upright position. Food on both segments was OK and typical of business class fare found on other airlines. What sets ANA apart from other airlines is their onboard staff. Simply put their staff has to be the warmest and friendliest I have encountered on any other flights that I have taken. Everything was done with a smile. Cabins and bathrooms were kept immaculate throughout the flights. The AVOD system worked great with tons of offerings to choose from. I recommend ANA.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,3,5,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

ANA has great service and their planes always feel brand new. I was excited to experience their new fixed-back economy seats on the 773ER. Plenty of legroom in the non-reclined position and I love the fact that they configure their 777-300ERs in a 2-4-3 configuration with a double armrest between the pair of four seats. It's also nice not having the person in front of you recline BUT the seats are impossible to sleep in. I won't be flying their Y class again. They're supposed to be introducing a new Prem Econ class soon will look into that next time around. Food was good and plentiful and their flight attendants are spot on.

SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average.

After having years of good experiences flying on Air France this was a huge disappointment. The seat pitch is ridiculously tight 22"" at best. I'm 194 cm tall. It was excruciating for a 12 hour flight. When the person in front me reclined immediately upon boarding my knees were crushed. The catering service was also completely inadequate. The first meal was served within 45 minutes after departure no drinks service beforehand. Instead a tiny bottle of cheap red wine came included on the meal tray. (It appears that the days of receiving Champagne even in economy are long gone.) The food itself was okay but there wasn't much of it. There was no food or drinks service for another 9 hours until a small meal was served just before landing by which time I was extremely hungry. This was a daytime flight which made the lack of service especially hard to fathom. There are drinks and snacks in the galley during the flight but I could not get out of my seat as I was boxed in the window seat by two people who did not did leave their seats for the entire flight and there was no room to get out. Their 777-300 aircraft has a 3-4-3 layout so the odds of finding yourself boxed into one of these tiny seats are quite high. Given the premium that AF charges on this route I will be much more likely to fly one of their Asian or Middle Eastern competitors in the future if this is how cut-rate their service is going to be moving forward.

My positive experience started before I booked my ticket when I emailed the Melbourne RBA office with some questions they were always prompt and helpful with their replies. I emailed them again after I booked to change seats and experienced the same excellent service via email. Flights between Melbourne and Brunei are on the Dreamliner which is so comfortable. Then it is a 1 or 2 hour stopover in Brunei. Flying in business class I expected to go through security quickly but for some reason there was a long queue and it took over 25 minutes to get through? I did not experience the same on the return flight it was empty and I walked straight through. I spent the entire time in the royal skies lounge as there is nothing to do in the airport. The food etc was good in the lounge the only problem I had was with their wifi - it was slow and kept dropping out. The flight from Brunei to Bangkok is in an A320 or 319. It is comfortable enough but can not compare to the dreamliner. Using the fast track pass from RBA I was through the airport and in my pre-arranged car in under 25 minutes.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Phil Malone,Thailand,2013-01-25,I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi. The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint.

vueling-airlines,/airline-reviews/vueling-airlines,Vueling Airlines customer review,Sergio Gomollón,Spain,2014-10-28,I have flown with Vueling Airlines three times of which the last was a round trip from Barcelona to Düsseldorf. Both the outbound and the return flights were more than an hour delayed and in the Barcelona Airport they changed the gate in the last moment making it difficult for passengers to know where to go to. It is supposed to be a cheap airline but it cost only a little bit less than it would have with Lufthansa because they make you pay €25 more if you want to have your baggage checked. They offer customers nothing on flight: no entertainment no snacks - the food they sell is quite bad and really expensive prices for small portions €6 for a tiny sandwich or €2.5 for a 15cl soft drink. On my return flight I wanted to purchase something to eat but they had ran out of everything. To be fair the staff on board are nice but the seats are totally uncomfortable. I will never again fly with Vueling. It is false that it's a cheap airline and for a similar price they offer you much better services in other companies.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,3,1,1,NA,NA,2,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,C Sireesha,United States,2014-10-22,LAX to Hyderabad Economy October 102014 I always use Singapore Airlines and I decided to try Emirates for a change. Long story short: Singapore Airlines wins. Pros - the seating is comfortable great selection on entertainment nice mood lighting nice warm facial towels are provided to freshen up quick water service when requested. Cons - Food I ordered a Asian vegetarian meal 2 weeks in advance. It is actually offered as a part of the regular choice of 3 main course meals but it ran out before it got to my seat. This happened on the Dubai to Hyderabad flight which was for 3.5 hours. On the other flight I lucked out getting the last vegetarian meal. The main food meal service (lunch or dinner) is pretty filling. I felt Emirates should have reserved Asian vegetarian meals for those who pre-order and offer extra ones for the rest of the passengers during the service. A vegetarian pizza was given as a light snack in between - very salty. Dubai airport is poor when I compare it to Changi in Singapore. I was given a meal voucher at the ticketing desk. If you have a layover for over 4 hours you can get a free meal at Dubai airport. Also the free internet stations are horrible. The internet is slow and the machines cannot seem to load Internet explorer. I gave up after 5 mins of trying. Not worth using the Wifi there either. Dubai airport ever heard of high speed internet?

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,G Alexander,Australia,2015-04-23,April 3 2015 Sydney-LHR. Staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. The cabin looked very new was clean and comfortable. IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again. The seat is a real let down.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,1,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

cityjet,/airline-reviews/cityjet,CityJet customer review,C Fries,Germany,2013-10-28,"With the intention of saving a little money I was again brought back to reality and had to realize that it is probably better to pay a little more for an airline where the costs are not hidden in the dirty details. Travelling with a child under two years I was glad to see that Cityjet charges ""only"" 3 EUR for the child travelling on your lap. Concerning the fact that we had to check in one bag (which costs an extra 15 EUR when doing it during online check-in - completely ok) I tried to check-in online as offered by the airline. Stupid enough that during this process I get the information that online check-in is not possible when travelling with a child under the age of two. This bumped the costs of our checked-in bag up to 30 EUR because we had to do it at the airport. With two flights this makes 30 extra Euro just because we were travelling with a child on our lap - not occupying a seat. So in fact the child was travelling for 33 EUR.

Unfortunately we were not notified of the pilots strike until Wednesday afternoon April 2nd. We went to the SFO airport on April 2nd and were unable to obtain alternate flights that day. After several hours Lufthansa scheduled us to go through Seoul Hong Kong and on to Addis. However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience!

Used the Number 1 traveller lounge at discounted price using Virgin flight reference which whilst no where near the Virgin Lounge quality was excellent and way above the normal pay for Exec lounges. Flight to Newark was very good plane in excellent condition and staff attentive polite and helpful. In flight entertainment was adequate with plenty of options. The meal was well presented and again the presentation was excellent. On arrival in Newark the Priority baggage did not materialise and it was the usual 'dog fight' to wait for luggage. Our return flight (after a cruise) was via Orlando international direct to Manchester on an old B747 in upper class. The Delta lounge was offered as a code share and was a nice quiet oasis although these American lounges are not a patch on the UK lounges regards food etc. Escorted by a Virgin staff member to the gate when the flight was due to be boarded and the upper class area was excellent The seating was not the new seating product as used on the new A330 fleet and the newly arrived 787's but was still very nice and the best way one can travel 'Red Eye' back to the UK. The staff were so attentive nothing could be too much trouble the novelty bar was just that a novelty for some the food was excellent the Beef Filet excellent as was the cooked breakfast. The fold out bed with mattress was a great feature and the Virgin pyjamas. The bed itself was quit hard but I was still able to have a nice sleep.

Flights booked with Virgin because of very impressive Atlantic flight some years ago from which I never stopped praising Virgin for their excellent service I also paid extra to be able to fly Virgin this time however that is now out of the window completely and they will be way down the list of recommends now. The outbound flight was not pleasant with a seat that was about on par with the general charter 2 hour holiday flights probably the seat on the inbound did not seem so bad but still uncomfortable in comparison with what is generally available now days. There was generally a number of things that are not now acceptable eg main meal that was decidedly mediocre with rubbish box of claggy breakfast come tea a menu on outbound that had no relation at all to what was served with just a brief apology a cheap drinks regime of pouring from a large bottle but generally just substandard. The worst thing however was the entertainment screen for me and many other travellers I suspect this is one of the most important items as I do not sleep on aircraft's so I look forward to relaxing and watching films etc throughout the flight and I was disgusted that the screens on both flights were so dark that in many of the screens all you could see was a few flashing lights this was made worse when the person in front put the seat back and the screen could not be pulled out sufficiently to get the best view available in fact on the outbound flight it not only would not pull out sufficiently but as soon as you let go it sprang back into the seat. The selection of films was also rubbish with not much choice except that didn't matter in end as they were impossible to follow and on the outbound the films all started at set times and could not be paused or re-started. In general I would say that Virgin have paired down their service to a minimum which is now not anything like acceptable I have flown in several carriers in the last year and found eg Emirates Air New Zealand BA etc vastly superior. Both were safe and on time flights which is the main requirement of course and that could not be bettered.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,4,2,1,NA,NA,2,0

Very disappointed with these flights. OK with the domestic flight you don't expect much. A seat which was comfy enough and one or two drinks runs. Bog standard plane no inflight entertainment and had to pay for wifi. Fine for the four hour domestic flight. Transatlantic though different matter. On a Boeing 757. Same comfy seats (all seats were in the extra legroom section but the actual seats were the same in normal economy). Very dated entertainment as in TVs down the centre isle therefore no choice what to watch or when. No wifi on the planes either. Even if it was the same wifi as on the domestic flight it didn't give the chance to use streaming services such as netflix etc. The result? A very boring 10 hours on a plane. Food was OK nothing special or bad apart from the kids meal. We reserved one for our 5 year old in case the normal meal was a bit too adult for a kids palate. As it turned out the normal meal would have been fine for ours. But the kids meal consisted of chicken nuggets or similar potato croquettes and sweetcorn followed by biscuits and grapes. Breakfast was a bagel with butter and jam. We had a lovely blueberry muffin. A bit of common sense would have been to keep the puddings and breakfasts the same throughout just change the main meal to suit. Drinks runs were at the start and the end of the flight only.

Both flights were smooth and pleasant. Bag drop at Melbourne and check-in at Alice Springs (no check-in kiosks) were easy. Due to strong winds which affected the incoming plane the Alice Springs to Melbourne flight operated about an hour late. On the 4½ hour flight to Darwin a pleasant cold breakfast was served (yoghurt muesli etc) and just before landing a couple of biscuits and mineral water. On the return flight from Alice Springs my vegetarian roll looked better than the squishy meat pies and sauce served to the other passengers. The seats were comfortable enough for the flight sectors.

I don't think we did any sector that would be classed as good. The seats are small and uncomfortable the staff did not seem at all interested in the passengers and we had great difficulty even getting a second drink (would have thought we were alcoholics). On nearly every sector they locked off one of the toilets and this made it difficult as all flights were full. The galley is badly designed as people had to queue for the toilet in the galley which obviously made the crew a bit cranky when they were trying to put things away.

The flight was very early in the morning with no delay and very quick check-in at TXL. The service - even if decreased over the years - was including snack and drinks not worth complaining.

Flights were on time check in was smooth as were the flights. Flight attendants were great. The only cons were the planes were small and cramped especially on the Denver to Spokane leg. We paid extra for Classic Plus and felt like our knees were under our chins undoubtedly due to the aircraft type and the fact that three seats were squeezed into an area probably meant for two. We were shoulder to shoulder in the three row seating and both of us are small and thin. I imagine it would be even more miserable for people who are normal sized or a little overweight. It wasn't as bad on our return flight but it wasn't full and we had an empty seat in our row.

I must admit I didn't put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and hard. I was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. Drinks G&T were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least I did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor.

tap-portugal,/airline-reviews/tap-portugal,TAP Portugal customer review,M Bauernfeind,Portugal,2013-09-24,I am flying frequently with TAP between Vienna and Lisbon. The flights themselves are usually unspectacular however the course on Sunday evening from VIE to LIS has a delay rate of 100% (everytime approximately an hour). In general flying TAP from Lisbon to anywhere with TAP has become a nightmare over the summer period: Chaotic check-in in LIS with huge crowds as TAP seems to be unable to deal with the amount of passengers they have during the summer season. Latest event: My wife flew today LIS-GVA-VIE. She was informed at check-in that the flight would be delayed 35min but that there would be no meal served to insufficient crew. She was not given a voucher or anything like that. In the end they were unable to find any crew at all the plane finally took off with more than 2 hours delay. Since at some point it got tight with the connecting flight she tried to get a place on a different flight (there was a direct one to Vienna more or less at the same time) at the transfer desk in Lisbon. Staff there were very unhelpful just telling her that they could do nothing and that she had to ask the ground staff in GVA for help not respecting repetitive information by wife that the flight she had to catch in GVA was the last one of the day to VIE. She only made that connecting flight thanks to the kind help of the ground staff of SWISS in GVA who picked her up at the plane from LIS and guided her directly to the gate for VIE. In a nutshell TAP Air Portugal should be renamed into Take Another Plane (at least if you have an alternative). I only use it since it is the only airline offering direct flights between VIE and LIS.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,3,4,0,NA,NA,1,0

In my experience when I was leaving from Birmingham for Barcelona I was requested to put my cabin luggage into the sizer without reminding. Since my luggage which its design is flexible and there are two rows of zippers at that moment it was not suitable for the sizer. I said I can try to make it smaller but there were three staff crowed to me and threatened me they didn't have time to let me organise my items and charge me the penalty immediately. Their attitudes were like robbers and I didn't have any options then because there was nobody beside me. Actually when I returned from Barcelona the same luggage and there were even more items inside but I've used a belt to tie it up. Therefore the length is much less than 20 cm and it perfectly fit the sizer. Due to the delayed flight every passenger was on board without any checking size of their baggage when I left form Barcelona for Birmingham I've also noticed that most of the suitcases were much larger than me but nobody was requested for penalty. I understand terms and conditions of Ryanair in advance. But what a shame the attitude of Ryanair’staff made is unpleasant and 50 pound is not a small fee for me. How come they charged it without any warning (If I could have one more minute to organise my suitcase.) before boarding especially originally I've been tagged the yellow label in the queue however they changed their mind and enforced me when there were no other customers at the boarding gate.

Easy breezy departing flight from CGK-SIN check-in was quick and professional (apart from CGK airport condition with their on-going development). Arrived in SIN surprised with a 20$ gift voucher to spend in Changi (SQ flights only). The next flight from SIN-CDG on 'THE' A380 (appropriately decorated with some mistletoe) was nothing but sheer pleasure. Although their seats are rock-hard the legroom is all that I could ask from a cattle class (I am 184cm tall that is a smidge over 6 feet). The IFE was good even though it is a little bit outdated it was still decent. The food? Inappropriately good! You should try the infamous Singapore Sling too!

The Dash8 series has never been able to accommodate a full-sized carry-on bag in the passenger cabin either in the overhead bin or under the seat in front. As a solution AC has accepted full-sized carry-on bags aboard the Dash8-100 - 200 and -300 models by having passengers place their bags on a cart beside the airstairs when boarding placed them in the baggage compartment as the last bags by the compartment door and then put those bags on another cart at the foot of the airstairs for passengers to collect upon arrival. With its new Dash8-Q400s Air Canada cannot do this but it only announced that fact at the gate at Victoria telling passengers that their full-sized carry- ons would be taken only as checked baggage to their final destination. Passengers were forced to take out from their carry-ons all the items essential to keep with them during their entire trip (laptops prescription medications anything breakable or valuable). My own carry-on is only two-thirds the standard full size and (just barely) fits under the seat in front so I was able to keep it in my possession for my entire 16-hour journey.

The rationale offered by the gate agent (we made the reservation more than a month ago) - you should have known when you couldn't get your seat assignments on line that you were on an overbooked flight! After considerable discussions around the unacceptability of spending a 24 hour period in Panama City we were booked on a supposedly unavailable evening flight to San Juan. So after an additional seven hour layover at the mundane Panama airport cum duty free strip mall we were on our way. Oh and the gate agent upgraded a single seat for each of two bumped couples.

As our return flight was cancelled as well our secretary got in touch with CityJet to rearrange the return flight. Unfortunately this turned out to be a complete nightmare for her it took her a whole day to finally get things arranged and as a result CityJet is now blacklisted at my institute. I feel bad because I wanted CityJet to succeed but unfortunately they don't seem to employ the people that understand that customer satisfaction is important for success. Their website still shows two daily flights from Cambridge so there is much improvement to be made. I can unfortunately no longer recommend CityJet from Cambridge.

The first class seat although spacious is very drab. The whole cabin has a very utilitarian design with nothing that says flying with United is an exciting experience. I have to say though that elements of the experience have improved over the last few years. A cloth hot towel has been re-introduced and even though they ran our of food items in the first class cabin the breakfast selection was good. Besides a scrambled eggs option they had a healthy oat bran choice as well that I really enjoyed. Moreover they also came by during the flight with a fruit basket.

I had to pick up my luggage and find the check in counters and someone who can guide. Staff had limited English skills in a large international airport and I had to consult about 6 counter desks without any positive response. Finally I was booked in the next flight. And while waiting the staff at the business lounge told me that my flight did not have a time of departure and offered me to change me in another flight 1 hours after!

If I'd known I would have been irritated but at least I could have prepared! When I asked for water from the beverage cart they wouldn't give it to me because it came with the meal (which I never got) and when I finally got a crew member to stop she didn't answer me when I asked for water but came back 20 minutes later with some.

After having already committed I checked the reviews for Rouge and became startled. All of the negative comments had me dreading the trip. It is a long flight and to be cramped would suck. Much to my surprise and pleasure the seats were fine! Of course I have noticed that most of the negative reviews were for Airbus planes and we flew on a 767 but the seats were identical to the regular AC flight we took on our second leg. There was plenty of leg room. In fact there was more leg room on the Rouge flight than on the Lufthansa flight we took getting there. The seats were plenty wide. The staff were a little young but nice and cheerful. The food was great and plenty of it. I read so many bad things about the lack of inflight entertainment but then they played two recently released movies on the cabin televisions more than I got on my last American Airlines flight going the same route. Overall it was a great flight and experience. In fact it was much better than the second leg we flew on regular AC in that the staff sucked on the AC flight and they charged for snacks and food.

A list of whats bad is much longer than whats good. In short, poor products, service, impolite cabin crew, inadequate food, delayed flights and cramped seats made my experience very bad. While booking through their site, it hung up half way and did not continue. Restarted and tried again twice, again it did not work. I had to call their call center and complain, them book on the phone. I was travelling with an infant. No infant bassinets were available on both trips. Its an easy excuse for them to say ""first come first serve basis"" and ""limited bassinets available"". What's the point of advertising a nanny when even bassinets are not available. On the flight the flight was delayed departing the gate by 40 minutes. To add insult to injury, the temperature was far too hot. Every few minutes there were loud announcements that woke up all sleeping babies. The meal was limited and very ordinary for a ""premium"" airline. The quantity was less too. The cabin crew on both trips were neither helpful nor knowledgeable. I asked for vegetarian food and was given an omelette, despite me having made a request for vegetarian meal without eggs during reservation. When I pointed this to the cabin crew, the purser was very casual and unprofessional with his response. The entertainment system did not work for 40 minutes for no one in the flight, it only displayed route map and nothing else. The collection was not impressive either. I called the cabin crew multiple times, they said they would come back, but didn't come back. In Dubai I had to wait 3 hours for the shuttle bus. The seats were very cramped. Small narrow bodied planes not comfortable to get in or out.

Bag drop at Melbourne was a slow process. About 50 people in line and only 4 of the 12 desks operating. When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30. The Jetstar Melbourne departure area resembles a bus station and has too few seats for the passengers waiting to board their flights. Pushback for the full flight was at 11.00 and the cabin crew very efficient announcements could be clearly heard and service was friendly and efficient.

Some people are just ruthless. Yes you pay for everything but even then it is probably still cheaper than a traditional airline. A simple google of their additional fees (such as their baggage fees carryon fees printed ticket feeds etc.) and you will see them. Many flight delays and cancellations are not even controlled by the airline. I have flown them twice so far and it was uneventful. A situation arose in which I had to cancel two of my flights. Their cancellation fees are crazy (something like 130 bucks each booking) and the rest is credited to your account. Well instead of cancelling the flight instantly like so many people do I waited a couple of weeks closer to the date. Sure enough they changed the flight time of my flight by only 15 minutes which allowed me to cancel my flight at no charge and receive a full flight credit back to be used on future air travel. I used my two round-trip tickets from Fort Myers to Chicago and on a 50 dollar off promotion day was able to book four total round-trip flights for only 15 bucks more (wanted a better flight time). I would have never been able to book like that on other airlines. Oh and the round-trip flights that came from that uneventful on-time sometimes early and on a nearly empty plane. This airline is not for you if you struggle to read what the cost of everything is and expect 5 star service. There is a reason this airline charges a ""bare fare"" because you are paying for you and a small bag not a small army. I have flown major carriers many times that incur huge delays and cancellations too. I understand the inconvenience that a delay or cancellation may cause but sometimes it is a part of flying. Everyone is so adamant about ""no cancellation fees"" or free baggage when I saved over 200 bucks round-trip to the same destination nearly months apart on everyone's seemingly favorite airline that starts with an S (not Spirit). Yes you get what you pay for and if you want to pay more for no baggage fees no cancellation fees no boarding ticket printing fees no carryon fees no drink fees etc. then pay for those items upfront like you do on other airlines. Me on the other hand I enjoy flying on an airline that charges me far less than other airlines and I can take twice as many trips with a little carryon than other airlines with a couple huge ""free"" bags and a little more leg room. At least Spirit charges by the item and doesn't group them all together like other airlines. If it costs you more to fly on Spirit than other airlines it is dare I say it probably your own responsibility. Nobody wants to take accountability for not reading these fees and that just doesn't fly with me. I had to cancel my flights knowing when I booked that if I did have to I would have to pay for it. And I did on one of them. Plain and simple just read and if you want a cancellation security blanket to tuck you in at night then please use another airline. Some of the delays and cancellations will happen on those airlines too.",NA,NA,NA,NA,9,2,2,1,1,NA,NA,5,1

The AMS-MAD and MAD-AMS legs were in Business class and the MAD-MIA-MAD in economy. It has been a while since I flew Iberia and boarding their A330-300 with new economy class shows you immediately that they had a lot of improvements done. The seats are comfortable and the emergency exit rows are worth to extra for. Only disadvantage of the emergency exit row seats is that the personal entertainment screen is stowed in your armrest. When you use it you have adjust the screen frequently because the screen tends to fall down. The food is nothing special but OK. On both flights the transfer time in Madrid was only an hour. When you need to switch terminals (4 to 4S or vice versa) this is the minimum transfer time you should book. If it is busy or when anything goes wrong you will not catch your connecting flight if the transfer time is >60 minutes. The AMS-MAD and MAD-AMS flights were on Iberia Express. This means no service at all. In economy class you should buy your own drinks and snacks. However in business class a fine quality meal was provided with a variety of drinks and bread. Since Iberia is still updating its fleet it is recommendable that you check whether your intercontinental flight is on a A340 or the newer A330. The A340's do not all have personal entertainment and so on. Flying on their A330 is great and also their crew improved! They even seem to be friendly nowadays.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Brathole,United States,2007-12-20,The whole setup at Luton with a private security channel is very convenient and about as hassle free as an airport experience can be these days. The Luton lounge is decent enough at least on par with an average business class lounge but not nearly in the same league as the Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow. The Newark lounge is just a partitioned area in the arrivals hall without its own bathrooms etc so left a little to be desired. Also the security at Newark is just the standard lane shared with other airlines. In flight experience was similarly a slightly mixed bag. The flight attendants were friendly but seemed rather inexperienced and the food service was not particularly impressive. But the seat provided a good level of personal comfort which is really what matters most on a long flight. It had a continuous range of adjustments from upright to various reclining angles to (almost) flat and was more than adequate for getting some good sleep. I preferred this to the more plush Virgin Upper seats where the lie-flat design offers no positions between a limited initial reclining range and being turned fully flat. Overall the airline left you with the feeling that they are not quite as slick and professional as they would like you to think as some aspects of the end to end service package seemed a little half baked and improvised.

Saturday's flights were nearly empty but the flights Sunday were packed so it seems that if there is a rush the airline has no idea how to handle it. There were no weather issues or anything to cause multiple delays on Sunday and I really was never given a clear answer as to why all of my flights were delayed. It was a mix of ""technical issues"" and ""delays at other airports"". I was leaving Montreal for Toronto then had a connecting flight to Chicago. When booking my tickets all I was offered was a 30 minute change over between flights for the flight home. Porter in Toronto has a small terminal so on a normal day this should be no problem. In the end I missed my connection in Toronto to Chicago because of the original delay of 45 minutes in Montreal and my new second flight (an hour and half after my original flight) was also delayed by an hour and a half.

This past summer I took a trip from Philadelphia US to HK and the overall quality is definitely quite exceptional. The seats were comfortable enough considering the long flight the leg room was decent for economy class and the food was at least a step up from average. What stood out the most was their customer service both onboard and on theground. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. There was a mishap in my journey in which I was stuck in Doha for a day one of the three options I was given. I will never regret it. They provided complimentary stay at a cozy hotel (along with 3 meals!) and I got to see the beautiful city. The only slight drawbacks was the longer-than-required duration of the flight (not direct route and trip from PHL to DOH was an hour late) and the arrival / departure time gap is short enough to cause problems if the first flight is late but how it played out made it worth the while.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Michael Critchley,United States,2014-10-31,Since the late 80's I have been flying UA for business and pleasure and it has been a roller coaster ride. Having switched to another carrier for the last couple of years due to truly awful reliability and missing customer meetings I thought I would give UA another chance on a trip from Denver to Paris. How hard could it be? Get on the DEN-ORD flight allowing 2.5 hours in ORD to make the transfer to the ORD-CDG flight. The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight. All this is very sad as the customer service people are trying hard to make their system work but are hamstrung by continued incompetent management.

philippine-airlines,/airline-reviews/philippine-airlines,Philippine Airlines customer review,Aeron Aquino,United Kingdom,2014-04-14,LHR-MNL-LHR. I had to fly to MNL for an emergency. I couldn't get any flight on the usual airlines I fly with specifically Star Alliance member airlines or Emirates. A PAL flight suited my schedule so I booked a flight with them. I was not sure of PAL when I did the booking as it is fairly new to the London market though it is the only airline that offers a direct flight to between LHR and MNL. The day of the flight came. I did a web check in with no frills. When I got to the airport (LHR T4) the longest queue of passengers waiting to check in got my attention: all PAL passengers on the same flight I was about to be in. Luckily I checked in online so I did not have to wait for hours. PAL does not have its own ground staff hence was outsourced with DNATA which Emirates owns. When I got onboard very friendly FAs assisted me and changed my mood. Service really is great may be the same as Singapore Airlines' service. Food is average had 3 services all throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment is good though as not extensive as Emirates' ICE. No complimentary toiletries in flight unlike Asiana. Seats are wider and comfortable unlike seats on Singapore Air's A380s. On my way back to London I am impressed with the service at Centennial Terminal that PAL exclusively uses compared to Terminal 1 which is stressful. The flight was the longest flight i have ever been into - 15 hours. The service was great. In total PAL LHR flight is good value for money and will fly again with them. Hopefully PAL will have its own ground staff at LHR as DNATA staff do not care and gives bad impression on PAL.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Boarded on time but a technical fault with the APU resulted in a 45 minute delay. Once underway the meal service was slightly chaotic though everyone did get their pre- booked meals in a reasonable time. Cabin crew appeared slightly flustered for a lot of the time. Crew friendly and helpful though. Seats are undeniably narrow (16.5 inches) but seat pitch no worse than most at 32 inches (and 2 inches better than Jetstar's Dreamliner). Definitely recommend paying the bit extra for a 'hot seat' with extra legroom (I had 17C). The Quiet Zone seats are rubbish.. Same seating as further back and whilst there are no children in this forward cabin there are still plenty of loud adults. Much better to select a bulkhead hotseat and stretch out there. Overall a reasonable flight at a fantastic price!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,4,4,2,NA,NA,5,1

A complimentary sandwich was served on the flight with free hot and cold drinks a turkey tandoori sandwich which was very nice then a salad tomato and cheese roll on the way back which was less appetising.

When I asked for water it took them 40 minutes to bring me a cup with attitude since I used my attendant call button. On an 8 hour flight I only received two beverage services that were water and coffee. Lack of water is unhealthy on a flight this long. I actually paid 81 usd to upgrade my seat to a window seat. Worst decision - very cramped seat. Do yourself a favor switch to regular Air Canada. I have never written a poor review for an airline. Sadly they deserved this review.

The seats are uncomfortable and cramped the choice of in-flight entertainment poor (even if you could see it on the minuscule seat-back screen) or for the 2 hour flights pay-TV and the food absolutely disgusting. No snacks offered (I guess they are worried people will fill up on these having tasted the food) although available to purchase and no complimentary alcohol. Attendants fairly average and could certainly do with a better corporate uniform on trip out. On way back distinctly poor. Most worrying was the man who was on our plane and about 20 mins before take- off realized he was on the wrong flight only when somebody else came to sit in his seat.

The cabin was in no way a business class cabin. The seats were reclining armchairs which is fine if there is plenty of room between rows but there was not. The consequence of this was that when the lady in front of my husband decided not to eat dinner but recline her seat to its fullest extent he had her head in his lap whilst trying to eat dinner. It was impossible to gain access to the aisle from a window seat without physically clambering over the person seated next to you not good if the person seated next to you is a complete stranger. When I enquired about the entertainment system I was told that there was an iPad in the seat back pocket I thought it was a joke. The iPad was streaming films etc but had to be held or propped up on the tray table impossible to watch and eat at the same time. The ear phone jack plug did not fit properly with constant loss of picture and sound every time you moved. Totally unacceptable in business class.

Cabin service lacks warmth and smile on both legs. Very professional and efficient cabin service but no feeling of sincerity coming through. Y-class food of good standard nothing special though despite the fact that Swiss prides itself in using GateGourmet as opposed to LSG. IFE system definitely long out of date with very basic inflight tracking capability and animation radio channel selection also poor. Worst of all on this flight was the Y-class seat itself. Leg-room actually decent but the softness of the seat is poor. It is very hard to sit on and on a 12 hr flight is VERY uncomfortable overall compared to other Y-class comfort at other carriers.

Condition of the aircraft is good as the aircraft is new. BA had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck. This was good as it avoided the vast spaces which could make the cabin look like cattle class. The food service was acceptable and has not changed much (except for the smaller portion) from which I first flew with BA about 15 years ago. Service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. The downside was the seat design. BA is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back. This makes the tray table and video screen far too small (back to sizes that I experienced back in the 90s). This made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. All other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. The worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after I asked him repeatedly. This resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach. The cabin crew just shrug me off when I asked him to ask the ""gentleman"" to put up his seat for just 10 minutes.

nok-air,/airline-reviews/nok-air,Nok Air customer review,Philip Rubenstein,Canada,2015-01-05,"HKT-DMK 29 Dec B737-800. I used to be a big fan of Nok but in the past year have been disappointed. Check-in at HKT was the usual disorganized mess without appropriate lines. Agents were not polite which is unusual for Thailand. Gate boarding was the usual chaos and crowding without enforcement of the carry on rules. Flight left on time and landed on time perhaps because this was an off peak hour flight. Landing into DMK was not reassuring with unusual landing bounce and hard braking. (weather conditions excellent). The obligatory crowded bus ride to the terminal was not fun. Although I was on a full fare ticket I was grateful I did not have the preferred seats because the screaming children were seated right behind the preferred seat section. Not very thoughtful of the airline to place small kids in that zone. People pay for preferred seats to avoid the noise. I don't know why Nok provides a ""snack"" consisting of a hotdog roll and plastic cup of water. Most people seem to toss it and it is wasteful. Announcements from the flight deck were inaudible and in fractured English so it was a wasted effort. Seat comfort was fine and leg room was as good as any mainliner. My experience with Nok is that the travel experience is superior to Air Asia it's main competitor on the route and much better than Thai Smile. Nok offers a much better fare most days. Baggage delivery at DMK took approx. 30 minutes which never used to happen as the bags would often be unloading within 10-15 minutes. For a short commuter flight Nok is fine. However the quality of service seems to have fallen off over the past year and management needs to get out and provide some coaching/encouragement to its personnel.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,2,1,1,NA,NA,5,1

The tray arrived with a NLML sticker on it (which is actually a Non Lacto Meal). Regular meal was pretty bad on a tiny tray. I opted for the chicken hot which was bland and for some reason was coated in egg/omelette style coating!? Asked for a cup of tea at the appropriate time and got coffee. Stewardess realised mistake shrugged shoulders and walked off. Never got the tea!

My flight was set to leave at 7.45 am. While sitting at the gate waiting you could see they were working on our plane. Then came time to board and they told us it would be just a little while longer. They finally started boarding us at 8.00 am. At 9.00 we were still sitting on the runway waiting on mechanics at 9.30 they deboarded us from the plane and said it would be about 10.30 am before we departed. Sat at the gate area and at 11.30 they cancelled our flight. They gave everyone a card with a phone number to call to get on another flight. I called and got on an 8.45 pm flight that night. I sat at the airport for 16.5 hours waiting for the next flight to leave at 5.30 I got a phone call from U.S Airways saying the flight would be delayed until 9.30 pm. When I got to the gate it was pushed back to 9.50 pm. Finally after much hesitation I had to call and take myself off the flight and find my luggage. When I looked up that flight later it did not actually leave until 10.45 pm. When I went to go claim my luggage after about 30 minutes of not being able to locate it they discovered it was in Phoenix. It apparently made it on an earlier flight that it was not tagged for.

Another highly positive aspect of flying with Swiss airline is that you get plenty of leg space (compared to other airlines) and the seats are very comfortable even on short distance routes which shows that Swiss airline is one of the few airlines these days which doesn't compromise quality. We got free Swiss chocolates from the crew as well as sandwiches and drinks.

My fear that we were going to miss our flight was quelled when I realized the entire plane of passengers was in this line. The biggest reason for delay in Caracas was the lack of respect from passengers when it came to boarding the plane ""Only rows 30 to 20 can board"" meant nothing to people who constantly cut in line to attempt to board.

Cabin basic and not particularly clean- we literally passed the departing passengers from our plane across the tarmac so obviously no time there to clean the plane - however if speedy turnaround keeps costs down I can put up with a few crumbs. Did not pay for allocated seating but got two decent seats one by the window. If they reduced allocated seating costs I might have considered it. Return flight also bang on time leaving and arrived early. Pilots friendly and informative although very difficult to hear as engines seemed much noisier than other airlines. Staff were definitely not as friendly as other airlines rolling eyes at passengers etc which is a shame as being cheap shouldn't mean poorer customer service. I am meticulous about measuring hand luggage as I do not want to be charged extra but the shapes and sizes of bags being allowed on was hilarious- some people looked like they'd packed for a 3 week cruise. Everything was allowed on and massive bags which would never have fitted in the cabin were allowed in the hold free of charge.

The most cramped aircraft by far is the CRJ900 though that's mainly due to the narrow cabin while the seat pitch remains comfortable.

The flight to Kenya left on time but I feel it was let down by many things: 1) The plane being very old. 2) A lot of the TV's don't work mine did but the film like many other people said stopped working near the end. 3) The food quality was really bad. I however then had a flight from Nairobi to Uganda and this was really good the plane was very new and had working TV's with pretty new films (it was only 1 hour flight). Another thing was we got served food and drinks. This was far better than the flight from London.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,3,2,3,NA,NA,3,1

Seats are now allocated before flying which must save hassle. No problems with luggage. I have flown with BA and Virgin and it cannot compete with them but I would place it top of the many budget airlines I have flown with.

Cabins clean seats adequately cushioned but a tight fit as expected. The entree salad I purchased was tasty and priced fairly. Entertainment is really inadequate on B767-300 with overhead video and no music channels at all on return. Unfortunately American Eagle is really a hot mess except for nice cabin staff. On final segment five schedule changes were sent to my phone in a 30 minute period-30 minute delay no just 5 minutes back to 30 minutes etc. The final message indicated just a 5 minute delay but after we boarded we sat on the plane for another 50 minutes while they located a new captain anyway.

avianca,/airline-reviews/avianca,Avianca customer review,Hans Roloff,Germany,2012-01-24,Four flight segments all in Y-class two pax senior age. MIA-BOG and BOG-SCL. We picked them because of convenient departure times out of MIA and due to a considerable price difference compared to LAN Chile. All 4 flights - domestic and international - were in almost new Airbus A320 and A330 planes thus impressively clean. Departure procedures at MIA and BOG international airports were chaotic the domestic terminal in BOG plus the terminals in Cartagena and Santa Marta are acceptable. Inflight service is ok for the domestic part - the service on international flights is probably the worst we have ever experienced. The only thing they care about is selling onboard duty free items. If you want to save money take Avianca into consideration their planes will still be pretty new in 2012 - if you want/need more quality and service you have to pay the higher fares of LAN!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0
singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,J Hampton,New Zealand,2015-01-14,Travelled AKL-SIN on the old 777 with the incline bed. There was no topper pad for the seat so very uncomfortable to try and sleep. This is a 10 hour flight so it was not up to scratch. These days you really expect more in Business class. There are also 6 seats across so there is not a lot of room to spread out. The food was only just acceptable but as the flight left at 1am we didn't feel like much anyway. I think Singapore need to review their fares on this aircraft as it was barely a step up from premium economy on other airlines. The way back SIN-CHC is the refurbished 777 with a lie flat bed and 4 seats across. A quite different experience. A lot more room and even though it feels a bit weird to sleep diagonally it was fine. 2 comfy pillows. I had tried to book the cook but I didn't think it had worked online as couldn't see it in our booking but on arriving home found confirmation emails that it had but we didn't get our requested meals on the plane so don't know what happened there. The food was really good anyway. Service was fantastic from the crew in fact it was the best part of the experience. In Singapore they allowed our two sons (21 and 17)who were travelling with us but in economy to come into the lounge as we had 6 hours there which was really appreciated. On both trips the movie selection was dismal and the only amenities given out were a pair of slippers and an eye mask . There were some toothbrushes in the bathroom but they were all out on the way to Sin. This was our 1st time travelling business with Singapore and have to say was slightly underwhelmed compared to our other experiences.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,3,5,4,2,NA,NA,3,1

I was connecting from a internal flight to a Hawaiian Air flight and had a great welcome from desk staff which continued in the Air New Zealand Lounge. Great food and drink service with great amenities. On board the A320 the unique Hawaiian welcome on board set the ambience for a great fight. Food and drinks service and care was exceptional. The great experience with Hawaiian Air resumed on my return flight on a 767 to Brisbane. The friendly welcome from Hawaiian ground staff at the curb side at the Honolulu terminal until I got on board was terrific. My only disappointment was the Hawaiian Premier Lounge need to look at their code share airlines Virgin or Air NZ for a better standard.

I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away.

Outbound flights were fine and B767 although now extremely old are very well kitted out in Business class. Half full so excellent service. Return is where the problems start - at Male they can only check you in for the MLE-VIE sector - at VIE we found the flight overbooked for LHR with options for the next morning as they had let our seats go. Abysmal service when you have been flying for 9 hours and apparently this is not a concern of Austrian Airlines that there agents can't check you through from Male. We were not alone in having problems with OS connections on a Friday afternoon so be warned fly this route at your peril. After kicking off they eventually found our seats again but then due to technical problems delayed the flight by over an hour with what can only be described as limited explanation - the usual chaos at LHR (not OS's fault on this to be fair) added a further 40 minutes to the delay - a great holiday but not a nice surprise from Austrian at the end.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,4,3,4,4,NA,NA,4,0

Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection.

They charge you for baggage and believe it or not a carry-on is actually more expensive ($45/bag) than checked luggage. $45 is actually the discounted rate because I pre-paid. In order to ensure my family sat together we needed to pay for each seat - for each leg of the flight. I had to pay for 12 seats for one round-trip flight for a family of 3 at a cost of nearly $200. In addition most airlines do not charge for a child younger than two years that sits on her mother's lap. Surprise! Spirit charges. Onboard forget about a complimentary glass of water everything must be purchased. We never had one flight depart as scheduled. Out of the 4 individual flights in this trip two were cancelled after multiple delays and the ones that weren't cancelled were significantly delayed. As a result of the cancelled flights the seats I purchased for my family were not the ones provided to us. On one of these return flights I had intentionally placed one member of the family 10 rows behind the rest of us so that he could sleep without being disturbed by our baby that was with us. As a result of the cancelled flight we were placed all together on a much later flight. Needless to say there was no sleeping with a very exhausted baby at that point.

The aircraft used were in very good shape and we found seats and legroom far superior to most western airlines. Crews were dressed in very attractive uniforms and were quite fluent in English. Alcoholic drinks and a sandwich (even a pre-ordered vegetarian one for my companion) were offered - basic, but hey, that's the way it is nowadays. Small downpoint: the very interestingly looking in-flight magazine was almost exclusively in Russian language. The transfer in SVO (as well as entering Russia in LED) was quick and smooth (performed by traditionally grumpy staff, though).

If you wish to fly Qatar please take a converter for your personal headphones as theirs is a 2 prong. We had a 24 hour lay over in Doha. Qatar Airways granted us an accommodation and food voucher. Our stay in Doha was wonderful and memorable. It is an easy process at Hamad Airport to get the vouchers and board the shuttle to the relevant hotel.

In the end prices had risen by about 500 Euros. Then we made the final booking on a friends laptop and the initial low prices came back again which means that they recognize the computer you work on and adapt in this case increase prices each time you come back.

Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,George Scholes,United Kingdom,2010-12-27,London-Taipei-Sydney Business Class. Online seat selection is available one month before the first sector is flown and selection was honoured. Online check in can be done twenty four hours before the flight and was completed but boarding passes would not print out. Check in at the airport is at a dedicated desk and was fast end efficient. China Airlines uses the Skyteam lounge which is close to the departure gate - lounge is spacious and attractively designed and has all the facilities you can expect. On boarding coats are taken and welcome drink appears. China Airlines is not big on alcohol so that drink is Oolong tea. Aircraft LHR-TPE-SYD route have no first class and business cabin is right forward. There was no pre-dinner drinks service and the drink I ordered came on my meal tray. Meals properly served course by course and accompanied by wine wine on offer was adequate but not up to much and it was served in glasses more appropriate for serving a small sherry. The meal was tasty and interesting and there were choices for each course that was presented on good tableware with plastic cutlery. TPE-SYD sector the cutlery was stainless steel. Seats in business class are angled lie-flat ones but the footrest rise is a bit less than adequate and I noticed that several passengers used their pillow to give extra height to bring legs up to a more comfortable position. The seat controls are on the top of the armrest where they are nudged several times on a thirteen hour flight to cause sudden small random movements. I did not use the entertainment. We broke the flight at TPE for a two night stopover which was allowed within the basic fare. Arrival procedures at Terminal 1 very fast and away from the airport about thirty minutes after landing. TPE-SYD sector departs from Terminal 2. The China Airlines lounge is basic and looks like a railway carriage. Close by is another lounge that welcomes Priority Pass cardholders so those passengers may be better off trying that one instead. Arriving at Sydney was not the best. We were parked at the wrong gate where there was no one to meet the aircraft. After some delay and a debate whether the plane would be towed to the correct gate eventually the original gate was staffed and we left the aircraft 45 minutes later. We chose China Airlines because it offers competitive fares on the route and were satisfied with the service they provided.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

On-time or within 10 minutes of schedule - Ataturk Airport is a mess and all flights arrived or departed via gate stand so dealing with buses to and from the planes gets annoying.

Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience.

There is no advantage to preferred boarding anymore everyone is some kind of club member airline branded credit card holder or something special that gets to board early.

I recommend you buy your own blanket and pillow pre flight (fleece with blow up pillow in a zip up travel bag) as I did as the plane is kept at a cold temperature.

No wonder the bags fly free Southwest has no intention of taking reasonable care with them. Now we have discovered that they make you sign a waiver saying that they aren't responsible if your golf clubs don't arrive at your destination or if they are damaged in transit. Also on our last two flights the attendants made the safety briefing into a real joke and didn't even complete it properly. It is nice to try to make flying fun but I think that they are crossing the line. Not all customers are frequent flyers who are familiar with the safety aspects of a plane.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,C Shannon,Canada,2014-06-09,My partner and I have had sporadic good/bad service with Air Canada in the past and until this year I have been fairly neutral about them. However my partners continued poor service through Air Canada for his work trips since February has made me rethink my opinion on them. He has had multiple flights with AC from Toronto to Newark Intl for work and it seems over the last 4 months the service has continued to degrade. AC has continued to overbook flights. On top of overbooking every flight seems to range between late and very late. This level of tardiness could be explained away in February as bad weather but now with not even a cloud in the sky the excuse has gone to continual maintenance issues. As I type this my partner is still sitting in his now 4 hour delay with no explanation why the crew can't seem to get the plane off the ground. I understand things happen sometimes but the way problems are handled is clearly an issue this airline needs to work on. Not all of our service has been bad but all of the recent service has been rather poor. The additional seat area with more legroom is a very nice option for customers and the little TV screens offering movies and music are also very welcome and help with longer flights. However food options are questionable and as I mentioned tardiness and rude attending staff at the terminals coupled with recent check-in issues (like not being able to print boarding passes online) really sour the service.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,1,2,4,NA,NA,1,0

The space between the seats is nothing and I sat the 3+ hour flight with my knees jammed to the seat in front. The flight attendants were rude and kept obsessing over the stupid curtain between business and economy (there was no difference on this flight as it was a charter) and only did half the safety briefing on the outbound. The heat on the plane was unbearable and any time you asked for a drink of water the flight attendants would acknowledge your request but made no effort at all to fulfil it. Another person in my group went to the galley himself to get a drink after having asked the flight attendants several times. The flight attendants could barely crack a smile and they only time they spoke was to give an unenthusiastic hello as we were boarding or to stand in the aisle and wave their hands about while complaining about the amount of children in the aisle. The plane had no Bulgaria Air titles on it or anything to suggest that it was the country's national airline.

Cabin crew friendly did speak good English but I do agree with some previous reviews: too much talking and gossiping among them. Food quality was in my opinion better than Lufthansa but what a small portion I got for dinner! Good breakfast but no tea available. I found the seat more comfortable than LH: did especially appreciate the footrest each seat has. A small amenity kit was also a nice touch.

I was assured I would be able to route my baggage through from SFO to Kansai and visa versa (i.e. without having to pickup and recheck in Honolulu). The agents at SFO were able to do this but the Japanese agent at Kansai insisted that Hawaiian required all baggage picked up at Honolulu with passenger responsibility to recheck bags for continuation flight to SFO. Of course this created undue/unnecessary passenger burden! Bottom line Hawaiian needs to improve training of the Japanese agents they hire for check in at Kansai.

The seat I selected when I checked in online was given to an another guest which eventually they gave me the seat reluctantly. The seat was unbelievably congested for myself a medium sized person and I did not receive a personal care kit. The menu offers mainly Arabic and Japanese selections which I found lacking. It took the flight attendant literally an hour to serve me a bottle of water. I selected a Japanese breakfast and they served it promptly however the dishes tastes were bland compared to Japanese dishes I experienced later on my trip. Hence I was really underwhelmed by the experience but maintained my composure throughout the flight and really felt sympathetic towards travelers who were seated in the Economy cabin for 10 hours and surely they had their share of inconveniences.

First it got pushed to 4:30 and then without warning they cancelled it. They didn't even offer another flight until the following day. Options? They would give me tickets for a flight the following day and put us up in a hotel. Meaning: some bedbug-ridden flophouse near an airport runway. In order to get to the Big Island the same day in the hope of still being able to utilize the condo we rented I quickly ran over to the Hawaiian Airlines terminal. At that time they only had one flight left that evening: a flight to Hilo - on the other side of the island. So I grabbed that flight changed my rental car from the Kona airport to Hilo and then had to retrieve my bags from Go and get them onto that flight. Hawaiian Airlines was great and everything went very smoothly. But then I had to retrieve a rental car in Hilo and drive over two hours to get to my condo. Like I said - what a mess.

Stansted to Tampere out 31st Jan return 3rd Feb. The allocated seating (on the return leg) was a big improvement. The seats are still bolt upright but at 6ft 3 I've never found the legroom to be that bad. This leaves us with the migrane inducing yellow the bright cabin lights and the constant procession of scratchcard sales and frankly annoying announcements about the still overpriced microwave food to moan about. They seem to have at least stopped the irritating soft drink adverts on replay. I guess Ryanair are an option if they are flying where you want to actually go but my own conclusion - as a relatively frequent flyer - is that there is no point in saving a little bit of money if it costs you a lot of time and hassle which on this trip it still did.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,3,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

We booked and purchased our ticket 3 months in advance. Between that date and the flight date Cebu Pacific called 3 times to change the time of departure. The worst thing happened when they called 6 days before the actual flight date and told us the flight would be cancelled and they would fly us to Kalibo (3 hours away from Caticlan by bus). The airline rep tried to appease us by providing a free bus ride from Kalibo to Caticlan however this would mean we would arrive in Boracay past 7pm instead of the original schedule of 3pm. This in effect wasted 1 entire day and meant we paid for 1 night's hotel stay which was useless. Having no other recourse we agreed but to our horror upon arriving in Kalibo the bus they prepared from Kalibo to Caticlan was not big enough to accommodate all passengers. They had to fit all 13 of our group into 1 small van. Needless to say we have all vowed to never fly this airline again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Food on board was fair-priced I ordered a menu with a sandwich 0.5l drink (coke) and a snack (Pringles) and it all cost 8.50 euro. For a low-cost airline I think the service and flight was very good. The only reason I'm not rating it as great is because they did nothing outstanding. The only inconvenience was the checked-in luggage policy: regardless of how many bags you bring the weight limit is for the sum of all your bags and it's only 23 kg. Unfortunately I found out about this after paying 34 euro for a second bag (for 2 flight segments) and did not get a refund after deciding to bring just one bag. So pay attention to this aspect!

The Star Alliance lounge in Terminal 1 was good with excellent catering and plenty of seats. We eventually boarded significantly delayed. Having done the research on Icelandair's website I was aware that Saga Class seating was effectively ""US Domestic"" 2x2 with limited recline. Definitely not the flat beds you can find on other Airlines. But then again the price you are paying is significantly below these other carriers. IFE was OK if slightly limited. The meals on all flights were disappointing. Two smallish courses is not my idea of Business Class catering even on the 3 hour flight to Reykjavik - however the quality was good. There were 3 courses on the KEF-BOS leg plus a welcome drink and a travel kit. When we eventually reached KEF we were 1 hour 45 minutes late for a 2 hour connection.

eurowings,/airline-reviews/eurowings,Eurowings customer review,Jon Knudson,United States,2015-06-13,"This was supposed to be a flight on Germanwings from Hamburg to Oslo. I had booked 2 flights on Germanwings. The first was from Budapest to Hamburg, the second from Hamburg to Oslo after a hotel stay overnight in Hamburg. I booked and paid for one suitcase to be checked in on both flights. I did retrieve my suitcase after the BUD-HAM flight as I needed it in the Hotel. It was 2 separate flights on ""Germanwings"". I did not know anything about ""Eurowings"". When the bus that took us from the gate at Hamburg to the plane I saw it was marked ""Eurowings"". Of course I asked if I was on the correct plane and was assured it was. After we were in the air a short time, I was asked if I wanted anything by a member of the crew, I only asked for a glass of water and was told it would be 3 Euro. Not a bottle of water, a glass poured out of a large bottle. I guess this is the new craze of overcharging for everything on LCCs. But I really knew I had been traveling on a inferior airline when my luggage did not show up in Oslo. It had been left behind in Hamburg. Even Eurowings did not handle the missing bag. It was done by SAS ground handlers in Oslo and done very well. Thanks to SAS I did get my suitcase back all the way to my Florida home.",CRJ900,Business,Economy,Hamburg to Oslo,2,4,1,1,NA,1,NA,2,0

Their seats do not really recline but slide forward something I didn't really mind with ample leg room on my NRT-LAX flight but was a huge problem for the smaller aircraft.

Gate-allocation for BOM-BKK was changed at least twice from 85A (written on boarding-pass) to 85C (on flight-departure screens) to 85B (eventually found after sitting waiting at the wrong gate for 30 mins) it was a shambles which can only cause passengers worry or even cause them to miss boarding.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Howard,United States,2014-07-01,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day.

Very odd odour from the carpet. Requested a special meal 4 weeks in advance it was confirmed but not provided. No menu for dinner and breakfast options flight attendant walked up and down asking veg or non-veg food presentation was below par. On board movie selection was outdated - seat 8H had mechanical failure would not recline. Bathroom were dirty 6 hours into the 14 hour flight.

With the way Qantas have changed their redeeming of FF points it seemed like a prudent investment of 60000 points to upgrade (from Premium Economy). Going through the Express passport control at JFK is so much easier & the BA lounge is quite decent. The lounge at LAX is also good - albeit a little crowded when I was there. Both legs of the flight were really well done (very good crew) and good food - the omelette with fetta and smoked salmon at breakfast before landing in Sydney was especially good. The bed worked well - it is the first time I have slept solidly on a plane (and I have flown in Business many times). It was quite amusing seeing the mature FA wrestle the bed cover on with such vigour! I reckon she could take down any recalcitrant passengers easily!

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,D Remnant,United Kingdom,2014-06-17,London Gatwick to Orlando. No surprises to guess that as our original flight to Tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. Due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. After finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the BA system for an unexplained reason. What an insult to have to stand in line 3 times for over 3 hours. No extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. After accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day BA then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. Our first arrangement was a flight 24 hours after our original departure time from Heathrow to Charlotte to Tampa. We did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. I declined this arrangement for a flight instead to Orlando. A longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a 3 hour drive from our holiday destination. We arrived 32 hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. To add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid £100 for not allocated to us!

Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each. There was a huge line at the flight services counter with many people experiencing the same issue with connecting flights.

It turned out it was Air Canada Rouge, flight AC 1902. The experience was mostly poor. The airplane was a 767-300 with tight legroom and no entertainment monitor displays. This was a big surprise for a transatlantic flight. When I did the web check-in on aircanada.com, it showed that the airplane had individual displays. The crew said you could download the application on an android or apple smartphone or rent an Ipad for $10. Of course we do not have such a device for each member of the family and paying for such a basic service item was out of the question. The Wifi was slow and the entertainment server would show busy many times when we tried to connect with the smartphone. The food was below average but the washrooms were kept in good condition during the flight. The only positive was the crew. They did all they could to help with questions and queries.

My husband and I took 23 guests on our wedding vacation. From the get-go our entire wedding party had an awful experience. The flight from Toronto: in the beginning we were frustrated that we didn't get certain things that were promised to us when we booked our wedding through Air Canada Vacations. We were supposed to receive a complimentary upgrade which we did not (to make matters more frustrating there was another wedding party on the same flight of which the bride and groom were upgraded). They were also supposed to hang my dress on the plane and when my mom asked they said there was no room. While this on its own was frustrating the flight was delayed by about an hour. We were told to stay in our seats with our seatbelts fastened this entire time. We were travelling with our 9 month old daughter. When I got up to get her formula out of the overhead bin about halfway through this wait I was rudely scolded by the flight attendant and told to sit down. She slammed the bin shut. Everything else about the experience is just how most people say - seats are jam packed with virtually no leg room there is absolutely no in-flight entertainment and they only offer juice water and pop (everything else you need to pay for). If I thought the flight there was bad I don't even know what to call the flight home. After boarding the plane in Cancun we sat on the tarmac for three hours while they tried to sort out mechanical issues. Again travelling with a baby this was a complete nightmare. During the entire wait we were offered water twice. Eventually they told us we would be staying in Cancun. We disembarked and they put us in a small holding area with no air conditioning. We waited here for another three hours without being offered any food or drink. When passengers started to get testy they walked us through the airport to immigration. We waited and waited while all 200+ passengers went back through immigration and security. When we finally got outside and hopped on shuttles the Air Canada Rep said ""the hotel is all-inclusive - go eat drink."" When we got to the hotel they told us that Air Canada had not in fact paid for all-inclusive. We were only entitled to a meal and two non-alcoholic beverages. While this wasn't a huge deal it just demonstrates the disorganization and lies that were the theme of our entire day. I will never travel with Air Canada Rouge again. The next morning at the airport only some of our wedding guests were given connecting flights through to Winnipeg. Once we arrived in Toronto we were sent home on three separate flights. On our flight there were six guests. Three were offered a complimentary food item ""for their trouble"". Apparently the rest of us (including the bride and groom) were not on the ""list"".

The stop over in Dubai and Bandar were fine and due to departure time broke up the flight nicely so that an evening departure would lead to a morning arrival. The Dreamliner was actually quite loud but was more like a white noise than anything intrusive. The 3x3x3 configuration is very good and most solo travellers did not have someone sitting next to them which is a plus for long haul comfort the load factor must have been around 66% for all legs of my flight. The air quality was excellent although the seats were not particularly comfortable. I did ask for blankets to make my own lumbar support and this help a lot. Despite this I felt more refreshed after 24+ hours travelling than I have done travelling only 3 hours in Europe. I am only 5'9"" but I was able to stretch my legs out under the seat in front (without intruding on the person in front so this is a plus). The cabin crew were polite and non-intrusive (which is a good thing in my book since often I like to sleep without announcements etc) but they were also good fun - I had a chat with them in the galley and had a little Malay lesson. The food was hit and miss and probably had more to do with on the ground caterers in different counties. On the LHR to Dubai section the food was good. Dubai to Bandar it was very poor.

The seats are pretty bad but for the price one cannot complain and its pot luck whether you get the new or old version at this stage. The IFE is continuous loop so bring an iPad full of stuff to watch as the UL offering is terrible (and I'm being polite). However the food and service from CDG was markedly different. The cabin crew were on the ball and were polite prompt helpful and caring. The food quality was excellent even though I ate very little due to the timing (desert was a let down as the advertised offering and what came were strangely different). My partner and a friend all ate more and enjoyed theirs as well as the flowing wines including Australian quality wines.

The crew were excellent attentive without being intrusive used our names when asking what we would like to drink and all made us all feel welcome on board. The food was very palatable. IFE was limited to drop down screens as the aircraft whilst scheduled to be one of the newer A321s in two class configuration was swapped out for an older 737 still wearing the old AA livery hence the 2 stars for IFE.

We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport.

Whilst the crew were all fantastic and food and drink all good the rest of it was not up to standard at all. This is a very old aircraft with the very old seating and fit out. The business class seats are appalling. The headrest is very proud from the seat back forcing your head forward at an angle so very uncomfortable. The TV screen was very small and on the seatback in front. When the seat in front is reclined your TV screen goes down with it so you end up looking at the floor area just to see the TV and there is a very limited number of films available to watch as well. Worst seat I have ever sat in. My wife's footrest fell into 3 pieces during the flight so not sure what maintenance is done.

After reading some reviews I was a bit worried but shouldn't have been. No real issue at all. Flight out was a little late but nothing major. Plane was clean and cabin crew very polite. I'm 6'3 so was worried about leg room in a Standard seat but although not great I was by no means uncomfortable. I got up to stretch my legs twice and I was fine. The meals were great. Either Beef or Chicken both lovely and Pasta as a kids meal which my son loved. On the return we were on time and made up 30 minutes coming home. This was a night flight and I was told Thomas Cook no longer do blankets on board. All money saving I suppose. Again the meals home were great. A Chicken Curry or Beef in Red Wine sauce. I ate my sons meal of Chicken Strips as he was asleep best out the three. Thomas Cook are all about money. Everything costs. Food and drink is not cheap but you have the option of buying in the airport so I don't know why people complain so much as they know what to expect. Headsets headphone adapters etc it all costs but what do you expect? I don't understand anyone who would book through a low costs holiday firm and expect everything to be handed out free. Cheap airlines charging for these things is not new. If you want it all free book a Virgin airline but I bet it will cost you more for the flight overall with them.

Arrived early for bag drop but realised that my new passport had not been updated on the ESTA system for getting into the US. Check in agent was pretty good at telling me where to go to get it done but also made a call for me to find out waiting times - turned out I'd be cutting it close so did it on my phone instead. Was enormously relieved as this nearly ruined my entire trip. Paid for assigned seat on upper deck but might consider shelling out double for an extra legroom seat next time if in economy the cramped space is a real issue with a tall guy on a flight this long. Cabin bag space is an issue as well but crew were accommodating in finding space for my bag (which despite being a little large the check in agent had waived through after explaining the unusual reason for my trip - these guys have a lot of discretion and it pays to be nice to them). Plane delayed due to disruptive and violent drunk passengers. I neither witnessed this directly nor intervened as police were already in attendance. Given how frustrating this delay was I would question Virgin's gate staff level of vigilance in letting these guys get to the aircraft in the first place. The resulting tirade of repetitive warning PA's from the captain and cabin senior were a little condescending and poorly worded and seemed to reflect quite a bit of judgement on people who had done nothing at all. Once we got underway flight was uneventful. Food good (for economy) IFE decent but need to bring your own headphones if you want decent sound seat reasonable. One thing of note is that the seat belt signs were turned on for turbulence a total of 5-6 times despite mild turbulence only been present once. I speculated that they were doing this to give the crew a break and I have mixed views on this. Service otherwise good if a little robotic and crew were a tad informal at times.

condor-airlines,/airline-reviews/condor-airlines,Condor Airlines customer review,Maya Stephens,Canada,2014-08-13,"I flew Business Class Frankfurt-Calgary at the beginning of July. I usually fly British Airways Club Class. Overall the experience was quite pleasant and the ""value for your money"" was great. Flying on short notice at the height of summer business cabins on the major airlines are either booked up or exceedingly expensive so this ended up as a great option. Having said that though I don't care much about the in-flight experience I just need lounge access a comfortable seat for sleeping and a non-disgusting bathroom. If you're after the more service oriented perks of flying Business class Condor might not be for you. Seat Comfort: The seat while not lie flat like on BA is certainly comfortable enough to survive a long-haul flight without feeling like one has been hit by a bus. There can however be the sensation of sliding down the seat but this can be remedied with an additional pillow placed by the feet. If you can find one. I took one from an empty seat not sure whether they keep those stocked. Food: Acceptable but nothing to write home about. For me this was not an issue I tend to take healthy snacks and sleep for the large majority of the flight. My seat neighbour did not rave about the food either. Bathroom: My reason for flying business class is at least in part based on my aversion to airplane washrooms which I find to be cleaner and more available in business. Condor definitely met my expectations here there was one washroom for 18 seats and it was spacious enough and clean. Lounge use: Another key reason for business class of course is the lounge access. As I flew out of FRA Condor gave me a voucher for one of the Lufthansa business class lounges which was great of course. The food offerings were not as good as say Heathrow's Galleries options but that may be because I am vegetarian and the Germans love their meat. Overall Service: The flight attendants I encountered were pleasant ground level staff less so but that tends to be the norm in FRA. One annoying thing is that here is no priority boarding as they use buses in FRA. This might be different at other airports.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,0,NA,NA,5,1

This is welcome given the poor availability of food to purchase at PRN and ZAG. Also the tight transfer time at ZAG restricts any opportunity to purchase food/beverage. The only problem I have with Croatia Airlines is the transfer at Zagreb as the airport is a joke and the tight transfer can be stressful due to slow security processing.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,M Lomax,United Kingdom,2015-01-11,We flew from Manchester to LHR to YCC and return over the Christmas period on the Dreamliner. The only comfortable section of the journey was the short trip to and from London. The Dreamliner is narrow and uncomfortable. We had read the reviews and were hopeful it would be better than the reviews. The 3-3-3 seating is far too cramped with narrow seats the leg room was just about acceptable. We sat in the back row of the front cabin of economy by choice as it reduced the risk of being kicked from behind. It was a good choice but pick the side without rest rooms behind you as the toilets are very noisy and busy. The food was typical air line food. The crew were variable. On the outward journey the crew were great but on the return less pleasant. The lights were dimmed late in the flight and the crew did not use the variable lighting to gradually light the cabin and just flicked the switch. We are returning to Canada in a few months but we will not be using BA despite my husbands Executive Club membership.

westjet,/airline-reviews/westjet,WestJet Airlines customer review,R Sawyer,Canada,2015-07-10,"I chose the Plus service, partly for the extra leg room and partly because everything is included - no nickel and diming. I have used this before and been reasonably pleased with the benefits, mainly since earlier flights were not full in the Plus section. On these flights however, there wasn't an empty seat on the plane, either way and of course I had a very large ""companion"" in the middle seat. Really it did not feel much different from the regular economy, but at least I did not have to pay any extras. I note that Westjet are going to stop selling the middle seat. Too bad they haven't implemented that already. I was hoping for some level of improved comfort for the extra money, but really I was just crammed in like everyone else. Food is the same as regular economy, and nothing to get excited about: limp sandwiches and junk food snacks. Wine was drinkable. On the return flight, the aircraft had no seat back entertainment, instead they were renting out tablets (much like AC Rouge). This was, of course, free in Plus. Choices on the tablet were minimal. All things considered, this service is preferable to Air Canada, who do not offer a premium economy on this flight.

When we checked seat assignments today (thank goodness) we found that they had charged for extra legroom on the first leg of the trip but the seat assignment was in the economy seats and that they did not have a seat assignment on the second leg! We called Continental and they were totally unhelpful even though it was clearly their error. We ended up paying another extra 40$ so my parents can sit together because they gave us no other choice.

First Class on Cathay commands a premium but in the end you get little more than a bigger seat. Consistency and orientation seem to be big problems. For example they seem to offer some F passengers an escort through security while others (like me) do not get one. They offered a padded mattress (duvet) to some passengers but not to me. For the most part I was ignored. The Inflight Service Manager introduced herself at the beginning of the flight then disappeared for the remainder of the flight. The cabin crew delivers the meal then hides in the galley. They ran out of Heineken beer about 2 hours into a 16 hour flight. Don't get me wrong… the flight is not awful. The seat really is big. They serve 1 can of caviar Krug champagne Johnny Walker Blue and so on but how much of that do you really consume?

When I explained to staff that I was going to miss my flight he responded that the TAP Portugal flight had been delayed 30 minutes so I would still make my flight. When I got to the gate the plane was there but the gate was closed. In fact the flight was not delayed 30 minutes rather they waited an extra 10 minutes for late passengers but apparently not for us. The TAP customer service rep was rude and incompetent. She gave us bad instructions on retrieving our luggage and it took us almost 3 hours to get our suitcases.

alitalia,/airline-reviews/alitalia,Alitalia customer review,Tara Willetts,Canada,2015-01-11,Saga began when I tried to book a seat several weeks prior to boarding. I went to the website and tried to follow the instructions but was unable to reserve a seat. Despite several attempts to do this over the next few days it would not work so I decided to go to the airport extra early (5 hours in advance of my flight). There were no aisle seats left despite me being so early so I decided to go ahead and book a “comfort” seat for which I was charged an additional 85 euros. Onboard I get to my “comfort” seat which is the aisle seat at the front right beside the washrooms. The aisle where everyone crosses in front of you. The man sitting beside me had also paid extra. His seat was ripped and the stuffing was coming out. He moved to the next seat over. Meanwhile people who had not paid the extra asked if they could sit in the other comfort seats (including the two by the window on each side which were much nicer and also vacant) and told that they could. We paid they did not they got better seats than we did. As we were taking off the air hostess told me to put my seat to the upright position I was surprised because I had not put it back. A few minutes later she told me the same thing. That’s when I realized the back of my seat was broken. The man behind me was unhappy with this and spent the entire flight pushing on my back in an effort to keep my seat more upright. It would stay for a while and then a passenger would walk past and push on the back of my seat for stability and back it would go. The man would push me forward someone else would push me back - this went on for 9 hours. One of the bathrooms went out of order (the bathrooms beside my seat). The staff did not put an out of order sign on the door. They knew it was out of order because I told them. People kept lining up. I would tell them it was out of order. They would walk to the other bathroom on the aisle in front of me. I would pull my feet up to let them pass - one more strike against my “comfort” seat. The man next to me was trying to work - every time someone walked past they hit his computer. He was very tall and got tripped over and bumped through the entire flight. The other bathroom at the front of the plane was put out of order. They ran out of toilet paper. I chose to avoid drinking for 9 hours so I could avoid the bathrooms. The plane was so old and decrepit. I fly several times a year for both business and pleasure. This was easily the worse flight I have ever been on.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

The the purser came round with lunch hake or beef and it was service with a friendly smile. A further drinks round was provided with a smile before a 30 minute early landing into Heathrow.

We were provided with slippers blankets pillows and eye shields. The staff were very courteous and announcements were made in Russian and English. The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music. If you are a tall person you are better off purchasing the emergency exit seats as they were so much more comfortable for someone 6'. Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops.

Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck.

I was upstairs in Travel Class (Economy) and would have to rate the experience as the best of all my Economy Class flights over a million miles of travel. The new design seats are plenty comfortable enough especially when the redesign generated another inch or so of legroom (via thinner back cushioning). The crew was the usual Asiana well-oiled and very attentive machine and everything went off without the slightest hitch. The in-flight entertainment is presented on a beautiful 10-inch touch screen but it could have benefited from a broader range of offerings as is found on Cathay Pacific Singapore Airlines and other competitors in the region.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Paul Brodie,Australia,2015-05-12,I flew Qantas QF27/28 in economy to and from Santiago on the 8 October 2014 and 5 January 2015 respectively. The QF27 leg to SCL was fantastic. At the counter my oversize baggage was checked in without issue. The food was great and it seemed like every hour or so crew were coming around with desserts ice creams or drinks. The crew dealt with a drunk unruly passenger seated in front of me in an assertive way and the CSM disarmed the situation. The staff seemed to strike that balance of being friendly and getting on with the job in an efficient manner. As we approached Santiago from the south the Andes came into view on the right - definitely choose the right side of the plane if flying QF27! This would have to be one of the most scenic long-haul flights in the world and certainly gave an adventurous feel to the beginning of my 3-month holiday. Coming back the other way on QF28 I again had awesome views of the Andes from the left-side of the plane as we tracked very far south over Chile's Patagonian archipelago. One negative I would highlight is the price. The fare to South America is generally expensive so it's worthwhile waiting for a sale. I paid $2350 return but have a sale fare booked next year for $1600 in Jan/Apr. It helps if you travel a few weeks either side of Christmas. Staying on cost Qantas charges for seat selection. For me it's window seat or nothing so I didn't mind coughing up $25 each way but its worth noting that competitor LAN offers free seat selection. Lastly the entertainment selection is good but the provided headphones only provided sound through one ear. Combined with the roar of the 747's engines at the back of the plane I couldn't really settle into a movie as I was straining to hear the audio. I flew LAN's 787 within South America and the quietness of that aircraft made watching movies much easier. Something to consider now that LAN flies the 787 on the SYD-AKL-SCL route. On the flip-side its comforting to know you're on the tried and tested four-holer 747 as you cross the deserted Southern Ocean (and you don't need to make the stop at AKL making for a quicker flight).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,5,NA,NA,3,1

AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,D Patrick,Australia,2014-10-31,MEL-SGN-CDG and return. We decided to try Vietnam Airlines as they offered Australia to Europe flights at a significantly lower price to other airlines I've used in the past. We got what we paid for and nothing more. Note that Australia and Europe flights aren't timed to connect with each other which means a 16 hour layover in each direction. This worked out well as we were able to exit the airport stay at a nearby hotel and freshen up before the connecting flight while our bags remained in transit. The only problem with this is you need to purchase apply for a visa before leaving MEL which can up to 140 AUD on top of the fare. The MEL-SGN flights on the A330 were fine however the 777-200 on the SGN-CDG leg is looking very tired. The seat back IFE is limited and works in channels rather than on demand.

Because of this we missed the connection to Santa Cruz and the staff at the TAM desk were not very helpful. All they were concerned about was getting more money out of the customer by charging us to change the ticket to a later flight.

Normally I travel direct to Asia so I was dubious about transfering in Helsinki but no worries. The lounge is bright and comfortable. BA Silver card holders get free drinks and food (also pre flight dining). I used the Spa (cost €40) - surprised to have to pay as I thought it was free for business travellers but worth every penny. A330 is spacious with mood lighting. Very attentive service delicious Scandinavian food and wine and the seat went flat. There are a number of single seats in cabin which I would have liked but was unsuccessful at checkin - should have been online earlier! Return leg I was convinced the 30mins connection time would mean a lost bag but my case was first off in London. .

allegiant-air,/airline-reviews/allegiant-air,Allegiant Air customer review,David Smyth,Canada,2014-06-10,Have flown several times with Allegiant without incident. Typically I've showed up about an hour before departure time with only carry on. The Plattsburg NY airport has one flight departing at that time and therefore with pre- check-in done and a boarding pass security is a 3-5 minute affair and I'd wait about 35-40 min to board. Pleasant professional on-board staff. Departs on time arrives on time. No complaints until I should up a bit late. Traveling with wife daughter and two young grand children to FL for a family vaca. Due to circumstances beyond our control the usual 2 hr drive took 2.5 hrs. 30 min before departure they refused to check our one pre- paid checked bag saying no room left but directed us to security and suggested we gate check it. This made no sense to me cause gate checked goes in regular baggage hold which is apparently full. The large bag with fluids clearly got the attention of TSA and stalled our progress for about 10 minute. Upon reaching the end of security row an Allegiant agent was waiting for us saying we can't board the door is closed and he can't open it. This was about 10 prior to departure. We walked out to our car and watched the plane parked at the jetway for 15 minutes more. Rebooked on next flight (3 days later). Arrived early. Everything went smoothly. Sat in plane till departure time. Door closed 1 minute before push back from jetway. Total cost for rebooking car rental rebooking baby gear rental rebooking $1250. Why did we re book with Allegiant? No competition at Plattsburg and our return flights already booked. Delta out of Montreal charges about $75 more return and free carry-on.

The long distance flight had one of the business class toilets not working. Answer on complaint was that there were not so many passengers in economy and so enough toilets were available. There were toilets but - the economy ones in front of the business toilet where there were always several people waiting. We were seated in the almost the last business class row economy passengers got their food served earlier than we did. Not all dishes were available for our row. A problem with the electric's caused a delay of approx. 40 min but was handled properly. Entertainment system was quite old-fashioned compared to other airlines only a small selection of movies was offered. The overview-map did not work at all. Headsets were not really noise-reduction ones. Seat was slide-version. Food I found satisfying. Personnel very nice and supportive. Flight from Copenhagen to Hannover was not what I expected from business class. On other airlines I am used to have a free seat beside me on the small plane this time almost all business seats were occupied no difference to economy. The only difference was in some food for business not for economy. I was happy that I fell asleep.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,4,2,3,3,2,NA,NA,2,0

I returned on flight #410 on March 10 2014 from Fort Lauderdale back to BWI. My experience with Spirit Airlines was by far the most unrealistic unbelievable flight I have ever had. They advertise that Spirit has the lowest fares but in essence they do not for the following reasons: 1) You charge $45 to take on a carry-on if done so online $50 at the airport counter $100 if the attendant at the gate says your carry-on is not deemed to be a carry-on. 2) $40 to check if done so online. 3) $2.00 for water on the flight and on and on. I was allowed a bag with a hat from BWI to Fort Lauderdale and on my return with this same bag I had to pay $50 because the attendant said I only could have my purse which was not a large purse. When I told her that I came down with the same bag she responded in an unprofessional manner and said well here you will pay. I will never fly with Spirit again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

After some exercise walking around the terminal to check in found the Biz class check in and found the service courteous but the area run down in appearance. Made it through immigration and security easily but struggled to find the correct lounge. Once there it was not worth the effort. Uncomfortable seats and well worn furnishings. Strolled down to the gate and learned that departure time is the real boarding time. Fought my way through the line onto the bus and then shoved my way to the stairs and made the climb. I found if I didn't assert myself I would keep getting cut in front of the line. Once onboard seats were old style angled beds. Service was courteous and smiles were plentiful. My jacket was ignored until about 3 hours into the flight. My meal order was taken chicken ordered and beef delivered. Debated pointing this out but decided between my language skills and the crew's skills I should enjoy the beef. I think there were inflight announcements from the cockpit but they were difficult to hear. I did have to ask for water about halfway into the flight and after asking got regular top offs.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,L Stanton,United States,2014-01-13,Just completed a round trip from BWI to Las Vegas. The service at Spirit was as I expected. I anticipated that Spirit was like the Greyhound of air carriers. For your discounted ticket you get the seat you will ride in and the storage space under the seat. If your personal items will not fit in this space you will be charged for a carry-on bag which is $100 at the time of boarding. The Spirit webpage has the baggage policy which clearly explains the weight and measurement restrictions. Checked baggage is $30 each and carry on is $35 if purchased prior to the start of boarding. Boarding passes should be printed prior to arrival at the airport to avoid a charge to use Spirit's printer. I did some research on the seating on the plane i was booked on and found that the seat spacing is the tightest in the industry. I opted to purchase an exit row seat which was well worth the $25 each way. Even with the additional costs for amenities I saved at least $100 on airfare compared to other carriers providing service from BWI to LAS. I would fly Spirit again tomorrow if needed. If you like having free drink service pillows and blankets then Spirit is not for you. Spirit is a no frills airline but they got me to my destination and back safely and on time. Most of the complaints I heard while on this trip were by people who paid for a flight on an airline and assumed they knew what they were buying.

Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant. It wasn't spectacular and I'm sure they're competitors can offer equally good flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,5,4,2,NA,NA,3,1

The food was a joke: on the second leg (FCO-CAI) a 3.45 hours flight you get a slice of raw meat and a slice of Cheese and a Fruit salad. The seats have minimal legroom and are not cushioned well. On an 3.45 hours flight no entertainment. Even no overhead screens. The security instructions were shown bye the flight attendants.

One week prior to departure rec'd an Air Rouge email - oh well had no idea what it was. Now I can inform you - it was awful - a throw back to Air Transat planes 20 to 25 years ago. The seats were so close you could not sit with your legs straight if you are tall and you could not cross your legs let alone your ankles. Once the person ahead put her seat back I could not move or would have hit my head on the back of her seat. There ought to be a law re safety -- none of us would have been able to move to get out in an emergency and what about health insuch cramped quarters.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,Mary Leger,Canada,2015-01-28,I had no idea what Air Canada 'Rouge' was until I experienced it on a trip from Toronto to Tampa on January 13 2015. Everything you read in the unflattering reviews is true. However to add insult to injury we had a full flight with no water in either of the washrooms! There was what appeared to be a well-worn sign in the washrooms apologizing for the lack of water and a supply of little individual towelettes to wipe your hands afterwards. On the trip back when the stewardess asked if I wanted a drink I asked first whether there was water in the washroom this time before deciding whether or not to drink anything. I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. I will fly another airline for my next trip to Florida in a few months time just to avoid the inconvenience of no leg room (and I'm barely 5 foot tall) discomfort of thinly padded seats inability to get in and out of any seats but the aisle nothing to ease boredom - not even a used newspaper from a previous flight.

The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A321. I travelled in Business Class and was seated on 4A. The overall experience is very good and everything is well thought through with German precision. The cabin was very clean and tidy and the service was very good. The food served on this route was a cold dish but very tasteful. If to complain about something the service was not especially well co-ordinated. The meal was served first and it took approximately 10 minutes before any drinks were served. I would have expected the opposite in Business Class. Lufthansa does not offer any IFE on intra-European flights but offers very good inflight magazines. The main negative thing to my opinion is the very uncomfortable seats. Recaro slim fit with very limited comfort. There is no head rest available so bring your cushion or maybe two and the seats are very hard. The seat pitch is however according to industry standards. On this occasion I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt with 1 hour transfer time.

You have to ask to be satisfied they do not provide food or drink menu so most of their expenses will be on juice water and wine. 7) Value for Money: For a moment they still the best although if their competitors were offering the same price I would definitely move. 8) Transit: No free internet crowded toilet crowded passengers at the security gate limited choice of restaurants one smoking room for whole transit passengers the less transit time in Addis the better.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,3,4,1,NA,NA,4,0

This is a quality service with really good times and connections. The seat to and from Perth-Jakarta is a basic business recliner on the 737. We thought the connection in Jakarta would be tight but it was all fine with no rush or hassle apart from the rude Dutch businessmen going home. The cabin staff handled them well. The 777 ER from Jakarta leaves at 01.00 for a 13-14 hour trip to Schiphol. The cabin setup is excellent with solo window seats alternate couples together in the middle or two seats separated. We were together in the middle. The seats mattresses and bedding were as good as Qatar on the same routes - really comfortable but without the pyjamas. The full flat bed was a bit like the Qatar 787 layout and might be a bit tight for anyone over 180cm. Food and drink is good but anyone with any brain is not flying business for this. Equally the lounges are basic at both Gatwick and Jakarta but very acceptable. Business class is about being able to sleep in a comfortable flat bed. They excel. The connections on the way back are also excellent with a close connection in Jakarta and arrival in Perth at 1930. Garuda have certainly set a new standard for this route.

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,M Conway,United Kingdom,2013-10-10,I have done a lot of long haul economy flights over the last few years. This time round I flew with LAN both long haul Madrid/Lima return and also domestic flights within Peru. Seat size is OK but if the person in front reclined their seat back you just had no space at all in front. Toilets were constantly kept clean. Food was worst food I have had on any economy long haul flight. No choice of vegetarian. Although I'm not vegetarian I tend to eat vegetarian food on the planes. If you are vegetarian you have to request vegetarian food when booking the flight ticket. Other economy airlines haven't required this as they always include a veggie option in the menu but not LAN. I had to have a meat dish and when I bit into it the food was stone cold in the middle and lukewarm on the outside. Clearly the food had not been warmed up properly. Inedible! On my return flight I risked the food and paid the price for doing so. Staff during my flight out seemed pleasant enough but on my return journey they were unfriendly and sullen. Entertainment system restrictive. Worst and smallest choice of films I've encountered in economy long haul. However all short domestic flights within Peru were actually very good.

Before boarding (after 4 hours of waiting) a few parents with young children asked for some water and sandwiches for their children. Their requests were flatly denied. I approached the purser to ask for water and something to eat when we had finally boarded after hours of waiting but I was impolitely brushed off and made to feel greedy even though I had been travelling for 12 hours at that point and was starving. After we were finally informed that the crew were no longer legal and that we had to disembark and spend the night in the airport we were informed that there were no available hotel rooms.

Check in was quick and efficient as was security check. Our cabin crew were lovely both pleasant and efficient. We had pre booked our seat numbers and both the actual seats and the leg room (we only booked ordinary seats) were very good. Seats were very comfortable with a holder for drinks in the back of the seat in front which is great and much safer than leaving drinks on tray. The leg room was great. We have had less leg room on long haul flights with bigger companies. The pre booked breakfast was good as was the hot pre booked lunch on our return. This was our second year with Jet2 and so far we have had good on time flights and very comfortable seats.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,R Koster,Australia,2014-01-02,Adelaide-Kuala Lumpur-Beijing. Happy with the Business Class product offered by Malaysia Airlines but if this airline wants to compete with the new player on the block in Adelaide Air Asia then clean the fuselages of your aeroplanes! A clean white Air Asia A330 (yes in all white colour) pulling up alongside Malaysia's sooty white fuselage is not a good look. Also noticed a dirty A330 at KL so ours was not a one off. Also hoping Business Class lounge at KL will be re-opened soon. One small gripe about food service lunch out of Adelaide was served at 11.30am after a 10 am departure. Was too soon. Two years ago a light breakfast was served with lunch later in the flight. Maybe a cost cutting exercise?,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,4,5,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

The seats go down under the armrests of the seats in front of you so you lie in a narrow casket-shaped space - your legs can't move up and down at all but the part of the lid over you chest and face is open. When the passengers put their seats back up it literally looks like vampires rising out of caskets. It's very cramped and there's no privacy. The herring bone pods were worth the money to me - you got a smidgen of privacy. The new configuration is back to 2 across (ex for a few singleton seats that are always gone already) so you have someone breathing at you from a foot away that you have to crawl over to get to the aisle.

Outbound flight was ok on airbus A330 but food was terrible. The real fun began on the return flight. Having checked in (self service next to the desk) we discovered that although I had booked 3 seats together US Airways had decided to seat me away from my wife and young daughter). When I asked the attendant if he could change my seat to where I booked next to my family he replied ""oh but yours is a nice seat"". I replied ""ok but I want to sit with my family as I had booked so can you please arrange it"" to which he replied ""oh but yours is a nice seat"". Eventually he said ""sorry I cannot do anything you will have to ask them in Charlotte"". Eventually the lady at the gate managed to change my seat for me for the 1st flight but couldn't for the 2nd one and I would have to change it in Charlotte. Luckily the lady at the gate was sympathetic to my request and seated us all together for the Manchester flight. On boarding the flight (a 757 Aircraft) it was a very outdated plane for a transatlantic flight! The TV screens were down the aisles not in the back of the seats and worse still the one at the back where we were seated did not work for the entire flight. Again the food was very poor for the main meal but that was nothing compared to breakfast! This consisted of a single warm small muffin/cake and a cup of coffee or tea. When I asked where the breakfast was they replied ""that's it"". If I had to rate this airline I would give it a 1 out of 10 at the very most.

It was actually fine. Superb value efficient. The airbus was clean and reasonably comfortable and movie choice good. Temperature fine. Service friendly left with only short delays on both legs and actually arrived a little early back on 24th. Food was very small portions so take extras. I was happy to buy snacks but the choice is poor. There was one small hot meal served with wine if wanted. Later in the flight a filled roll. Tea and coffee after each meal.

meridiana,/airline-reviews/meridiana,Meridiana customer review,Davide Greco,Italy,2014-08-28,LIN-OLB on Aug 11th back on Aug 23rd. First time flying with them a kind of throw back to the 80's flight experience. They had a sort of monopoly for flights to Sardinia Island before EasyJet came in as a new player still very strong on this route. Onward leg on time but terrible seat pitch on the MD82: the flight is short about 1hr otherwise it would have been painful. The dedicated counter for baggage drop off was left unattended so only one queue in Linate: check-in procedures looked slower than I am used to with other airlines but luckily there were not so many people waiting for being registered. Return leg delayed 15 minutes again an old MD82 with slightly better leg room. Staff were polite nothing more. Drinks were served quickly after take off. Ticket was expensive (300EUR) because of the peak of the holidays season: Easyjet was offering more or less the same rate but with lower baggage allowance and departing from MXP which is far away from my hometown. Not my favorite airline for sure but I will probably give them a second chance.

Excellent food and drink provided by good crews. Seats comfortable but a bit tight for anyone in the window seats due to the 2-2 configuration.

Business class check-in was quick and easy. Note that the economy queue snaked for a long way. My partner uses a walking stick. Actually this was an advantage in Rome airport as the queues at immigration are long and slow. With the walking stick and me as carer we could cut those queues. The Business class lounge at the airport is ok. It is a quiet place to sit. Drinks are served but make sure you don't need food! Onboard everything was bliss! Memories of that airport dissolved. The cabin crew were kind. Drinks and snacks were always available. The meals were full and copious. The seat reclines to a flat bed. This means I can't remember much of the flight except for eating a lot. So that's good. The transfer in Colombo airport is problem free. There is the Serendib lounge. Here you can have a shower grab a snack and get another rest in the recliners. The transfer time is 2-3 hours. we had to wait for an incoming flight to arrive for more passengers so it was more like 3 hours. The flight to Singapore takes about 3 hours. The meal was again copious! On arrival our bags were there waiting at the conveyer belt before we got there!

srilankan-airlines,/airline-reviews/srilankan-airlines,SriLankan Airlines customer review,F Wong,Hong Kong,2013-08-13,UL423/422 HKG-BKK return: This is one of my preferred airlines choice on business class flying this short route as their prices are often very competitive (between 350 USD to 500 USD) over 9 other airlines who are serving the same route but a much more inflated price. Srilankan airlines gives you 40kg luggage allowance and lounge access it doesn't get any better. Service is always attentive and smiles all the way food is very delicious and nicely presented which is one of their strong points. This route often use the flatbed which offers so much more luxury and comfort. Great leg room storage space large AVOD screen etc. Entertainment system is okay not the top of the top but passable. Duty free shopping is great often they have incredible promotions. Only one gripe is their chaotic boarding process in BKK business class passengers weren't given any priorities which to me was very disappointing. Other than that it remains one of my most favorite airlines.

turkish-airlines,/airline-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,B Fowler,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,"My husband and I took four economy flights in the last couple of weeks between London and Antalya via Istanbul. We chose Turkish Airlines over the lower cost carriers as it has won several awards and had better arrival times than Easyjet etc. Check in at LHR was chaotic and staff were disinterested and inefficient. The flight was delayed. In fact all four flights were delayed. We were unable to book legroom seats on the first flight (my husband is 6'6"") but were able to move once the flight was underway. As we were going through the gate for the second flight the staff grabbed my boarding pass took a pen and scrubbed out my seat number and changed it. When I asked why (no explanation was volunteered) I was told the plane had changed. On boarding I was in an entirely different part of the plane to my husband in between members of a young family despite there being spaces next to my husband. Needless to say I moved once the flight was underway. No apologies from staff. On arrival international passengers were separated from domestic and taken to the international terminal to receive our suitcases. After waiting for a long time (late in the evening) someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal. No apologies. No directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal. Eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone. On arrival at Antalya airport 2 weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic. Asked for legroom seats - we're given them for the first flight but not the second. No explanation or apology. Legroom was non existent - even I struggled to fit. My husband found it impossible. We asked if it was possible to move and we're told no - no explanations or apologies. Again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly. Once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyone's way. The person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so. My husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit. No care understanding or apologies. I pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat. His knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins. Food dreadful.

IFE was AVOD but screens were from previous century and picture quality poor selection was OK. WBC seats were just angle-flat and rather tired but comfortable for resting on a day flight. FAs were brilliant attentive and doing their job with a smile. Food served was quite good. Salmon Tartare and Indonesian Chicken Curry (or 2 other choices of Beef or Plaice) for lunch. Chili Prawns and Indonesian Beef (or Cod) for the second meal. It was nice that the product featured some Dutch (Indonesian) elements throughout the flight and was not just generic. Wines served were also nice with some interesting choices not just the standard fare. KL uses a shared airport lounge in VIE which is not particularly great but in line with other lounges in VIE and at least not overcrowded. KL’s Non-Schengen lounge in AMS was nice and spacious with a decent selection of drinks but with limited food choices. Transfer in AMS involved walking long distances but was otherwise hassle free. Overall I found KL to offer a good product for a day flight thanks to the soft product on board and the flights' on-time performance.

If you wanted more food during the flight all you needed to do was go to the galley and get sandwiches drinks etc. If you are used to flying Qatar Airlines then maybe its not the same service as you get there but for the price and the fact you fly direct in a safe plane then I would definitely recommend Vietnam Airlines.

Virgin planes on this route are old stuffy and feel like throwbacks from the 90's. Genuine examples include Air NZ United and BA - who all fly brand new planes on the route with all the latest tech. On all other airlines Economy passengers get offered touch screens in seat ordering and high resolution screens. Virgin still operate some cord connected piece of junk.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,Bedwell Simon,United Kingdom,2014-09-14,"Is it reasonable to expect that if you pay many thousands of pounds to take your family for a special occasion to Orlando you would assume that Thomson would help you have great time right from the outset? We are a group of six adults in three pairs due to travel on Saturday. When you buy a holiday you are asked whether you want to pay extra to ensure that you can sit together. However for me that equates to an extra £180. I assumed that if we didn't take the option at least the airline would try to sit us in pairs as I never expected to be six together. On flights with other airlines it has never been an issue. Always together on long haul. The other day I looked at our allocation and to my disgust we had all been split up. I went to Thomson because many of the unallocated seats were in better combination positions that we had allocated. No joy from Thomson unless I was willing to pay for change of seats even if no one had been allocated to them. They advised me to phone Thomson which I did. Again absolute stone wall response. I was told that because a computer had made the allocations that was final. I couldn't change to spare seats without paying even though no one had been allocated to them. I was told that buying a flight only entitled me a seat on the plane. Not a seat with a fellow passenger. So I asked ""on a long haul flight where I have three pairs of passengers nothing can be done to change our seating arrangements to spare seats without me paying"". ""No"" they replied. In one swoop it confirms that because computer says no Thomsons claim that where possible they will seat passengers from the same group together is absolute rubbish. It is all about money grabbing. I can understand it if I was popping across the channel but an 8 hour long haul. It makes a complete mockery of having a system where you can just buy a holiday with an expectation that you will sit next to your partner.

Flight departure delayed 30 Minutes. There are many food and drink items and the prices are in general very reasonable even compared to Vietnamese prices. Due to a crowded Hanoi airport and due to its low priority for LCCs there was no direct gate boarding and the bus drive to the aircraft became cumbersome and tedious. The carrier resembles AirAsia though slightly less professional.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,4,0,NA,NA,3,1

icelandair,/airline-reviews/icelandair,Icelandair customer review,C Bibler,United States,2010-07-12,Would advise that you never fly Icelandair out of Minneapolis on a Friday or Saturday (Sundays probably not good either). They don't have staff on site on these days so if you should miss your plane (as we did due to weather) there is no one who can rebook it for you. They have flights operating but use staff from another airline (Sun Country) to run them. These non- Icelandair staff are not authorized to rebook flights. We could find no one capable of rebooking us on the next flight - called the Icelandair 800 number etc as well as Orbitz who initially booked our flight - no one could help us because they weren't authorized to rebook.

We flew from Cleveland to Las Vegas return. I opted for the stretch seats. The flight was delayed slightly on the outbound leg but this was communicated to us before we arrived at the airport. It was really not a problem. The ground staff were friendly and efficient. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The stretch seats were worth every cent of the small supplement payable ($25 per person per leg of the flight). The aircraft was a modern Airbus A320 which was clean and comfortable. The return leg was exactly like the outbound. I will not be giving five stars however. Upon arrival at Cleveland 5.45 am we were directed to a piece of taxiway until a stand could be found for us. The delay amounted to 45 minutes. That is unacceptable at that time of the morning and Frontier and Hopkins need to address it.

Like many airlines now they charge for bags. Unlike any airlines that I know they limit the weight to 40 lbs. not 50 lbs. If a bag is 41 lbs. they charge for a full extra bag (if you have a 41 lbs. bag it costs $100). They charge for water. Our flight was delayed because they had not calculated the fuel requirement correctly and had to send 4 flight attendants and 2 ground crew up and down the aisle again and again counting the passengers. Unlike any other airline I have used one is required to turn all electronic devices off. Airplane mode is not acceptable. Unlike any other airline that I have used no one is allowed to use any form of electronic device during take off and landings. While that was common place 10 years ago that has been proven to be unnecessary on every other airline. The planes are old and well worn.

Now I'm out almost $500 because they won't refund the ticket or allow me to use the credit for another passenger - even if it's just transferred to my name. Their reason when I filed a complaint? ""a proactive step to align our business with the general practice of the airline industry"" So it seems SW is in fact purposefully intending to become just another airline. The really upsetting part is that only a week or two earlier another trip for an employee had to be cancelled and I was able to use the flight credit for someone else. Suddenly I can't. No notification at all. I get emails just about every other day from SW advertising their ""get- away"" deals; couldn't they have simply sent out an email letting us know their policy was going to go into effect?

The best bit was the cream tea which was served about an hour before landing. Lovely fresh scone and plenty cream. We returned on 12th January.

Ok unless you are Chinese and don't mind staring at a 13 inch screen at 10 paces to watch a poor movie dubbed in Chinese. Flight attendants kept insisting (twice) I turn off my iPhone (of course on airplane mode) which I was reading from even though I pointed at two other (Chinese passengers) who clearly had their mobile devices on and she did not bother them at all! Very poor operation by staff - wrong gate info displayed on monitors which did not come on until well after a huge line up formed we had to ask which counter to go to.

The interior was somewhat dated and tired and the entertainment system was not intuitive for the first time user and difficult to navigate once the general layout became obvious. The programs available were generally sufficient. Emirates looks after the kids well, with our youngest receiving special attention when she got on board and the gift she received was far more imaginative than the usual set of crayons and a colouring book that most airlines go for. The kids meals was also a dedicated meal rather than an adult meal with a few tweaks, though it would be nice to see some healthier options available for kids meals. The headset provided actually fit our daughter. It's these small touches that make travelling with kids easier. The seats were roomy in width and pitch and the flight to FRA was only a third full so we had plenty of room to spread out.

Very positive is the fact that you can deliver your hand-luggage next to the aircraft and thus not check it in or wait for it at a luggage belt. The stewardess was very friendly and well groomed. In general the cabin crews of Air Nostrum are young and good looking. The old CRJ200 was noisy and small not my favourite regional aircraft. The flight was short and uneventful. The inflight service consisted of 'tu menu' which is in your seat pocket and from which you can buy 'Iberia' style snacks and drinks.

I asked if they had any children activities and was told they didn't do it anymore. The quality of the food is poor for the price I paid I don't think a cold chicken curry sandwich is acceptable. You can of course get nicer food but you have to pay for it. Inflight service on the Helsinki legs was inadequate. I needed to get some water for my boys and my call light was ignored when I finally asked I was told to wait until the trolley came through. The plane only had 2 toilets and when my oldest boy needed the toilet there was a long queue my wife asked to use the business class toilet and after several curt refusals he allowed to use the toilet. There was a general feeling of a lack of care from the IFA's on the flights as if we were annoying them by being on the plane. Service on the Helsinki - Ekaterinburg legs was better but no more than adequate and nowhere near the high standards I was expecting.

I went online to check the status of said flights and they were still available just a lot more expensive. After hours on the phone trying to reach a representative they finally honored the tickets at the price we paid but not w/out giving us a lot of grief. On the day of the flight airport staff were rude and would not honor the selected seats we had picked and only offered seats at 55€€per person.

The ground staff were friendly and handled our bag drop very efficiently. Unfortunately that is where the good points end. The flight itself was OK albeit a little late. The seats were just about comfortable enough as was the legroom. However the flight crew missed out our entire row when serving the evening meal and the only way we got served was to ask for the food which was only just edible. We flew back to Manchester on VS76 and paid for extra legroom seats in the hope of getting some sleep on the overnight flight. These extra legroom seats were immediately outside one of the galleys and whilst the legroom was more than adequate the constant queue of passengers asking for service (the flight crew only came around once during the flight to offer drinks) together with the additional light from the galley made sleeping virtually impossible. Again we were missed out during the dinner service and had to ask for the food. We were then missed out again when the dessert was served and had to go to one of the galleys to ask if here was a reason for us being missed out. After finishing my main course (the food was again barely edible) I asked one of the crew if I could have a second glass of wine. Thirty minutes later I had still not received it and had to go to one of the galleys to ask again. All in all the plane was OK as was the service from the ground staff.

garuda-indonesia,/airline-reviews/garuda-indonesia,Garuda Indonesia customer review,A Ahmed,United Kingdom,2015-05-10,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product. Small gripes aside I would use Garuda again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,5,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

I have flown many times with other airlines and never has it taken that long. Once we got to the desk the lady working was not very helpful and was rude not a good start to our vacation. Wouldn't let us have a carry on because it was too big. Same carry on we use with other airlines and it's never been a problem. The service on the plane was good and they give you a glass of champagne once you take off which I thought was nice. The food was good as well.

We ultimately did and then spent 3 hours 40 minutes trapped on the plane on the runway. Told that the flight was cancelled. When we finally deplaned we were greeted by a line of approximately 200 passengers who had also had their flights cancelled with all of 2 customer service representatives handling the situation with a public address system that had stopped working relying instead on word of mouth trickling down through the line. There was no effort to either consolidate the lines or open another line to handle the 100+ passengers who had just deplaned leaving it to people in the competing lines to fight it out between themselves. I had to intervene to prevent a screaming match from turning to blows. There were people on my flight who had been trying to get a flight out of Newark via Porter for two solid days and failed.

Arrived at the gate around 5.30 only to notice that it was so full of people we would have to stand or sit on the floor. At 9.30pm we were called to the desk at the gate to be advised that our flight had been cancelled. Shuffled from one part of the airport to another no instructions given no vouchers for food we were then met by disgruntled LIAT staff on the outside of the airport who seemed to be aimlessly writing down our passport numbers but giving us no indication as to what we were supposed to do next. Eventually told to get on a bus and go to the hotel. The next morning no LIAT personnel could answer our questions or tell us what was going on. At 2pm we were on our way they went from not being able to find any planes anywhere to all of a sudden finding one to get us out of there! The way back from St Vincent to Barbados had a 2 hour delay.

The flight was only about 65% full and my son and I were lucky as we had all 4 seats in the middle section to ourselves. Seat recline seemed limited. The A340 is clearly an older plane - no seat back videos but passengers are issued with iPads for the duration of the flight which are pre- loaded with games and films. The staff were friendly and helpful. The catering was fine - 2 full meals and a snack. Getting to Manila non stop is a real selling point for PAL. Return - big plus point is that PAL uses Terminal 2 at NAIA which is a dream compared to Terminal 1. Again half empty flight and I had 4 seats to myself! Again 2 meals and a snack. Staff were good no complaints. I was a bit wary before I travelled as I had read some poor reviews of the PAL flight from London and I had always used Emirates / Cathay / Singapore / Thai before. The lack of seatback videos is solved by the iPads. The staff didn't come round with water that much.

condor-airlines,/airline-reviews/condor-airlines,Condor Airlines customer review,J Maitre,Australia,2013-10-10,"Salvador - Frankfurt 29th September 2013. Flight DE 7077. The rudest airline staff I've encountered. We were travelling with four children under 5 the youngest two are twins and my husband and I had one each on our laps. First the host rolled his eyes and pursed his lips every time he rushed past us in the aisle and the children were hampering his progress. Given the size of the seats (my knees pressed the seat in front) it is normal for toddlers to stand in the aisles from time to time and he had his knickers in a knot about it even though they were promptly moved aside for him to pass. That said I couldn't understand why he might have been hurrying as customer service was zero. My son spilt water on his seat and the hosts would not give us a towel or serviette to dry the seat and so we had to sit on a wet seat for 10 hours. They would not let us change our babies into pyjamas in our seats but would also not let us go to the toilets to change them telling us we needed to wait for the seatbelt sign to go off - and it remained lit for 3 hours. I ended up very upset and having words with them about their extremely poor attitude; they said we had no legitimate complaints as ""no one else was complaining"" and it was our problem for travelling with four children (who I might add were good as gold and didn't cry once the whole time). In short travelling with a family was a nightmare on this airline and not on account of the children - I have taken more than 40 flights with my children and we have never experienced such rude obstructive and lazy hosts. We will never - never - fly with them again.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,1,3,0,NA,NA,1,0

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,J Tuomimaki,Finland,2013-10-01,We booked a 3 week trip to Thailand and started our journey on September 7th from Oslo where our flight was scheduled to depart directly to Bangkok. Problems started immediately. Aircraft had technical problems and boarding was delayed several times. During the exhaustive wait information was given in Norwegian until the angry non-Norwegian customers demanded English announcements. Eventually the captain announced that the crew ran out of work time. We were taken to a low budget airport hotel late in the evening to spend the night and were told that we had to be back at the airport at 5 am next morning. We returned to find that the flight was delayed again to 8 am. They decided to give up fixing the plane and arranged to fly everyone to Stockholm in order to get on to a new plane to Bangkok. Naturally this required 3 separate flights to get everyone and the luggage there. Finally we took off from Stockholm towards Thailand after over 24 hours of waiting. Return flight had no more success than the first one. As I'm writing this our original flight from Bangkok to Oslo is already cancelled and there is no information whether Norwegian is able to get us back home somehow. Our original departure was scheduled at 9 am on Friday 27th and now it is 5 pm on Saturday 28th.

I have never transferred on a flight before so I followed the people leaving the plane. They all went downstairs to the luggage area. I knew I didn't need to get my luggage because they told me it would be put on my next plane for me. I stopped at the information desk and asked where I was suppose to go for my ticket. I was told to hurry up the stairs and go through security because I was going to miss my plane going to Grande Prairie. When I got through security I was told I had missed my plane and to go and see West Jet about getting on another. I was told it was my fault that I missed my plane and I was dawdling around. I told them exactly what happened and they said that was not so and I should have known not to come downstairs. I should have known to just get off the plane and get right on the other one. No one ever told me this nor did they ask me if I knew. I should have been let off the plane along with the people leaving for Toronto so I would have made my flight. I had to pay another $52.50 to get on the next plane. I am very disappointed in the way West Jet handled this and how they treated me.

On the route from Moscow to Palma-de-Mallorca via Barcelona: the planes were new the crew were great the seats comfortable and the timetable convenient. The problems began on my way back. The plane from Palma to Barcelona was delayed for an hour so at the time of landing in Barcelona my connecting flight to Moscow was supposed to depart. Instead of delaying the flight to Moscow for 30 min which would have been sufficient for us to board Vueling opted to send a plane to DME without us. What was even more infuriating is that Vueling representatives assured me that the flight was waiting for us at D10 gate. The transit desk managers could offer nothing better than the next flight at the same time tomorrow! Such situation was unacceptable for me so they gave me a boarding pass to Paris-Orly flight in the early morning. The flight to Orly was not good - the plane was extremely old and dirty. What I can say is that Vueling is not so cheap but has very convenient schedules from Moscow to Barcelona and back.

We upgraded to extra leg room and chose seats all close to each other. Monarch changed the aircraft a week or so before the trip and notified us that our seats had changed. We were still together so all fine. Before travelling I phoned Monarch and enquired about child car seats and if ok to use on board - I have a very active 2 year old who doesn't sit still for 5 minutes! At first the lady told me that my car seat wouldn't be allowed on because the only car seats that are allowed on monarch flights are very old styles. (She hadn't asked which seat I had) I told her that I wasn't sure this was correct so she checked online. The website states that car seats are allowed for all children under 3 years old. She then put a note on the computer to say we were bringing a car seat and which seat this would go in on the plane. Arriving at check in we were greeted by a lady who told us that car seats are not allowed to be used on Monarch flights. She phoned someone and then told us that actually they are allowed but because our aircraft had been changed again we would not be able to use it as we were now sitting on the left of the plane and car seats must go on the right. aWe said we would take it down to the gate and let them decide. Once down there a lovely lady checked for us and told us it was fine but the seat would have to go next to the window. Thank goodness we took the seat toddler slept all the way there and all the way home. Monarch staff in Tenerife much happier and helpful than the staff in England. Not even a smile from the no car seats lady. Monarch please inform all of your staff on the car seat rules when travelling (especially with children) it really is a pain when given wrong information which delays checking in/ boarding. Car seats are much safer for young children to travel in and must also make the attendants job easier as no toddlers wandering down the aisles getting in the way.,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,5,3,3,1,NA,NA,4,1

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,R Priestley,Australia,2014-09-22,I was excited to be travelling on Air India's new 'Dreamliner' from Sydney to Delhi yesterday. The experience fell well short of my expectations. I endeavoured to do on-line check-in but it was not available so I phoned and requested an aisle set. That request was never registered but the check-in assistant in Sydney gave me an exit row seat which I was very happy with. On the flight the entertainment system for my seat 30C was not working. I initially complained but I was dismissed by the first flight attendant and told I would need to wait for it to cut in. After an hour of waiting I approached another flight attendant who assured me he would re-set the system. Following another few failed attempts I was assured that they would register the fact that it wasn't working and that it would fixed for the next passenger. Not sure how that helped me! When it came time for meal- time the flight attendant asked me to pull out my tray and was irritated when I couldn't. The tray was actually broken. She did endeavour to fix it but it remained a problem throughout the flight. Unfortunately the entertainment system appears to control the overhead lighting as well. The result was that I had no access to movies music or reading light for the full flight which is 12 hrs 30 minutes that's a long time to sit in the dark. There was no apology or understanding from staff. The food was very basic with little variety there was minimal genuine service on the flight. Staff seemed to vanish between meals and seemed irritated when a passenger asked for something. If anything I found some of the staff quite rude. This was a very full flight I think staff need to pay some attention to the toilets during the trip. At one stage one of the toilet basins was clogged and another passenger complained to staff.

Sydney-Nadi boarded 10mins late but managed to leave only 2 mins late and all flights arrived 30 mins early. Nadi was longest transfer as only 1 person on desk. The food varied from ok to really good. It is airline food in Economy Class and Fiji Airways is not your top end Airline. Flight from Nadi-LAX left at 9.40pm so we had a small roll with vegetable patty served as snack but a large breakfast of scrambled eggs grilled veggies fruit muffin yoghurt juice and a breakfast bar. On return trip was prawn cocktail beef and rice fruit juice chocolate bar and scone. Both large meals were very tasty and vegetarian rolls also had a great flavour. Water was on offer regularly during flights. My only negative was that I had requested Vegetarian Meals for all 4 of us however this information did not get through. On trip to LAX there was a vegetarian option (although not booked) however on return flight there wasn't. The planes were new which was a bonus and seating although a little uncomfortable at times was probably more to do with being on a long flight than anything else. It felt no different to the 5hr flight Sydney to Perth on Qantas. Toilets were exceptionally clean at all stages of all flights. We went with Fijian Airways mainly due to cost.

Check in was a breeze the crew were great helping us take turns so that both me and my wife could have our meals while the other one kept the baby. The food was below par. The next leg of the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dhaka was deplorable. First of all checking in was annoying. Another thing that stuck out to me was yes they had a lot of multi-lingual crew members but if you are headed to Bangladesh it probably would help if someone inflight spoke Bengali. On our way back check in was again easy and that's the only good thing that I can say about our return flight. Inflight service was horrible on both legs of the flight. We were flying on Jet Airways not an Etihad carrier and the crew did not know the first thing about customer service. On the longer portion of the flight from Abu Dhabi to JFK after the first two hours of the flight all the crew had vanished and the only way you would see them is if someone rang the attendant bell at their seat.

I can tell you that the information you get from Spirit is spot on. If your bag is overweight, you have to pay more. You can only take one personal item on the plane. Yes, you have to pay for food, drink, a roomier seat. But-that is spelled out before you purchase the tickets. We did buy the zone 2 seating, and it was worth it. The seats are regular sized seats, but the knee room is a bit cramped. Nothing that was too bad, but I felt bad for a gentleman that was quite tall that had to put his knees in the isle. But he was happy and said he had flown with them many times before. I brought a neck pillow to sit on and found that very very helpful.

Also one drinks service coming into London.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Sjoholm Magnus,Sweden,2014-01-09,In December I flew Emirates on 4 different occasions from Copenhagen to Dubai/Bangkok and I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed. The most annoying was the slow and confusing service of the cabin crew it took more than 2 hours for them to serve anything on each of the flights and it seemed like they were all trainees. On the first flight we had great large new screens for the inflight entertainment system but on the other flights the planes were equipped with an earlier version which was not at all as good. The check in and boarding procedures worked fine although there are always a lot of people who don't understand the boarding priorities. The food and beverage were of average quality and you more or less had to go and ask for the drinks by yourself.

The smaller plane made check-in boarding and exiting the plane far easier than with a larger plane and I liked the interior of the Dreamliner. I'm 194cm tall and was able to get a bulkhead or emergency exit seat of 3 of the 4 flights at no extra charge The staff performance and courtesy was flawless the food was good and even in economy class they said you could order anything off the menu any time you want.

So no need to waste also time in reviewing it. On the way back I asked on board the upgrade against 800€. The seat is a real lie flat but somehow is feel a bit cheap and ""fragile"". The mattress is also a bit hard and is very uncomfortable for tall people the foot space that is very narrow and requires a lot off efforts to turn your body on the other side.. The grey design doesn't help as well: a bit boring. The amenity kid is just ok. The entertaining system is fine even thought he selection of film is not as nice as on other higher level airlines. The food is the only nice point: different choices of antipasti first course second course and dessert offered you on a tray: you can even taste a bit of everything. Also good selection of wines. The disappointing thing is professionally and the level of the service. I won't comment the ground customer service that is just shameful: nobody knows nothing or would better to say everybody gives you info that most of the time is just a personal guess. On board the service is a bit improvised and basically depends on the individual character of the attendant: if he/she is a nice one it all be nice. On the opposite if bad will be very rude.

Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well.

Departed on hour late but didn't mind as it cut the transit time down in CAI. 737-800 to CAI with older style seats. It is a dry airline so juice or water offered pre take off by crew who did not smile. They also give out hot towels which are so hot you can't actually touch them. No menus offered on either sector toilets not maintained on either sector. Food is well below the usual standard of most airlines but ok ex AMS only. On arrival in CAI a bus meets the aircraft and whisks Business Class away promptly and we were impressed. Once inside the terminal it was a mess. If in transit you must visit the transit check in desk which has long lines of people. We noticed there was a desk just for Business Class so went under the rope only to be yelled at by Egyptair staff. Security was a joke and did not put us at ease. Star Alliance lounge is tired and wifi not working at all. No alcohol in lounge. Toilets are disgusting. On the next sector service was just as poor with unhappy staff and no real flow to the service. Flight stops in BKK for an hour then goes on to KUL. Most people left Business in BKK but staff kept upgrading friends and family in flight which became distracting. Upgraded children running around the cabin and pushing past us. Manager was standing during take off and only just managed to strap himself in as we were climbing into the sky.

Both flights were full except for a couple of seats. Overall my trip was average. Limited number of toilets for that many people. Food was minimal and bland compared to other airlines. On my first leg of the trip the sound was not working and the only choice I had was to move to the very back of the plane. It totally spoilt my trip. There was no foot peddle to rest your feet on so the pressure is reduced to the back of the legs. This is very important for 'short people' to reduce the risk of DVT. All other airlines flying the long leg have them. The water given to passengers was very metallic in taste and not drinkable. When we flew out of Hong Kong the security staff suddenly set up a barrier just before entering the plane and confiscated all the passengers water bottles and duty free bottles. How is this acceptable when the duty free stores sell you alcohol only to have this confiscated before boarding. They said this was an Australian ruling. A number of people requested bottles of water when entering the cabin but were refused. Why wasn't there an announcement before entering the aircraft that bottled water was not allowed. I would not have bought my new bottle and OJ prior to boarding. We could only get the 'metal tasting water'. The crew were accommodating but that's all. The seat in front of me did not stay completely upright. The man sitting in it was large but I felt that he would collapse in my lap any moment.

At 10am the gate number flashed up on the screens. At last! when we got to the gate we were further informed there would be yet another hour's delay. At 11am an announcement told passengers that the flight may not depart as it had not been catered! At this point there was uproar and people demanded to go even without any food. Suddenly there was food and we took off about noon. The cabin crew were pleasant and chatting to one I was informed that this was the plane delayed in LA as he was crewing and had also been delayed! So why did Norwegian lie? The plane was freezing and yet there were no blanket unless you paid - the A/C was unnecessarily high and I am sure this was a ploy.

It can really add to a zen atmosphere and help people who might be having some pre-flying jitters. One thing to note, Air Transat: get your food situation together! Each flight, we ended up basically getting the worst they had to offer meal-wise because none of the decent food was left as everyone before us had opted for it. I was not at all impressed by this. We booked seats towards the back of the plane to avoid screaming children as best as we could, only to suffer as far as meal options went. Be prepared to need more of the food you know people prefer. It just seems kind of cruel otherwise, subjecting the back 1/3 to 1/2 of the plane to the runs serving them the slop that's leftover.",A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy,Calgary to Glasgow,6,3,4,1,5,4,4,4,0

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,P Evans,United States,2013-12-12,LAX-LHR premium economy on 777-300 with space seats. This is an amazing product. Speedy check-in at separate counters at LAX. Efficient boarding. Seat is amazing - really comfortable with loads of personal space and leg room. Separate cabin makes in feel very business class like. Toilets designed like boutique hotel with library book wall and kept clean throughout the flight. Food top notch and large glasses of wine. Great cabin service. Arrival into LHR ahead of time despite fog and fast delivery of bags. Cannot ask for more. One annoyance - flight attendant had friends in cabin and kept stopping to chat whilst in service.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1
united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Mark Collins,United States,2015-05-08,I have grown to despise flying after an early love affair with travel in the early 80's. That said the flight I was on from Dublin IR to IAD on a United 757 was excellent. We were in premium economy which made a huge difference on a 7+ hour flight. We had two hot meals (full + snack) three full beverage services and at least 3 or 4 juice/water services. I was dreading a narrow body long haul flight but United did it right. A most pleasant surprise in this age of travel misery.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,3,3,NA,NA,3,1
adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,Francisco Camino,NA,2002-08-25,I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Overall good flight but service could have been better for business class. Old looking cabin on A300. FA's older and quite reserved. No repeat servings and one had to ask for a drink refill. Catering good from HKG and meal very tasty. Seat comfort is ok but not designed for taller person. Priority luggage tags mean nothing with Aeroflot almost for sure your ""priority"" tagged luggage will show up last! Result was 55 mins wait at the luggage belt for delivery.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Peter Driscoll,United Kingdom,2013-12-20,I have flown over 10 times with them! They provide a reasonably comfortable safe and above all inexpensive flight to a good variety of destinations and those who complain have usually griped over some issue they always had control over ie. printing boarding passes luggage allowance etc. Grow up people for heaven's sake recognise a great facility when you see one.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1
indigo-airlines,/airline-reviews/indigo-airlines,IndiGo customer review,Giridhar Penumarti,United Arab Emirates,2013-08-26,DXB-DEL-DXB and was returning with my grandmother who was a wheelchair passenger. DXB-DEL the flight was half full and that allowed a lot of space to stretch out and sleep in comfort and while the outgoing service was excellent the return journey was par excellence. From the moment we arrived at T3 Delhi IGI our every need was met and every question answered with professionalism and friendliness. The ground handling staff member was very friendly and knowledgeable the check in staff at Delhi were very friendly and helpful and the crew of 6E21 provided service that cannot be faulted. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Indigo Airlines again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,4,0,NA,NA,5,1
air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Norma Fleming,United Kingdom,2013-04-14,Air India (AI130) from Heathrow to Goa via a stopover to Mumbai and returned 2 weeks later (AI131). All flights departed on time. The seats could have been more comfortable but a cushion between the back and the seat took care of that. The bottom line is that the flights were at least £150 cheaper than the nearest rival and so if considered as a budget airline (the long haul Easyjet) I have no real complaints. My main gripe was the attitude of the cabin crew. They were really quite unfriendly smiles never quite made it to eyes - when I was up stretching my legs during the flight I was asked quite abruptly 'where are you going'? However on the whole a reasonably good experience and I'd fly with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,2,4,4,NA,NA,4,1
air-transat,/airline-reviews/air-transat,Air Transat customer review,C Thorne,Canada,2013-10-09,Flew club class into Nice from Montreal on Sept 19 and unfortunately did not get a refurbished aircraft. The service was not very good which has not been my experience in the past. Wouldn't see a flight attendant for an hour or more at a time. Almost had to beg for a glass of water. Food was ok only. We flew back out of Venice club class on Oct 5th and it was a fabulous experience. The aircraft had the new cabin and the staff were excellent. Super service and very attentive. Seats were comfortable and the entertainment system was great. All in all the return flight was superb but unfortunate that the 2 trips varied so greatly.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1
finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,N Ofenloch,Germany,2014-10-01,I had to use Finnair twice within 2 weeks for lack of availability on Lufthansa / SAS flights which I normally use. For good reason. Trip was FRA-HEL- MP (15th and 23rd September) and return (19th and 25th September). Both times departure from FRA was delayed on the 23rd the departure gate was announced only a few minutes before boarding was supposed to start. The stopover time in HEL is only one hour and since my flight was not the only one that was late the connecting flight to TMP was also delayed. Both times. On the trip back on the 23rd I had no checked luggage - luckily. Seemed like the computers were down I had a mobile boarding pass but everyone had to be checked manually from a printed list free seating on the first leg of the flight - no announcement from the crew as to what was going on the guy sitting next to me asked about his connecting flight (we were about 30 minutes delayed) and was simply told he has to pick up and re-check his luggage in Helsinki then miss the flight or catch the flight and then try to find his luggage later on - lots of other people had similar issues but all that was said via the speaker system was that everyone has to pick up and re-check their luggage in Helsinki nothing else. Absolutely no customer service connecting flights wouldn't wait if you wanted to catch the flight you would have to leave your luggage. The same then happened in Helsinki as well nobody showed up at the gate to start the boarding process until about 40 minutes past the scheduled departure time. The lady had a printout and checked every name manually from that list. At least the assigned seats from prior online-check-in were still valid this time. On the first trip I had luggage checked and both in TMP as well as in FRA it took forever to get it from the belt. In Tampere the distance from the plane to the belt is maybe 30 meters. You'd think it would be manageable to unload the luggage in less time than 30 minutes (plane on that route is an ATR propeller-plane very small). In Frankfurt I understand that it takes longer but I have had plenty of Lufthansa flights with apron- positions and even on those the luggage was on the belt after about 20 minutes. Finnair needed about 45 minutes for that. Another thing is that the desk service in Frankfurt is really terrible. The staff that handles the baggage drop is the same that handles the boarding - very unfriendly and sometimes even ignoring questions. Last but not least - the food is horrid. Some dry sandwich or bun with veggies on them. Either a hot drink or a cold drink. Now I read they want to get rid of free snacks on the European routes altogether. Anyway I will not fly Finnair again not voluntarily anyhow. Lucky that I book my own business trips and that Lufthansa / SAS has excellent service on the route to Tampere.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,2,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Beside getting the excellent service from ground staff and flight attendants the rest of my experience was no good. Flight was delayed for almost three hours from HCMC-HK then delayed for 1.5 hours from HK-HCMC. Selection of beverages was minimal alcohol was not offered unless you asked for it and the inflight food was awful. I do not think I will fly with this airline again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,2,5,1,1,NA,NA,4,0
