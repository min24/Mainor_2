Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well.

Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly.

aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,M Stewart,United Kingdom,2015-03-24,Airport is small and convenient when flights can actually leave and the check in and security I experienced were fine. The airport lounges are OK too if you are frequent flyer. However the airport is not equipped for all weather flights apparently the runway is too short so delays or cancellations due to weather (a little bit of fog) occur as happened the only 2 times I visited and I understand this is not infrequent. A taxi driver who took me to a hotel (which I paid for myself) told me that when delays occur all the local hotels are full so I had to find a hotel way out of Aberdeen. The positive side for taxi drivers is that the one who took me said he'd had a passenger who was so desperate to get to Heathrow he paid Â£1000 (yes one thousand GBP) to get there. They staff at BA with whom I'd flown are unable to cope with queues very long at desks. Its more like a third world airport in that respect. One would have thought that with the importance of the oil industry etc that arrangements would have been made to improve capacity and capability.,NA,NA,NA,2,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,S Ritchie,United Kingdom,2014-08-26,"I find trying to book flights virtually anywhere out of Aberdeen nigh on impossible. You used to be able to get to many destinations with one stop in London - technically impossible now thanks to BA dropping Aberdeen to London Gatwick. The only route to Gatwick is EasyJet which has two flights a day as far as I can see which will fleece you for your long haul cases and not give you any guarantee for your onward flight. This level of service to a supposedly international airport is a joke. The international arrivals ""area"" is dirty cramped and there is nowhere to sit. You have to try to stay out of the way of the crowds waiting for their luggage. You can't see people coming you have to loiter around a small corner. It's truly bizarre and the most unwelcoming arrival area I've ever seen in an airport. The luggage belts are in desperate need of an addition. It's all well and good have a nicer departures lounge and fancy coffee but where precisely are we meant to be flying? Having to walk onto the Tarmac in wind and rain or even better snowy conditions to haul your case up a flight of stairs does not exactly make for a modern airport facility. The check in desks are under-served and the security slow at busy times.

The seating in the gate area is not that comfortable most often you get on and off the plane by steps-rarely an airbridge as in many other airports.

Unless you are going on an overpriced package deal with Thomas Cook Thomson's etc and book around 8-12 months in advance you're only other option is a convoluted chain of flights transfers and even overnight hotels via Edinburgh Glasgow or London.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Jay Sitlani,United States,2015-07-14,"Transiting through AUH is an ordeal, and lets down the very good inflight product of its dominant hub carrier Etihad. Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd. And if you're connecting to the US, then you have to repeat this farcical performance. A new terminal is being constructed, and while I suspect it will be posh and modern and beautiful, it will still be burdened by these transit procedures.

Terminal 1: This is where all the other airlines (not low cost) flies out to and out from. Small considering its Abu Dhabi, where all the money is at. You are required to scan your luggage prior to check in and 'apparently' only passengers are allowed to go there, even if you're just there to buy flight tickets which is located inside. Only one small coffee shop before the immigration check for you to hang with your loved ones before you say goodbye. Inside the terminal past security, only few stores available, and all are tiny. Terminal 2: This is where the low costs airlines such as Rotana Jet flies in or out from. Terminal is tiny, looks like a ghost town with only one coffee shop that surprisingly has good food. Coming in to the terminal was another nightmare. I've flown in twice here and both times were jam packed. It's as if the queue is never ending. Terminal 3: This is where all the Etihad flights come in and out from. Much better than the other 2 terminals and you can actually check in at the counter with another person accompanying you. Shops inside the terminal passed immigration is better than Terminal 1, although still not as amazing as Dubai Terminal 3 or Doha airport. Still, not recommended for transit more than 3 hours.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,F Marc,Australia,2015-02-18,Worst airport I have been to it is a complete mess. I strongly believe that this airport could not handle such huge amount of travellers. After a long flight transit passengers usually need a quiet place to relax change clothes use the bathroom and charge electronic devices. This airport could provide any of them. Toilets are full and are also dirty. People lie on the floor blocking the passageway while restaurants are all occupied there are no place to sit either. Even if I could sit somewhere power plugs can be hardly found in the gates. Trying to appeal as a luxurious airport while providing such poor facilities is not a good combination believe me.

The duty free stores are well stocked and the upper level food hall adequate enough. However (and this has been pointed out in previous reviews ad nauseum) the air-conditioning is just far to cold for normal passenger comfort.

It was bad enough dealing with ghastly food on Etihad. The food options at Terminal 3 are limited and very expensive. Also the fast food on display looked as though it was there 48 hours before. Not very pleasant at around 20 dollars for a similar meal which In London would cost less than half. A small bottle of water cost around 6 US dollars. Not many places to sit but lots of shops.

Free wi-fi and computer terminals. Not much to do for that length of wait - as a transit point it needs more activities.

As a Silver member of an Etihad guest I can access the Al Reem lounge which is a big plus apart from duty free not a lot of things to do apart from free wifi. However as previous travellers note at peak times the security clearance for transit passengers can be very poor - I saw the longest line yet all the way back to T1 nearly on the way out but no queue at all for the return flight.

T1 is clearly more cramped than T3 which I have used before and I found the ATMs hard to locate without directions from staff. Ironically before opening up the scanners at Gate 7 the security team there used the passenger waiting area as location for their smoking break - in direct view of the no-smoking notices.

Only back-up was at document checkpoint at the gate. If you don't want to be forced to go through the duty free shop simply use the toilets after security as they have a second exit that leads to the gate concourse.

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,A Fleming,Ghana,2010-06-13,I have been through Kotoka International Airport more times than I care to remember and the attached domestic terminal a couple of times. Against most other African airports I have passed through (around 30) it is at the top end and there is an evident desire to improve. The airport is relatively small has only two gates for international departures and there are an ever increasing list of carriers adding Accra to their routes. Departure is not usually too bad security keeps the majority who may bother travellers at bay. Many first time passengers do not realise the need to go to the extreme right end of the airport for a customs check before going to their check in queue. This can result in additional queuing for the uninitiated as there is no signage. There are well in excess of 20 counters so whilst it can be crowded in the evening as others mention it is not unmanageable. Passengers must go upstairs for immigration and here is the best eating place in the airport - the only problem is that is security are doing their job they may not allow your friends to come and eat with you. In this case there are a few outside eating options within a short walk of the departure area of which Airport Landing is probably the best for a full meal. Once through immigration the shopping options are limited and overpriced but there are places for drinks snacks or even small time gambling. Business passengers will according to their carrier be assigned to one of two lounges - whilst neither is spectacular the lounge used in the main by Skyteam partners is my preference. It has a view of the runway and usually some kind of food as well the usual drinks. This lounge is close to the departure gates for intercontinental flights but there are times when African flights including Kenyan are from the gate located at the other end of the airport. The other lounge is used by BA Emirates and also Star Alliance partners (South African Lufthansa and United and apparently soon to be Turkish). This has minimal food no natural light but is nicely decorated and probably has the better drinks selection. The main x-ray security is before you go to your gate and you then sit in an often poorly air conditioned room awaiting boarding - it is rare for boarding to start when they first announce that it is. These areas often have passengers from multiple flights at one time and there is some small risk of boarding the wrong plane in the chaos that can ensure. It is not the best end to the departure experience but with the limited space and an expanding range of carriers it is hard to overcome this and as others state staff are for the most part friendly and polite. On arrival immigration is normally not more than 10 or 15 minutes bags can be quick or slow like most places (though I find very slow for late night flights) and you must then go downstairs where you are likely to have your baggage tag checked to confirm you have picked up the correct item(s) of luggage. Beyond this point it can be a little chaotic - people will almost certainly offer you a taxi and try to carry your bag then put pressure on you for a tip. If you do not want any of these services it is best to smile and say so - personally I would always favour trying to arrange a reliable pick up at any unfamiliar airport and in Accra most hotels can arrange for this. The domestic terminal is fairly spartan but perfectly adequate.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
adana-airport,/airport-reviews/adana-airport,Adana Airport customer review,William Foran,NA,2007-10-04,Adana is in the southern part of Turkey and so the grounds of the airport are full of palm trees and other desert flora. It is chaotic as the previous reviewer has commented. What was amazing to see was aircraft taxiing in on the same part of the tarmac as passengers walking in from their recently landed flights. I recommend the restaurant on the second level. The food was terrific ( it is frequently so in Turkey) and the view (Including the aforementioned strange combination of people and aircraft) was very entertaining. Most of the flights are domestic/commuter flights and therefore the airport is otherwise very quiet apart from the morning and evening rush hours.

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,Henry Tib,NA,2006-05-24,"Had my first experience travelling on a regional airline from the new Adelaide terminal. It would seem that when they designed the new terminal they forgot about the regional air passengers. The departure ""gates"" for both the regional airlines are situated at the extreme end of the terminal requiring a fair walk although you can enjoy for part of the way a 50metre travelator ( though not sure it works) . When boarding you have to be escorted by the flight crew down a number of stairs to the exit for boarding. Regional air passengers returning to Adelaide airport again have to be escorted by the co-pilot to the terminal building through a concrete passageway then go through airport security and return to the upper level departure area through a door that is well away from the designated arrival area shown on the monitors to depart the terminal. nterstate passengers have to walk down two ramps to the aircraft and it would seem for speedier boarding passengers seated at the rear of the aircraft are directed to walk across the the tarmac to the rear steps of the aircraft.

The taxi and rental car shuttle rank are only about a hundred yards from the gate area exit and only steps beyond bag claim. The security queue moves relatively fast.

There is no need to allow excess time because there will be no queues at checkin or at security-the largest planes into the airport only seat 78 people-and they aren't always full. There are lovely large windows with views over the tarmac runway and ranges in the distance (and if it's race day you can see the horses too). The cafe is good although a bit overpriced.

alghero-fertilia-airport,/airport-reviews/alghero-fertilia-airport,Alghero Fertilia Airport customer review,Harry Albright,NA,2006-01-27,A nice little airport actually in Fertilia rather than Alghero. It has been recently expanded and a new arrivals hall should be opening shortly. Arrivals are straightforward both Schengen and non-Schengen. There are two belts for luggage and then you are straight out to the arrivals hall. Car rental desks are opposite where you come out and there are a couple of cash machines as well as a bar and a few shops. At the bar you pay at the cash register then take the receipt to the bar. Apart from the car rentals there are taxis just outside arrivals although these are pricey (about 20 Euro to the centre of town). It's about 12km to Alghero. Another option is to turn right and cross the parking lot. About 100 metres away are bus stops with orange buses running to Alghero and other buses heading to Sassari and Cagliari. Buy tickets for the Alghero buses at the souvenir shop (about 70 cents) in the terminal. If this is closed ride the bus anyway. The driver will sometimes stop for you to buy tickets sometimes not. Departures is equally straightforward at the other end of the terminal from arrivals. Note though that there is absolutely nothing to do airside so don't go through too soon. Non-Schengen international flights (e.g. to the UK) all leave from gate 1 and you have to queue for passport checks before you are allowed in to the gate area. The immigration officers usually arrive about 30 minutes before the flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It is now up to adequate standard of other International airports apart from long immigration line and numerous security checks (luckily they don't take much time per person). Handcrafts at the Duty Free are expensive but from my experience are of first quality that you do not easily find outside. Just beware that Ariival affair is always a hit and miss: if your plane arrives when there are no other queues ahead then fine but be prepared for a very chaotic and one hour long baggage collection if several flights arrive at the same time.

There was a substantial Italian style queue but it dispersed steadily even with only one immigration officer. The baggage hall was well organised. One snag with our car hire and I believe some others is that some of the big names have slightly less obviously named partners at ALC and can be difficult to spot. For the return journey the departure and check in facilities were pleasant cool and airy. Catering has improved markedly and the El Palmeral restaurant is to be recommended landside.

almaty-airport,/airport-reviews/almaty-airport,Almaty Airport customer review,H Dalem,Netherlands,2014-04-27,An old building with old services although parts are modernized. The domestic side is on the right side with no connection to the international part. You have to exit the building to get to from domestic flights to international flights. You are not allowed to go to the airside terminal before your flight is announced for check in. This means you have to wait outside in the departure hall. WiFi is available for free but do not expect great speed. Check in is in a rather small area. Passport control is reasonably swift as is customs control and safety control. There are no shops on the domestic airside. The business lounge is almost always closed. And the local airline Air Astana does not provide this service for domestic flights. There is a small restaurant in the old and new part. There are shops in the international airside. There is a small restaurant/bar. The business lounge is available and open 24 hours. Use of this service is based on the airline. Lufthansa gets a limited menu of drinks and food. KLM seems to be more generous (no apparent restrictions). But it is an old room with plastic leather seating and not much else. There are enough ATM´s available to get cash. There are no newspapers/magazines for foreigners. Only taxis ordered or outside at the official taxi stand have decent fares. But agree on a fixed price no meters installed. Ignore offers inside the building.

On a recent flight from London-City airport we landed on the‘remote’runway so had to endure a 10-15 minute taxi to the gate. Once we got there the gate was stilled occupied so has to wait for another allocation (typical for this airport). Once we pulled up to the new gate we had as usual to wait for what seemed like ages for the jetty to dock with the aircraft then the endless walking and travelators to immigration added another 10 minutes to the journey. Luckily the immigration was very fast. So given a 40 minute flight from London we spent at least 35 minutes taxiing disembarking and endless walking. I don't find this airport at all suitable for shorter commuter type flights.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-03-05,I generally like Schiphol it is large and busy but well laid out and has plenty of facilities and never feels particularly crowded. I have generally found queues short and staff helpful. However my most recent experience was rather less than perfect because KLM has introduced some very short transit times. Going out was 55 minutes and on return 40 minutes. The first was just doable but the second very stressful and I only made my flight by jumping a queue (on instruction from staff) and running the last part (I was not alone). The problem is exacerbated if you are on short-haul Cityhopper flights which park away from the terminal and require a bus to and from them this reduces the transit time by at least 10 minutes. On the second occasion my second flight was 'now boarding' as I got off the bus from the first flight and 'gate closing' appeared when I was still some minutes from having my boarding card checked and going through security. This was despite going straight to the gate at a brisk walk anyone unfamiliar with the airport or unable to keep up a good pace would really struggle.

There is now a full-body scanner at each gate so you are expected to be at your gate an hour and a half early versus the customary 45 minutes at normal airports and even after the full-body scan at the gate you may be subjected to the pat down. For all the things this airport has going it is definitely the worst when it comes to unprofessional and rude security personnel.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,T Whittington,Sweden,2013-12-29,One of the best airports in the world and comparable to Asian benchmarks such as HKG. Most recent time I used the airport two days ago I was late and arrived at the airport 2pm by train and made it at C04 at boarding 2.15pm. Security was very fast think they even upscaled a bit for the expected traffic due to Christmas. Unfortunately there was no time left to grab a bite or do some Christmas shopping but airport has sufficient places for that. In the past I have experienced once or twice (in my case <5% of times traveled through the airport) 45 minute wait for the luggage which was too long don't know what happened there the other occasion customs took too long but apparently it was a sudden peak and it took some time to call some extra staff. These two occasions however are not representing the overall performance. The walking distance are normally fine you can be unlucky when you have a stopover and need to go from H peer to B that will take a good twenty minutes. But that shouldn't be a problem for the average healthy person. Still better than a train or worse shuttle bus. So looking at the numerous experiences I had at Schiphol great airport.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Flew in from Barcelona into Schiphol and Schiphol to Dublin. It is probably the most convenient airport with their self check-in kiosks and self drop baggage counters. The airport does look a little old now but still very well-maintained. The only thing that I think can be improved is the immigration counters and queuing areas.

Found it a bit like an airport from the 70s it is sufficient and massive and has everything but needs a face lift renovating operation. I couldn't understand why arrivals and departures are in the same place it was a bit confusing. I spent some time at the duty free upon arrival so didn't have any queues at passport control. Very well connected with train station buses and all public transport. On departure I checked in online for my Emirates flight however I spent sometime at passport control which was long and slow with only 4 counters. Duty free staff were very friendly and helpful toilets were in very bad condition. The screening and security was too long due to the fact it is a massive A380 aircraft with 500 passengers luckily I was seated in the second row at the front of the aircraft so I took my time and boarded last.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,David Tjan,Netherlands,2012-09-23,I made more then twenty flights this year mostly from Schiphol. This September I departed from Schiphol four times. 3 times Schengen lounge and 1 time intercontinental. I have to say that Schiphol is becoming more and more outdated and is rapidly losing ground with major Asian competitors like HKG SIN and Seoul Incheon and Munich and Madrid in Europe. It's overcrowded congested not passenger friendly and the terminal buildings are getting old and claustrophobic. During peak times going through security on the Schengen side is like standing in line in Disney world with endless waiting cues. One time it took me over 40 minutes to pass security. For the first time I noticed how dirty it became especially the dining area above the Schengen departure hall. All tables were full of dirty plates left behind for several hours without cleaning. Food choice was also very poor. The staff tends to be arrogant and non service minded. I am also surprised how uninviting the immigration area is. A small dark corner when entering the Netherlands. Baggage claim is terrible small long wait and sometimes I feel as If I'm on a marketplace with no space at all to move. Usual wait lasts more then 30 minutes for baggage to unload and counting. I wish I could be more positive but I do think Schiphol needs a major upgrading to maintain it position as a big player in Europe.,NA,NA,NA,4,1,2,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The terminal is clearly labelled. The facilities are clean the stores are interesting. Food service is varied and also good. Parking and transportation is very well organized. It's an excellent airport except for one big thing: passport control. It is completely unacceptable to routinely wait between 30 minutes and an hour just to show your passport (mind you this does not include going through scanners and such it's merely showing your passport). The lines are typically enormous hundreds of people squashed into one area. Usually there are several booths unoccupied even though the lines are enormous. Despite all it's many great qualities Schiphol needs to serve people better at passport control. Below it asks me if I would recommend the airport.

There are a number of rest areas with very comfortable seating (especially the ones on the top floor of Terminal 3). They are very quiet and comfortable. The airport also offers shower facilities although I am not sure if there are any free ones. I used the facilities at the Mercure Hotel in the transit area which cost 15 euros but if you are transferring between two long flights the price is worth it. Staff are friendly and helpful.

Someone told me Schiphol was a great airport and especially easy to navigate. Well that aspect might be true but everything else was awful. The worst thing is there's just nowhere to sit - there are about 20 seats by each gate (hardly close to being enough!) and we couldn't find any anywhere else. I guess they want you to have no option but to wander round the many shops (the same repeated over and over) and spend your money! Starbucks was packed with people who'd finished their coffee and stayed in their seats because there was nowhere else to go. Then 'boarding' started - except they re-screen all your hand baggage before you can go through and with only one person and one x-ray machine it was absolute chaos! They did apologise for how long it took but we couldn't see how with that system it could ever take any less time!

The one-terminal concept is a major selling point for this airport but the airport is too large for this concept to be viable. The last time I used Schiphol the planes landed on and took off from the Polderbarn runway and this added about 20 -30 minutes to the overall journey time. Both the incoming and return flights involved a lengthy trek to Gate E. Baggage handling was fine on this occasion but is not reliable.

The few open counters are not enough at all when the flights from SQ Delta and CX are arriving at the same time (and many others)! I was through quickly as have EU passport but my friend had to wait nearly 30 minutes. Baggage delivered quickly. I love the great connectivity of AMS to trains bus taxi etc. On our return flight check-in very quick and no problem but again very very long queue for passport control there were two queues only for non EU passengers and one for EU passengers - my friend was waiting 45 minutes myself 30 minutes!

In fact there are two terminals: the Domestic and International Terminals are separate buildings. For my flight to IST continuing to LHR I presented myself at the THY check-in in the Domestic Terminal but was told that if I wanted to check my luggage all the way to LHR I would have to go to the International Terminal some 500-600m away. To this inconvenience was added the simultaneous arrival of six tourist coaches which began to disgorge their passengers and hefty luggage. This prompted me to accelerate and get to the screening point ahead of the crowds - any dithering would have left me at the end of long lines that would snake out of the terminal as described in previous postings. A close call that.

Immigration took about 40 minutes bad but I have suffered worse elsewhere and the officer was polite and welcoming. Departure is rather chaotic you queue to check-in (about 20 minutes in our case) and to go through emigration (over 30 minutes) though security was cleared quickly. Once in the terminal it was crowded but had (just) enough seating. The snack bar was reasonably priced but souvenirs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the island. The good news (hopefully) is that the new terminal building is complete and due to open in the next few weeks according to locals it is much larger than the present one and looks a better design - there are several dedicated piers for large aircraft.

Very full flight for the cricket so had to queue to ages to clear through immigration. Not helped by the fact that 2 young ladies didn’t know where their accommodation was (why are they so fussy about this?) and one inebriated passenger had lost his passport. Porters were very pushy and hard to get rid of. Departed on 3 Nov - a nightmare. Flights were very full and so there were long queues to check in not helped by the fact there are no self service machines. None of the ATMs at the airport or the nearby Bank of Antigua were working so we ended up having to borrow money off other passengers to pay our departure tax. Not sure what this tax is for given the woeful state of the airport. Again long queues for immigration – perhaps they were wary of our NZ passports? Very few shops not enough seats café inadequate.

The airport does not permit any pick-ups by regional hotel or downtown shuttle services (they do permit drop-offs). On arrival you must take a small shuttle bus to the domestic terminal and the ground transportation centre if you need a regional hotel or downtown shuttle van. Try getting 3 heavy suitcases on and off this small and crowded bus. I have never been to an airport with such an inconvenient and insufficient system. The airport should permit pick-ups at the international terminal! Otherwise I found Immigration and Customs to be fast and friendly compared to my last trip.

When arriving if you need to catch a regional shuttle (Groome Transportation) to another city such as Columbus Ga. or Macon Ga. you must first get on a small airport bus that takes you to ground transportation located in the domestic terminal. It is very inconvenient especially with several suitcases. I have never seen an airport with such a system. Regional shuttles should be permitted to pick up passengers at the international terminal. Also when exiting the international terminal there are no signs indicating how to get to downtown Atlanta or other areas. The signs only say I-75 North I-75 South and I-285. This is confusing.

First there is only one place to eat in the departure level outside the security check point. It is rather small and often crowded. Second the customs area is too small to handle all incoming flights. Customs officials are rude and bark orders to arriving passengers. Third to catch MARTA or regional shuttles you have to get on a shuttle bus to go to the domestic terminal and ground transportation. That means lugging your heavy luggage onto a shuttle bus. The domestic terminal was much more convenient and offers more services.

Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points.

The central air terminal at lat phrao station is a real plus as nobody uses it! A sign in the subway telling you which exit to take would be useful! The downside is the baggage check on the Bangkok subway. They insist on opening your suitcase but never actually rummage around inside. Check-in at the terminal is swift and Thai staff take care of the bags once you arrive at Don Muang as its already tagged and security sealed on check-in at the terminal. You can now eat airside.

It only took five minutes to clear immigration. The bags took awhile to arrive but this just meant that I had time to exchange money at one of the many (competitive) vendors in the arrivals area. Departure - Horrible airport. It hard to believe that it is only six years old. The design seems like something from another era. Up through security I have no major complaints but then the entire experience really goes downhill. The first priority does not seem to be getting you to your gate but rather making sure you are exposed to every single one of the very high end shops. I did not see one newsstand or bookstore anywhere although I did finally see a great drugstore. There are some normal food options toward the end. The gate situation could not have been designed by anyone who travels much. You sit outside the gate area in a place with few seats until shortly before boarding. It is a crowded miserable experience. Your boarding cards are submitted as you enter the (secure) gate area where more seating is available.

I have tried morning noon and night and its still the same regardless of the time of day. Some airlines are sending out search parties to find their pax. Other airlines are advising their pax to turn up four hours before flight because of the long lines. If you are in another major city in Thailand make sure your carriers co-operate and clear outbound immigration before you get to Bangkok. Immigration in Chaing Mai means no lines no waiting and through in less than 2 minutes.

Usual agitated people trying to queue jump with those in front standing firm and rightly so. Thai immigration needs to hire more staff.

I reckon BKK has at least 40. Arriving back from PVG on a new TG A340-600 aircraft around 21:30 on Sunday evening I counted at least 15 unoccupied airbridge gates on the east side of the airport (and more on what little I could see of the west side). Yet we had to park way out on the tarmac. No dedicated first and business class buses. We were trundled half way around the airport packed into smoky smelly buses before then having to wait whilst 4 other buses unloaded their passengers at a single entry door.

It took them so long that we missed our flight along with about 6 other people. They are incredibly understaffed. They ended up costing us nearly $300 extra to rebook our flight and didn't offer to pay for a hotel or anything. Be thorough at security but have the staff to handle the passengers.

barbados-grantley-adams-airport,/airport-reviews/barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Barbados Grantley Adams Airport customer review,Jim Thomson,NA,2006-01-06,"I have been through Grantley Adams twice in the last month. It looks as though it will have a very nice landside terminal when the the work is finished and once through security the (I hope) temporary shopping arrangements will improve once the new units are finished. Things must have moved on quite a bit since October because the airside waiting areas at the gates seemed adequate with four wide-bodies on the stands and no sign of overcrowding. Improvements could be made in the way that check-in queues are managed with handling agent staff positioned at the entry to the queues rather than down at the desk end. On the second occasion I used the airport the signage above the desks clashed with airline information displayed on the monitors above them and resulted in some annoyance among people in the wrong queues - hence the comment about need for agents at the tail end of a queue. The public address system could also be improved (they REALLY need a good sound engineer to sort out the audio). There also seems to be a problem with the way airlines access the PA system. It would be better if there was a single person making all the announcements. That would reduce the variation in announcement ""styles"" (some barely decipherable) and techniques (some too close to the microphone and some to far away) and would ensure that all announcements were aired. One last improvement would be the change of access to the business lounge so that it was from airside rather than landside. That would make it a much more relaxing place because users would already be through security and not have to judge when to join the security queue so that they would be on time for boarding. I suppose the down side of that would be that the lounge would need to be bigger to accommodate a greater number of users. Overall a fairly average airport experience that will improve once the building is completed.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

beauvais-airport,/airport-reviews/beauvais-airport,Beauvais Airport customer review,Mark Wadham,NA,2008-11-18,This once great little airport has outgrown itself. When there were just 2 or 3 flights a day this airport was a pleasure to use. The problem is that there are now many flights and further expansion is planned. This would be fine if the facilities were developed in parallel. I arrived one hour before my flight having checked-in online to find the car parks at near saturation point. A helpful attendant invited me to leave my car at the end of a row but outside a normal parking space. In the terminal there was a very long queue to go through passport control & security. This was because insufficient staff were on duty for the number of passengers. This is inexcusable as surely the authorities must know the number of passengers expected beforehand. it also represents a loss for the airport as many passengers - myself included no longer had time to visit the shops. Although at the airport one hour before the flight I only boarded 10 minutes before departure due to these inadequacies. The other major problem at this airport is access. If your destination/departure point is Paris there's no problem. If it's anywhere else there is virtually no other choice than to use a car and be subjected to the monopolistic practices of using the airport car parks. There is a bus to Beauvais but its infrequency is as good as to render it useless. This airport needs to invest fast in additional parking quicker security and larger departure lounges. The bus service to Beauvais needs to be increased to at least one bus per hour to allow the surrounding communities to benefit from what is after all Beauvais airport rather than Paris airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The good part is that T2 is uncrowded most of the time since most all other airlines except Skyteam have moved to T3. Hence there are almost no lines for check-in security and customs and baggage claim is speedy. Departing international flights out of T2 will often get to enjoy a virtually deserted concourse with the fellow passengers on your flight the only others in the building.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Security and immigration for transit is insane only one member of staff on the transit immigration desk for 2 full plane loads of passengers. The staff manning these points I found to be rude and abrupt. The airport was freezing cold I saw many people walking around with big coats to try and warm up.

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,Peter Goldsbury,Japan,2010-09-06,For my flight from Hiroshima via Dalian there were two pick-up areas for the baggage one for Hiroshima and one for Dalian but there were no signs in English for the Hiroshima baggage so I had to go back into the immigration / customs area and start again. There was no problem with this so I suspect that it often happens. Given the huge size of this airport I cannot understand why planes are still parked away from the terminal and buses used to convey passengers with the inevitable free-for-all. For the return trip I was accompanied by a Chinese guide so the check-in procedure was very smooth. It took about five minutes so there was no sense in having to arrive three hours before departure.

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,M Bates,NA,2009-02-16,The new Beijing Capital Terminal 3 is architecturally fantastic especially from the air. The check-in area is huge and not too crowded and generally easy to navigate and I have always found the check-in process to be reasonably smooth whether for domestic or international flights. However things go downhill from there. Although the check-in area is huge all the passengers are congregated into one smallish area for access to the gates. Domestic passengers have it easy in that once through the security check the gates are right there in the same building as the ground side area. But as in the old terminals at this airport it seems like the airport authority likes to bus as many passengers as possible to remote stands which is simply ridiculous in a modern airport. It is even more ridiculous when you are on the bus looking at the airport with most of the gates unoccupied and all the planes parked a mile or so away on remote stands. I have travelled on domestic flights through this terminal eight times since it opened last year and only once have been to a proper gate. As for the international passengers all have to go down two escalators to a train that is often broken. You then get transported out to the furthest of the three buildings at the end of the dragon (the intermediate building is not in operation yet) where you then immediately go into the passport control and tiny queuing areas for security. Once through into the airside terminal be sure to have a jacket as it is always about 10C in that building. There are lots of glitzy shops to spend money in but almost nowhere to eat. For such a grand project there are so many small problems with this airport that could have been fixed with just a little thought. Regardless of this it is still 100 times better than the two other decrepit terminals at this airport.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The terminal building is wide and spacious divided into two wings. The personnel are professional helpful eloquent and proficient in foreign languages. Unlike many airports in the world the duty-free area is not an aggressive maze you're virtually forced to enter on your way to the gates it is a very discreet area but that offers an extensive choice of virtually everything. A seamless experience. There is also a small Arabian sweets stand at the entrance of the duty free area after the passport-exit control. Classical music is played inside the terminal. Security? Was so quick that I don't remember passing it which in the other airports makes you not to want to travel by plane again in the next few months. (Same for immigration on arrival can only remember the friendly officers.) There is Wi-Fi around the terminal although it wasn't completely functional the last time i travelled. Finally the gates area is a delight with carpets comfortable seating and windows offering complete view of the apron and the runways. Again the indirect lightning is so pleasant! Another small but important detail you could find electrical sockets everywhere (which are virtually non-existent in places such as Istanbul Ataturk).

Add to this a £1 charge to pick up or set down £1 for a trolley and £1 to use a smoking room. I found security to be ok not as friendly as Heathrow but certainly not as bad as Newark.

belgrade-airport,/airport-reviews/belgrade-airport,Belgrade Airport customer review,A Milossavlyevich,Cyprus,2014-04-21,Belgrade is now a busy transit airport in South Eastern Europe.

The obvious downsides would be: lack of a smoking room (especially for transit passengers people smoking in the toilets) absence of a post-office that was closed some years ago the rude security personnel at the gates and the ventilation or a/c not working properly - it easily gets too hot within the gates and air-side of the terminal.

Passport control did not take long luggage arrived extremely quickly but to be fair it seems only two flights had arrived simultaneously at that time (including mine). On departure check in was very quick gate easy to find. the only definite improvement that could've made things better would be either enlarging the waiting area in front of the gate or adding some facilities such as vending machine.

At present it serves only the cut-price cattle-herding airlines. For a modest operation it really isn't as bad as some reviews here make out. The arrivals hall was compact and it was easy to find the sort of things you need on arrival - bank machines travel information and so on. Departing through Schonefeld my flight was delayed by 5 hours which offered a lot of opportunity to experience the airport! It lacked enough seating landside to cope with two seriously delayed flights but there were reasonable facilities otherwise: indeed the best restaurant offered an excellent breakfast buffet for â‚¬11. Airside once again there was insufficient seating (the airport is designed as a shopping mall with optional access to aeroplanes in the currently fashionable style). The seating shortage was particularly unreasonable at the departure gates where people know they need to assemble en masse if they're flying with an airline that offers no seat allocations.

Anyone who is looking for the facilities you find at major German Airports like HAM or CGN (let alone MUC) is in for a serious disappointment but take SFX for what it is - a former communist airfield smartened up to deal predominantly with low cost airlines - and it really isn't bad at all. Seating is definitely an issue both in the Terminal A lounge area and at the departure gates. Like some of the other reviewers I wouldn't fancy being delayed here. On the other hand I found the security and airline staff friendly and efficient although unfortunately the same cannot be said for the passport control officers who were checking outbound passengers at the entrance to Gate 65 when I departed.

I've rarely queued for check in or security which is so much better these days. The departure lounge is reasonable with plenty of choice for a relatively small airport. What annoys without fail is their arrivals handling. Maybe it's because there is less opportunity for financial gain from arriving passengers (although their charges for baggage trolleys might suggest otherwise). I've never found immigration anything but busy that is on a good day. On a bad day the place is heaving with passengers queuing up the stairs to the gate concourse. Problems are caused when passengers use the lift to reach immigration leaving them with no option but to push into the queue. One might assume that after the time taken to clear immigration at least your bags would be merrily enjoying their carousel ride. Rarely is this the case. Why is this airport so slow at getting bags to belt? Sure every airport has occasional delays but Birmingham seems to have nothing but delays when it comes to the arrival experience. Odd as you'd think the airport would want the passengers last memory of the airport to be a good one obviously they don't otherwise they would resolve the issues.

You cannot pick up a tray until you get to the X-ray machines so there is no way to start preparing to remove liquids belt jewellery coat boots laptop coins and everything else that has to go in the tray. Hence the delay. Once through there are only a couple of tables and chairs so you struggle with the largest tray imaginable and have to sit on the floor to put everything back again. When will the airport authorities realise that they have made a huge mistake and address this problem. And don't even start me on charging to drop off airport users.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Birmingham is a lovely airport not small but not huge. Every thing you need is there and the shops in departures are normal not just high end over priced clothes and hand bags! I've only had one 20 minute delay and airport staff have been great. The only gripe is the NCP parking on site although not the airports direct fault the website says its covered and a 2 minute walk to the terminal its open air and a 10-12 min walk at a brisk pace or 5 mins on the free bus (every 5-8 mins or so) still better then Heathrow or Gatwick.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2010-08-17,Birmingham Airport seems to be going down the road of ripping customers off at every opportunity. Firstly you have to pay £1 just to drop someone off. They charge Â£3 per 15 minutes if you dare take more than 15 mins at the drop-off area. It used to be free but according to one of the police officers at the airport due to anti-terror measures the charges were brought in along with a new drop-off area. The airport luggage trollies cost £1 (you don't get your £1 back). The plastic bags cost £1 at the security point. Upon arrival at the airport baggage always takes about an hour to arrive in the baggage reclaim area and you are stung again for a £1 luggage trolley. My suitcase had its wheels damaged which meant we had no choice but to buy a luggage trolley. I will not be flying out of BHX again.,NA,NA,NA,2,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,Nick Wilcock,United Kingdom,2010-03-07,This used to be a very pleasant airport. But it has slipped in a couple of areas of late. The first impression if you use Long Term Car Park 1 is the bus to the terminals. This used to be for car park passengers only and it stopped at both terminals. Now it is for car park passenger 'set down' passengers using the free 15 minute option and airport staff. As a result it is slow and meanders its way through the car park before stopping at a point which still requires an open air walk to reach Terminal 2 departures. Quite why business travellers should be forced to share a bus with airport ramp workers is beyond me - no other airport mixes staff and passenger buses. The 'priority channel' at security causes resentment from passengers queuing in the 'normal' access - particularly when only 2 out of 5 checking lanes are available. Servisair lounge offers very little in the way of comfort food or beverages and the thumping music from the Tie Rack shop nearby is intrusive. On return the automatic passport readers are a plus - but then it all goes wrong again with the latest change to car parking. You can no longer pay in the terminal; instead you have to drive to the exit gate park pay in a draughty shed with only 2 machines (which do not have clear instructions for use) then back out into the oncoming traffic to drive to the exit lanes. Whoever came up with this stupid idea should go and visit other airports to see how car parking is managed!,NA,NA,NA,4,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

blackpool-airport,/airport-reviews/blackpool-airport,Blackpool Airport customer review,B Scott,NA,2009-08-09,My experience of Blackpool Airport was not a positive one and I will certainly not be flying from this airport again. The free parking one of the airport's selling points is a less positive feature when you realise you are parking in a field a long distance from the terminal building. It would frankly be an insult to charge anybody to park on what is essentially a glorified field. The Airport Development fee though much needed in terms of the airport requiring a lot of development is also a very irritating element of this airport experience. There is certainly no evidence of this money being spent on the previously mentioned car park or in fact the terminal building which reminded me of a scout hut in terms of build and facilities. My experience was not helped my officious staff many of who were clearly on a power trip indulging in their own self importance. The highlight of this was in the cafe in the departure lounge where the man serving decided I did not have time for the bacon sandwich I ordered (without even knowing which flight I was on or in fact what time I was departing). The facilities are extremely basic. On our return entering the scout hut via a fire exit added to the sense of amateurism that surrounds the whole experience of flying from this airport.

The latter was really bad when I travelled through a few weeks ago. I think they must be in the process of upgrading it, or building it altogether! Presently its like a DIY airport made out of Ikea flatpack. When you check in you have to take your bags round to a separate desk for them to be tagged and sent to the plane. This created a pretty chaotic and busy environment. The queue for security was long and merged with the queues for the bag drop area. Once through security there were more queues that snake round the shopping section whilst people wait to go through immigration and the boarding areas for the flights. This means that its impossible to look round the retail area and food areas. It was all so chaotic and such a muddle! I'd hate to think what it'll be like once peak season kicks in. As i said, i think they're in the process of constructing this terminal, which is called the 'billi' terminal, as it had a very temporary feel to it.

bournemouth-airport,/airport-reviews/bournemouth-airport,Bournemouth Airport customer review,L Joyce,United Kingdom,2014-07-27,I know that the security info for airports from the government must change on a daily basis however the people who work at Bournemouth International Airport clearly don't want their jobs if recent experience is anything to go by. I have had the experience of this by flying out of there twice in a month. Once to Ibiza in June with Ryannair and I have just got back from Corfu flying with Thomson. I remember the days of Bath Travel when flying from Bournemouth was such a luxury. Having an airport not ten minutes away from your home and with happy smiling people was such a novelty. Since it has been sold to Manchester Airports I have noticed a very big decline in Customer Service. Lets start with the airport itself. To pay £2.50 for half an hour drop off is just a rip off and encourages people to be dropped off at the road before the airport. In the grand scheme of things £2.50 is not a lot but when hardly any other airport in Britain does this it makes you feel that you are somehow being scammed. The toilets are fine but there is simply not enough of them especially when it comes to last minute. I do like the Duty Free shop and the WH Smith the cafe is also fine and very clean with a wide range of dishes. When I flew to Ibiza in June I had my trusty clear sandwich bag which I have used at Gatwick various terminals at Heathrow and Southampton. This wasn't an issue here. Fast forward three weeks later to last week where I was stopped and told that my clear bag was too big and I needed to buy one of their bags for £1. (Gatwick and Heathrow hand these bags out for free so yes another way for Bournemouth to make money out of you). When I tried to say that I had used it three weeks before and it was fine the security guy simply told me that the other person shouldn't have let me through. I get the feeling that it depends which jobsworth you have on that day. Now my real reason for deciding to complain is the fact that Bournemouth airport offers online check in. We had reserved seats for both flights but checked in anyway to print the boarding passes. 20 minutes later I have filled in all their questions online with our details etc however unlike the big airports they don't offer a 'bag drop which I wasn't aware of and isn't mentioned online and which also meant that we still had to queue for 40 minutes and then a further 20 minutes at the check in desk while the Check in Clerk weighed our bags hand luggage checked our passports and documents even though we had already printed out our boarding passes. All this was done without a word or a smile. I don't see the point in offering a 'check in online' service if you still have to go through the usual process. The airport is simply too small and the airlines cannot be bothered to provide enough staff I am afraid that this has turned me back to the biggies or even Southampton.

Are the staff culturally sensitive and ethical? In my experience yes you're not going be searched here because you haven't covered your tattoos or have to worry about security staff confiscating your items so they can pocket it.

Seems the international arrival area is going through extensive renovation to ensure each arriving passenger has to pass through duty free upon arrival. Upon arrival on Monday I could not believe my eyes when we actually had to stand in line in front of the duty free area for approx. 30 minutes before being able to enter the actual immigration area. Fortunately I had an express card and eventually made it to the baggage claim within 1 hour but believe economy passengers would have easily spent 2-3 hours clearing immigration. Air conditioning was not sufficient and saw lots of tired families arriving with their children after a long trip from Europe/Asia/America. Immigration experience simple and fast as usual but the incompetence did not stop there. Had the pleasure of waiting another 30 minutes for my luggage as some clever mind decided to combine our QF flight from LA (B 747) and a SQ flight from Singapore (A 330) and the same luggage belt. As the majority of passengers were stuck in the immigration line no luggage was removed from the belt so lots of luggage was backed-up and could not get on to the belt. Needless to say that 2 other belts were not used at all while others just serviced single flights on small B 737 aircraft. First impression of a visitor arriving in a foreign country is always the airport so I feel very sorry that so many visitors on that day had such terrible experience arriving in Brisbane.

Flying business class on EK had checked-in online and with carry-on only went straight to security and immigration. No priority security lane open at 6am but at least 50-60 people in front of me many of them being apparent first time travellers as it took ages to get through. Finally made it to immigration only to be told that I had no right to line-up in the express line as I did not have the express card from the airline.

This time around I was disappointed. Firstly, the security check. If you've forgotten a small plastic bag for your carry on liquid items you are encouraged to pay out £1 for a bag - don't bother doing this! Once through there were staff handing them out for free. Not sure why they do this, Heathrow and most other airports seem to give the bags out for free. The security check itself was awful. The queue was unbelievable and crawled along at a snails pace. The low ceilinged queuing area was stiflingly hot and the whole thing was just bad. Compare this to my last flight from Heathrow when I zipped through in 10 mins, max. Once through, the facilities on offer aren't too bad, but the terminal building felt very dingy and closed off, there were no windows that offered views out onto the runway area. I'm sure there were last time I flew from here. The walk from the terminal building to the boarding gate for my flight was also epic. Admittedly, that isn't necessarily a problem unique to Bristol. Coming back, again the walk to immigration and baggage reclaim was a real epic, worse than going out. That said, bags came off quickly and the joy of a small airport is that you're out and on your way pretty quick. I've been told that Bristol is undergoing a bit of an upgrade, so be to be fair some of my gripes may be resolved in the future.

The good news is that the new gates require a much shorter walk and there is far more seating than at the western apron. Note however that many flights do still go from the western gates so you may not be lucky. Early morning is always the busiest time but on my last visit the wait for security was about 5 minutes (though getting through took another 5 minutes as I kept setting the scanner off never found out why). Return was OK but could be better the usual lengthy wait for immigration checks but at least one of the officers took the time to explain why using the scanners is often no quicker than queuing for a manual check.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Mark Taylor,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,First the good news. Given this is a small airport averaging around half a dozen departures per hour you are unlikely to face a long queue on the runway for take off or for that matter to have to circle around for ages to land. Also the check in queues were not too bad albeit I flew during the off peak season. But that is about all there is good to say. The whole point of little airports is they should be easy to use very short walks from the plane to the exit. Instead it has been designed without airbridges so you usually need a bus to get to the plane. You will also face long walks with no moving walkways (mine on return was over 1/4 mile) along with going up and down stairs (again no escalators). Anyone with young children and pushchairs or elderly and infirm should take careful note. Access is horrendous as the airport is in the middle of nowhere without any sensible connection to the M4 or M5. Most people will either have to go through Bristol or across windy minor roads. The parking is basically in a dirty great big field poorly concreted and open to the elements so if it's raining you will get drenched. All this for parking prices on a par with LHR and Gatwick despite the airports rural location. Helpfully the short term car park is also sited in a dip so you face a big uphill lugging of your cases while the rain pelts you. If you want a trolley it's £2 per trolley non refundable.

I'd like to make an observation on other largely negative comments about walking time to gates and irritating charges for trolleys and car pick up. Probably 80% of the airports landing fees revenue is from low cost carriers who are not prepared to pay for frills including moving walkways and air bridges. Even at airports with these facilities the likes of Easyjet and Ryanair end up in a basic terminal and/or one far away from the main entrance and when you get to the gate you can still be bussed to the plane.

As we walked along we saw at least a dozen aircraft parking spaces closer (including 3 in right front of the terminal) none of which was being used.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,L Eames,United Kingdom,2011-01-09,Bristol airport cannot cope with the number of flights. Immigration is a long queue and the machines for the new passports have never been in use since my other half got one. In December they failed to load our suitcases onto an early morning AF flight (can't use the excuse the airport was busy) leaving us without luggage for 96 hours at our destination. The departure lounge is usually very crowded encouraging you into one of the many bars if you want to sit down. There is now a new gate for smaller aircraft. Instead of being bussed out to the plane you can now walk the whole distance up and then down various flights of stairs and along very long corridors.

The architect of the recent expansion only seems to know about Shopping Malls and very little about handling passengers. The departure hall now has some seating but the whole area is inadequate for handling the scrums associated with budget airline seating arrangements. Arrivals are a nightmare; a sign at the point disembarking passengers enter the maze say that it is 390m to the luggage hall. As a previous reviewer has pointed out there are no safety notices or indications of emergency exits. The 390m does not include the additional 100m or so provided by the UK Border agency as a queuing maze. Some of the UK Border agency officials are sufficiently sadistic to take pleasure watching elderly passengers some with walking difficulties struggling through the maze in an almost empty queuing hall.

Once a gate is called there is now an extremely long walk some of it uphill and involving stairs. There is no seating and no facilities for half-a-mile! A modern airport should surely have escalators and moving walkways over such a long distance. Then on reaching the gate there is - unbelievably - no seating at all.

Getting to / from the airport: an executive coach leaves Brussels south station (Gare du Midi) 2h. 30m. before each flight departure. As the average journey (± 60 km) takes one hour the bus arrives 90 minutes before the flight departs - in other words 60 minutes before check-in closes. The bus parks ± 50 metres from the departures door. For the return journey: buses leave the airport 20 mins or so after the flight arrivals back to Brussels Gare du Midi. At weekends I have done this journey in 40 minutes. Cost: €10.00 single payable to the driver. This includes an arbitrary €3.60 tax imposed by the Chairleroi Airport which is the subject of a legal action by Ryanair who charter the buses. Train / bus connections are not so good. I have written twice to TEC (Charleroi) asking why at weekends their ""connectional"" bus #68 from the airport arrives at Charleroi Railway station three minutes AFTER the hourly trains depart to Brussels. No intellgible answer was forthcoming - but they are Francophones and don't ever take criticism - just offer a ""Gallic shrug"". A ""joined-up public transport service"" - NOT! Parking is plentiful and cheap with free shuttle buses to/from the terminal every 10 minutes. The cafe resembles a motorway service station in UK but food and drink are comparatively cheap for the standard offered. Best to stock up here before your 60-90 minute flight so that you don't die of starvation or pay €9.00 on-board for a sandwich. This can be more than the cost of the flight! From the terminal passengers walk to the plane across the tarmac ± 100 metres. Boarding is fronty and rear so very quick. In the new Schengen terminal in Brussels Zaventem airport it can take up to 20 minutes to walk to the most remote departure gate! There are plans to expand Charleroi Airport with a second terminal in 2006 assuming that the European Commission's latest investigation hasn't scuppered the Ryanair operation by then.

The new layout in the Departures terminal means that check-in security screening and passport control move much faster now. There is plenty of space to sit down and stroll in the lounges ok shopping as well as smoking areas. Arrivals is still in some need of improvement: if you deplane via bus (which seems to be the rule rather than the exception) you have to climb two storeys on an incredibly narrow spiral staircase (and it can be quite difficult especially with a heavy carry-on or a stroller; do not count on the elevators working). Luggage arrives quite quickly. But the biggest problems at Otopeni are the state of the lavatories and price gouging. The lavatories are without exception filthy: nobody seems to bother cleaning them very often toilet paper and soap are frequently missing and they also appear to double as smoking areas for the custodial staff. Price gouging is epic: a small water or Coke is over 3 Euros beer and coffee are pushing 5 Euros. Same goes for the dismal snacks. In short it's a terrible place for a long layover but an ok one if you only have one or 2 hours to kill.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Terminal 2 is divided in two parts making it really small and uncomfortable. Queues are huge both at check-in and security. If not for the Skycourt after security and the maze-like duty-free it would really be claustrophobic with the lack of daylight being a real nuisance. The link to the city is very poor. The bus / metro combination is both uncomfortable and expensive making it impossible for you to reach the city center without a transfer. The entire terminal has only one exchange booth but most appalling wasn't their scarcity but the rate they're charging which was nothing short of a scam - welcome to Europe. Coming from Ukraine (IEV) the contrast was even more evident. Toilets weren't clean broken faucets soap lacking in many. Next - the Wi-Fi. BUD supposedly offers 2 hours of free Wi-Fi that is available once you get passed a lengthy security/rules agreement check-page that directs you then onto another useless page that given the speed takes ages to load. Even once passed those mandatory checkpoints the internet was still very slow and almost completely useless.

Arrived and bussed to terminal since there are no air bridges here arrival hall is a very small claustrophobic room not the cleanest however surprisingly didn't queue much for passport control. Waiting for luggage felt like forever taxi drivers trying to grab you and your luggage is still an annoying issue departure was a better experience. I prefer the coziness of T1 still in good shape and has a decent food and beverage outlets and small nice duty free though very annoying with the non stop flight announcements for departure and arrival I wonder why it was only in Arabic.

cairo-airport,/airport-reviews/cairo-airport,Cairo Airport customer review,T Kofod,Denmark,2013-03-21,A new terminal has been added to the old one - that means that when you arrive and remote parked there is a quite long drive to the terminal. As everything in Egypt arrival can be quite stressful you need to buy your entrance ticket (visa) by the exchange offices you might as well change money at the same time. Then you go through passport/visa control and then luggage area. you might be asked again for a passport check before leaving the airport. Coming out of terminal please hold on to everything you have as strangers will grab your luggage without asking and expect a tip. Even if you have an ordered transfer they let the strangers take it - everybody makes the most out of emptying the tourists pockets. In case you are arriving at international and need a connecting domestic flight it can be a bit tricky but follow the signs and ask your way to a small corridor - which by the way is a very popular praying area. When you arrive at the airport terminal touts will round you up and ask if you are flying Egyptair (it is the Egyptair terminal so of course you are) they pretend they are VIP handlers and take your luggage to first security screening demanding money before you enter. Check in is slow. Until you reach your plane you will be subjected to 4-6 security checks and many of them ask you to pay tips - even cleaning staff will follow you into the toilets handing you toilet paper and ask for money. There are shops and eateries which are overpriced. Use all Egyptian pounds before entering the terminal- they do not change it back. When boarding first you go through security screening then one person checks your boarding card and passport then you walk 1 meter and a new security person checks your boarding card and passport - and before you enter the airplane another security person checks your boarding card.,NA,NA,NA,4,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Security check took a while but that seems to be the norm nowadays. There was a decent duty free and some shops after security. Nothing too interesting. Also few restaurants near the duty free.

caracas-airport,/airport-reviews/caracas-airport,Caracas Airport customer review,Alasdair Brooks,NA,2010-08-26,Nearly two years on from the most recent review by A Hetier and much remains familiar at Maiquetia. Entering the country is easy and immigration is quick and friendly. Leaving the international terminal however is a far more stressful experience. The problem seems to stem from the multiple security agencies operating at the airport who often duplicate security checks. So one set of police screened everyone queueing at the check-in desk. Once in the customs/immigration area carry-on bags were x-rayed twice in rapid succession by two entirely different security groups. Then - and this was the real delay - passengers were called from the boarding gate in groups of 5-7 at fifteen to twenty minute intervals to go down to the working area of the airport for hand inspections of their already checked-in suitcases. I was in the penultimate group to be called down for an inspection at 6 PM - for a flight that was supposed to have left at 4:20. Some passengers claimed that TAP (with whom I was flying) and Iberia are singled out for this type of additional security check; others claimed it was common on all international flights though perhaps not to the same degree we were experiencing. I can't verify either of these claims. And even after these suitcase checks our carry-on bags (already x-rayed twice remember) had to be be hand searched in the airbridge by the same police force who had been checking our passports at check-in. These constant overlapping checks can cause significant waits and long delays. It took me two and a half hours to complete the check-in and immigration formalities and after that my flight was then almost four hours late leaving. Do also make sure that you have _more_ Bolivares than you think you need for taxes as all taxes have to be paid in cash. In addition to the airport tax (currently BsF 162.50) I had to pay an additional BsF 30.50 at check-in as the separate departure tax - usually included in tickets - had gone up in August forcing everyone to pay the difference in cash. Several passengers had only brought enough Bs to pay the airport tax and were placed in some difficulty since the ATMs upstairs only accept local Venezuelan cards (in a pinch some of the travel agencies downstairs will reportedly forward you cash; at a price). For all that airside is modern with plentiful duty free and food options - some of which will take a non-Venezuelan credit card - so at least you won't go hungry. I also used the domestic terminal several times in July and August. This is considerably easier to leave than the international terminal and I always found it a pleasant and stress-free experience. Do be careful though if your flight is using Gate/Puerta 5. This is not a standard gate but rather where the buses for smaller planes that don't use airbridges leave from; announcements for boarding are called out by an airline representative and actual boarding does not always match what the airport departure boards claim is happening. You need to pay attention and speak enough Spanish (not a huge amount to be honest) to understand these verbal boarding announcements. Like international airside in the domestic terminal is clean modern and with plentiful food options. The usual warnings about not taking unlicensed taxis from Maiquetia still apply; if at all possible have someone meet you and if this isn't possible only take an official taxi booked from the official desks. The warnings about robbery and express kidnappings from unlicensed taxis should be taken very seriously. Harassment inside the terminal however isn't as bad as some airports I've used. It was less full-on than the old Bangkok airport for example.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Drop-off area was good and no charge (well done CWL). Check-in staff were fine security was no worse nor no better than most airports we use so all in all not bad.

On arrival at the terminal I found that the check in queues for the Thomson desks were reaching outside the entrance. With travellers having to arrive up to 3 hours before flying and waiting for what seemed forever to actually check in the facilities for having a meal both before entering and in the departure lounge are very poor. Eventual boarding was good. On our return in the early hours of the morning the only flight to land waiting for our cases became an exercise in patience. Some cases would arrive and there would be up to a 15 min wait for the next batch (I think they were unloading using a wheelbarrow) in all for not a very big plane it took well over an hour to deliver all the luggage.

On our return we were off the plane and in the car within 20 minutes and that was after collecting bags which is pretty good in my experience. Other reviews moan about charges for Pick-up and Drop-off but most UK airports now do this and there is a free area if you wish to use it.

The facilities look frayed at the edges but are at least functioning but the impression is of an airport that is staffed as part of a job creation exercise with motivation energy and charm being in short supply. Security is a particular bane with backed-up lines and staff relishing the chance to exercise their power by barking at pax.

The only downside is that relatives and friends are made to wait outside in what can be hot and (in the rainy season) humid conditions, rather than the airconditioned terminal.

cebu-airport,/airport-reviews/cebu-airport,Cebu Airport customer review,Dirk Visser,NA,2005-12-11,We flew into and out of Cebu-Mactan Airport in November of this year. We arrived quite late from HKG and had to wait quite a while for immigration to process our full flight together with a PAL flight from Japan. Luggage claim area was like stepping back in time....a bit dodgy but ok. Leave the terminal and you are literally bombarded left and right by taxi drivers and money exchangers. Leaving was a different story. The check-in desks for the international departures are behind doors that are kept locked until a few hours before departure which means you are sitting in a rather dingy terminal until your airline is ready to check you in. Security is a joke but that didn't surprise us after being in the Philippines. Once you check in you have the option of going through to the gate or back into the main terminal. We were told to go to immigration and were surprised with the fact that we had to pay an airport tax P 550 or $ 11. Once through passport control you are at the gates. There is ONE store: Phlilippes Duty Free (total rip- off and joke) and two cafeterias which were asking ridiculous amounts for everything on the menu. As the gate area was kept closed you wait in a huge area behind passport control just behind passport control. We had a laugh as we stood (there were only 5 chairs) behind the passport control people who were playing video games on their computers. That explains why they snarled at us when we arrived! We interrupted them!!!! Other than stand and wait you can be massaged by ladies that await you when you clear immigration who bother you even when you barely look in their direction. So for those travelling to this prison- turned-airport do not clear immigration too early as there is nothing to do!

Basic stuff. Foreign exchange - Thomas Cook office within the secure area available. Free local phone call permitted from assistance booth near baggage collection area. Most staff speak good english and respond well. Long-distance / international calls can be placed from telephone booths (labeled ISD/STD) which are manned and you can get receipts. If you have someone to pick you up at the airport: Clear customs; Exit immediately after customs and wait there. You will turn left to exit the ""secure area"". Do not do this unless you have seen the people waiting to receive you. If you have do not have someone to pick you up: Clear customs; Exit and as you turn left you will see two private travel agencies within the secure area (one is Akbar travels and the other is Airport Express). Both of them are prepaid safe reliable. Akbar costs 350 rupees (less than 10 USD) (as of Aug 2008) to a ride anywhere in to Chennai city. Tip the person who rolls your luggage (about 20 to 30 rupees); and tip the driver about the same. Walk very closely to the person who takes your luggage to your car since you might get lost in the crowd outside. MAA International Departures: Arrive at least 3 to 4 hours prior to departure time. Must have a ticket / itinerary printed and in your hand with passport to get in to the airport. No other options allowed. Check-in queues are very long and slow. Elite status helps (depending on airline). No food for purchase prior to check-in. Passport control is usually quick (max 30 minutes with a 100 people in line). Duty free available. Overpriced food available prior to and after security check (for your handbags etc). The food is actually good in the mornings (between 6 to 9:30 AM) and after that its not that great. Make sure you have a luggage tag for your hand baggage - this is true for all Indian airports. They will make you leave the line and go and get one. Also make sure you have exactly one piece of hand baggage...no matter what it is.(so fit everything in to one bag). Did not use any lounges. MAA Local airport: NEed ticket with ID to enter airport. Some food available prior to check-in. All luggage is screened with X-ray machines similar to international airport. These queues are long. Otherwise its generally quick to get through to check luggage and clear security. Individual airlines may be slow depending on quality of service. After security check there is extremely overpriced stuff to eat. A coffee dispensing machine. Its pretty boring otherwise. Nothing to do except people-watch.

So checking-in (and particularly baggage screening) is less stressful. Also: new are separate airline lounges but I am not sure whether they are a real improvement. For one the combined Paramount/Sahara lounge does not serve any beer whereas the airport restaurant does. Second all the new lounges lack windows - the airport restaurant offers a spectacular view across the tarmac and runways. Security uncrowded despite my flight departing at 18.50. I checked the prices at the refreshment stand in the departure lounge and the prices are effectively daylight robbery (Rs 60 for a can of Coke). Still a lack of airbridges and most domestic pax have to be taken by bus.

The airport has been upgraded in the 2 years I have been here and the new TG lounge is really rather nice. Typical thai decor. Adequate snacks/beverages. Why are westerners hung up on alcohol. Is it really impossible to go anywhere without consuming the stuff? BKK is only an hour away!! And that is an airline issue not the airports. Buy an overpriced beer upstairs! The restaurant upstairs is a rip-off but this is not a unique problem to CNX as it is true of just about every airport i can think of (and I travel around 70000 miles a year so i know a few). CNX has much going for it notably the close proximity to the centre of town and the recent addition of a meter taxi service which I always use and a bus service which passes the end of my street if I could just fathom out what their schedule is supposed to be!! and the ability of being able to clear immigration here off most (BUT NOT ALL) connecting flights is a real plus. Some carriers have no agreement so TG in BKK claim (and disputed by BKK customs) to transit BKK and thus benefit from this facility. I arrived in BKK on Gulf Air (GF) and found this out the hard way but no problems with Emirates. So you end up having to clear immigration in BKK travel to CNX as a domestic passenger then reunite yourself with your baggage in the customs hall by walking in 'the wrong way'. Fortunately there is no problem as the security people probably see this off every flight. And to those who dream of flights from the USA or Australia direct to CNX please stop dreaming. We have lost the non-stop narita flight into CNX so the thought of an LAX-CNX flight is sheer fantasy. So we will all be stuck with a night in BKK. A new HKG-CNX flight is about to start with Hong Kong Express. But having seen how they cancel flights from HKG to Guangzhou one wonders how long this will last.

As we made our way towards immigration we were ordered by a young lady to 'stand against the wall' get against the wall'. We queued there for about 45 minutes before getting to a hall best described as a cattle market crammed with hundreds of visitors. People were taking photos of the unbelievable crowd. Only about 1/3 of passport desks were manned. It took 2 hours to get through the queue plus the 45 minutes in the corridor. Many people were missing connecting flights. When they asked staff what they should do they were rudely told 'stand in line there's nothing you can do you just have to catch the next one'. I guess for some that meant spending the night in the terminal. One parent tried to offer food to their bored child only to be ordered to 'put that food away- no food' because they were using sniffer dogs.

Although it is not a fault of anyone this airport is just unreliable especially in the winter anyone can lose connections due to delays that can be triggered not just by snowfalls but also by mere rains coupled with low visibility. I was affected by exactly that and ended up arriving at O'Hare an hour late. Airport's location itself is already a reason to avoid this airport especially for connections. The airport offers a cheap rail link into the downtown in addition to the expressway option and considering the frequent congestion's on the expressways around Chicago sometimes the metro option is a must for travelers. Except for T5 - the international terminal - the other terminals are also nicely grouped together in the central terminal area so walking over to a different terminal is not that difficult at all there is a free and efficient Airport Transit System that links all terminals and the remote parking lots. The terminal facilities however can have some upgrades to be more appealing. Airside had seating available for passengers around each gate but landside had a very limited number of benches. The wifi was not free and even when I wanted to pay for it the signal was not even strong. The power ports were virtually non-existent. Flight information displays were lacking both in terms of its quality and its size. Information was incorrect for some delayed flights. Some flight information was not even clear as to which terminal they were expected to depart/arrive many first-timers would be in trouble finding their ways to the correct terminal/gates. Other aspects of evaluation seem to be on par with or slightly worse than most other major airports in my opinion. In short I would discourage others from flying in and out of ORD unless it is unavoidable (e.g. Chicago is their final destination).

There is no direct link between the domestic terminals and the international terminal which means if you come in on an International flight you have no hope connecting unless you have at least a 3 hour wait between flights.

I wanted to give this airport 4 or even 5 stars for the experience I have had of Terminals 1-3 however T5 drags it right back down. Departures: There are almost no facilities beyond security bar a few carts selling candy and cigarettes. There is no bar except for a temporary stand selling bottled beer - not exactly the way to unwind before a long flight. Before security things are a little better - you can at least get something to eat albeit at McDonalds. Arrivals: There's a long wait for bags however my destination has always been from Ireland where immigration is done before take-off so this mitigates that somewhat as we don't have to queue. There is a bar in arrivals (one might have considered putting the bar in departures?) and a shop but little else and the area is cramped with few seats. The rest of O'Hare is a pleasure but it's as if International flights are an afterthought.

No fast track for F/J class passengers no help whatsoever with flight connections. You just wait in the queue at immigration and take your chances. It's not even logical they had space at the US immigration channel so some uniform opened the barrier for people waiting behind me to go through. One guy tried to join this from near me- probably also had a connection- but aforementioned jobsworth shooed him back. I can handle the idea of needing extra security but if you US immigration can't find a way within this to accommodate the realities of an international hub then come clean and tell people not to try connecting at this or other US airports operating on this basis- which is many of them I believe. To their credit the airport and airline staff are pretty good at managing the situation and getting you on a later flight because they are well used to this farce and ashamed of it too. I know LHR immigration is bad but at least there's an effort to get people to their connection. If this is truly where US government/immigration has arrived at post 9/11 I'm afraid you've conceded a clear victory to the terrorists on this one.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport has average facilities for departure however it is with arrival that the weaknesses of this airport shine forth. One small baggage area with an exit for domestic travellers no customs check required and one exit for international travellers with a through customs check result in chaos. The lack of baggage carts and hundreds of people struggling with several large suitcases each all struggling towards the one international exit result in a rugby scrum.

The staff are friendly the facilities adequate for a regional airport of this size the queues managable and it's clean. It just feels like it's missing something. Despite it being refurbished within the last decade or so it feels like it needs a bit of a touch up-and the constant use of that sickly blue colour everywhere doesn't necessarily help the situation. So yes it is a nice airport in regional NSW that serves its purpose and the needs of the people but I just get the feeling that with a bit of money put in (new floorings lick of paint open up the departure lounge a bit more provide wi-fi) it could be have a certain wow factor reserved for NSW regional airports like Newcastle Albury and Dubbo which have been thrust forward into the 21st Century.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

columbus-airport,/airport-reviews/columbus-airport,Columbus Airport customer review,H Lee,United States,2012-12-13,Overall pleasant to fly in and out of. The facility has gone through a major renovation some time ago and it is still well maintained. Most parts including the restrooms are very clean. The main terminal is not so big but not too small to be overcrowded either. The parking garage is attached to the main terminal so travelers can avoid being exposed to the wind/rain/sunlight to reach their cars. A McDonald's is located within the airport complex. The landside and the 3 concourses are also fairly well laid out and dotted with decent number of eateries. In most cases the check-in and security check procedures altogether took only about 10 minutes for me and as the terminal is not too big even walking to the farthest gate takes only about 5 minutes. Of course TSA agents sometimes can be less than courteous. Baggage handling was fairly quick I did not really have to wait for more than 5 minutes until my bags were placed on the carousel for pickup. This airport offers free wi-fi and plenty of power outlets in between seats including USB power ports. My only concern about this facility is the lack of public transportation options. This airport is connected to the city by only two bus lines (52 and 92). Of course as this airport is only about 15 minutes' drive from downtown even a taxi ride costs only about $25 which implies a low demand of public transportation options in this region.

The airport has over the years developed improved passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting to your gate. The latest development is scanning machines just before security. These automated gates allow entry on reading your boarding card much the same as the London Underground ticket gates. The next improvement due in 2013 (which I'm looking forward to) is 'self-service baggage drop' where passengers can simply drop off their bags without standing in those endless snaking lines.

We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples? Overall a mixture of pluses and minuses but I would give it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the surprisingly positive impression we gained of the security staff.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

American dominates the airport and takes up 4 terminals - if you're making a connection between A/C and B/D (on opposite sides of the central highway) it can take a while because the SkyTrain is slow and makes many stops. Terminal D was recently renovated and is quite smart but A B and C are older and could use a refurb. Dining options are outstanding in D but mediocre in A B and C. For whatever reason the airport operators crank up the aircon at all hours and the terminals feel unnecessarily cold.

Amenities are on par with other large US hubs but security checks rarely take more than 15 mins of queuing. Customs/Immigration is probably the fastest I have experienced in the US and although int'l transfer passengers must exit the secure area and undergo an additional security check this is not really different from any other US airport. Gate-to-gate transfers can be quite a trek given the size of the airport but are quite simple if your gate is closer to a Skytrain entrance. The biggest gripe is the fact that the baggage system is slow and outdated.

Be prepared before going through security as although the queue looks long it moves fast and security staff get annoyed if they have to ask you to remove your belt watch etc but they are very pleasant if you are ready. The flight I was waiting for was leaving at 1:15am and there were a few international flights but the cafe was closed. The only place to buy refreshments was from a ""trolley"" however the coffee wasn't bad and wasn't too expensive but nothing to eat that was hot.

T3 is a lot better than the old airport. Signage is clear and present in all areas of the airport. There are also lots of screens showing flight departures/arrivals. Bathrooms are found in all corners and are extremely clean. A lot of seating is available and there are a lot of shops present at the terminal. Delhi Duty free is very good - lots of products are available. Many good restaurants are in the terminal - serving Indian and international food. however immigrations queues are extremely long and can be a pain. security is also tedious and security staff can often be quite unpleasant. On the plus side airport staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Lounges are also good. The terminal is aesthetically stunning.,NA,NA,NA,9,2,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,In transit from LHR to BKK with Air India. Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge). Long walks between gates so once boarding starts you need to start going to the gate.,NA,NA,NA,7,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,M Seymour,United Kingdom,2013-11-07,First of all I must mention that T3 is an enormous improvement on the old terminal. It is well laid out and very spacious. I'm not sure about the brownish carpet throughout though! With a few improvements mainly in attitudes it might one day achieve the status of some of the better airports like Singapore although I'm not holding my breath. First of all immigration and security staff need to learn manners. Security staff in particular are incompetent and surly. Secondly toilet attendants need to attend to their cleaning duties instead of hovering about trying to extract tips. Thirdly WiFi needs to be free. There is supposed to be free WiFi for 30 minutes. However the PIN code was not fully sent to my mobile phone and as a result I was not able to log on either at the time of my first visit or upon my return visit a fortnight later. Finally FX facilities need to be provided in the departure area after immigration so people have the possibility of converting unused Rupees into an alternative currency since it is not possible to exchange those in one's home country and it would appear taking Rupees out of India is actually illegal!,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,A Arora,United Kingdom,2013-09-25,I had to use Delhi for domestic and international transfers. The Airport has still got smelly carpet which they need to change. The toilets were clean and better than Heathrow. The security queues at international transfer was really long and as well as the queue for lift to domestic transfers. They need to introduce more lifts to domestic transfers as one lift is not sufficient for international passengers. The food court is impressive and caters for world cuisine. Elderly people have a nightmare at this airport due to long walks. This can be overcome by introducing shuttle services to gates from security gates.

There are checks to get into the airport checks to get to check-in checks to get to passport control and the massive queues at passport control and through security.

So far I have not used the new T-3 terminal because I have not been back since 2009. Seems like everything that happens there is chaotic from line-ups to get into the airport to boarding your flight. A few things I should warn you about specially if you've never been there before make sure you take your online flight schedule/ticket etc with you. I know it is only a printed piece of paper but the security personnel don't allow you inside unless you have it. No one is allowed inside the terminal unless he/she has a flight and they want to see the proof. Oh yes be ready to be checked at least three four times. Be ready to be approached by employees (from cleaners to policemen) asking for well let me just say some tip. Feel free to say a firm no. While trying to resolve something try to get to the highest possible official.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,L Carter,Australia,2014-09-06,After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took Due for a 2.45 arrival on a Thursday landing delayed as we had to sit in a holding pattern for over 30 mins. 1.5hr wait to get through immigration word is that you can't purchase the VIP pass anymore to get through quicker but you can go up to someone and pay then and there if they are in a good mood. I was already 4 lines into my wait when I found this out so didn't want to risk it. Flying business or having premium FF gets you nothing on arrival at this airport every foreigner queues together. On top of all of that took an hour to get to Seminyak. Departure was a completely different story. 20 min drive from same Seminyak location at 6pm on a Monday. Waited 5 mins at priority check in (here I was provided an entry card to the temporary lounge) around the same to pay the departure tax (yes it's annoying but most if not all other imports have this it's just built into the taxes when you book your flights!) then maybe 15 mins at immigration? In there there's also 2 security check points that had less than a 3 min wait. Decent sized duty free but pricey from what I saw (alcohol in Australian airports is cheaper). The temp lounge was packed could probably fit 100 or so people seated. Food selection consisted of sandwiches vegetables soups fried rice salads and some fruit. Refreshments include sodas water beer and wine as well as hot drinks. Severe lack of power points which seems to be a growing trend these days. I walked past 3 food outlets to get to the lounge but can't comment on the quality or selection.

Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took about an hour from landing till getting out of the airport. VOA arrival took about 15 minutes and was easier than I remember. Now the immigration lines themselves were long and slow. With staff talking amongst themselves. That was the bottleneck. The advantage was my bag came out about 2 minutes after getting through immigration and through the x-rays 5 minutes later. Leaving was a different story (shocked at how quick it was). Arrived early took 10 minutes to check in the Departure tax line was 5 minutes and through the security checks and immigration 10 minutes after that. It's like 2 different airports. Inbound dirty and feels grimy. Departures was clean! Needs more seating though. Warning: Australia bound Flights go through a final security check at the gate (looking for liquids).

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-03-10,My review will be less inflammatory than others because I have the good fortune to only ever use Bali airport at off-peak times. So I'll acknowledge that it's a massive improvement over the old terminal. There's more space and it's much more comfortable and attractive. There were still hints that despite spending a lot of money on a new terminal they still didn't cater to the existing demand (immigration took 20 minutes and there was a relative lack of seating airside otherwise things moved quickly). There are definitely still problems - hopefully some are temporary - that people should be aware of. Most flights are using buses at the moment and the terminal entrance where they drop you has 2 big steps and no wheelchair ramp - I saw 3 staff struggling to get a disabled guy up them. We didn't get arrival cards on the plane and there is very little in the immigration hall to tell you that you need one or where to get one (there were piles on some - but not all - of the VOA counters) plus there was one single desk in the entire cavernous hall where you could fill them out. Signage is not finished (or it's intended to be terrible) and it can be hard to see how to get from arrivals to departures (with a new terminal they really should have catered for airside connections) or where the taxi booth is. There are rigorous security checks before AND after check-in - the first one seems like an afterthought since there isn't enough room to do it smoothly. There are no ATMs in departures so if you forgot the R150000 departure tax (I had miscounted and I ended up R500 short!) it's back down to arrivals and then through security again. And what is the stupid serpentine gauntlet of shops that you have to run to get to the gates? I wonder where this horrible trend started - I know Sydney's done it for decades (but mainly in arrivals). All up a massive improvement over the old terminal in off-peak times.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,M Henry,Australia,2013-07-09,Flew from Brisbane AU. It was still organized chaos. Arrived in Bali at 2.30pm which was one of their busiest times and were delayed in the air for an hour. Transferred to the terminal by bus. Buying the Visa on Arrival (US25 each) went fairly quickly but the wait to get through Immigration took much longer. Airport is quite humid and hot with no air-conditioning. There was a delay in getting our luggage took an hour and no signage so confusion as to which conveyer belt was ours. Immigration staff were ok and friendly to our son. Lots of touts trying to take your bags etc but just watch your bags and give a firm no. The pick up area was crazy but we found our pre-paid taxi fairly quickly. Leaving Bali there is a quite a long walk from drop off to the entrance and luggage touts are everywhere. We couldn't find any carts nearby so I gave in and paid a tout 30000 Rph ($3) to carry our bags (for 5 people) to the entrance. Had to wait a while to get past the first security checkpoint which was a pain and a bit stressful. Arrived a little early for check-in (9pm) and had to wait 15 minutes. We then paid our exit fee (150000 Rph / $15) and got through Immigration after about an hour. warm. Airside I had thought we could enter the best of 3 lounges (Premier Lounge) but was told by as we were not affiliated with their partner airlines. So we went to the cheaper one on the other side (Marigold Lounge) but it was only 150000 Rph ($15). Facilities were ok seats reasonably comfortable food choice was a bit limited (rice noodles sandwiches cakes and pastries and coffee free beer but what do you expect - its only $15). Lighting was a bit dark for me. Large flat screen TV to keep you entertained. Free WIFI. Toilets / showers are located at the back outside the lounge and were basic. We spent about 1-2 hours there. Staff were friendly. We had to go through a final security check just before the gates. Limited seating at the boarding gate so we stood around for about 30-40 mins before getting onto our flight.

Shortest TSA lines we have experienced ever and the agent was both polite and welcoming which is unusual in our past experience.

If departing there is a nice cafe on the first floor that few people know about. Alternatively sit away from the gates near to passport control- there are lots of seats there and its quiet. On arriving if you need transport walk away from the terminal and jump into an auto rickshaw/baby taxi or get a taxi from the roundabout just outside the airport.

dhaka-zia-airport,/airport-reviews/dhaka-zia-airport,Dhaka Airport customer review,Mark Bickerton,NA,2007-07-14,Check-in is usually a bit busy but everyone is polite and it works OK. Immigration queues are longer for Bangladeshis than foreigners as there are generally many more Bangladeshis. Once through there is a lovely Sheraton cafe on the first floor which everyone can access but its always very quiet and relaxing compared to the pretty tacky cafe on the ground floor. No real shops to speak of but to be honest thats a refreshing change these days. Arrivals - if you are at the back of the plane the queue at immigration will be long by the time you get there. If flying to Dhaka try to get a seat near the front of economy so you can get to the immigration before the crowds. Everyone is very friendly and the hall is spacious.

dhaka-zia-airport,/airport-reviews/dhaka-zia-airport,Dhaka Airport customer review,Riaz Osmani,NA,2005-03-06,Departure facilities are excellent. Ground staff of the airline you are flying will largely determine your experience. They are usually quite good in Dhaka. Arrival facilities are a mixed bag. Immigration signs are large and clear upon disembarking your aircraft. Passport Control slow but functioning. Nothing to worry about. Baggage handling a bit messy. Conveyor belts are on two sides of passport control. I went back and forth between the two since they kept changing their minds about where to dump our luggage. Eventually they settled on one belt. Note: Bags can arrive on a belt adjacent to the one they mentioned on the board. Also the new conveyor belts are a little narrow meaning your suitcases have a hard time staying on them. Look around a bit if you cannot find your bags. If you are arriving from Europe or North America you may be asked to jump the queue and exit the terminal ahead of those arriving from the Middle East who are subject to rigorous customs checking. Arriving in Dhaka would be a more pleasant experience if baggage handling was more disciplined.

The stress levels that you will experience travelling through DNR are comparable to no other airport I have experienced. The unfriendly staff go out of their way to make your journey unpleasant. Services and facilities at this airport are non-existent which is understandable due to the very low number of flights it is basically just a shed in a field with a runway.

No assistance or clear information regarding a fast lane at the immigration hall. Immigration officer was very rude and made us go to another counter at the other end of the immigration hall.

It's very over rated and as a seasoned traveler I was very disappointed with the lack of 24 hour service I have had in Asian airports. The lounge already feels very worn and tattered and they only served tea and coffee and soggy sandwiches. If they are trying to compete with Dubai they have no chance in winning. Even compared to old European lounges it didn't strike me as anything too exciting.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Alasdair Brooks,United Arab Emirates,2013-11-05,Perhaps I've been lucky with the immigration queues but I've found immigration in and out of Doha to be fairly quick and straightforward - though make sure you have a credit card to cover the visa fee; they don't take cash. But I wouldn't want to be a transit passenger here; there aren't enough seats the air side food options are dismal there's hardly anywhere to plug in electronic equipment and the shopping is surprisingly poor; if I was in transit for more than a couple of hours I'd seriously consider paying for Oryx Lounge access (and maybe that's the intention). That every flight I've taken to and from Doha seems to involve a long bus drive from the gate to and from the actual plane is also a minus - and often confusing to people who haven't used the airport before.

Small and cramped departure areas where people are herded one hour before the boarding and are forced to sit on the floor due to lack of seating? Dingy and smelly toilets. Long bus rides around the runway where often the driver is himself unsure at which aircraft he has to stop. Surly and brusque customer service?

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,James Laskowski,Thailand,2013-09-25,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have been in. Mainly due to the archaic use of busses that take over 20 minutes to get to and from the aircraft to the terminal. And then when checking in with the extremely polite staff everyone must hurdle into a 2nd waiting room to wait for the bus. The lack of services at the airport are very poor. 2 or 3 restrooms tops that have a line out the door for men are packed and in locations not convenient to all passenger waiting areas. Since the current airport is so small the food and shopping options are extremely limited and the shopping is limited to duty free items (and over-priced electronics).

The airport is clearly in transition as the opening of NDIA approaches. The terminal is still massively overcrowded even at 0300 but it's quite easy to find a seat as seats are everywhere. The new colour-coded transfer card system works well and clearing security only takes a few minutes even when several wide-body aircraft arrive at the same time. Staff are friendly and helpful with no hassle at security. Toilets rarely stay clean for long – the cleaners work very hard but they simply can't cope with the huge volume of pax. Shops are still cheap compared to other airports especially for bottled water. The biggest issue is probably the bus ride to/from the aircraft – this must surely now be the world's longest aircraft-to-terminal bus ride – the distances are huge!

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Andrew Maile,Indonesia,2012-09-06,Travelled through this airport twice last month and overall impression was that it is below average. The biggest problem is that there are no airbridges onto the plane so in order to board the aircraft you go down an escalator into a very cramped 'holding area' with hardly any seats before boarding a bus for the very long journey out to the plane. Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge.

The flight was an hour early and there transit terminal security check was deserted so there were no bad experiences and I was soon walking around the duty free shops. Cost of food in the food outlets seemed OTT but there is nothing new in that concept! Boarding for the onward connection was orderly although making everyone use the rear steps for boarding was a pain especially as the other steps wouldn't have disturbed the J class passengers (who in fact hadn't boarded anyway).

The transfer to the plane on the 1st leg was terrible (all shoved into a very small waiting room) and after about 20min doors were opened to allow us onto the buses - which we waited in with closed doors when we got to the plane. What is the point of a smoking room if everyone stands inside with the door open? Duty Free badly laid out on the one side - during peak times you cant move - a very strange mix of products.

Next door was a Costa Coffee and we enjoyed a nice coffee for a similar price to Europe so we had no argument there. Didn't use the food court area but it looked okay nothing fancy and not much choice but was serving it's purpose. All in all it was an okay small airport which was very clean and comfortable my only one annoyance was the gentleman on our boarding gate who stopped nearly every non-white person who passed to check their details. He was so rude and patronising to a British born Indian lady in front of us it was embarrassing for her. Thankfully she kept her cool and dignity which showed him up.

When I arrived the queue for the baggage screening was short so was straight in checkin was fast immigration was not so fast and final security check was okay as the immigration lines were throttling the amount of people trying to get through. Once inside you go straight into the duty free area of which there were plenty of cigarettes but everything else seemed to be lacking for example the only decent champagne was a '98 Dom Perignon everything else was Moet or less. To be honest they did have everything you could want i.e. electronics Mont Blanc Hugo Boss etc but the range they had of each was limited and expensive compared to UK High Street prices. There were a few shops on the upper level but the main shopping was a large single shop on the lower level. Food was also limited no restaurants just 2 food courts at separate ends of the terminal both were very busy until gone midnight then they were almost deserted. Opposite the far food court was a small childrens play area. One thing you could find plenty of was toilets and smoking rooms however some of these are 'hidden' so most people crammed into the smaller easily accessible rooms whereas the larger rooms were empty.

Generally it's not bad although we were locked into arrivals by mistake on one occasion. It's like a smaller version of Liverpool airport and suffers from the same atmosphere. Signs warning the approaching motorist of dire consequences should they not comply with a list of regulations serve as a welcome. Then one is charged to use the drop-off zone even though a few yards away you can park for free for 15 minutes. The 15-minute rule both here and in the drop-off zone adds a little extra inconvenience to the experience as it makes it difficult to be met by a partner with a car (they may be obliged to drive around the airport for a while if your plane is late).

dortmund-airport,/airport-reviews/dortmund-airport,Dortmund Airport customer review,Mark Evans,NA,2004-09-19,"DTM is now gaining a higher profile as easyJet's northern German hub. DTM can be compared directly with easyJet's UK counterpart - Luton (LTN). Both can be described as ""engineers' airports"". There is an absence of architectural flourishes and each is strictly functional. DTM in fact does a good job at present although pressure points may build up as traffic levels increase e.g. at the airside bar area. The Dortmund Flughaven website omits any mention of public transport connections to the city. There are two options. A dedicated express bus service to the Hauptbahnhof costs EUR5 one-way and takes some 20-25 minutes. It is generally an hourly service although there is a two-hour gap between 15.30 and 17.30 on the return Hauptbahnhof-Flughaven timetable. An alternative way is to take the free shuttle bus to the nearby Holzwickede DB station from where there is a circuitous twice-hourly service to Hauptbahnof. The one-way fare is EUR 1.80.

Flew in to Terminal 1 where all the other airlines land at. Now this is a review for Terminal 1. This greatly varies to Terminal 3, where all the Emirates flight flies into (which is the posher terminal). Absolutely amazed at how bad the condition of the terminal is, considering this is a main hub for tourists and that this is Dubai. My flight from Muscat to Dubai was only 45-50 minutes long however the queue at the immigration? 1 hour 10 minutes - longer than my flight. The immigration was jam packed. Regardless the day or the time! I flew in on a Thursday afternoon (4pm): Packed. I flew in on a Monday morning (11am): Packed. I flew back in on Wednesday (12am): Packed. Oh and not to mention, it was boiling! I don't know if the staff noticed just how packed it was, but they certainly did not notice just how the amount of people equals to more body heat. Considering that is is Dubai, they can honestly do better. Because of all these queuing, I have decided to only fly to Abu Dhabi whenever I need to get to UAE again (unless I'm flying via Emirates).",Arrival and Departure,14-06-2015,Solo Leisure,1,1,3,2,NA,3,2,0,NA,0

You seem to have to walk a very long way between gates particularly if you are moving from A gates to the far end of the B gates. If your incoming flight parks on a remote stand - as mine did - your transit time can be very long. On the plus side the Emirates lounges are good - if you get the time to enjoy them. No doubt the duty free shopping is also good - if you get the time to do any. I was disappointed by Emirates and the DXB experience just increased my disappointment.

That would have left still one hour for my transit to Bangkok but I hadn't counted on being parked 25 minutes by bus away from the terminal building. Imagine 500 people to be bussed to the terminal. Even though I was in the second bus out by the time I passed security and could start looking for my connecting flight the gate was closed. Queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed transit desk followed. So I spend the next nearly 7 hours in the airport lounges - my 'new' flight departed one hour late too due to - as was announced by the Captain - the backlog of flights resulting from that night's problems.

DXB is a fairly good airport without being in the same league as Incheon or Changi it compares favourably with many regional competitors particularly Doha. Terminal 3 - the dedicated Emirates terminal - is the best of the three. It's modern bright and airy. Shopping facilities are generally good I've always found immigration to be relatively quick and customs is straightforward. Terminal 1 immigration queues look much longer; I was lucky enough to be travelling business class on the way in to Terminal 1 otherwise I might have been stuck in immigration for well over an hour. Terminal 1 is also clearly just a little bit more run down around the edges than Terminal 3. Metro access to Terminals 1 and 3 is straightforward and often a good alternative to taxis. Terminal 2 - where budget airlines are based - is infamously on the other side of the airport and isn't accessible by Metro (and personal experience demonstrates that taxi drivers are very reluctant to take you the short distance from Stadium the closest Metro stop) though it is walkable when it isn't too hot. But once you arrive at Terminal 2 it isn't actually that bad an experience.

The service at the food hall was incredibly Huge inconsistency in services. Aer Lingus check in terminals in particular. 1 machine could not read a passport next could. Bag drop off consists of huge queues at peak times. Half the desks are empty and they prefer to have staff herding passengers around instead of checking them in. No other airport in the world finds it a normal process to have people working full time to pull people from the main queue for the closing flight queue as they know they will miss the flights. In T1 I used to just wait at the closing flight queue instead of waiting for nothing at the normal check in. Then generally if you are on a short haul you may have to walk to gates in T1 anyway. Once had our aircraft brought back to the ramp as they had departed minus 10 passengers due to delays in T2. Security has improved in timings in T2 and found that more organised now but watch out for Aer Lingus sharks monitoring the queue for oversized cabin baggage to send you downstairs again. Airside services are nice and if departing T2 terminal its a pleasant experience just painful to get there. Of course pre clearance for US flights is a great plus. For arrivals prepare to walk and if you arrive in business hours car hire consists of a mini bus to main yards 15 min away. So factor this in unless you go gold with the hire company.

Airside there is absolutely no space - the airport was designed before security measures and you simply have to wait until 5 minutes before the flight before you go through. Duty free closed (with only 2 flights of westerners a week you would think it was worth their while to open it) and nothing at all airside aside from a few plastic chairs.

First time I've taken an outbound flight from D'dorf although I've arrived here in the past. Fortunately we arrived with over two hours to spare because it took forever to get through security. No good reason other than the staff were very slow and prioritised chatting with each other to processing passengers. We were there the day after they'd been on strike (pay dispute) and it certainly looked like they were still on go- slow. Apart from that you're forced to walk through shops to get to the gates but that's the case at many airports these days. It felt crowded with inadequate seating but we were there at peak time (Friday evening). What was worrying was that our plane was delayed because passengers (who had arrived at the airport in good time) were stuck in the security queue - there was no system for pulling people out and prioritising them if their flight was due to leave.

The arrival process on a domestic flight is as simple as can be and you are out within 10 mins of arriving. However they require more taxis as we had to wait 30 mins for a Taxi when we arrived. Departing, we didn't have bags so went straight through but the airport security was really quick for the morning rush. Shops are great there and you can also have a good view of the aircraft and the runway. Boarding began 50 mins before for the flight to Stansted and started to board within 10 mins. This meant we were airborne early and could arrive 40 mins early into London.

She then proceeded to search me for a whole 10 minutes after that she used the mobile machine on me and said I was fine to go. Why couldn't this over enthusiastic girl have used that first. I felt that the level of that search was unnecessary and very intrusive in front of other people. Anyway after that experience I couldn't find where my tray with my handbag cash iPad other gold jewellery phone etc was as the end of the conveyor belts are out of sight. My husband picked it up for me and no-one questioned him. So basically anyone could take your belongings.

edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,H Williams,Singapore,2015-04-24,"The ""old"" security system (ie: he one they had before this one) also had long queues but at least that seemed to be just due to passenger numbers. As others have pointed out the new system does not allow for any passengers who need more than one tray (ie: most as one wheelie/rucksack goes in one tray and laptop/ipad/phone/jacket etc in the other) - as the ridiculous numbered allocation of spaces on the belt before the x-ray means that there is virtually no way to keep multiple trays together. I can't even begin to imagine how a family of four would cope (and presumably won't come summer time). The automatic tray extractor after x-rays is similar to the ones at Heathrow but in this case just adds to the confusion. Worse is at the end you are supposed to take your (one) tray to an array of metal shelves to re-pack/re-dress - but once again this doesn't in any way allow for passengers with multiple trays - it is virtually impossible for one person to carry two trays across the gap to the re-pack area. Amazingly this system manages to make T5 and T2 at Heathrow look a model of security efficiency. When I went through EDI a few weeks back there were a lot of management-type people observing the chaos hope the brilliant PE minds can work a solution to this. Funny thing for them is that now no-one has time to shop or eat/drink as they get out of security just in time to make their flights so I guess the retail guys will be asking for lower rents come review time.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

After this we went upstairs to security which is a joke. Only two lanes open with hundreds of people waiting in line. Staff are off hand and rude. New security halls are coming into service which is great but why is there a need to provide such bad service at the old ones? Security needs to be done properly however surely more lanes can be kept open to get the passengers through. We arrived at the airport more than two hours before the flight and only just got on the plane with no breakfast and having spent not a penny in the fancy shops because there was no time left. Returning was no better. The plane disembarked onto the concrete and we were left standing outside the building in the rain for 15 minutes because immigration didn't seem to have its act together and we therefore were not allowed inside the building.

What was shocking was the immigration control where they had 3 staff for all passengers with non EU passports and 2 of them were looking down and chatting and doing their own thing. The woman officer processed over 10 people and they just sat there chatting and laughing. Very disappointed considering all that is said about German efficiency. Food options limited once you pass immigration and security. Duty free is okay.,Transit,21-07-2015,Couple Leisure,6,2,3,3,NA,2,3,1,NA,0
frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,John Hill,United States,2015-06-17,"Flight from Manchester to DFW on Lufthansa via Frankfurt. What a mess the Frankfurt airport system is. Landed on time after a great flight with 40 minutes to when our other flight to DFW was to take off, should be easy we thought! The jet bridges not used, so we had to climb down to the tarmac via stairs, then wait for buses to take us to terminal A. Bus took a while to get there, then we were ordered off with no explanation as to where we needed to go - we found someone who told us to follow signs to terminal Z. Followed signs which lead us to a train station, we boarded this and got off as indicated, then walked for 5 minutes only to find we needed to go back through security and passport control, all lines were long. By the time we got into the long line for security, our plane was already boarding, and there were a good 100 people ahead of us. After 10 minutes we managed to get someones attention and we were ushered towards security. What an attitude these security people have, have never been treated so badly in all flights I have taken. The passport control was not much better either. Next is the Duty Free maze, what a joke fighting your way through this lot trying to get out of there. We followed the signs to Terminal Z, our gate was 69(the last one) with over half a mile of walking to get to it. At the gate down at least eight flights of stairs to the bottom, only to find we are back out on the tarmac. The plane was parked at the cargo terminal on the other side of the airport. We did make the plane, and we were not the last ones on it, but never again will Frankfurt see us as visitors.",Arrival and Departure,17-06-2015,Couple Leisure,1,1,2,1,NA,0,0,0,NA,0

I had no problems at all with immigration and I avoided the shuttle. However All the bussing and waiting for the bus to leave and stair climbing was pretty horrible and the signage definitely not very helpful (but then again I find that this is a problem beyond the airport as well). My real vexation however was with the slow security that required the removal of just about every thing electrical or battery-related. I travel all the time and never had to take out my computer and phone chargers et al. Only two lanes were open because a third lane suddenly closed down. Both open lanes had few people in the queue initially but no one was moving. Worst of all having gone through the scanner with some guy barking out something in German this seriously efficient woman gave me a strict pat down like I had never experienced (believe me I travel a lot and usually get tsa pre-check in the U.S. I also have never had a problem with a little wand-ing but this was absurd).

And my experience has been confined to Terminal 1. On a recent trip it took two hours to go from Gate C13 to Gate A40. There was just one official checking passports at the immigration gate for entering the Schengen zone so loads of passengers were pushing in with varying degrees of politeness because of their earlier flights. On the other hand transferring from Gate A34 to B23 was very smooth with the moving walkway in the connecting tunnel being fully functional and hardly anyone at the passport control. However after passing through passport control so quickly I had to waste time checking the departure gate for my flight. The departure gate for my flight to Osaka was posted on the monitors at Gate A34 but not on the monitors just outside the passport control. So I was wondering if there had been a gate change. Finally boarding the flight by row numbers proved chaotic though this might have been due to Lufthansa. Transferring via Frankfurt is like being an out-patient in a very poor ill- equipped hospital.

Signage is atrocious - one sign actually had marker scrawled on it by staff to clarify just which gates were in which direction.

Doesn't seem to suffer overcrowding and everything works. Is unusual in that 4 car hire companies have windows in the baggage reclaim hall which saves a lot of time if in a hurry to get away. Although small it has a pharmacy and medical care facility in the departures concourse very accessible if required. On busy days it does suffer with a lack of taxis & there are always long delays. The bus services need to be expanded too but with fuerteventura suffering a decline in visitors (dont know why) improvements may not be forthcoming.

Efficient and friendly airport staff even the immigration officers were welcoming. It was supposed to be a domestic airport so the international terminal was nearly empty when we arrived. Spotlessly clean no matter the departure or arrival hall toilets luggage claim. Floor guide was very clear. As impressive when we departed from the airport. Before departure visited their domestic terminal. Amazed with their friendly and helpless ground staff and the facilities despite the small size of the airport. Three domestic terminals with good Japanese and western restaurants. Observation deck was amazing that I could actually see planes takeoff and land very closely unlike Hong Kong International Airport where they charged.

There's not a huge variety of shops but just enough of them for an airport the size of Madeira. Mondays and Thursdays are the busiest days. There are no air bridges so you most of the time will walk to your plane or to the terminal occasionally by bus if it's a busy day or it's raining. Security staff are friendly and most staff at the airport too. There is some possibility that due to high winds which are quite frequent in Madeira you'll have to go in circles around the island until the pilot is able to land. I frequently use the airport and it only happened last time I used the airport which was last week - July Summer - and it's more frequent during winter months though I flew a lot of times during winter and it never happened before. Rough landings are quite frequent too. On a final note the airport is cleaned to very high standards everywhere you go it seems neat.

gdansk-airport,/airport-reviews/gdansk-airport,Gdansk Airport customer review,Robert Szocik,NA,2009-09-20,Domestic flight to WAW evening departure with LOT. Check-in fast and efficient but when multiple departures are called together the check-in area simply cannot cope with the queues as the ground floor level just doesn't have enough floor space to deal with hundreds of passengers and cases. Most of the airport's facilities are on the first floor. Main criticism is the lack of seating before security which probably explains why everyone seems to crowd around the windows to watch take-offs & landings! Security is quick efficient and stress- free. There are several cafes/bars/shops before and after security; nothing spectacular but adequate for the average passenger's needs (prices weren't hugely elevated either which makes a nice change). Avoid the taxis and buy a bus ticket for 2.50 PLN which gets you to or from the city centre in 30 minutes (bus 210 which runs 1/2 hourly and stops near the main bus/rail station).

Can be confusing so you need to listen to announcements. Airside in international departures there are 3 shops one selling cigarettes another selling alcohol and the other selling perfume and there is also a bar. Smoking is banned in the terminal so be warned. There are no airbridges and as the airport is so small no need for coaches.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,S Smith,United Kingdom,2015-04-19,Have used this airport 8 times in the last three years and it is usually an agreeable experience. Queuing for security and immigration is fast and straight forward queuing for gates however is difficult due to a lack of space.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,J Long,Hong Kong,2015-01-19,This has to be the worst airport experience I've had. Check in queues are ludicrous - the airport simply cannot cope at busy times and you genuinely need to arrive about 3 hours before your flight. If not you'll queue for about 90 minutes then get pulled out into a fast track queue for those flights that are leaving in 60 minutes or less. Then this will take another 20 minutes which will leave you with no time to get through the horrendous security queues. At least the security people were smiling and trying to lighten the mood when we were there. Once in departures there is a depressing lack of any shops or decent food outlets and if you end up at one of the island gate areas there are not enough seats and barely any amenities. Luckily by this point you will probably not have any time to notice this as you will be running to catch your flight. I better not mention that Geneva also has a unique baggage priority handling system which is a polite way of saying they allow people to check in more than they're allowed and then don't load all the bags on the flight. It then takes 3 days to clear the back log! The arrivals part of the airport is no better with our bags taking over 90 minutes to arrive and the place seemed totally chaotic. Up escalators were not working in some parts so you had to lug heavy bags around and the whole place was drab and dreary. It reminded me of Luton train station in the 1980's which was not it's finest time. I live in Asia and the airports here put this and most in Europe to shame. We will never fly or connect in Geneva again and I really don't recommend anyone else does either. Dreadful.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,P Bischoff,Switzerland,2013-10-30,Geneva is a small but very practical airport.

Rare have been the occasions where I went through a queue and service throughout the airport is always friendly. Being Swiss but living abroad I have been using it for the past 20+ years and though various periods of extensions and refurbishment's and I can only say that I love this little airport.

On the positive side: airport has its own railway station with regular connections to downtown Geneva (10 mins travel time) as well as major Swiss cities. Airport terminal and lavatories very clean. Many annoying issues however: Air France flights depart from the French Sector which is hard to find - you have to look for a small sign displaying ""Destination France"". French Sector is basically a limited area at the very end of the building. Self-service check-in hassle-free but very long queues at security - no Fast Track for status passengers; only one lane open while other screeners just kept chatting with each other.

If you don’t know the airport of Geneva is in two countries : Switzerland and France. All the flights going to France (AirFrance) arrives in the French section. Let me tell you something if you will depart from here there is nothing! When you pass the security check there is only a very but very expensive shop with some magazines and chocolates and another of beverages breads etc… So this was my first time at the International section first of all is much bigger but that also means it takes you more to get pass through the security point. After that is like many other airports. Many stores duty free etc and is also nice. But if you are taking a flight out of Europe like to New York with Swiss or in my case Newark with Continental you need to pass a immigration point. After that you arrive to a small area with two stores and free internet. Then you can board your plane. So I can say knowing this airport pretty good that is a clean “modern”  and with many facilities.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,Harry Albright,NA,2006-12-10,"To help people avoid the problems that Jenny Eckersley encountered here are a few tips. First of all the signs are for Ferney (note the second ""e"") because that is the French town next to the airport. The only reason for using the French sector even if you are travelling on into France is to pick up a French rental car. In this case follow the ""Secteur Francais"" signs before passport control (do not go through Swiss passport control) and you will arrive at the French car rental desks. (You will need to ask a baggage handler to go and fetch any checked luggage from the Swiss side.) This does not apply if you are arriving from France as you will be in the French sector to begin with. Or if you aren't renting a French car exit through Switzerland where you will have the full range of transport options including trains to the main station and on to France. If you have rented a French car on leaving the airport follow the signs back to Geneva (it's hardly the airport's fault that the French authorities don't sign their roads very well) and cross back into Switzerland. You will go under the airport runway and link up with the Swiss autoroute that passes in front of the airport. Take this in the direction of Geneva (not Lausanne) and continue on the autotroute until you reach the Bardonnex customs post. From there you will link directly on to the A40. On the way back come off the A40 at Bardonnex and follow the autoroute to the airport. Follow the signs for ""secteur francais"" to return your car then go to the Swiss side to check in for flights to countries other than France. If in doubt ask the people at the rental desk for directions to your destination. As for walking miles to the B gates there are travellators. You actually have to walk very little at all. Walks to the gates at Heathrow or Gatwick are much more arduous. Geneva is actually one of the most compact best managed airports I have used. It is true that if you want to shop or eat stay landside as long as possible. Airside most of the facilities are in the main terminal so avoid going to the gates until as late as possible. They really are just pre- boarding holding areas (as they are in most airports).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

goa-airport,/airport-reviews/goa-airport,Goa Airport customer review,A Walker,NA,2010-08-19,It would seem things have improved here. There are armed security people at the entrance to the airport and prior to the car parking areas and only passengers can enter the departures area after providing their boarding pass. Visitors can enter with a visitor pass but have to remain in a small waiting area near the glass front of the airport. The staff are friendly and the security only took a couple of minutes. After security it was pretty much the boarding gate as others have said it's a small airport. Be warned there are no walkways to the planes and all connections are made by bus across the airfield. One concern I had was from the customs where there was a large sign advising passengers not to pay bribes if requested and to report any incidences by calling a number. Not the sort of thing I'm used to seeing but at least the authorities are starting to wake up and tackle corruption in India as it is about time someone did so. Anyway staff here were polite and seemed efficient enough.

gold-coast-airport,/airport-reviews/gold-coast-airport,Gold Coast Airport customer review,J Maley,Australia,2012-12-28,"Recently used this airport having not been here in about 5 years. They have done a major upgrade since then. I arrived on a Thursday evening and was off the plane and in my hire car in a matter of a few minutes - all good and smooth. The terminal is small so it was easy with the rental cars right outside the front door. However the return journey the next day was the exact opposite. I checked in and went to the Security Screening area. I was flying Business Class and was delighted to note there was a separate lane for Business/Platinum passengers especially as the queues were enormous. However despite the red carpet and gold railings for the priority queue this system was not being manned and this entry point was one of the two that had the enormous queue. I tried to get towards the front to see if the staff would push me through but they were far away and ignored you. I saw several other people try to find the entrance to the ""fast track"" security clearance but it did not work for them either. Normally this would be nothing more than an irritant but on this occasion it was a lot more than that. The queues were enormous and after spending 20 minutes in the queue my flight was starting to board and I had to ask to be let to the front of the queue which the people in front were agreeable to. I estimate it would have taken about another 10 minutes to clear Security otherwise i.e. a total of 30 minutes.

The latter are long overdue & far superior being lighter more spacious and with a much better range of food and drink outlets. On the negative side watching many newly arrived passengers wandering aimlessly through the building looking for the baggage arrival area suggests that signage needs to be improved. Having been caught twice in heavy rain while crossing between the aircraft and terminal buildings I can't understand why the renovations apparently do not appear to include any plans to install aerobridges to protect the presumably significant number of passengers from the vagaries of the Gold Coast weather.

They have the best answer yet seen to long security queues: they immediately open another scanner: when the queues build up again yet another - sometyhing some of the bigger airports would do well to emulate. A good restaurant is available although once passing through security snacks and drinks are all that is available. They also prove that Priority Boarding can work with buses being used with Priority Boarding passengers be directed to one bus which goes to the aircraft first. Only when those people have boarded do any other buses leave for the plane.

Check-in (especially international check-ins) and security can sometimes have long queues.

Luckily my previous flight wasn't delayed and I was flying 1st class so I can cut the lines I didn't miss the flight. Their 50 mins minimum transfer time is really tight.

My boyfriend and I were excited because when we were about to leave the aircraft we noticed that the gate was very close to us and that we wouldn't be rushing for our connecting flight. Apparently that was not possible as we were required to go back to the main terminal, go through the security checks and then walk back to the B gate area (despite the fact we already have our boarding pass). Other than that, airport is clean and had plenty to do.",Transit,14-06-2015,Couple Leisure,8,4,4,4,NA,4,4,0,NA,1

Arrival was straightforward with bags on the belt in reasonable time. The direct S-Bahn connection to the city centre is frequent and the fare a very modest EUR2.95. Departure was also fine apart from a few minor niggles spoiling the experience. The up escalator to Terminal 1 departures was out of action leaving a choice between carrying heavy cases upstairs or cramming into a lift. Didn't it occur to anybody to reverse the direction of the down escalator which was still working? Secondly the security staff put my passport and boarding pass into the tray to go through screening (why?) but in such a position that they fell out as the tray left the machine. Luckily I noticed this and they were retrieved with no harm done but such carelessness with essential documents isn't good enough. More seriously both male and female toilets at Gate C06 were out of action (and seemed to have been for some time) with only a tiny notice in German to warn you. Since you have to go through Passport Control to reach the gate there is no access to alternative toilets unless you can persuade the Passport staff to let you back out. Fortunately my flight was well up to time but I hate to think what would happen if there was a significant delay.

A nice touch: when two or more flights use the same belt a message on the screen tells those waiting which flight's luggage is on the belt.

Check-in procedures quickly done though why the Chinese Authorities insist in customs declaration upon departure is a mystery to me.

Worst of all is upon return it takes far too long to get your baggage. On a recent calm winter night we'd all deplaned a Delta flight and it took about 20 minutes before any luggage began to appear at the carousels.

heraklion-airport,/airport-reviews/heraklion-airport,Heraklion Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2007-10-29,"We must have passed through Heraklion airport at much the same time as your previous correspondent but our experience was much easier - perhaps things were quieter because of our late evening flights. We last used Heraklion 6 years ago and remembered little apart from the crowding - until we read the reference about the entertainment value of the bottom step from the duty free as we'd been entertained too! Obviously Heraklion has been redeveloped since then because there's much more space and no longer an irregular bottom step from the duty free. On arrival we too did have a long wait for our bags and I would agree that it was not easy to find which carousel was to be used. While I waited for the suitcase my wife went through to process our car rental pick-up and had it all sorted long before our bag came through. Leaving from Heraklion was far easier than departures we've had from other Greek airports. BA check-in opened early so that only took us about 10 minutes there was no queue at all for the separate baggage drop and there was plenty of seating in the pre-security departure area. We didn't even have to queue to go through security either time (more of that later!) though we're not sure how searching security actually was as the visible screen didn't seem to recive much attention. Lots of space in the departure lounge and much cleaning going on. We didn't try to buy anything as we tend to avoid airport food anyway so I can't comment on price or quality. The only problem that arose was when our flight was called - we were in the wrong depature lounge! We had to go back through security right through the check-in area through more security to find Gate 1 at the other end of the terminal building. We don't think we missed any signs or information but most other passengers for the flight seemed to be in the right place so we assume that it is something to do with ""Schengen"" which is a mystery to us who are more used to shorter journeys with low-cost airlines. By the time we reached the gate the buses to the plane were being loaded but we weren't the last by any means so perhaps we weren't the only ones in the wrong place. Otherwise the ""new"" Heraklion came as quite a pleasant surprise.... though we did miss the entertainment of that bottom step! Score: 4",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

This IBEX flight leaves quite early and I usually travel by taxi from Hiroshima. Check-in and security checks are always very smooth but an annoying problem with the IBEX flight to Narita is that the plane is too small to use the normal gates. So we use Gate A walk down the stairs and across the apron to board the plane. Umbrellas are supplied on rainy days. I would use Hiroshima Airport more frequently when travelling to central Tokyo but I think that the plane still cannot beat the Shinkansen for this distance (just over 900 kilometers). It is a pain to have to travel out to the airport 45 kilometers from Hiroshima undergo the check-in and security check board the flight and then have to travel from Haneda to central Tokyo.

hobart-airport,/airport-reviews/hobart-airport,Hobart Airport customer review,Alasdair Brooks,NA,2005-05-12,I travel to Hobart 2-3 times a year from Melbourne. Hobart may be the capital of Tasmania but the airport's size and facilities reflect the fact that A) Hobart is fairly small and B) is not an airport you use to transit to somewhere else - there's nowhere else to go! Qantas has an actual luggage carousel but with Virgin Blue arrivals your luggage comes into the terminal on the back of a flatbed trailer with a consequent mad scramble as everyone goes for their luggage at the same time. I do wish there were better food and shop services; the dreary cafe and drearier bar are inadequate and the tiny shop is worse. There are no airside facilities - not even a toilet - but then it is a tiny airport and not one you're ever likely to linger in waiting for your flight. Though if you're arriving and are trapped there for three hours waiting for your lift to turn up (as I once was) you're really really stuck for entertainment. Last time I was there (Dec 2004) the old international terminal had been transformed into the new JetStar terminal but I have no idea what the facilities are like there. I occasionally here mutters about reviving the Hobart - Christchurch link and the occasional Singapore Airlines charter flight touches down (according to my local colleagues) but I can't imagine the international facilities were ever particularly extensive. In the end this is a single runway with a couple of glorified sheds acting as the terminal at the southernmost commercial airport in Australia. It's entirely adequate for what it does and realistically doesn't really need to be any fancier.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The only place you can actually sit down is in the gate area or (if you're lucky) in the food court upstairs. Food selection really not as extensive as Changi and not as much to do either.

Great options for shops and food though be prepared to walk long distances (when connecting between two 11 hour flights I'm happy to walk a lot). Great variety of duty-free shopping though some prices are much higher than regular retail (caveat emptor). The wifi is too stingy however: should be up to 3 hours even if add-supported for free. Arrive: queuing for immigration but things move quickly. Bags come in a reasonable amount of time Again long distances to walk especially for the taxi queue once you're done inside. Depart: HKG is a double epic fail in this regard. Massive badly managed queues for departure immigration. Followed by an equally badly managed security queue.

Immigration was a bit slow few counters open and took about 15 minutes to clear a huge number of passengers rushing to catch their flight. Thankfully I got to my gate on time with minutes to spare thanks to the automated train (as Cathay had not even issued a boarding call despite flight being scheduled for take-off in under 30 minutes) and managed to do a bit of shopping.

I'm not sure I agree as I found the airport to be as efficient as on previous occasions – quick immigration clearance despite long queues and on the MTR into town about 30 mins after landing. However the airport seems to be heading the way of British airports and is becoming a shopping centre first and an airport second. The upper level airside used to have lots of comfy seats but these have now been removed to make way for even more ""shopping opportunities” and restaurants – yet there is still plenty of unused space which could be used for seats! It seems that the only way to get a seat without buying something is to head straight for the gates where there is lots of seating (and better views of the runways). My other complaint is that there is still hardly anywhere to buy bottled drinks etc. airside – there are several branches of Relay towards the gates but they have a poor range of products compared to their European stores. Is it really too much to ask to have a few branches of 7-11 or OK at HKG?

Arrived on a Saturday afternoon flight with a transit to another Asian city. When I booked my ticket on Cathay Pacific they offer a connecting flight with 50 minute lay over. Normally this should be sufficient for an efficient airport but to be on the safe side I opted for another flight that gave me 2 hour lay over in Hong Kong. Once I left the airplane I went to the transit area immediately and was surprised to find a long queue. The security area was not under staffed but they just didn't work effectively. Despite the long queue there was only one line opened (with 8 members of the staff). It took me at least 40-50 minutes just to go through security and had to run all the way to the other end of the airport to catch another flight. This is very similar to the arrival experience where there is always a long queue. On my return journey I travelled from Kowloon to the airport.

On the few occasions where I could not locate a bag or needed to be moved to another flight because there was a delay or cancellation with my flight the airport staff were accommodating and helpful. Food and shopping options are numerous. In summary one of the least stressful airports that I have flown through.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Traveling from here to the other islands has sometimes been unpredictable but I have had no real complaints. But now (2015) the usual difficulties of traveling out of Honolulu have been compounded by construction. Problems include crammed lines at agriculture security, no one to deal with priority customers (in my case American Airlines), a long walk and terrible mash up of a line up at the non TSA checkpoint (curiously my line this time around - June - was almost all females with children), one line for everyone, no faster lane as in almost all medium sized or large airports. I am sorry for older folks or folks with disabilities who might have to contend with this.

Absolutely no line for them with an international queue ridiculously long and only a few people assisting.

It turns into a completely wasted day. Management seems to not care about passenger flow. They torture you with long lines with 4 or 5 stations out of 80 (yes 80) open. The appearance of security is there so while they delay you anyone can walk off with your luggage because there is nothing to monitor it at the back end. No nexus pass to speed things up. No priority for connections or smooth connection process. Do not buy duty free perfume or liquor etc. You are a transit passenger but it will be confiscated or taxed because you pass through customs. In short I will limit myself to direct flights out of Canada now. Passing via United States is not an option.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,/airport-reviews/houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport customer review,J Johnson,United States,2014-02-18,We had 2 elderly passengers requiring wheelchairs to meet us at Houston (from Cancun heading to OKC) which arrangements had been made when we booked. When we got to Houston they picked up my Mom and Aunt on a cart but it was full of other passengers so I couldn't ride with them. Since we had to go through customs we knew they would be taken care of in their wheelchairs. Turns out the cart guy dropped them off somewhere with no wheelchairs available and no one to assist. The guy also told them they would miss their connecting flight. So my 81 year old Mom and Aunt were wandering around the customs area and having to walk with their carryon luggage with no assistance. Since we had already passed customs and the ensuing security check (again) we couldn't go back to get them. Evidently no one can go back to customs to assist even airport personnel. We finally went back to the security area and just waited for them. Eventually they made their way through. We did indeed miss our connecting flight to OKC and ended up getting a hotel in Houston. If someone had indeed met them with wheelchairs at the gate in Houston (as they were supposed to) we would have made our flights and breezed through the airport process. There were 6 of us flying together on that flight we all missed it because we weren't going to leave them behind.

Food choices may be limited and free wifi options are just on the free 45 minutes provided by Boingo but the airport served its purpose. Baggage was out pretty quickly (the fact that we were on a 45 seater CRJ 900 made the wait less painful as we had to wait for only a few bags out the carousel).

What was particularly impressive to me was that IAH seemed to have a roughly equal number of desks open for non-citizens as for citizens; in my experience this is extremely rare in the USA. Since most of the arriving passengers seemed to be US citizens - leading to what seemed to be an extraordinary queue all the way out of the immigration hall for the latter - this led to the even rarer phenomenon of non-citizens often having a shorter wait than the citizens even though the former were being processed faster. For all that I still had to wait about 70 minutes before clearing immigration but a similar length queue at Washington Dulles for example would have required two to three times as long to clear. Otherwise facilities at IAD seem to be a notch above average for major US hubs with clear signage 45 minutes free wifi many plugs for laptops and the best duty free shop I've ever encountered at a US airport.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

A nice landscaped and well signed access road takes you to the terminal with ample parking. The only drawback there are just 2 (1 each for domestic and international) entrance points and 2 exit points at dep and arrival levels for passengers and these get very crowded.

Very impressed to find a laptop and mobile charging kiosk in the checkin hall itself .The dep area has an array of different food joints duty free shops (overpriced) children play area small smoking room and also a prayer hall.

innsbruck-airport,/airport-reviews/innsbruck-airport,Innsbruck Airport customer review,Guy Senior,NA,2008-03-20,Flew in and out recently. Perhaps crucially on a Friday and a Monday when the congestion mentioned was not a problem. Out of the terminal on arrival within 30 minutes despite an absurd 100 yard bus transfer from plane to terminal and a 10 minute wait at passport control. Coming back I advise not going through passport control until late - there are very few facilities. However the real problem was that my flight could not land due to high winds and we were put on a coach to Munich meaning a 7 hour delay.

There is a rather strange glass corridor which one enters when leaving the terminal to board.

The baggage is often available as soon as you arrive after a short walk from the plane. Quite often I've been outside the airport within ten minutes of the flight touching down. On departures the security queue and process can be a little tedious if there are a few flights departing at about the same time and there's only the minimum of facilities in the departure lounge (although there is free wi-fi). The car park is a bit more expensive than it should be; if you're away for a weekend it seems very pricey (currently the first day costs £11.50 but £3.50 thereafter).

The day of our flight a general black-out happened in Turkey meaning the trams and the trains weren't working for a certain amount of time. Allow at least two hours to arrive to the airport and one more to go through the customs and security control. Turkish Airlines check-in staff are not English speaking. Enough food options although overpriced and with a service leaving a lot to be desired. No A/C sockets in the entire terminal but there are machines where you can insert coins in order to charge your mobile - derisory if to remain polite.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Robert Marshall,United Kingdom,2013-08-27,This is now a very busy hub airport for Turkish Airlines. A fair wait for aircraft to reach available airbridge or remote stand after touchdown. We used both the international and domestic terminals. Airbridges available for inbound flight from London and onward domestic flight to Bodrum. Remote stand and bus transfer to domestic terminal coming back. Airbridge available for flight back to London. Layover in either terminal was no longer than 1.5 hours. Fairly lengthy queues for non-Turkish passport holders at immigration. Certainly nothing of the order that non-EU passport holders would face on arrival in the UK. Immigration officers were efficient and good humoured. We had pre-purchased Turkish e-VISAs via the Turkish Government's web site and would definitely recommend that especially if arriving at particularly busy times or face an additional queue of 20+ minutes to obtain your Turkish visa then queue up for immigration control. As others have stated signage in the terminals in English is not good and could definitely be improved upon. Security screening staff were fine. Did not find them any better or worse than those at UK airports. Again as others have said plenty of places to eat and drink as long as you are prepared to pay the prices for food and drink (post security screening) which were as we anticipated expensive but comparable to other airports we've used. Toilets both gents and ladies were clean. There was plenty of seating available in both terminals at the times we used them.

The experience was far better than previous reviews led me to expect. The international arrival was calm and orderly - it was mid-evening so perhaps a quiet time. The domestic departure - early afternoon - ditto. The need to undergo two security checks - one for the building one for airside is a bit tedious but worked OK. The domestic - international transfer was more pressured - you get taken landside after domestic arrival (why?) and then mixed in with local departing international passengers but passport / security etc worked smoothly enough with structured queues etc. Facilities airside immediately downstream of security were crowded but once you made your way to gate all fairly spacious and calm.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The airport is pretty small and incredibly overcrowded long queues and bottlenecks in every area are the norm. On departure: lengthy security checks the agent at check-in didn't know a word of English - a superior had to step-in. Seating is scarce around the terminal. The food court area is like a bazaar hard to make your way through. The smoking terrace - overcrowded as well is a nice addition and well taken care of so I would put that as a plus. Walking times to gates very long gates number changing at last minute. As the previous commentator objected you must have a Turkish SIM card in order to access the wireless internet - in an airport that tries to position itself as a global transit hub - mind boggling to say the least.

One reason they are slow at this point is that the available cubicles are never fully manned. Onto luggage claim - at the opposite end of the airport to the aircraft. You need a 1 Lira coin for a trolley. If you do not know this or do not have one you are stuck. I learnt the hard way during a previous trip.

I dashed off to use the (clean and modern) toilet facilities at baggage retrieval and my wife already had our suitcase by the time I made it back. Leaving was equally simple with the slight quirk that security is before check-in so you go straight from check-in to passport control without having to go through security again (though there is a second security area once you reach your specific gate). Airside is neatly and sensibly laid out with plenty of shopping without the sense of being in a busy glorified shopping mall you get from most UK airports - though as noted in several other comments food and drink are pricey.

I paid for lounge access but when I got in they'd run out of beer and I complained and all the staff said was ""come earlier in the day"". I then replied by telling them a high percentage of long-haul flights leave late at night. Another thing which was very annoying and this happened both times I recently arrived was that baggage trolleys ran out meaning I had to carry my big heavy suitcase. At the same time I could see porters who were possibly charging for their services using baggage trolleys. How difficult is it for the management of CGK to order more baggage trolleys? On top of that its not very well organised and can be rather confusing to navigate. Finally (I was lucky because I have a work visa) there was only one immigration desk open at about 4 o clock in the afternoon meaning those who had to get a tourist visa on arrival had to wait ages. Also there was no queue control system like a 'snake line'.

jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,M Fadjar,Spain,2012-05-22,CGK represents most things that are disorganised about Jakarta. However I am a great defender of its traditional and distinctive architecture. If you are an arriving Business Class passenger and don't waste your time to get to the immigration desk (assuming you don't need visa on arrival) then you can get to the taxi in 10 minutes flat without luggage and 15-20 min with (priority) luggage. Immigration officers have improved a lot over the years. The problem with CGK is all the chaos happening outside the sterile area after the custom check (arrival) or before the check-in (departure).

jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,C Ng,Australia,2011-11-22,I have to say this is the worst airport I have experienced. With the exception of the departure lounge area the whole place is a shambles. The building is claustrophobic and dark signage is limited or absent the air conditioner struggles to maintain coolness and toilets are filthy. The arrival exit leads out to a fenced-in area which cuts off the concourse into two halves. The Departure roadway also doubles up illegally as a pickup area and as a result cars are double parked buses coaches and taxis of all kinds obstruct the roadway and the end result is absolute chaos. Touts are plentiful. I have had the misfortune of spending 1.5 hours waiting for a phantom shuttle vehicle from the hotel. I finally gave up and spend the rest of the remaining time trying to stay awake in the noisy and messy departure concourse. I haven't even mentioned about the visa charges and the airport tax.

I have travelled many times (approximately 20) via this airport. It appears to get worse each time I've visited. On many occasions I was a VIP ie. performing Umrah. Almost every other Islamic country offers a fast track or special treatment for persons on a journey to/from umrah. However the host nation ie. Saudi Arabia passport/immigration control make you queue for hours (5-6 hrs is the norm). No separate queues for elderly women or children or persons with other reasons for visits. Passport control then spend approx. 45 mins per person at the kiosk flicking through pages of your passport taking fingerprints of every finger on both hands. It gets worse if you have not completed the correct landing forms as you just get waved away without a proper explanation. And there are no clear signs or instructions on where to obtain such forms until someone from the mile long queue points or explains what you need to do. Saudi or Arabic speaking travellers jump the queues and there are just allowed to and we as foreigners aren't allowed to question. To make matters worse just as you think you are next in the queue the passport control clerk leaves/closes their station. No explanation no replacement clerk no moving of same queue to another kiosk. You just stand there hoping he will return or just join the back of another mile long queue.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The waiting area in departures was clean and someone was clearing up. There is a cafe area and they charge 10 Riyals for a coffee and forced me to take a bun - they said it was part of the package. Tea was 3 riyals (no bun). Duty free shop is small but adequate enough to waste ones time window shopping. They accept £ and $ currency at the duty free and return the change in Saudi currency (though the rate isn't great - but not bad for the convenience). The waiting area near the cafe was very clean  with massive windows overlooking the airport. The only drawback is that the displays on the departure gates dont work and I never heard our call for boarding in English. I had to keep checking for a queue.

jiamusi-airport,/airport-reviews/jiamusi-airport,Jiamusi Airport customer review,Nick Fortuna,Australia,2009-07-04,JMU is located in the far north-east of China approx two hours' flying time from Beijing and three hours' flying time from Shanghai-Pudong. With a single runway doubling as the only taxiway JMU doesn't see much traffic. One has to walk across the runway to the terminal building - no provisions of covered walkways in this single-storey terminal building. Ok in summer but imagine in winter with -25 degrees. And it does get that cold up there - the Russian border is only a few hundred km away. The single belt means it can get crowded when a full China Southern 737 disgorges is complement of passengers. Trolleys are free but in a poor state. As soon as the airport staff matches luggage tag against baggage receipt means you're fair game for the taxi touts. Which is meaningless since they all use the meter. The drive into Jiamusi city is uneventful and mercifully only 50 RMB away. Departing on Hainan Airlines was easy - though the ticket counter accepts cash only should you need to purchase the ticket at the airport like we did. The two check-in clerks went about their job quickly and efficiently. Security was equally quick. The single departure hall consisted of two gates a souvenir shop selling Russian matrioshka dolls and manicure sets (!) and a smoking room.

I went to the nearest one which seemed to be Europcar (sadly no the company I was using) so back in the lift. When I returned the car again the signs came thick and fast along with the turns in the road all very confusing but I managed to keen in the correct lane until the last when all of a sudden the car rental lane was only valid for some companies leaving me a split second to try and find the companies logo!

The International terminal has really improved both before and after check-in. The new International wing is quite something modern spacious and very airy. But somewhat left the heaters on ( on a very hot day) so that was not exactly welcoming. One gripe I had about my experience in the International departures lounge area was that there is no ATM to be found. And I happen to be the unlucky one without SA Rand cash. I tried to buy a phone card from Telkom they do not take credit cards (machine broken) Vodacom does not sell phone cards but their vending machine does which takes cash. So I ended up spending a small fortune phoning from my mobile phone. So beware: If you need Rand cash after check-in and immigration draw money from the ATM first before going through. I found the craft shops to be expensive. I wondered to myself if they ever get their wares sold? Airport itself: ACSA is doing a fine job bringing OR Tambo International up to standard.

The gate areas have very little seating unless you want to walk and sit at another gate. The corridors in the entire airport are narrow and make it difficult to move around as you are always in someone's way. The bathrooms are lacking all around and they are filthy.

kansas-city-airport,/airport-reviews/kansas-city-airport,Kansas City Airport customer review,F Martin,United States,2014-07-03,There are good things and bad things about the set up of this airport. The biggest plus is the small size which makes it easy to get to where you need to go without having to walk through long sections of stores restaurants lounges etc. However that's because they don't have those amenities except for a couple so if you are a seasoned traveler who expects those you're out of luck. There isn't any real connection to public transportation here (only buses in KC) so you have to take a taxi use a shuttle to your hotel or pay to park in the lot and take a shuttle to and from the lot to the airport. The bathrooms are generally clean and not busy. The waiting areas are small but I've never seen it too crowded either. Security is right there at the waiting area so there's little walking you need to do between entering the airport and getting to your gate. The airline availability here is not ideal but it's adequate to get by. Basically if you aren't expecting to spend much time at the airport it can be quite nice to breeze in run through security and sit down ready to board your flight. If you are used to the amenities of bigger airports expect to be disappointed.

While there are recharging stations for mobile devices a few seat-side plug sockets to facilitate laptop use would be welcome given the lack of things to do.

VV does not appear to check bags through to final destination so had to pick up bags and recheck in KBP. Terminal B is not impressive. The domestic baggage belt is tiny so it will be a scrum to get your bag. The entire terminal has only 2 jet bridges so there's an excellent chance you'll be riding a bus to the terminal and plane (the NYC flight does use a gate due to the extra security). I had a 2.5 hour layover and when my bag finally arrived I discovered I couldn't check in yet. There were a few places to eat in the arrivals area and a couple other shops. I joined the others staring at the departure board waiting for the check in counter to be posted. BT has its own check in staff so you won't be lined up with VV. Passport control was fairly quick and so was security. After you past security in the international half of the terminal there are 3 duty free shops (2 were closed) and about 3 cafes. That's it for shopping so you won't be picking up any last minute souvenirs.

Signage is poor it is a very old Soviet building that has had a cosmetic decoration yet is simply not big enough to handle extra traffic. The check in procedure is a joke only one belt shared with 6 check in desks passengers then have to leave by an exit door and go outside around the back to a second building housing the departure gates. The departure area is basically 1 room with a duty free shop no bigger than 15m m2 There is seating for only around 60 while when I was there more than 200 people crowded into the room. No facilities for refreshments and the plasma screens show no flight info just weather reports. Expect pandamonium as military police airline staff airport officials and heavies in black bomber jackets all seemingly want to control things with the result being chaos. Incoming passengers face piles of baggage passed directly from the tarmac through a door there is no reclaim hall-just a 6m corridor. This place makes Boryspil look like a palace. The only advantage is the 7 km from the centre of Kiev as opposed to KBP 33km. All the same be wary of taxi drivers asking for extortionate fees to unsuspecting arrivals- better to get a bus from just outside main entrance.

When he took the details about my blue suitcase he suddenly stopped went back into the office and came out with my suitcase. It arrived on an earlier and direct flight. As the airport bus runs only once a day on saturdays he offered to call a taxi. This will need 12 minutes to arrive from town because there usually are no taxis at the airport waiting.

A major disadvantage of going with a budget airline apart from the lack of onboard amenities and punctuality is the low- cost terminals or airports from which they fly. I therefore expected a bare and plastic terminal with next to no amenities when I was on my way to KLIA2 which is used exclusively by budget airlines. How wrong I was. In all my years of flying I have never been so pleasantly surprised with an airport. The duty free shops and various cafes and restaurants on offer was excellent and better than most full-service airports from which I have flown. Also the terminal was so clean. In fact based on this experience the only airports I would say are better than KLIA2 are Singapore Hong Kong and Amsterdam Schiphol though in fairness they are mainly for full-service airlines. How KLIA2 heaps shame on many full-service hubs like Beijing Manila Jakarta Paris Charles de Gaulle Shanghai Pudong and Heathrow. Also public transport links are excellent for both efficiency and value for money. My only criticisms of this airport are the lack of travellators in such a large terminal building which could pose problems if someone was in a rush and the fact I had to go through security twice once right after immigration and then again before I went to pier P to catch my flight to Jakarta.

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Robert Jan van Pelt,Malaysia,2014-03-28,Probably due to the recent dramatic events with MH370 security checks have doubled at KLIA. Problem is that there isn't any more staff so many empty counters at immigration. We are queuing at the premier lane and it will probably take us 45 mins to clear immigration just in time to board the flight. We might have been in serious trouble if we would have had to use the regular immigration counters. So it's certainly wise to allow yourself 1 hour to pass immigration at KLIA now. it's a pity as facilities at KLIA are nice but you'll probably have no time left for coffee or shopping.,NA,NA,NA,4,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,H Yaacob,Singapore,2013-09-30,KLIA used to feel like a modern airport. Unfortunately the airport has been under-maintained and it's beginning to show it's age. First up the Aerotrain system had no announcements. Several monitors next to the platform were dead. Trains looked old and tired. This was not the case before. It seems as if they've not bothered to repair the PA system. There were no queues at immigration but the area has poor and illogical signage. They gave warnings on Taxi touts before the immigration counters without little information on Foreign or Malaysian passport lines until we got to the counters. There were no lines and all counters were open so that they've improved the well-known KLIA passport lines. Then you're squeezed into a small hallway with small monitors detailing the carousels assigned. Upon exit booths for rental cars and airport taxis are cluttered and strewn about. The airport taxi counter has long lines forming blocking the exit. When you exit surprisingly there are other taxi booths all empty. On the way back we were assigned the last check in row which was did not have enough space to accommodate the crowds. Not to mention the oversized check-in portal was also located there creating a huge bottleneck. There were 3 flights being checked in at the same time for our row. We were shoved around because the airport staff needed to put up queue barriers to check in an Oman Air flight at the counters next to ours when there was a line already forming for that flight. They took their own time. Shops are worthless because they're either too expensive or are just uninteresting. Eating places haven't changed since three years ago and were terribly disappointing. Seating is terribly inadequate. Several seats were dirty and rusty and not to mention had come lose meaning that they were not in a straight line and were strewn about. Shops are disorganized and are cluttered around resulting in inefficient floor use and various bottlenecks. Trash cans are overflowing and some had their lids broken resulting in trash on the floor. Not a good experience. Departing and Arriving from SIN (a very well kept airport) you can definitely see the difference ironic because we departed from SIN T1 which is at least a decade older than KLIA.

Inbound was the usual piece of cake only one person in front of me at immigration and they were processed in no time so hardly queued at all. The facilities at LCCT are better than KLIA. Lots of places to eat/drink catering to all tastes. The bus into Sentral is a steal at MYR 9.00 and the time taken isnt much more than the train. The new train service isn't quite what it seems as you are bussed to a station to get the service. Only downside was that my flight to BKK left from Y1. After checkin I went to the normal departure area are (T) and was told that Y gates are not located there but behind the domestic checkin. Sure enough there it was but entry to the area was closed. So time for a Big Mac after which I came back and it was still closed. This irritated a lot of people who had already checked in. And there is a large notice warning people that there are no toilets in the Y waiting area.

The airport is huge looks good with an all- glass facade and a remarkable design on the roof. The boards outside the airport are small too difficult to read the airline information from the cars. There are five entrances to the airport and it is very difficult (if not impossible) to understand which gate one should use. I entered through Gate 1 and had to walk for a full 15 minutes to arrive at the airline counter (which was closer to Gate 4 by the way). The airport has an in-line baggage scanning procedure in place but the airlines have not started using it. The staff however are quite helpful and try to answer your queries with a smiling face. The airport if working all guns would not allow any queues at all however 60% of the immigration and customs counters re closed so as usual it takes time. Once you are done with the security check is where the trouble begins. There is no good food shop no lounges no shops where you can kill time. I was told that new stores would open in the next few months. The washrooms are relatively clean and I saw people wiping it every now and then. The arrival hall is a huge one fast baggage delivery and lots of carts. Overall a big improvement from the old domestic and international terminals but still lots of work to be done.

To be fair the main terminal was far better than the low cost terminal as it was quieter and more spacious. The big lacking of this terminal was that the air conditioning did not seem to function properly causing the whole airport to be humid hot and uncomfortable. The departure hall was almost empty with very limited choices of shops and restaurants. My feeling was that this airport was simply under used and should definitely need more to- and-fro flights. The other downside was that the announcement was barely heard and the poor command in languages especially English language did not help at all.

Domestic terminal is tiny and resembles the former Etiuda terminal at WAW. Baggage reclaim is rather slow. Check-in is surprisingly quick despite long queues. Security and ground staff are fine. The free bus from the railway station is timed to pick up arrivals but is not so useful when leaving the domestic terminal - the bus can wait for up to 30 minutes at the international terminal so it's sometimes quicker to walk. Facilities consist of two shops and a cafe with minimal seating before security - not a problem when the flight is on time but my second flight was delayed by two hours due to fog which made things less pleasant.

We queued for nearly 1hr30 mins to be screened and as we neared the end more people just pushed past and jumped ahead. No staff whatsoever around to keep everything under control. On other occasions some staff did then seem to escort certain passengers to the front of the lines which is wrong when you have people queuing for ages. It's time the whole mess was sorted out.

kuwait-airport,/airport-reviews/kuwait-airport,Kuwait Airport customer review,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,2015-06-17,"I honestly have been to this airport far too many times considering that I have once lived here in Kuwait before (but this will be my first review on the airport). 1) Upon arrival, for some passengers, it is required of us to obtain a visa on arrival before heading to the immigration counter. I have noticed huge improvements with this service as they now photocopy your passport getting your passport stamped at the visa place (which did ease up the whole transaction). I did notice however that there was no information with regards to the price for the visa. Last time I came, I paid 5kd but my boyfriend (on an American passport) didn't pay for any. I actually had to Google up the actual cost and turns out its only 3kd. Anyway the whole visa process was easy thankfully. 2) It was not notified to us that those who already have their passport stamped at the visa application area can just walk through the immigration without going through the queue as you already have your passport stamped. 3) Coming back to this airport and heading out to Abu Dhabi almost gave me a heart attack. This airport has a weird way of organising their check in counters as they would group some airlines in one gate/area (e.g. Omanair, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways would be in the same check in area). Passengers are required to stand out the airport and look at the direction to figure out which gate/area they need to go to check in. Anyway, as I entered the airport, I noticed there was a long line at the luggage check going out to area I needed to get my boarding pass. I have already checked in online and all I needed to do was get my boarding pass. I didn't even have any luggage to scan as I flew in the same day as I am heading back out. My flight was due to leave in 1.5 hours and I noticed that all those that queued up were ones that were flying with Emirates. Thankfully, the security guy at the luggage check allowed me to jump the queue (scan just my handbag) and proceed to the counter. 4) There are hardly any shops in here. Both before and after immigration. I'm happy to see the new coffee shops area at the end of the terminal which is usually less crowded and more peaceful. Overall, it is an OK airport to be at for a short transit.

This sets the tone for your entire New York experience of dilapidation on a grand scale. The Security experience however was fast and far less hostile than JFK and there are plenty of places to recharge. Since I am a budgeting hound there's not much choice of airport when you locate a nice cheap airfare (sites like skyscanner or skypicker for this) but this is the least awful airport for those going in and out of NYC. The area is not good and its better to get a park and fly so your car will have the hotel security rather than leave your car at the airport. The wifi is pay-only and if there are any flights cancelled you will wish you were in hell instead of here. Forget trying to get here on the subway although you can take the buses.

Describing it as a third-world airport would be an understatement. Facilities and decor are outdated and very limited. I frequently travel in and out on Air Canada and the 4 departure gates assigned to this airline is in an area that offers very limited seating is stuffy and overcrowded. The experience one must endure to transit through this airport completely negates the convenience it offers due to its proximity to Manhattan.

Used terminal B (the main terminal) when both arriving in and departing out of LGA. Absolutely limited space with insufficient seating let alone totally miserable number and variety of shops with limited things to buy yet with high prices. Even walking to the baggage claim without bumping into other people is a challenge. No free wifi and only a few power ports can't even be a major concern in this airport as so many other things are just miserable. Total chaos continues landside where signage is insufficient and no one seems welcoming. Public transportation limited and reliable systems like rail links non-existent. Bus services seem to be there but with no information posted anywhere. Departure also a total pain. Passed check-in as web check-in was already done but security check took 15 minutes even at 6am. Then on to the same concourse with appalling state of amenities for passengers. Apparently sleeping is the best thing to do in this airport but good luck finding a spot to do so.

In place of the Fox Sky Box restaurant with all the TVs is some french cuisine place that is overpriced. In place of Chili's another very popular and safe choice is some other very high end restaurant that again is overpriced. Forget dining for fun on the run and grabbing a reasonably priced burger chicken or salad. Now you have salmon and steak as your choices. That is the most screwed up decision I have ever seen in airport retail. Starbucks before security - gone. Starbucks after security - gone. In place is some other new coffee that will not attract all the same traffic other than the fact that it is the only coffee joint there. And finally there are so many bags of chips and grab and go items everywhere that it literally looks like a supermarket.

The escalators work - unfortunately one of them empties everyone directly into the customs area so passengers were crashing into each other and falling all over the place.

The immigration official was even quite charming in a curmudgeonly sort of way. The Alamo shuttle was tardy. For departure T2 is not the place to be. Check-in was fine. Bad design means that the security line which was not actualy that long easily backs up on to the escalator which is potentially dangerous.

We departed a very busy Barcelona some 20 minutes ahead of both Jet2 and Ryanair landed at Leeds and parked on a remote stand.

Everything about this airport appears to be designed to make things as awkward for pax as possible or to get them to spend as much money as possible. From the £2.00 drop-off charge to the poor pedestrian access to the long-stay car parks it's mostly bad. The airport had few arrivals at the time we landed yet it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive. On the return leg it took 25 minutes to check-in just 6 passengers in front of me then another 20 minutes to clear security. For an airport which only had 5 flights within the hour this is unacceptable. Airside is crowded and poorly-ventilated with lots of unpleasant drunken locals staggering around. Although the number of shops/restaurants is much better now this is at the expense of space. Seating is minimal unless you are willing to spend money to eat in the overpriced restaurants.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,Harry Bratley,United Kingdom,2012-11-27,This airport still needs to try harder. The new layout still relies heavily on shopping food and bars but if you don't want to use these facilities places to just sit quietly are severely limited. We now try and arrive at the airport as late as possible to avoid the inconvenience in the departure lounge. Sadly we can't cut it too fine as security is still surly and slow! Arriving back into LBA doesn't improve the impression. The escalator up to passport control is still not working after 10 years (no quick fix here then! - shops more important). Elderly people left to struggle with their bags up the stairs and then a long walk to meet the rude and slow passport control staff. After all this you would at least expect your luggage to be on the carousel (after negotiating more stairs back down!).

The main complaints are: If you don't pay the drop off fee then you have to drag your case from the main road. The security queues are slow. The airport is very crowded but a new expansion plan is progress. The other main issues are when you return - you have to wait at busy times for a fleet of old buses to take you to the Terminal where the fun really starts.

We were not allowed to disembark from our Jet2 flight from Alicante for 25 minutes after landing (not the Airline's fault). Reason: a flight was boarding and because of airport construction the two sets of passengers were not allowed to intermix. This is an international airport isn't it and do not passengers embark and arrive at roughly the same time? So eventually get into the terminal and up several sets of stairs which I noted were giving at least one elderly lady some discomfort.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2012-05-16,This used to be a pleasant little airport. However in recent years it has been taken over by a company determined to squeeze every last penny out of customers. The drop-off area costs £2 simply to enter so many people simply take a chance and drop passengers off on the mini-roundabouts. There is no taxi rank so taxis bringing passengers to the airport cannot get a fare back to the city. The airport taxis are provided by Arrow cabs which are more expensive than local firms (for example £20 to my home instead of the local firm's fare of £10). If you live locally and are flying home take the number of a local cab firm with you and call them when you leave the plane. The taxi will be waiting for you when you exit the airport. Public transport is poor; there is no train service and the many flights arrive or leave outside the hours of the bus services. The terminal is cramped so it can be difficult for example to get through to the lavatories if you are carrying hand luggage. There are shops but the selection is not good and the cafes are crowded so you will not be served quickly. The only advantage of LBA is convenience if you live locally.

Fortunately it's a small and quiet international airport so you can't go too far wrong unless you're asleep! There's enough shops to keep you entertained for 10 minutes there's a cafe and you can watch the planes from the outdoor balcony - and there's not much else. But what it needed to do it did so efficiently and pleasantly - nice to be aware from the security paranoia of LHR or other big western airports.

lima-airport,/airport-reviews/lima-airport,Lima Airport customer review,John Wilson,United States,2015-06-26,"We started the day in Cuzco, and connected via American Airlines in Lima. We had to change planes from LAN to AA, so we had to leave security and re-check in at the gate. WIth a four hour layover, there was no where to sit, and no agents to check you in. People sat on the floor, and before you knew it, were four-deep against the wall. Security would walk through on occasion, but no one was able to answer questions about when the agents would show up. We had business class tickets, but when the queue finally was set up, there was little to no indication as to where that line started, which resulted in some midwesterners mouthing off to us as we moved into the business class line (probably due to the same frustration we were feeling). About an hour later we finally made it to the front of the business class queue. All in all, I've travelled to more airports than I can count internationally, and this airport was by far the worst. The comments about the water (purchased post-security, pre-flight) are true - they won't let you bring them on the plane. The road traffic to the airport is awful. Give yourself plenty of time and be prepared to mingle with strangers as you wait for the agents to show up and set up the queue locations.

Lines were not bad and we got to our destinations on time. The final time arriving at that airport in order to depart back to Miami was a challenge to say the least. We got there around 7 or 8 pm for our flight that was departing around 10.30pm. This airport is very small to be an international airport and there were passengers everywhere. Security is a joke. The way my bags were searched was unprofessional. Everyone had to wait on ticket agents. We were still waiting to check our luggage when our travel agent came over to our group and whispered that our group was being divided up to get back to the US. There were only 16 of us in our group so I knew there was a major problem. We got our tickets without complaining and walked to the gate. Got to the gate and was told our flight was delayed. Waited a couple more hours and it was around 1 am. That's when we were told to get on the plane as quickly as possible when our seats were called stow the bag and sit. I must say I saw complete order and compliance and we all got our seats in record time and as soon as our seatbelts were on we were pulling out of the gate.

For me an airport's principal purpose is to facilitate my departure / arrival as painlessly as possible and LPL has largely done so each time I have used it this year. I have no problems with walking from the car park (instead of having to wait for a transfer bus as at some airports) and travelling hand luggage only have rarely spent more than half an hour getting from car park through to departure lounge. Passage through security has always been swift - but my wife and I are usually flying out first thing in the morning - and we have never encountered any lack of politeness perhaps because a smile and a ""Good morning"" from us creates a favourable ambience. Even when we had an item confiscated last week (a jar of jam - don't ask!) it was done in a perfectly pleasant way and demonstrated that the security staff were vigilant. I would agree that the carpeting throughout the terminal looks dowdy but I think that is due to an unfortunate choice of pattern / colour rather than actual dirtiness.

There is an express queue through security if you want to use it basically its just side stepping the queue and following the crew channel but of course you pay extra for the privilege of nothing really just another money making racket. Its the only airport that I have found where airport security staff insist on you carrying only one handbag for hand luggage I always thought that was the airlines business just goes to show who controls the airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

Arrived at the airport for my flight to Malaga and went straight to the Ryanair bag drop where there was virtually no queue after parking (cheap and on site) and entering the terminal. Security was very quick and easy and staff friendly and efficient. The departure lounge was clean and had lots of shops and eating outlets to enjoy before boarding. Boarding was completed efficiently.

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Kurt Mueller,United Kingdom,2011-11-16,Same day return to AMS on EZ. Departure largely stress-free (I had checked in online). Queue at security at 6.30 am very short security check dealt with in under 5 minutes. Security is on the first floor and departure gates on the ground floor so it's up to security from the departures hall and down again to the gates. Could be better. On time boarding. Returning the same evening at around 9 pm we used a bus for the transfer from a/c to terminal which means upon entering the terminal building you need to climb a flight of stairs then walk a substantial distance before having to walk down a flight of stairs to the ground floor again (i.e. the same level you had originally entered the building - not very smart). Immigration reasonably swift. No queues at machines for paying the car parking fee.

The new bags immediately got a hole in them so I returned them to the original bags and had no problems at either AMS or CDG. Airport would be fine if they cleaned it better and revamped the arrivals area.

I had to use Liverpool last month because I wanted to fly to Seville on a Friday and back on a Monday. I breathed a sigh of relief at security which is now three times the area it used to be and has many more scanners open and I was through in about 5 mins. However on my return I had to wait almost 50 mins to get through immigration and 25 of those were spent queuing outside before I even got into the immigration hall. The reason was that two other aircraft had landed just before mine. Fortunately it was sunny but extremely windy and I am only glad it wasn't in the winter.

Parking is relatively easy and can be cheap if you take advantage of the various offers available either through Holiday Extras or even from the airport website itself. On each occasion passage through Security has been swift and painless with staff efficient and polite even when one of us has been selected for extra scrutiny. Retail and food outlets do not interest us so we sit at the easyJet end of the building until our flight is called. I would agree however with some of the comments posted about the hold-ups to pass through passport control on returning to the UK - the immigration area is small and quickly becomes congested when 2 flights arrive in quick succession. It is particularly bad when one queue coming down the stairs has to merge with another queue entering at ground level.

We were directed to the PRM (Passengers of Reduced Mobility) desk when we arrived checked in there and were issued with a wheelchair and then allowed to make our own way through security to the gate. Security was very quiet but in any case we were directed straight to the nearest desk where everyone was very attentive and helpful. There were even apologies for the need to ""frisk"" my wife. We had to have a convoy system for boarding as there were 7 wheelchair passengers for the flight the other 6 of whom required the ""ambulift"" while my wife was able to climb the aircraft steps alone and at her own speed. The whole procedure went so smoothly that the flight actually was able to leave early. Our return was equally well handled: since an ambulift appeared at the side of the plane and there were only 2 PRM passengers this time it seemed churlish to turn it down so we were transported directly to passport control and bypassed the queues in the chicane.

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,P Thompson,Ireland,2010-09-14,The airport is undergoing long overdue modernisation to the departures area but the check in area is still shabby and dirty and the toilets frankly disgraceful. The main gripe still has to be the security processing which is the slowest I have ever encountered at any airport. There are now 6 scanners and all were in use but it still took half an hour to reach the head of the queue where I was then assigned to a smaller queue behind one of the scanners. I soon found out why people moved so slowly. Once in the small queue you have to wait to be called forward to put all metal items and bags in plastic containers. Bags cannot go through unless there is a container so you have to wait till one is available. Then I was astonished when the security staff scrutinised every plastic bag containing liquids to check its dimensions and routinely sent people back to buy a 'regulation sized' bag from a vending machine. A family of five in front of me were all sent back causing exasperation and further delays. Having placed my items in a tray I had to wait 5 minutes to go through the metal detector as two scanners have to use one detector and the staff just seem amazingly slow. The whole process took over an hour. Due to this I will not be using Liverpool again unless completely necessary.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

At GBP12 for the main I thought it was a bit pricey but the quality and portion size was very good so shant complain. Security was fairly quick. Tip - go behind a business traveller and not a tourist. Seasoned travellers have the routine down pat while infrequent users slow the process. The lounges were full once inside. We had a look at all the new shops. Shame there is a WH Smiths there now it loses its classy feel and a bit more downmarket in my eyes.

Blamed on Gatwick air traffic control. Some of the travelators weren't working and this is unfortunate for someone with arthritis. Gatwick seems to delight in offering long distance treks to get to or from planes. The good thing is that the taxi booth is close to the exit, and fairly easy to find. It was the following day, when we were travelling to Aberdeen from Gatwick North, that we experienced Gatwicks inefficiency at its worst. To be fair, I believe easyJet needs to take a lot of the blame - they are never that efficient at check in but excelled themselves here. We got to area C/D for a 07.20 flight at 05.50, with our boarding cards and flexitickets which technically entitle us to speedy bag drop. The area was roped off. We were directed to a queue about 100 metres long, by Gatwick staff. There was no attempt to prioritise by flight time, you just queued. Beyond the barriers was teaming with people trying to get to easyJet check in desks. We got to the head of the queue after 25 mins. Another Gatwick staff lady directed us to speedy bag drop in the top corner, where there was a queue of about 5 ahead of us. We got through after about 10 mins - it was now 0650. A solid hour when you have paid extra to get through the check in process, and have checked in online. I had requested special assistance, which was lucky. I can't praise the assistance staff highly enough, but that's the only part of Gatwick that deserves it. Our names were being tannoyed at this point. We boarded a packed bus.

The departure lounge is large however there is no view of the apron at the South Terminal as the one restaurant there was is now going under redevelopment. This is the one thing in the departure lounge that needs to be changed. The gate opened one hour before our flight before the plane arrived. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen. It took far longer than it should have and is probably why our flight was slightly late. On arrival we landed early and disembarkation got away quite quickly. Immigration took really quickly and the staff where friendly which was a good thing.

Boarding is allocated between 90mins and 45mins but clearly tell you when (Stansted you have to figure out what time and if it's delayed i.e. Boarding in 129mins). The gates are 15min walk at the most so it was fine there was a lot of seating and boarding was boarding not get in queue. (Stansted you have to queue up for 30mins before walking on to tarmac). Arriving: The immigration queues are quick which is good as after sometimes a 10hour overnight with no sleep you want to get home. There are several e-passport checks as well.

You enter not via a door but by lift and if you are slow or handicapped and it's busy you could be there for evermore trying to get in assuming you're not run over in the rush. Following this you are confronted with a contender for the world's slowest travelator. Then the next attractions you can look forward to a totally confusing and aimless series of ramps stairs and escalators leading you pointlessly up hill and down dale at random through the obstacle course of check-in security shops restaurants etc finally should you have the stamina to departure gate.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,S Ahmed,United Kingdom,2012-09-07,Gatwick is fairly well run apart from 2 ongoing issues.

In the departure lounge is a sign saying all gates are no more than 10 minutes away - well this is absolute nonsense I am a fast walker and my gate took a good 20 minutes to reach! You have to go up a massive escalator along a lengthy walkway and then down again. If you were delayed en route to the airport you could easily miss a flight due to this.

Check-in quick and efficient (printing your own luggage tag at the BA machines makes a difference). Several toilets blocked untidy and not flushing.

There were bottlenecks on the walk from the gate down to the shuttle trains which take people from the remote satellite terminals to the 'main' part of T5 which houses passport control/baggage reclaim as well as check-in/security on departure. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get on a train, because in many cases the shuttles would arrive from the previous stop (the C gates) already full. Was a bit stressful. At passport control, it was a 30-minute wait for non-EU nationals, expected as this was the morning rush. Immigration officer was courteous and polite (am a frequent visitor to the UK, so minimal questions asked). She endorsed (i.e. stamped) the wrong visa, and when I pointed out her error, she rectified her mistake with minimal fuss. Bags didn't take much time. Very convenient vending machines if you need to pick up a SIM card in the baggage claim hall-if not, there are several shops in the arrivals area selling UK SIM cards, plus WHSmith and a few other outlets. Signage to Heathrow Express clear, and in 20 minutes was in central London. Departure: Arrived on the HEX, and wanted to do VAT refund, but the office was on the other side of the terminal, and quite busy at that, so I ended up ditching-they should have a VAT refund office on either end of the large T5 check-in area. My flight left at 1pm, and there were quite a number of flights leaving, a mixture of European and intercontinental flights. Used self-service kiosks to print BPs, then waited for a good 30 minutes in the bag drop queue. Would be much more efficient to have a proper self check-in service, where passengers can print and stick their bag tags themselves. Although the queue to get into security was short, getting in line to go through the scanner, then waiting again for the bags to come out through the machine all ended up taking a good 15 minutes. By then, only had 70 minutes or so until departure. Bearing in mind that my flight left from Gate B35, which required another ride on the shuttle, only had 20-25 minutes to grab a bit and run. Despite arriving 3 hours in advance, with the all the walking and waiting, felt like I was cutting it close. Overall a mixed bag. I highly recommend anyone planning on doing a VAT refund to get there a good 4 hours before their flight (and of course, you need to be prepared to show them your purchases, so unless it's in your carry-on, you need to do this before checking in your bags).",Arrival and Departure,01-07-2015,Solo Leisure,7,2,5,5,4,4,4,NA,3,1

Arrived terminal 1 12/08/2014. Arrived at T2 over 3 hours before departure. Good signage to indicate check in zones. Check-in for Star Alliance flights is generic and the entire process was chaotic with passengers about to miss their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to a check-in desk. Despite it being the 1st week of school summer holidays and 5 Star Alliance flights checking-in simultaneously not all check-in desks were manned. Check in staff were minimally communicative. Eventually got checked in then came the security 'experience'. Long queues for security. My cabin bag was selected for further checks which required a further long wait as there were several bags selected for further checks and just 1 member of staff doing this - in the 1st week of school summer holidays! The additional security checks on my back-pack must have taken about 40 minutes by the time the 1 member of staff got to my bag had checked everything swabbed everything put the swab through the ionmiser re-xrayed everything and then I had to re-pack everything. Eventually completed security clearance had a quick trip to the toilets (clean) and got to departure gate with about 10 minutes to spare. At departure gate a sullen non-communicative member of ground handling staff. Airbridge was broken so down two flights of stairs and walk to aircraft. On arrival on 12/08 after spending an extraordinary amount of time going around in circles above London we eventually landed followed by a very long taxi to airbridge. Good signage in terminal. Clean and plentiful toilets. Very long walk to T1 UK border from where aircraft parked. Reasonable queues at UK border handled by pleasant UK border staff. Baggage reclaim no problems as baggage already on carousel when we got there. The final insult: sitting in the grid-locked traffic at about 22:45 outside of T1 car park for about 15 minutes wondering why we're not moving.

Flight connections signing was good and the transfer area was actually quite efficient with buses seemingly frequent although a painfully slow journey it did take the promised 10 minutes. Into T5 and a bit of quick thinking got us into the fast-track at the id check saving 10 minutes queuing time. Security was not very busy but was very slow although staff were polite enough.

Was excited to visit the new airport with high hopes it would be like T5 but what a great disappointment. The check in area was airy but not as grand as T5. It's clean and basic. There were only two cafes/bar before security - A Costa and a Weatherspoon. There is also a very tiny travel shop. When we entered the check in area it was empty - not many airlines have moved to T2. There was a very polite and friendly gentleman from the airport at the entrance to give you direction and guidance. I assume because it's not occupied solely by one airlines like T5 does the check in desks seem to be more ""traditional"" and less inviting. Most of the airlines are using self check in and bag tag printing service which might save time for some but not for all. Perhaps the airport was still new and not used by many airlines and we also arrived very early the check in was very smooth and fast. Security was also fast but it will be interesting to see what happens when all airlines move in. The check in agent warned us its a long walk to get to the gate. It turned out to be a reasonable walk just a lot of stairs/escalators going up and down. There are not many dining and shopping options in the terminal either. The signature restaurant was a big disappointment. Food was boring and plain. Shopping is also very weak. All in all it's a clean and new airport.

The facilities in T5 are good with several restaurants and a reasonably priced Wetherspoons bar (albeit the bar has a limited seating area for those purchasing drinks and not food). Its a bit bizarre that the smaller Wetherspoons bar in T5b has 4 times the seating. The free wifi is very slow and intermittent worked much better on outward than inward journey. The outbound transit was very quick and efficient. However offsetting this was the usual amount of time to exit/enter Heathrow on the plane - outbound delayed 50 minutes inbound by 30 minutes. Arriving at T5 transfers on 25 May was a disgrace - 1 officer having to deal with fasttrack EU and non EU nationals. No movement at all for 15 minutes. Staff co-ordinator realised eventually situation should be being resolved and eventually 2 more officials came out to assist. My non EU partner was held up briefly as well when eventually seen but issue then resolved swiftly.

Departure from both was pretty good with short queues for check-in and security though the scanners at Heathrow seem more sensitive than anywhere else I have been - everybody seems to set them off. Arriving is not so good with lengthy queues for passport checks as others have mentioned the scanners are painfully slow. Buses to and from long stay car parks seem to work well. My main gripe is that on both occasions having landed we were kept on the taxiway for 20-30 minutes as 'we are waiting for the gate to be vacated'. It also happened to my daughter (T5). It is frustrating that on a short flight you can spend as much time getting off the aircraft as you have in the air and on a long flight the last thing you want having arrived is to sit in your seat for another half hour.

Once I'd collected baggage the real fun started. My options to get to Croydon are train Paddington then underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (complicated and train is expensive) underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (slow and engineering work meant no circle or district line services to Victoria) or bus direct from Heathrow to Croydon (1.5 hours but direct and cheap). How to get to central bus station? Signage in Terminal 5 is confusing and unhelpful. Man on info desk in Term 5 gave me incorrect info. Finally establish I need to get a train from Term 5 to Term 2/3 and train only runs every 15 minutes. Is this a 3rd world airport in the middle of the night? No its London Heathrow middle of day on Bank Holiday weekend. Why is there no free regular shuttle like the one between North and South Terminals in Gatwick?

I agree with other reviews here that T5 is simply bursting at the seams since it's handling almost half of Heathrow's traffic.

It is already overcrowded beyond capacity for much of the day and it is often hard to find a seat. In spring summer and fall the temperature is too warm and humid for comfort given all the people inside the terminal. There are no pay lounges no lounges for Star Alliance or SkyTeam carriers (or any other carriers for that matter) and BA does not offer paid access to its lounges so if you do not have BA/Oneworld status you have no lounge access at all. This is not true in T1 T3 and T4. There are no pay showers either (unlike T1 T3 and T4)--so if you do not have lounge access a shower is not an option. The toilet facilities are also inadequate - it is not uncommon to be unable to get a stall without a long wait something that never happens in Frankfurt Munich Vienna or most other European airports. There all also very long lines at most transit desks with no automated boarding pass printers like those in German airports. Overall a very unpleasant experience if you cannot access a lounge.

Most recently I arrived from IAD on 27th November and returned 17th December on arrival passport control queues were very short (admittedly arriving on BA216 one of T5's earliest arrivals helps - will be interesting to check out next year when they deploy the A380 on this flight) and on departure (scheduled for 17.00) I only had to wait behind two people for bag drop and the security queue took about 5min. Once airside there were plenty of seats notably at the Crown Rivers pub which has expanded its seating and provides a perfect place to nurse a pint or two whilst waiting for one's departure gate to be posted and the Scotch whisky selection at the various duty free shops is as good as it's ever been. (The rule on no bag drop more than 3 hours prior to scheduled departure helps ease potential airside crowding as well.)

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,A Lane,United States,2012-12-07,I hate transiting through Heathrow specifically for two reasons: Immigration control and security. I have to clear immigration before connecting to my UK flight and there is always no more than two Border Agency officers on duty. They are either belligerent or disinterested towards non-EU passengers like myself. There are two lines-one for EU citizens and the other for non-EU citizens-where each time the officers give preference towards EU citizens while ignoring those in the non-EU line. My advice is for non-EU citizens to make sure to have at least 2 hours to transit because of this ridiculous practice. As to security it has become a nightmare recently. On my most recent experience my handbag was 'randomly' selected for a thorough search. To make matters worse the security officials take their leisurely time. I did not have my handbag checked until after a good 20 minutes of waiting around. They do not care that many passengers are in a hurry to catch their flights! Instead I noticed officials joking and talking amongst themselves oblivious to these randomly selected bags they need to check because passengers are waiting for them! This type of supposedly extreme checking is a huge farce really accomplishes nothing but hassle to the passengers. If not for the immigration & security issues Heathrow's T5 is quite nice provided one has time to actually relax and shop and eat.

Very straightforward passage through T5 on outward journey. One avoidable hitch when we left the lounge for T5B. We were unloaded from transit for an apparent fault and put on the next. The first then left with people on it anyway. Impressively fast on the way back in spite of recent adverse publicity about the UKBF/UKBA. There was a wait for the transit at a busy time. There were queues at immigration but to my surprise IRIS was still in operation. Baggage handling was commendably fast but then a lot of time was wasted waiting for the inadequate and infrequent Hotel Hoppa. A broken toilet had a sloppy sign indicating more that it was not being fixed than it was likely to be any time soon. A key escalator in the still fairly new T5 was not working and another in the same sequence was taped off even though it was running.

Security staff working hard at 5 am but doing so speedily and with a pleasant attitude. Shopping area is still dire but the food/waiting area is dark has no consistent flooring and has the feeling of being in a pen of doomed cattle waiting for the abattoir as they crowd to watch the screen to find out where their gate might be albeit in an hour's time. More importantly this is the first week of the Car Rental Village where all the previous 'on airport' companies (Hertz Avis Budget Europcar and Enterprise) are now in an area away from the airport requiring a shuttle bus trip of about 10 mins. These buses run approx every 10 mins except between 1 am and 4 am (or so I was told). This 'village' concept is becoming a regular feature of airport planning but means you have to allow even more time for your trip from the airport and returning your hire car to the airport (prior to check- in/bag drop/security/retail therapy) which is unwelcome at the best of times even more so with a 06H00 departure.

This airport is in a clear sorry state I generally enjoy flying and don't mind Airports for the most part but the experience here was utterly joyless. Firstly the Terminal as you walk in it is dark dingy and cramped with poor signage - not very clear where particular check-in desks are located. Then there is the zoo that is security I've been to third-world countries where security has been managed better - it was chaotic with enormous snaking queues which barely any staff controlling the masses of people going through security or to give any assistance. If you were running late you would have been stuck and most likely miss your flight. Once through security airside is no better again dark dingy and cramped with barely any natural light entering the building. Surprisingly there were some nice food outlets like a Leon but the environment is so poor and devoid of any joy you wouldn't want to linger here for long. At the Gate it is even worse decrepit waiting area with gates cramped next to each other and only a common seating area to wait for multiple gates which was obviously not enough room for the 3 flights taking off at the same time. This Airport clearly needs some serious investment - it hasn't got any hope of competing with the likes of Gatwick and Heathrow and is already at a disadvantage because of its location I would have thought some effort would have been made to actually encourage more passengers. I'm sorry to say but this is the first time an Airport has actually put me off from flying - it is unacceptable in this country to have third-world like airport especially when it is supposed to be serving what is the capital of the world.

We arrived at 04.30 for our 07.30 flight to La Rochelle and with no bags went straight through security. It took around 15 mins which is better than expected for a flight in rush hour during peak holiday season. The woman at security was annoying 'you failed to seal your clear through plastic bags'. She gave us another one and she just put it in the tray without sealing it. Departure lounge. It was OK. Walk through parade of duty free shops is not good as people go back and forward causes congestion. There are shops and the departure boards are OK a countdown system till the say go to gate. We where allocated a gate at 06.25 early so we went instantly to gate 87 the middle satellite. Boarding was smooth and we were however told to wait at various points which wasn't too great i.e. the end of the corridor to the stairs to tarmac and at the end of the stairs. Arrival.

Terminal overcrowded poor signalling and incredibly rude and dismissive staff (Ryanair mainly). Security line was a highlight as we found the only friendly member of staff in the whole airport. We went to a bar in order to avoid noise and crowds. We ordered breakfast but it was never delivered. Boarding gates were wait boarding gates? There are certainly no boarding gates whatsoever!

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,V Brown,United Kingdom,2013-07-07,I have long been of the opinion that Stansted has no concept of customer care. The whole place seems vaguely grubby staff are frequently rude and security is a nightmare. However dropping off or picking up passengers was always fairly simple. To drop off you drove up to the terminal your passengers got out (under cover) you drove out. To pick up you drove to the pick-up zone your passengers got in you drove out. Not any more. The whole thing has become shambolic. This morning I drove my husband to Stansted with the objective of dropping him off at 5 am for a 6.30 am flight where he had already checked in online but we were allowing at least an hour for him to get through security (see earlier comment about security). Arrived at 5 am discovered you could no longer drive up to the terminal and then took another 10 minutes to get to the so-called drop-off area where we were confronted by vehicles in the parking areas on both sides and also in the central lane which explained why there was a traffic queue trying to get into the drop-off area in the first place. As there was absolutely no chance of parking properly my husband got out and then wended his way through the melee. Fortunately he had no luggage to impede him. If the drop-off zone was properly sign-posted perhaps the log jam in the first lane would not occur but at the same time you cannot blame people for wanting to be as close as possible to what is anyway the far end of the terminal building. This morning was dry and warm so not a problem but in inclement weather with luggage? I wonder whether the designers of this chaos have ever tried it out as paying customers.

Then a train takes you to one of the remote terminals. We did this process twice since we missed our first flight. The strange thing is once you take the train out to the terminal there is no way back. We had to call our airline and have a representative come out and escort us back to the main terminal. I'm sure that the design is good for security and crowd control but someone hasn't thought through all possible scenarios. The second time we went through the process the remote terminal was freezing cold and dingy.

All in all from gate to easybus transfer roughly 25 mins. I can't comment on check in as I departed on the same day with online check in. Security could have been faster. Quite a long queue with many scanners not in operation. And then the trek to the gate. All in all a good experience bar a few little niggles. Transport into London could be a bit cheaper.

Yes it looks a bit like a permanent construction site on the inside and yes it can be crowded but I prefer it to Heathrow. On the other hand I never use Ryan Air or Easy Jet (my last flight from STN was on Turkish) so maybe this helps.

Connecting from domestic AA flight to International terminal (and vice versa) requires you to get outside and walk. It is not a long walk but can be confusing to folks who is not familiar with LAX.

We arrived from Las Vegas to connect to a flight to Europe and not knowing LAX at all were a bit surprised that there was no ongoing flight information for flights outside of Terminal 4. We looked in vain for an information desk of any kind in Terminal 4 and so found ourselves heading to Terminal 5 hoping to find one there. Was a little surprised that an airport of this size an importance relied on its passengers walking down claustrophobic tunnels between terminals with no transport or moving walkways but put this down to the redevelopment going on. Once in Terminal 5 it took another round of searching for an info desk (with our flight departure time getting ever closer) to eventually find one tucked away in a corner. The patronising attendant told us that we needed the Tom Bradley Terminal which was two terminals along and waved in the vague direction of a corridor which led who knows where. The corridor eventually led outside where we would have hoped to find a map or some form of signage to the terminal. Nothing of the kind could be seen. We ended up asking a shuttle bus attendant for directions after which we walked for 10 minutes to eventually find the right place. We are not stupid people and do not get overly stressed but it was a good job that we had a three hour connection time as anyone with a short interval between flights would have missed by a mile.

It's one of the worst airports in the world! Having arrived in afternoon peak-hour our flight was sent to one of the many remote gates at LAX requiring us to be bussed to the arrivals hall. Waiting for immigration clearance at LAX is a frustrating experience with several lines of about 100 people each being serviced by one or two immigration officials. After a 100-minute wait (seriously!) the lad who processed my arrival didn't know how to use the software properly and had to ask for assistance from a colleague which delayed the process even further. Once the passenger has actually had their passport stamped they enter the Soviet-era baggage-claim and commence their epic voyage to their connecting flight. The entire airport is grimy noisy and not at all pretty. The moral of the story is to arrive on the west coast of the USA via San Francisco or Seattle and avoid Los Angeles all together.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The corridors are poorly lit there is not enough floor space or seating for the number of gates and the floors and carpeting are worn and dirty. Not enough restrooms and food/beverage/shopping is of low quality. There is however a very good view of the north runways and not as much of a walk between curbside/check-in and gate as in other LAX terminals.

TBIT is still under construction but there are signs of progress. Security staff were noticably courteous but the processes remain frustratingly pointless. In response to previous comments there various staff members shouting out stuff but only in a very general public announcement kind of way. In addition to failing to appreciate the futility of their role they also fail to understand that shouting in English is going to miss about 80% of the audience in TBIT. There is a pinch point for a particularly slow passport and boarding card check and I am glad we were in Fast Track.

On arrival immigration is like some Orwellian post-communist throwback nightmare almost designed for psychological torture. Make sure you have the immigration form filled in on the plane and you get it stamped (show the guy yellow fever cert.). The immigration officials are painfully slow and exeptionally bossy and rude there is no A/C (by the way there are different queues but no one cares which one you're in choose the shortest) it is mosquito infested and dirty... shabby. the toilets will make you want to vomit.... after you've been to the immigration desk they will take your passport from you and you will have to wait an age to get it back with your visa... there are no seats. This is a good time to try and get your luggage sometimes the officials will let you through to get it sometimes not it's completely random just like everything else... expect anything as they change the procedures regularly and without informing anyone. Once you have your bags you're almost there just have to negotiate corrupt officials searching your bag and being accosted by local con men/pick- pockets once you're outside. I can't even begin to describe departure.... long queues to get through.. be careful when you go past duty free as there is a security check (a guy in a glass room looking for a bribe) once you are upstairs it's a bit easier.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Seating facilities in departures have been sacrificed to allow more retail outlets hence difficulty finding somewhere to sit - particularly if only one plane is delayed. Last arrival on 18th March delayed 20 minutes on plane as nobody had unlocked door to get into terminal!

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,M Davis,Ireland,2014-12-10,Very surprised at the negative reviews about London Luton. I have a choice between Birmingham and Luton to fly to Dublin and have chosen Luton most of the time because it's that bit closer. It's not a pretty airport but it's easy to use and I totally disagree regarding the staff they have been some of the nicest (and consistently so!) of any airport I've used especially going through security without exception they have all been beyond friendly and helpful. Food choices are not bad and the facilities are generally clean. On the down side the gate I've mostly used Gate 15 is not great with only a few seats for a full plane load of passengers. In the general concourse too there are not enough seats unless you decide to use one of the restaurants or cafes. And you need a bus to get to the train station long term car parks and the car hire centre. But that can be expected at a lot of airports. Luton doesn't have the big airlines or traffic of the other London airports so I guess it hasn't had the same ability to develop top class facilities but it has always been a pleasant experience arriving or departing every time I've used it. I think some people leaving reviews should bear in mind that at Luton they're boarding airlines like Easyjet Ryanair and Wizzair. It's not the golden age of flying and we're not boarding Constellations to cross the Atlantic. This is Luton Airport with low cost airlines and they've done a great job each and every time I've gone through.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Back in 2004 Luton was ok nothing special but perfectly acceptable as a low-cost airport nowhere near the hellhole that has become now.

The airport appear to have fences along the roadsides on a two mile radius around the airport forcing you into a minimum Â£2 drop off area. If you want to park longer take out a mortgage and don't expect a car park - imagine pouring tarmac onto a ploughed field and you get a feel for where you will leave your car.

Coming back into the UK the EU passport line was very long and the non-EU very short.

In the past year there has been a distinct improvement in the politeness and care of the security search staff but you can still be bawled at or humiliated in front of other passengers. The amount of seating in the airport 'lounge' has been reduced (area taken over by Pret a Manger and other cafés). After boarding clearance has begun the holding areas are cramped and are often simply stark staircases. On return I have found the automatic passport gates (installed at enormous cost to the tax-payer) open just 7 times out of the hundreds (see above) of times I have travelled whilst staff actually manually checking passports are always too few while colleagues stand idly by.

In fact the airport carpark shuttle bus regularly just opens the doors and let's its passengers make the dash - I dread the wetter months coming. Once in the terminal it is quite quick - provided you take the £3 priority security option which although very quick compared to the alternative is just a wrong concept when taking into account you are only late because of the traffic congestion arriving at the terminal.

It certainly looked new and was quite impressive but possibly this was because I was on one of the first flights of the day. First appearances however were deceptive. Check in was a painless and efficient procedure but upstairs in departures there's no pre-gate seating apart from restaurants and we were politely told to leave the area (although only about 5% of the seating capacity was occupied!) unless we ordered. I'd expected the toilets to be hassle-free (unlike the town!) but even there I was asked for baksheesh and I'd provided my own paper!

Although there was no other plane at the airport instead of parking the VV ATR 72 by the gate they parked it over at the far side of the old terminal necessitating a long and completely unnecessary bus ride. Check in was quick and so was security. There was a small cafe after domestic security and nothing else. Oddly the signs pointing to domestic gates didn't match the number of the gate shown for our flight. Looking to the terminal from the front domestic gates are to right international in middle.

The cleaning machines were strangely comforting and while the airport doesn't have too many overnight dwellers it could do with a snack/coffee bar that is open all night. Everything else was fine it could just use either a lounge (I had heard of one but I think this was just airside) or some double layer entry points (to limit heat loss) or some heating just for the few months that Macau may need it. Perhaps the airport could work with some of the nearby hotels/casinos to accommodate transit passengers - that would make for a more memorable night than just freezing on an airport seat!

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Federico Muscogiuri,Spain,2014-10-28,Madrid Barajas is a complicated airport. For a start it would be more adequate to describe it as a tale of two airports. Terminals 1-2-3 are within walking distance to one another. Terminal 1 is mostly used by low cost airlines and has the ambience and charm of a bus station. It is also used by non-Schengen flights except those operated by Iberia and other Oneworld airlines. The non-Schengen section of the Terminal 1 is a bit quieter and modern. There is only one overpriced eaterie queues for check in and security are long but overall it does its job. Terminal 2 is pretty similar but is used by Lufthansa Swiss and Star Alliance airlines. Occasionally however I have caught the odd Easyjet/Ryanair flight from there. Terminal 3 is more modern and airy definitely the best of the bunch with Skyteam airlines mostly using it. Terminal 4 is located about 4 kms from the main three terminals and it is connected by a frequent and free shuttle bus (I don't understand some passengers' complaints about connection from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4). It is used by Iberia and Oneworld airlines as well as those airlines that have a code-share agreement with Iberia. It is architecturally impressive and compared to the other terminals feels relatively uncrowded however there are three things that really bother me about it 1) long walks from one gate to another 2) the fact that now you find it impossible to transit from one area to another without having to pass through some Duty Free and 3) any eating place is almost twice as expensive than in the city. Despite its shortcomings one thing that sets Barajas apart from other airports in Europe and the US is the public transport which is excellent from all Terminals. I live in Madrid and moan about Barajas but when I travel via CDG or FRA (not to mention US airports) then I realise that it's not bad after all.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

We found it very difficult to hear announcements made at the gates.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,T Hamilton,United Kingdom,2015-02-12,"First the good: security lines are generally shorter for frequent flyers which is a definite plus during holiday season when the airport can fill with not the most savvy travel set. The T3 Escape Lounge is adequate even nice given how busy and cramped that terminal is. Emirates Lounge Virgin Lounge are both excellent. Airport shopping is decidedly down-market which I think is pretty nice (how many Mont Blanc pens does one need?) Having both Boots and WH Smith available is great. There is a train station at the airport too which is great (it's a nice little station but it does get busy.) Since it goes directly to Manchester Piccadilly you can pretty much get anywhere (relatively) directly from MAN via train. For the most part service is good at MAN. Immigration officials have always been courteous and professional with me. Now the bad: 1. Even in the ""Fast Lanes"" security is very slow. If you are unfortunate enough to have your bag separated for extra screening the process is excruciatingly slow. This happens to me about one in three trips. Be early. For some reason Manchester uses lots of employees to board a plane the security questions no one in the world continues to ask are asked twice if you are on a direct to the US. I at one time thought this was a US thing but it isn't it's a Manchester thing (the same thing does not happen in London Paris or Amsterdam for instance.) 2. The airport layout is nonsensical. There is this weird airport wide prohibition of ANY luggage on the escalators. They put up quite elaborate gates to prevent you from using the escalators with say a roller board (you are instructed to use the lifts.) Everyone ignores this stupid prohibition which I have never seen anywhere else in the world (30 countries hundreds of airports.) It's weird. 3. Taxi pickup is unnecessarily burdensome for both passenger and driver. In Terminal 2 for instance savvy drivers will pull up to passenger drop off to pick you up. 4. Arriving in Manchester can be hit and miss. Sometimes it is great for non-EU passport travellers like me (they are separated from EU passengers regardless of residency.) Sometimes it is horrendous. The immigration officers are typically very nice however. Speaking of if you arrive in Terminal 3 and need to get to the train fast avoid the lifts that take you to the parking garage. Instead follow the path from Terminal three and when you just arrive at Terminal 1 take the two small elevators to ""Terminal One Departures."" Enter the departure hall and ignoring the bags on escalator prohibition take the small escalators and you will be in the sky bridge to the train station. You can easily save five minutes getting to the station which if you are late can mean the difference between getting and missing a train. Terminal One is by far the nicest terminal three is a bit shabby and two is crowded (and also shabby.) Because the boarding areas are so poorly designed (meaning without any effort to facilitate people actually boarding airplanes) this is one airport that being a frequent flyer is a real plus. Being in the NW and without another international option MAN is my home airport. If I get through it hassle-free that's the best I can expect. At least I can take comfort that upon arrival I am almost home. The train is a real plus too.

At terminal 3 today around 50% of the x-rayed bags in security were passed for hand screening and swabbing causing huge build-ups of frustrated passengers. Many airports recognize that people who've paid money to fly are not criminals per se but Manchester (terminal 3) likes to make everyone passing through get the feeling they are an unreasonable nuisance to mankind. At security the tray containing my jacket and laptop and the tray containing my cabin bag were both sent for manual screening. Incredibly the security chap solemnly looked me in the eye for the second time when it came to tray number two and asked exactly the same questions: did you pack this yourself? Could anyone have interfered? etc. Is it really impossible to add intelligence to security? Airside at Manchester terminal 3 every WHSmith and Boots outlet insists on production of a boarding card for all purchases. Many British airports ask if you object to showing your boarding pass and don't mind if you say 'yes' but Manchester won't sell you even a newspaper without your producing a boarding pass. This farce has gone on long enough. The food outlets don't ask you to show your boarding pass to make a purchase: why should Smiths and Boots?

She even suggested that my wife and I share a tray for the items which had to be sent through separately. Would we choose Manchester in future over Liverpool? Only if it was much cheaper.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,A Lane,United States,2012-12-08,Most recent experience at T3 (MAN-LHR) was alright except for the security procedures of 'randomly' selecting passengers for a body scan and a shoe inspection. There are two separate lines that are separated by a glass wall. The first line one surrenders one's items (hand luggage jackets computers etc.) as usual for the x-ray scan. Then if one is unlucky one is instructed to step to the side to another line with a turnstile that turns green when it's okay to proceed to the body scan. Very slow official will then have you surrender your shoes to be x-rayed! And worse as in my experience there are 3 other officials to check one passenger. All the while the queue is growing and growing with other 'randomly' selected passengers. Worse is that one can see while waiting in that long queue through the glass wall in the first line that one's hand luggage and other items have already been scanned and are just waiting in the tray idling. If they are going to search people make sure that they have not 4 officials to do so but one and to speed it up. Otherwise T3 is a bit strange as once all of the craziness of the security checks are over one walks down a very long corridor to meet up with the departures lounge that doubles as shopping/eating areas. I just cannot understand UK security practices these days. I had hoped that Manchester would have been better than Heathrow.

Too many flights departing within a few minutes of each other in such a small space would make the claustrophobic and agoraphobic go into seizures. Only one set of toilets servicing 12 gates of wide body jets mean snaking queues especially for the ladies' room (singular). The sea of humanity makes the air-conditioning practically non existent.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-08-07,I flew into terminal 1 on a Royal Brunei flight and was amazed at how quick immigration was. Transit bus to terminal 2 was ok if a bit infrequent. Domestic departures for terminal 2 is clean and modern if rather sparse. What disappointed me most was the fact one can't buy a beer once through security. However my worst ordeal was when I flew back to Indonesia from the Philippines. You need to pass through 2 checkpoints just to reach the check-in desks of terminal 1. When I got to Royal Brunei's check-in desks it was understaffed with unhelpful staff and it took 40 minutes for me to get served. I then had to pay for a departures tax which was absolutely ludicrous given this is a pathetic excuse for an airport. When I got through immigration half the facilities were out of service due to renovation and there wasn't even a money changer. This in particular annoyed me as you'd expect this in one of Asia's largest international airports. Furthermore I arrived just over 2 hours before departure which seems like plenty of time but by the time I got through there wasn't that long before boarding and had I arrived half an hour later I would have struggled to make my flight. Therefore you must arrive here at least 3 hours before departure to be safe. Overall this airport is in a sorry state and terminal 1 likely employs the same number of staff as it employed when it opened back in 1981 which makes it chaotic. Unless the Philippine Airport authorities get their act together they will deter both tourists and investors which will only adversely affect its economy. Other major hubs in Asia even much-criticised ones like Jakarta Soekarno- Hatta and Shanghai Pudong provide a much better experience and airports like Singapore Changi Hong Kong and Bangkok Suvarnabhumi really heap shame on Manila.

Shopping and eating choices inside is limited but I didn't expect to get airside that fast so I think it contributed to the sense of lack of activity airside. I allotted 45-60 minutes for landside activity and found myself airside so fast I didn't know how to bide the time. Ended up eating lunch at one of the restaurants.

My daughter inadvertently packed 2 safety scissors in her pencil case and was not detected on the two layers of security (upon entering the terminal and at the final security after immigration - unacceptable). Airside nothing to do unless you pay for the upstairs lounges. Limited and expensive food choices. On our return flight we had to queue for more than an hour to clear immigration and customs as our flight happened to have landed the same time as flights from the US (JAL DL) and Middle East (EK) did. Officials tried to rearrange the booths but did not do much good as the arrangement apparently created more chaos.

As many have stated it is just too old and too small to cope with the numbers of people trying to use it. Taxi had to queue to get up the ramp to drop me off at departures. I then had a 20 minute queue to get into the terminal building. I'd checked in online which meant that I used the fast bag drop which was ok but next queue was to be allowed into the immigration queue which was hundreds strong and took about 45 minutes.

There was hardly any lines at all less than 5 minutes. Staff at security and customs were courteous and welcoming. The ladies in the bathrooms ask discreetly for tips but since the bathrooms are sparkling clean I don't mind. There were many nice shops with fair prices if you need to purchase more items. We didn't care for the sweets that we purchased in the Moroccan Pastry shop but there are other places to buy food.

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-02-18,There are good points: the building is quite airy and there was adequate seating when we were there (though it could not have coped with many more passengers) there was a good choice of eating places mostly not the usual boring international fast food outlets. Getting to and from the centre took about 20 minutes by taxi at a reasonable price (we had pre-booked on arrival which I recommend if you can). However there is one huge downside which has coloured my experience - the absurd process of immigration and emigration. You fill in an immigration card on the flight and then queue to have it and your passport checked and stamped. In our case it took about 30 minutes just about acceptable. On leaving though you fill in another (identical) and form take it to your airline desk to be stamped if you only have hand luggage (as we did) you thus queue (15 minutes in our case) for a process that takes about 30 seconds. You then go to the embarkation area and queue again (5 minutes) to check that you have been to the airline desk. This allows you into the hallowed ground of the emigration area where you queue (about 40 minutes) to have the paperwork checked and a stamp in your passport. All over? Oh no there was another officer standing about 1 metre behind the desk you have just passed who randomly stopped people to check again (admittedly we were not stopped). So over an hour queuing to get a stamp to leave the country. Marrakech clearly needs and attracts many tourists and has much to offer if it wishes to continue increasing the number of visitors it has to find a more efficient way of processing them into and out of the country.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,Alasdair Brooks,NA,2009-09-30,Arrival and immigration is a bit on the old-fashioned side but effective. If travelling from the UK don't change money before arriving as the rate at the banks at Marrakech Airport are much more competitive than at Gatwick. You can probably find a slightly better rate in town but it's nice to have a few Dirham in your pocket before reaching the Medina. We had a minor problem with our boarding pass on leaving which we put down to the boarding passes being handwritten and the check-in desk staff forgetting to write down all the relevant details. Family who have just returned from an even more recent trip using the same airline report that they had ordinary printed boarding passes. It's possible that our problem was specific to that day or that new procedures have just been introduced. Airside is one of the older parts of the airport and looks a little tired. There can also be a mad scrum for the gates as (or just before) boarding is announced. The 'standard' duty free shops were slightly better than anticipated but food drink and reading material options are poor. Summed up renovations have helped improve the airport and the overall experience was positive with smooth straightforward multilingual service (though we speak French which doesn't hurt) in a relatively uncrowded environment.

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,M Ferguson,United Kingdom,2015-06-18,"Marseille itself is a wonderful, buzzing, cosmopolitan place, but this airport, or possibly just the Easyjet/Ryanair sector of it, lets it down. You enter into a general hall that includes a very nice café area, where you can wait for your flight check in to show. The use of computers and digital displays in this airport is almost non existent. When we noticed our Easyjet check in was open, it was via a wooden or stiff cardboard board above the Easyjet area. We had speedy bag drop which that weekend, might just not have existed (see my Gatwick review). There were two queues. We were second in the speedy queue but you'd not have known it. At least 5 people went though on the other queue before we were called forward. There were two check in desks but our attendant seemed to have a lot of admin before she could start the process. We eventually were called, showed our documents, the tags were put on our luggage. Then we were told to take our luggage through and to the right. This was via a crush barrier, not the sort that you see in the bigger airports but solid fixed steel like a cattle crush! We traversed this maze of a barrier, to arrive at another point where once again our credentials were checked/scanned and our luggage put on a conveyor. We then went into a general holding area, that had a news shop and coffee area, and quite nice seats. But the loos were upstairs. This next floor was obviously an overflow area as there were lots of seats and no one in them. Ladies, these loos were the worst I've been in even on campsites. There were three that I would not even go in. Clearly there is no regular check/cleaning. Gents were apparently good. Down in the general waiting area, we could see a doorway that appeared to lead to passport control and the gates, but signage was minimal. There was no digital departure board. There was a board that showed all current flights, but it didn't seem to be updated as an announcement for the first flight didn't result in any change on the board. Our flight was meant to be 11.20. At 10.40 we decided we'd best move closer to the gates/passport control. We found passport control, through another of the fixed barrier mazes. There were 4 booths, three of them manned.The two guys in the ones immediately facing , simply ignored us. I moved forward, the woman in the other booth told me to wait. There was a digital board facing them and clearly they were able to see flight information which we couldn't.As it was there was chaos at Gatwick, so our flight was delayed, but no-one told us. Eventually at 10.55 we were called forward, and I noticed one of the attendants from the check in desk carrying the Gatwick sign from the desk. She was setting it up at the gate as we approached. Speedy boarding, she said, to the left by the window. Given that one wall is a window, difficult to know where to stand. There was a door in the middle, and one at the far end. Eventually there was an announcement in French and English telling us to move down. It got to 11.15. The luggage was on the tarmac, as was the fuel, and two sets of steps. No plane. Said plane eventually arrived at 11.20 (for said 11.20 flight) There are no loos after passport control. (There is a warning notice) and no seating in the gate area. We were eventually boarded at about 11.55. Unfortunately the first step on front set to the plane was a little high for my arthritic knee, and no attendant there to help.

Having felt like him that MP2 was beginning to get its act in order I had a poor experience a couple of weeks ago. At a 'busy' time for the terminal (ie 2 flights departing closely together!) management of two different queues was non-existent - and unnecessary given that in fact my Ryanair flight (to STN) was about 40 minutes late into Marseille and so passengers should not have been called to the gate at all. Result - on going forward to the border police passport control STN passengers were asked to stand to one side to let the others through (I think they were going to Eindhoven). Those of you who know the area at MP2 that I am talking about will realise the unpleasant scrum that resulted (after which we STN passengers were still required to queue at the 'gate' (ie behind a locked door) for almost 45 minutes before boarding.

mauritius-airport,/airport-reviews/mauritius-airport,Mauritius Airport customer review,Martin Brown,NA,2005-08-18,Interesting airport. The runway is big enough to take a 747-400 or an A340 but the terminal only has 4 gates. I arrived on 6th August on business and my baggage arrived very quickly and for those who really need a smoke there is a dedicated smoking area in baggage reclaim. The arrivals exit is looks inviting with palm trees etc. The queues at immigration are long but then how many people have just come off of that 747? They try to deal with you as quickly as they can. I was at the back of the queues as was last of off aircraft and was through in 20 minutes. Leaving is a different matter. You go through security before checkin. Security stick a security label on to say they have checked and you can go out and come back if you need that smoke as once inside there is NO SMOKING at all what-so-ever. I was told if we opened the bag we would need to go through security again. My bags have many pockets and the label was only across one? You need to go through security again before going into the main terminal which really doesn't make sense. There are not many shops inside. You can get coffee and food but it isn't cheap. Duty free had the usual array of jewellery alcohol tabacco etc at some good prices and in Euro's as well as Rupee's. I did find on a trip to the toilet that most people went in there for a smoke. The attendant standing outside knows this but ignores it so if you really need a ciggy before the 12 hour or so flight there is an 'opportunity'. That said the terminal was clean and most staff are friendly. Immigration can be stroppy. I had to fill out all of the details on the immigration form again as the carbon copy came out faint.

However Melbourne Airport was surprisingly a gem of the airport. Arrival into Melbourne on a Qantas A330 at the same time an Emirates A380 came in from Dubai was expecting immigration to take an hour or so but I was happy to be done in under fifteen minutes. Bags at the belt immediately after immigration and despite a small mix-up at quarantine I was on my way by Skybus to Melbourne forty minutes or so after deplaning. My outbound flight from Australia was also at Melbourne Airport and getting through the airport was very much a breeze. Hardly anyone at the airport in the middle of the afternoon when I arrived. Barely any time wasted checking in for my Emirates flight and immigration was particularly smooth and hassle free.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,David Harrison,Australia,2013-08-07,I travel internationally every month so have reasonable perspective on service norms. Arrived flying J class on Air China on Fri 2nd Aug. An absolute disgrace that it took 2 hours to be processed. Got through the Smart Gate in a couple of minutes. But the queue for aliens was huge and the delay on processing those pax was a major source of my ultimate slow progress. Got to carousel 4 to find it full of Malaysian Airlines bags. But the pax were still back in the immigration queue not present to pull their bags. So the conveyor belt bringing new bags just stopped. I asked baggage services for a handler to come and either put the unclaimed bags on the floor or rearrange them on the belt to fit more on. Refused to do either citing work practice rules. There are employees pulling the bags down in the basement why not up on the carousel too? Finally the MY bags were cleared and about 10 J class bags from my flight. But then no more. Eventually Y class bags and finally most of the J bags. A 90 minute wait. I contacted baggage services 3 times during this period. Walkie-talkie calls to the baggage room below described chaos down there. Then got into customs queue. It was approx 400 meters long snaking along 3 walls of the baggage hall. Two yes two customs officers were at the exit causing the backlog. Why not 10 officers? All in all an absolute disgrace. On leaving the airport it crossed my mind that in fact Melbourne Airport is a private monopoly and earns its highest income from the car park.

The arrivals area is poor in several respects - charging for baggage carts is plain mean. The baggage claim area is woefully inadequate even for an Airbus A330 - there is simply not enough space on the carousel meaning that the bags queue up in the chute and are released one at a time as others are claimed. This leads to long delays in baggage recovery. Presumably bags from a fully loaded A380 or 747 take twice as long to recover. The customs area is also cramped and subject to long queues.

By the time passengers from our flight had collected their luggage there was a single queue that snaked twice around carousel 1 before feeding into the existing three lines of people who had been waiting when we arrived. As we waited patiently passenger from another flight collected their bags & joined the queues. It took until 2345 to reach a Customs Officer & be waved though after a quick check of our luggage. I don't blame Customs staff who were obviously doing their best with patience & good humour but seeing almost everyone being asked to open their cases I could understand the delays. I doubt whether too many people waiting to clear Customs that night would have any positive thoughts about Melbourne Airport or maybe Melbourne & Australia in general.

Singapore may be essentially a government-run airport but Melbourne is boring by comparison and it is about time that passengers were offered a small 'freebie' given the various airport charges that are included in the prices of most tickets. Of course it would be unfair to claim that Melbourne Airport is the only Australian airport to fall behind progressive transport hubs like Changi Airport. While Melbourne Airport's per-passenger processing fees are lower than most other Australian capital city airports it ought to give something back to passengers who contribute a huge daily amount in parking fees and indirectly in airport income by supporting overpriced shops that block one's way once airside in the international terminal as others have observed.

Flight arrived on time and after a long walk to the immigration hall the fun and games really began. We started queuing for passport control in the non-US citizen line about 9pm. There were so many people ahead of us and so few immigration staff that it took 1.5 hrs to be seen by an immigration officer. While I was waiting in the public area of the arrivals hall I witnessed other people who had also been detained for intrusive / abusive questioning. The attitude of US border officials is nothing short of disgusting. While we had a pleasant stay in Miami we will never go back to the USA and risk experiencing this type of treatment again. A terrible ordeal and their whole attitude seems to be that you are a threat and are guilty until proven innocent and that they are doing you a special favour by letting you in to spend money and have a holiday in their country.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Miami Intl makes transiting in Frankfurt a marvellous experience. We had almost 3 hours for our connecting flight but made it to our connecting BA flight to London only because we were travelling First and BA kept our seats. Staff at Miami appear to be trained to be rude and unhelpful to passengers. We asked a female staff if we could go in front of the massive queue as we were just about to miss our flight and she said if we miss our flight we just miss it. After immigration one has to endure the other queue to get through customs which is another awful experience. There were more than 1000 arriving passengers and only two members of staff dealing with the queue. We waited an eternity for our bags at carrousel 8 where it was announced they will be delivered. However they were delivered at 6 and we were not told of the changes. Staff just do not care about passengers.

The problems started when we were instructed by an extremely rude airport official to form two lines (left hand side for US citizens and right hand side for everyone else). However on entering the immigration area all the US citizen booths were on the right and everyone else on the left causing chaos and confusion. We waited over an hour in a line which did not seem to move . At this point we were thinking that a 3 hour transit would not be sufficient. Worrying that we may miss our transit into Lima my wife asked the same rude official if there was a separate line for transit passengers. Once again he was rude and unhelpful and said we should wait in the same line or find one that was shorter as there wasn't a separate line! After waiting another half an hour we found a helpful lady who directed us towards a transit booth.

Upon arrival from France we headed off for a long walk to the customs and immigration area of the airport. However once we arrived we were held at the bottom of a staircase while they got their staff ready for us. Once inside things moved quite quickly though I've never been asked so many random questions by immigration. (Nor have I ever run into such unfriendly immigration agents.) Instructions for where to go and what to do with your bags for continuing flights was totally lacking. Fortunately a TSA agent walked by as we were being given instructions and he told us to just follow him. (Following the blue line in the floor was fine expect that you had to drop your bags off to be x-rayed about mid-way on the blue line.)

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,E Williams,NA,2009-05-05,MIA is not a passenger-friendly airport. I usually fly in and out of MIA on domestic flights - only if I cannot avoid it. Do not consider flying into this airport unless you can handle the minimum 15-20 minute hike from the security screening area to your gate. The later your flight arrives or departs at MIA the further your gate will be from the exit to the terminal. If you have the misfortune of arriving before 7am or after 10pm the stores will be closed the fast food and sit-down restaurants are all closed and you will walk past seemingly miles of empty gates to get to the terminal or your gate. There are no moving sidewalks in the concourse areas so be prepared to hike. If you are disabled by all means try to avoid this airport at all costs. The newer terminals are pleasant to look at but uncomfortable to navigate to. MIA is a rabbit's warren of zig-zagging white wallboard mazes with poor signage and a lack of decent food service or practical traveler shops. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the airport terminal or concourse layout and you usually must exit one concourse and recheck through security to get to another. Even if you are headed in the right direction you will need good walking shoes. MIA is laid out for the administrators security and airlines benefit - not the passengers. The taxi cab drivers are rude if you don't have too far to go from the airport and parking at the Economy Park and Ride is an adventure unto itself with a lack of passenger clearly marked pickup/drop-off areas. Good luck finding your way around this airport. With all the money that has been spent the only improvements I've been able to discern have been cosmetic. It is still the worst airport in terms of passenger experience I have ever used and continues to frustrate me both as a passenger and resident of Miami.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It is a fairly basic airport and the architecture is pretty unimpressive. However it is one of the most efficient airports I know. Luggage is normally delivered within 15 minutes from arrival and one can be in the centre of Milan in 15/20 minutes provided there is no traffic. I also like the fact that the parking area is next to the terminal and one can be in the check-in counter minutes after parking. Its downside is the lack of amenities the cramped spaces and the fact that on international flights you are whisked to the plane in a bus which is too small and always packed.

Queues for luggage drop were huge. Luckily (as a result?) the queue for security was short. Funny thing is the maze you need to go through to reach security - they do not allow shortcuts even when there is no queue. The departure lounge is just terrible. Downstairs you feel like sitting in a basement upstairs is slightly better. There is a huge shortage of seating there are plenty of shops but only limited catering.

Despite the airport being less than 10 years old it is already showing a tired interior - dingy terminals chaos at the security checks between the terminals and the bussing to the majority of the aircraft is a disgrace. I along with many others do not understand why the Italian gov't selected such a poor architectural design for this airport... They want to develop this airport further as an important hub but how can they if they didn't build enough gates??? It's not appealling and in the hot summer months the bus services are unbearable. Airport personnel are also lacking in manners and do not know what organisation is....they show up late at the gates ignore passengers seeking information etc. etc. The list goes on and on. With regards to shops and catering - it's alright though very overpriced. And the lack of seating is a disgrace too.

moscow-domodedovo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-domodedovo-airport,Moscow Domodedovo Airport customer review,Nick Fortuna,NA,2007-07-18,I used Domodedovo on a couple of occasions in June. The airport train from Paveletsky Station was badly signposted. There are four halls to choose from - by trial and error (welcome to Russia). It is located in Hall 3. The ticket counter to the Airport was closed because the power went out (welcome to Russia). The 'Help' Desk wasn't able to help. Power came back on ticket was sold. The train is the old rattly variety departing every 40 min. No airconditioning. Then again I can only compare with Vienna and HK. If you use the city check-in you're on the train for free. Airport itself was busy being holiday and charter season. Austrian's check-in went smoothly. Since we were Senator members we got to use the VIP passport control and security. A new whole-body scanner was in use though it broke down and we had to wait ca. 10 minutes for it to reboot. So much for VIP service. Airport facilities are excellent - lots of shops and a whole food court upstairs. Sheremetyevo take note! Arrival too was a breeze. Toilets were clean stocked and functional a welcome worthy of the name. Immigration was the usual Russian mess with no clear line(s) but push your way to the front and feign ignorance. Baggage arrived quickly enough and after the customs gauntlet you run the taxi mafia gauntlet (though not as bad as Sheremetyevo. Due to the reconstruction getting out of the arrivals hall to the car park was badly signposted. Some inconvenience but temporary hopefully. In all a positive airport experience on a global scale.

Airport staff is the same as many years ago nothing is changing. Taxi service is like in the 3rd world. They should have established a normal taxi service outside the door. The major problem of Sheremetyevo is transportation. From 5 passenger terminals and 1 cargo the road to Moscow is going though a 1-line overpass which is linking to a 3 line bridge of the one of the most busiest highways to St Petersburg so in most cases people are spending a long time just to leave the airport. This is outrageous. I've not seen it elsewhere in the world so that 6 terminals would be serviced by 1-line overpass.

I've been to what I believe are all of their major terminals (B D F E) with the exception of C. On a flight JFK-Paris via Moscow the transfer was seamless. We ended up arriving about an hour later than expected with just over an hour left for the transfer. There were no line-ups anywhere and as we'd already received the boarding pass at the Aeroflot desk at JFK we were directed straight to our gate with a quick passport check). The staff were polite and gave us clear directions. D and E are the recently constructed terminals - clean modern and open with clear signage and info screens. That might seem obvious but many airports that I've been to lack these basic necessities. B and F are the old soviet-era terminals that have recently been refurbished. They are pretty good and a clear logical layout. The number of stores is a little limited. There are some good Russian fast food stand there though (like Kroshka- Kartoshka which sells baked potatoes). Unfortunately most of the eateries in all terminals are quite expensive but if you take a minute to look around terminals have budget cafes (like the Kroshka Kartoshka). Customer service has improved by a lot and staff polite and for the most part will try to help you. Aeroexpress takes you to Moscow city centre and easy to locate from terminals F C and D (a walkway connects the train station with the terminals). There is also a shuttle from the other terminals that takes you to the aeroexpress train station. I'd highly recommend the train over taxi or other options.

On arrival from Tokyo Narita the plane was not parked at a gate. As we left the plane I saw someone waiting with a board with my name on it and I was ushered into a car. We drove in silence around the airport arrived at some unmarked gates and I was led into a hotel lounge and told to sit down and relax. There was a bar and food was also available. An immigration officer requested my passport and later came over and returned it to me. My luggage tag was requested and eventually luggage appeared. Friends who were meeting me appeared and we drove into Moscow. This lounge was full of people and I was told that there were four such VIP lounges in the airport. The return trip was equally surreal. Mercedes is the preferred transportation vehicle and we duly arrived at the double doors. This time there was a short walk to the hotel lounge. My e-ticket was somewhere in my luggage but it was never requested. I was told that with this way of passing through the airport one did not need a ticket. A little while later another vehicle took me to the gate. A stern official gave me my boarding pass and wished me a good flight - and I found that had been upgraded.

Road to the terminal is well maintained and elevated with 4 entrances for the security checks to get into the terminal.

Bus transfer to domestic airport smooth but beware of fake porters begging for money at bus. Check-in at Jetlite smooth domestic airport clean and modern.

Flew out of BOM to BKK 2 weeks ago; check in acceptable security not with changing rules as we queued - ladies separate - or not. Transferring from BKK to LHR on return a nightmare - long queues for pointless hand baggage security and frisk - no order whatever - queues redirected then abandoned. Further checks at the gate - was hand luggage stamped? Three separate security checks at the gate. Boarding by row number started then abandoned -completely pointless rude and tedious security queuing which missed -we realised later - items in hand luggage they should have picked up.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Karl Moosbrugger,Austria,2013-04-14,I regularly travel via BOM. The domestic terminal is pleasant easy to use and convenient. Usually no queues except during rush hour. The international terminal has improved quite a lot on the inside with lots of shopping and eating facilities. However access has not. There was an insanely long queue just to get inside the terminal. I guess what people don't know is that you can use any of the doors. Most people queued at the entrance next to their airline apparently for hours just to get by security who checks every passport and boarding pass at snail's pace. I usually ask to be dropped at the very first door where there is hardly anyone. Once inside it was OK.

I was aware of Mumbai's fearful reputation and was apprehensive about have to transit through it. However I was pleasantly surprised. No queue at immigration bags turned up fairly quickly and customs wasn't a problem though bags are screened incredibly often. Our transfer to the domestic terminal was quite smooth as well though the bus does go on a tour of the airport facility. The domestic terminal was remarkably clean and facilities were fine given that it was early hours of the morning. We had to change some sterling to INRs but that too went okay and we had no trouble with the exchange desk. Our only problem came at security in the domestic terminal where my husband's bag was retained. He was carrying our personal camera equipment and his diabetic medication. Our cameras were removed and the bag re-scanned. The security officer came over with the bag asked if he used insulin and immediately stamped the bag as cleared. We had to wait around 2 hours for our connection to Bangalore but again this wasn't a major issue.

The flight was scheduled for 4am which reflects the lack of queues but airport was clean retail areas were spacious and there were fantastic recliner seating areas at each boarding gate and coffee shops nearby. The duty free area seemed similar to that at Dubai Terminal 3 and it seems the airport are trying to improve their image. I also liked that there were highly visible emergency defibrillators located at regular intervals throughout the airport. Other airports would do well to follow suit. Staff were lively polite and helpful. Have to mention one of the police/security guys at the front of the airport who went out in the monsoon rain to fetch our dimwit of a cab driver who had got lost (don't ask me how a taxi driver gets lost at an airport complex...). Really did appreciate that personal touch and not something that I would expect in Europe/US regions.

Especially if you're flying with Omanair, they have a specific area just for that airline with many counters open for it. The only thing is, I just absolutely am disgusted with some of the staff where they would constantly question whether I need a visa to UAE with my passport and then question me back on ""are you sure?"" and ""really?"". 2 weeks ago, the guy at the check in counter said ""how do you know you don't need visa? When was the last time you were at UAE?"" (if he had properly check my passport that he was holding, he would have noticed that I have at least 10 UAE stamps in my passport, one which was dated 2 weeks before that). 2) Not many shops to be honest. Not the sort of airport you want to be at for more than 3 hours. 3) Did not like the other gate for low costs airlines such as Rotana or flydubai. That place is packed and crowded and super unorganised. I have honestly paid more to fly with Omanair just to avoid boarding through that gate. 4) Arrival at the airport is ok at times. Sometimes its super crowded, sometimes it's excellent. The immigration counter could do with some more counters during the busy time cause I remember when it took over an hour just for the queue. 5) Taxi from the airport to your destination is absolutely expensive. Where I am staying at, is only 10 minutes drive, yet it costs OMR8 (and same price to where another place that is 30 minutes is). 6) When the airport is full, it really is full. The cars are unorganised and everyone looked lost.

Signage over visas could be clearer once inside the terminal (to better distinguish between the pre-arranged and visa on arrival queues) but immigration is largely quick and easy compared to most international airports once you sort out which visa queue you need to be in. My suitcase was off the carousel at baggage claim before I'd even finished my duty free shopping. While small the duty free shop at arrivals does have some unusual alcohol options (such as Jordanian arak) that make it worth a visit. There are some taxi touts at the exit but they're easily ignored. So no it's not the most modern or largest capital city airport in the world (or even the region) but given that Muscat is hardly the busiest of airports it's entirely functional.

The two main problems are having to queue outside to get past the first security check and having to queue twice more for a long check-in and two more security scans at the gate. It really needs a layout change - so you can be scanned just once on entering the secure passenger only area. Duty free shops well they sell the same as elsewhere in the world just without hi power arc lighting and glossy shelves.

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,O Bennett,NA,2009-11-20,Arrived at NBO on night of 1 November to depart for London only to find the airport in semi- darkness. It took 90 minutes to dispose of my bag having already checked in on-line and queuing for the business class counter. Next to this line was one headed 'Fast Bag Drop' which was pretty ironic since that queue was barely moving at all. Just as I handed my passport at the immigration desk all the lights went out and this supposedly the leading airport in East Africa was plunged into complete darkness. Once the lights partially came on again I tried to proceed to the BA lounge only to find the stairs leading to it in such darkness that it was impossible to see anything at all. So went to the gate to sit on the floor like so many given the limited seating. On returning to NBO on 14 November I was interested to see that - as others have said - the immigration queue for those without visas proceeded faster than for those holding visas. But it didn't matter given the wait for luggage that was going - slowly - through a single xray machine with a resultant long delay even for baggage labelled 'priority'.

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,J Moore,NA,2009-09-14,It is interesting reading the comments of passengers passing through Jomo Kennatta airport the most talked of item is the lack of seating which is true the story I heard was that the chairs were removed after the attack on Nairobi with bombs so all the chairs were removed so that nothing could be left there. I have been visiting Kenya since 1970 and in that time the only thing that has vastly improved at both Nairobi and Mombasa airports is the toilets they were for years truly a no go area at times needing far more than flip flops to even approach but now someone has really sorted that problem out and I have found the loos' to be better than most of the public ones in the UK and I would like to congratulate them on that also the shops are very modern but seats would be better appreciated. The airport is supposed to be being upgraded with another floor being added but this seems to be taking a long time. The best tip I would give to anyone who knows they will need to spend more than 3 hours at JK is to sign up for priority pass this will give you access to the lounges at airports across the world including Kenya where you will have at least a comfortable place to sit and drinks and food are included so when you think how much you can fork out for food and drink at an airport this doesn't seem like an extravagant option. Lounges in 'modern' countries are of a high standard with food to match but places like Kenya are not quite on a par sandwiches being the most common item for eats but they usually have at least one pc with internet connection and toilets with no queues and you can come and go as you please.

Arriving with Thomsonfly on 6th June from Manchester we were met by a Thomson representative. We were then expected to walk dragging our suitcases along a footpath for about 500 meters to brick wall surrounded coach park. The temperature was hot and many people having to do this walk were elderly. On arrival in the ""so called"" tourist coach park there was 4 ""portaloos"" lined up against a wall and these were supposedly for the use of the arriving passengers approximately 200 on our flight and other flights also. This is the worst airport I have experienced and talking to fellow passengers they expressed a similar opinion. I enquired to our representative as to why this was allowed to continue and I was told that it was totally out of their control. Surely Thomsonfly as a paying airline arriving in Naples could insist on better treatment of its passengers. One think for sure I will never fly to Naples again.

I would not like to have seen the busy baggage claim busier. There was also some pretty insane crowding towards a single exit from the terminal building itself - not strictly necessary as there were other exits available such as the one to which we followed our driver. Departing NAP 22 April I experienced a swift check-in open early and was offered (didn't have to request) an exit row. Airside the departure lounge was light and airy with an excellent cafe/lounge which has a great view.

Another officer did come to help the one on her own but all too late and it looked very inefficient indeed it was also unsafe and I saw a large bottle of water go through on someone's hand baggage that went unchallenged. Signage was also inaccurate telling you to remove your shoes and belt but nothing about wallets pockets etc therefore time was wasted in operatives repeatedly having to get customers to rectify their mistakes they were also rude and overbearing in their manner.

Time and time again I am confronted by the most unpleasant passport control officials. No greeting, no eye contact, no thank you. Absolutely appalling and yes I do travel to the USA! Yesterday this was compounded by being faced with, what appeared to disembarking passengers, as one lane. Halfway down we accosted woman ordering British passport holders to move into another lane. There wasn't one, so people unclipped the tapes and we all clambered over - total chaos. When it was pointed out by a number of passengers that all other lanes had appeared to be taped off she was very rude and dismissive. Some good Geordie humour from some passengers helped the situation. People returning from holiday may look like easy pickings, but a lot of us, yes even the over 50s, hold down responsible jobs and all passengers deserve respect.",Arrival Only,16-06-2015,Couple Leisure,1,2,2,1,NA,0,0,0,NA,0

The cafe's that used to be in the airport have been replaced by a large barn type bar little seating few staff and clearly booze orientated.

During my last visit (26 Oct 2012) I was subject to a new rip off they have devised. They advertise parking deals which have to be purchased in advance so I asked to buy the 6 month deal for the advertised tariff of 340 euros. The guy took my money wrote out my receipt and prepared a little plastic 'credit card' for me to use for entry and exit. When I asked why my expiry date was shown as '31st March 2013' he explained that all parking contracts have to start on the first day of the month so despite the date of purchase being 26th Oct my pass had to start on 1st October. Furthermore there was an additional 20 euro fee to issue the card! My other memory of Nimes is the airport restaurant. Service there was so sloppy and slow that despite having nearly two hours available it was never possible to eat all of your rather poor quality overpriced 3 course meal without missing your flight. Other gripes - The little newspaper / book shop closed in 2010 and has only recently reopened I would say in summary that I only use Nimes Airport if I have to.

Yes it retains a slightly Soviet bearaucracy but that is to be expected but generally it runs ok. The duty free and cafe airside are ok but limited. The introduction of new airport transit buses has modernised things but the older truck and trailer is still around for added character. A resurfacing and lengthening of the runway is in progress so gradually all things will improve. Immigration is ok if you follow the rules and accept that it will take time. Luggage appears fairly quickly but the traveller must expect to have all incoming baggage checked and even X-rayed. The key to travel is correct paperwork relax don't expect slick service learn some local language and don't get stroppy when everything appears to stop. Remember the staff have the control and can may your life a misery if you give them cause. Also don't be overwhelmed with the onslaught from the rabid taxi touts as soon as you exit into the public area. Please remember that easy travel into and out of Ukraine is a recent thing and attitudes take time to change.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,G McGowan,United States,2010-08-26,Orlando International is very similar in layout to Tampa in that it has a landside terminal with several airsides that are connected by overhead trams with one exception: whereas in Tampa security is on the airside after exiting the trams in Orlando it is landside before boarding. Still open lines were ample and even color coded for beginners intermediates and experts. I was in the expert line and cleared security in under 10 minutes. The main terminal is stocked with shops restaurants and even a Hyatt hotel. On the airside there was a Burger King Nathan's Hot Dogs Outback Steakhouse Starbucks a deli and a couple of snack bars however there was not adequate seating at the restaurants themselves. There are coffee tables and chairs in the center atrium of the airside however they are all bolted to the floor. So if you plan to eat before you fly I would advise arriving at the airport early enough to check out the dining options pre-security. I noticed restrooms were inadequate particularly when multiple flights were arriving and they were rather dirty. When arriving at MCO remember that baggage claim is on level 2 and ground transportation (rental car & Disney shuttles and taxis) are on level 1. Long term parking at the airport can be paid by Sunpass however it is expensive. There is ample off-airport parking nearby for as little as $4-5 a day so shop around.

I was also ripped off for excess baggage of 1 Kg ie 27 USD. I had weighed both bags on my scales which read 19kg before leaving for the airport. Are these scales not certified by weights and measures. What was even more annoying was some of the bags being checked in at the other check in were weighing sometimes 22kg and they were not being charged anything.

Now for the down fall the return journey checked in at Sanford just fine but then asked where we could get something to eat before going through to departures only to be told there was nothing until your in the departure hall. Once in the departure hall all we found there was this tiny food court selling sandwiches burgers hot dogs and chicken curry. We settled for burger fries and a soft drink each and were expecting to pay between $10 and $15 for the food but when the cashier asked for almost $33 we were a little dumb struck. As for the rest of the departure hall if your not in to buying duty-free or over priced newspapers there is not a lot else to do. So as a word of warning to any future traveler If you have to travel through Sanford-Orlando Airport then take your own food and drink in with you but if you can use Orlando International Airport and avoid Sanford-Orlando all together you will have a better experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I found the airport to be clean efficient and easy to use. I had to go through Canadian immigration before going through US immigration in Canada (it's fairly standard of course to have US immigration desks in major Canadian airports). In both cases processing was quick and easy - the fastest US immigration queue I've ever had at any airport and certainly much much faster than I would have faced at Washington Dulles! I do wish that the food options were a little better airside for travellers to the US but they were functional. I did find the language politics in the airport entertaining but then I've lived in Brussels and have past experience of capital cities that try to balance two languages; an ability to speak French might help if you're addressed in that language first (which happened to me a couple of times) but I doubt monoglot English speakers would have a real problem.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

On arrival at Majorca's airport (around 1am) from Gatwick the entire plane's luggage was nowhere to be seen for an hour and a half. When the bags did start coming round it still was very slow. During this time another flight arrived (from outside the UK) and miraculously they all had their luggage within 20 minutes. On our return we were checking in with a member of staff who was clearly incompetent. We were waiting for over an hour to do this and we were halfway down the queue who knows how long the people at the back took. At one point this member of staff threatened to walk off picking up her handbag and gesturing. Why this happened no one could understand. Upon getting onto the plane (straight from check-in due to the massive delays) there was no air- conditioning for half an hour. It became very hot and everyone had sweat dripping down their foreheads we complained to the cabin crew who promptly informed us this was due to Palma airport's engineering department since the ground power unit (or something like that) was out of action.

Had already waited 45 minutes in line - Got hold of Thomson rep. and suggested as the next check in hand a smallish queue and two check in desks that she moved our queue over. She would not allow that. We were then sent over to the other side of the check in hall and made to join the end of a queue so people on later flights were checked in before us I got very cross and had a few harsh words with the Thomsons rep who would not allow us to go in front. We were the last to be checked in and therefore my husband and I could not sit together. This process had taken one hour and 20 minutes rushed upstairs to the queue for the security got through that joined to queue for passport check eventually got to the gate - no time to get a drink and no time to visit the toilet plane was boarding.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2010-10-10,"It's ironic that my last posting on PMI should have referred to wheelchair passengers because on this latest transit my wife had temporarily joined their ranks. The PMI pages on the AENA website were a useful guide to what type of assistance we could expect but when we actually landed at Palma my wife needed to stretch her legs after 2 hours of sitting and so we walked slowly from the gate instead of waiting for one of the 7 wheelchairs which would have been needed for our particular flight. For our return journey we did use the PRM facilities which didn't work quite as smoothly as those at LPL. None of the special call points around the airport seemed to be operative so we had to report to the information desk in the centre of the check-in area for assistance to be summoned. We then had a wait of perhaps 15 minutes before assistance arrived a form was filled in (with copy attached to the wheelchair) and we were then taken to the special security area for PRM passengers. There appeared to be a relay system after security but we were allowed to make our own way to the gate rather than wait for the next available ""pusher"". And yes we did have the gate number long before it appeared on the screens for everyone else. A delay to our flight resulted in a Belfast flight being allocated to our gate and more wheelchair handlers arrived ready to assist PRM passengers onto that flight so we quickly had to explain that we weren't going to Belfast! One of the handlers was good enough to ring through to ask for the new gate for the LPL flight and even to wheel my wife to it. When eventually our flight was called PRM passengers were the first to board with more handlers to wheel them along the airbridge to the door of the plane. Unfortunately my wife's ""pusher"" talked loudly on his mobile phone most of the time leaving only one hand free to steer the chair and failing to avoid the bumps! The only time when he came off his mobile phone was when he saw an associate some 20 yards away down the airbridge and had a shouted conversation with him. My wife was glad to board the plane! So though PMI has a clearly defined system for PRM passengers its operation was not as smooth or efficient as we had hoped though no one was actually unhelpful. We didn't see any of the motorised buggies which used to transport PRM passengers so efficiently in the past but perhaps they are reserved for passengers being taken to the more distant gates as on this occasion we flew into and out of area A. As for PMI itself it was less busy than we've seen it on some occasions and there were few queues....but then we bypassed the main security area.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It was pretty quiet when we arrived on a Saturday morning after a long taxi round to area D though there was a queue at passport control as 2 flights ex-UK arrived almost simultaneously. Departing on a Tuesday morning though was positively eerie: the place was almost deserted and at security there were just 4 staff and 2 of us! I've never seen an airport so quiet. Yet even with only 3 flights departing during our 2 hours there we still had to wait a while before our gate number appeared on the screens. I can't understand the reluctance of airports to announce the designated gate well in advance because the staff who take wheelchair passengers to their departure points always seem to know which gate long before the number is displayed on the screens. Despite checking in online I even had to go to an easyJet desk (also deserted apart from the staff) simply to find out which area (D again) to head for after security.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-11-05,Surprised to find how busy Palma was midweek halfway through October (not even UK half term week). Both inward and outward flights involved bus transfers from/to remotish stands and through area A which was fairly crowded. We were told on our return flight that one runway was closed so perhaps all flights were concentrated to just part of the airport. The result was shorter walks but busier concourses. Perfunctory passport control on arrival long queues at security on departure though the queues did move reasonably quickly. Even so some people had to queue-jump presumably to avoid missing their flights. Also there were lots of flight calls for named passengers who had failed to board on time.

Easyjet flights seem to be using area C again after being in area A for a while so it meant we were back to the extra long cross-airport hikes. No delays at passports in either direction and quite swiftly through security on the return journey. We didn't have to take our watches off this time but there were notices advising that certain types of footwear would have to be removed e.g. ladies full length boots. The only minor hiccup was that our return flight to Liverpool seemed to be omitted from some of the screens which could have been difficult for passengers who had checked in online.

Everything seems to work well but there could be more lifts because access from car parking/car hire collection or return to check-in usually involves going up or down one floor with a laden trolley. Transfer of less mobile passengers is usually efficient but on our return journey from Palma to Liverpool yesterday the two elderly and less mobile members of our party were deposited at the wrong location and I had to start searching for them! Luckily I found them fairly quickly but it could have been a real problem. Security is thorough and slow moving: even wrist watches have to be removed. Passport control en route to departure gates was also slow yesterday: two queues 50 yards or more in length gradually combining into one with just one man to inspect the passports.

There were a number of facilities and the outside seating area is very pleasant and would be much more so if all the smokers were removed. It seems to me that the number of transfer buses is inadequate so that when the Thomson peak gets going it is hardly possible for them to the load the outbounds and unload the inbounds very effectively. New building is under construction and I am sure it will be much better but Cyprus is so beautiful it is already worth going.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

As soon as we left the plane we were stopped by policemen who carefully checked everyone's documents whilst being incredibly rude. Then I had to run from Terminal 2E (gates L) to Terminal 2F in 25 minutes. I couldn't make it. Poor signalling lead to me taking the wrong queues twice. Security checkpoints for connecting flights were disorganized and slow. I had my bag trapped in a long luggage-queue at the X-ray almost for 10 minutes.

When we finally found the auto-check in machines they seemed to be very unreliable frequently freezing. Progress after Check In was similarly chaotic with further long queues for Baggage Drop off. Altogether took more than 2 hours from arrival at the airport to arrival at Security and having left Paris more than 4 hours before the flight (advice of Airport Shuttle service) we had 5 minutes at the Gate (altered at last minute) before we were directed by surly and unhelpful AF staff on to the bus that took us to the plane.

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,A Snelling,United States,2013-08-04,I travel frequently in Europe and I absolutely avoid changing planes at CDG due to the messes described by the other reviewers here. Those comments are absolutely true. This time I was vacationing in France so I figured that just arriving and departing from CDG could not be that bad right? Wrong. Arriving at Terminal 1 proved to be an absolute disaster. The facilities are operating at a multiple of their capacities with too few restrooms for example. The baggage area was clearly too small for even one or two arriving planes; people crowding around while waiting for their luggage created a jam where no one could get in or out or around. There was just not enough square footage for everyone and it is probably a dangerous situation. Even getting through the final customs check to embrace your loved ones was a crowded bottleneck involving a pushing/shoving battle just to somehow get through the maddening crowd. The parking and layout of the rest of the airport is confusing and illogical but we figured it out. Departing from Terminal 1 is even worse. Check in is okay but once you go through the first boarding pass check (ticketed passengers only) you take the escalator upstairs to see the real problem. You will stand in line for a minimum of one hour to get through the passport control. There were only two windows open for all departing passengers and those two officials took their time! I was up there two hours before my departure time and I nearly missed the plane. I have never just walked on a plane and had them shut the door but this is what happened. Everyone was in the same boat. The boarding announcements started while we were still in this non-moving line and everyone got very nervous. To run to the gate while they make the final boarding announcement and then realize you still need to go through security. It is all very unsettling. I would advise anyone who is using Terminal 1 to be upstairs three hours before your departure time. Perhaps this way you will be able to have a coffee before your flight but that is doubtful based on how things run upstairs.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I arrived at Terminal 2 G and signs were in English and there was an internal bus to 2E (typical international departures). Transfer was quick and good with the yellow line and since I am frequent flyer I went to the lounge which had good hot and cold food all kinds of beverages and international magazines. Big enough and staff speak English friendly and helpful. That was not typical in the past. Just got back yesterday and arrived 2E and had to transfer to 2G.

We had our questions answered about what to do and where to go to check in as the signage is not very clear. Once we checked our bags made it through security and found our gate it was all fine. Orly is not a modern airport and definitely has a 1970's feel about it but the bottom line was that it worked for us.

Our flight landed on time into CDG but apparently due to a few inches of snow everything at the airport was already backed up or not operating. We were warned before exiting the aircraft luggage handlers were very slow. With 4 hours before our connecting flight was scheduled to leave I mistakenly thought this would be plenty of time for our bags to reach the next flight. The connecting flight was inevitably delayed. The gate on our connecting flight was then moved to another terminal. We had to exit the terminal we were in and go through another security line in the re-assigned terminal with hundreds of other passengers. By late afternoon there was little food left at any of the terminal kiosks. 3 days later there is still no record of my bags ever being scanned by luggage handlers at CDG.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

paris-orly-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-orly-airport,Paris Orly Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,NA,2010-01-30,"I often use ""Orly-Ouest"" terminal for French domestic flights and my experience is quite mixed depending on which boarding halls I use. Hall 1 is mainly used for medium-sized destinations (with turboprop and Fokker aircraft) and is my preferred one - security checks are usually quick boarding area is bright with sufficient seating areas. Hall 2 is dedicated to LaNavette shuttle flights to Bordeaux Toulouse Marseille and Nice - at peak hours waiting time at security can be very long and the boarding area is cramped. Furthermore as LaNavette flights run every hour or even every 30 minutes it can become confusing and difficult to locate the right boarding gate! Hall 3 uses only departure gate 30 for domestic flights - no need to rush through security as tha gate has only toilets and no other facilities. Hall 4 is used rather for tourist destinations with larger aircraft (A320/A321 to Biarritz Toulon and Corsica) - the boarding area gets crowded rather rapidly and the small bar has rip-off prices. ORY is much closer to downtown Paris than CDG but is unfortunately missing a fast and reliable train connection. Avoid the Air France coaches and the OrlyVal train which charge rip-off prices - around €10 one-way. The OrlyBus shuttle is cheaper but is always overcrowded. My preferred alternative is to use the RER C suburb train: first catch a shuttle bus from the airport to the train station ""Pont de Rungis - Aeroport Orly""; from there a RER train run every 15-30 minutes to downtown Paris. The whole trip costs €680 one-way and lasts around 45 mins.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Once airside there is plentiful seating and I found the ambience quite peaceful. I do agree though that the signage could be better some gates are underneath the main area and it is not clear until you are close to the escalator.

paris-orly-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-orly-airport,Paris Orly Airport customer review,Dave Jaros,NA,2007-03-24,Used this airport for first time - arrival on South Terminal the very end next to reconstruction site (Hall G). This is pretty old fashion airport so do not expect jetways fontains or wifi hotspots but fairly enough for easy transport means and connections. Swift immigration no checked baggage so headed for the Orlyval train in 10 mins after landing. The only point is one (!) counter for train tickets - fairly too few to manage todays traffic at the peak times (there are another two ticket machines accepting banknotes or credit cards as well). Departing on Thursday mid-evening easy navigation to the check-in though you have to slalom between some queues sometimes. Two counters for an 737 flight just okay staff friendly and working fast. Reaching the departure hall is a matter of walking steps up and down (due to the reconstruction) first you can reach understaffed passport control (3 out of 8 counters open) security just before the respective hall (was forced to remove my belt on the other side nobody cared the liquids in my x-rayed bag). This may be a stuck point so beware you slower movers and take some 30 mins to reach the G hall. Tried to buy some drink before security to take with but shops did not offer the security pack (I wonder if they would when purchasing a bottle of wine or scotch?). Airside there was just one small snack bar and one delights shop there. A lack of seating for a full plane pax load waiting at the gate. A bit chaotic gate staff changed by PA the gate number their english was from terrible (rather a nose sounds than words) to non-existent (only French announcement for passengers to another international destinations). Considering sometimes crowded RER train to the city (ok it was a peak time with many commuters) but easy access by the Orlyval than I would not hesitate to choose this place for short routes and transfer.

It has a much better passenger flow than CDG T1 and finding one's way around is relatively simple. There is a good selection of restaurants/bars/cafés landside. Checkin areas are relatively clearly marked and it is a fast process to departures for domestic flights. Security and passport control for international flights can be arduous due to staffing levels.

Terminal 2E which Air France solely uses is quite nice provided you are there in good time. The shops are quite nice for browsing and the dining choices are good too. The location of the toilets could be better as they are placed on either end of the very long terminal. However CDG is not a good one for transiting unless one has at least two hours.

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,John Oram,United Kingdom,2010-08-08,The poor reviews of CDG are the correct ones. I flew there on 7 August only because I was taking advantage of the promotional fare on Air France's A380. I was apprehensive and right to be so. Although more light reaches the upper level the terminal lower level is gloomy. The walking distances are unbelievable; we took a shuttle train within 2E and still had considerable walks in the same terminal and subsequently from baggage claim to RER station. Baggage arrived at a carousel other than that advertised on the plane's information screen. I did not see any master screen to direct one to the correct carousel. Ticket machines on the cluttered station concourse were difficult to spot but do take 'foreign' credit cards which they used not to (a long time ago).

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,Erich Koller,Switzerland,2010-05-03,Arrival in CDG terminal 1 (star alliance) was okay as we arrived within Schengen area and had no passport control to go through and travelling only with hand luggage. The real problems started on departure. Swissport as the handling agent for Swiss was extremely unfriendly staff a mixture of rudeness and total incompetence. Security executed by another company also could have done a better job with processes that are definitely 3 years behind up-to-date standards. Shops are overpriced and facilities could have been cleaner. All this combined with an outdated airport layout of terminal 1 (nobody's fault) and with recent renovation work done that shows no real positive effect makes this wonderful city of Paris a place to visit rather by train than air especially when you travel within Europe.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Security lines understaffed and long. If you're a business class passenger you can get through them fairly quickly with preference. The food was overpriced inside the terminals inter-Europe flight gates in 2F were crowded and many via bus gates and toilets are downstairs and hard to find.

The only one toilet we could find was on the ground floor, and it is at the other end of the terminal, about five minutes walk. When you have checked in you then have to go upstairs to the so called lounge, there are two or three food outlets, basically lunchbar food, if you pass on these then you go through to the departure lounge where all semblance of service ceases. The food in this so called lounge is definitely of poor quality, but the prices are the dearest in all of Australasia.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,M Burgess,New Zealand,2015-04-16,What a fiasco. No easy public transport connections - took us two hours from just outside CBD to Int'l using train/public bus/inter airport bus. Qantas check-in not open - hunted for immigration forms from other airline counters to fill out in advance. The hunt for public conveniences involved a long walk to the other side of Arrivals. When we spotted a desk being opened we were informed to return in half an hour and go upstairs to buy a coffee in the meantime. As we had business class tickets we hardly wanted to buy a coffee when we could get one in the Qantas Lounge. To kill time we humped our suitcases up the escalators and back to visit Duty-Free. Why paper immigration forms are needed to be completed is a mystery with electronic passports and e-visitor visas? At Security one of us had to get 'double' scanned on the passport they emptied our bags unravelled our umbrella - OK a forgotten water bottle is easy to miss we needed it to keep going during the 'wait' for check-in to open - and then left us to re-pack everything. The electric toothbrush was nearly confiscated due to them thinking it was a screwdriver. Inadvertently I left my mini screwdriver in my glasses case to tighten my loose glasses screws not acceptable apparently and had to wave goodbye to it. When we eventually reached the Lounge for that long awaited cup of coffee was heaving with alternative airline pax and nearly all the seats gone!

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,Ian Morris,Australia,2014-10-13,Having had the misfortune to travel through Terminal 1 six times in the past year I think it is fair to say that this ranks amongst the poorest airports in the world especially for one in a so called developed country. Aside from the basic design flaws inherent in the original plans for the international terminal opened in 1986 which never helped the situation the current refurbishment's and extensions which seem to be as far from completion as they were when they were started 2 years ago are not addressing the basic issues that the terminal faces and seem to be making walking distances even worse. The basic problem is of course that when first built it never adopted the almost universal idea for airports of arrivals on the ground floor and departures on the first floor. Everything is on the ground floor then you go upstairs to immigration and security before going upstairs again to get to the woefully inadequate departure gates before having to walk down two floors via stairs to get to the airbridge to the plane. All the rebuilding ever since has not done much to correct the fundamental issues inherent in the design with Terminal 1. Facilities for the departing passenger are poor they are shockingly overpriced as far as the stores are concerned (although most are currently closed due to the refurbishment) they are cramped and illogically laid out. There remain serious issues with the lack of space in the departure gates but departing the airport is way easier than arriving! Arriving passengers now have to traipse to the back of the duty free store to get to immigration whist being bombarded by staff touting for business. After you get through immigration you usually get accosted without any warning by biosecurity officers who check your inbound passenger card for a preliminary check. Then you go downstairs to the baggage claim area where you have to miraculously work out which carousel your luggage will arrive on. Is it that hard to put an information screen on the immigration level to tell you this? If you have the unfortunate situation of your luggage arriving on carousel 3 then prepare your packed lunch - its a long walk! Then prepare to wait - a long time! There are only 5 international gates - why does it take so long for luggage to make it to the carousels? After arriving at Gate 5 last time I was in the baggage claim area in 8 minutes - then waited for just over 20 minutes for my bags. Once the luggage finally arrives you walk all the way back to the other end of the baggage claim area to go through biosecurity. Lots of staff but very few seem to be doing anything. You walk out of biosecurity into the arrivals hall - which is now smaller and narrower than before even though it is supposed to have been extended! Most of the extension seems to have been for more hire car desks. If you are unfamiliar with the airport good luck following all the virtually non-existent clear signage! If you are after a taxi well its now a nice long walk but at least it is undercover if you happen to be heading to the pick up lane or the car park you will get wet if it is raining or get sunburnt if it is hot and sunny. This is by far the worst designed airport you could ever find in a supposedly developed country.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Our layovers have been for six to eight hours. This airport 'lounge' is not up to international standards. The cafeteria style layout is unsuitable and it is very hard to rest with the bright lighting and persistent noise level. The flight gates and air-bridges are straight out of the cafeteria without separate waiting areas. Moreover airline staff make very loud boarding announcements. which reverberate round the whole hall. Many of these involve passengers who have failed to show up for boarding. How they could get lost or bewildered in such a small space is beyond comprehension. It is hard to understand why passengers can't just read the electronic boards themselves. There is no general airport lounge to check into if you are not elite class travellers with a few airlines.

Much of the problem relates to the fact that airport facilities are federally governed.

Facilities for waiting passengers are rather dissapointing (stay outside as long as possible once inside it is rather sad what there is on offer especially domestic gates).

pisa-airport,/airport-reviews/pisa-airport,Pisa Airport customer review,A Chinnery,United Kingdom,2014-07-13,Pisa airport is OK Medium Sized. Our flight landed in a 10mins early (Easyjet from LGW) and had to wait on the taxiway for 5 mins as a plane was leaving from our allocated stand a little bit late. We had to disembark by air stairs and walk a long distance to the terminal building. Immigration took 10 mins and as we were only there for a long weekend we had no baggage. There was a large taxi rank which was a delight from our 30min wait at Edinburgh for a taxi last year. Flying out we got at the airport 3 hours before our 10.10 departure (easyjet to LGW). We were expecting long queues at security and customs. However there wasn't and we were left in the departures lounge with around 10 duty free shops and cafes. Annoyingly they said go through customs (for UK and intercontinental flights separate departure area upstairs) 90 mins before departure and around 50 of us did. However a hazard was the escalator was kept running and we had to cram in to a small area for 25 mins before they opened up customs. We boarded 35 mins before (inbound was 40mins early) but there was a long walk down ramps (quite odd) our plane was at a stand the other side. It took a while to get down to the planes and a Ryanair was disembarking and pax had to walk across the ramp which caused a 10min hold up. (We where last to board before hold up) We push backed 10mins late and departed in just 2 mins. We arrived 5 mins early. I would say Pisa airport is a standard medium sized airport but it is quote odd in having to walk long distanced from a gate to either side of a ramp to the aircraft and vies versa.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Once in the 'non-Schengen' area seating was very limited and there is only one snack bar. Note that the railway station is closed for a year while the line to Pisa Centrale is upgraded it is not a huge problem as there is a shuttle bus that takes you there in about 10 minutes (buy tickets in the terminal or when you get on); it arrives and leaves from the opposite side of the station to the main concourse it is well sign-posted.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

On arrival we had to wait in a queue for 40 minutes on the tarmac in baking hot temperatures to get to security. Then another 45 minute wait to get the shuttle bus to the car hire terminal then another 45 minute wait to get to the Hertz desk. On departure a week later we made it through check in no space in departure lounge so went straight to the gate then sat at the gate until an hour past our departure time with no word as to what was happening. Eventually a passenger who spoke Italian found out that the baggage handlers had gone on strike. After another half hour we were told there was a 4 and a half hour delay to our flight.

pisa-airport,/airport-reviews/pisa-airport,Pisa Airport customer review,Michael Mulholland,NA,2005-05-10,Pisa remains a very user friendly airport in many ways. However beware of one thing. There are now a large number of flights departing to the U.K mid morning and as at early May 2005 neither security nor passport control was ready for this. The upshot was that there was such queue at passport control that passengers on the Ryanair flight to Liverpool could not respond quickly to the last call or boarding the flight missed a slot it had for an early departure and in fact left 20 minutes late. A very small glitch as the flight actually arrived only a couple of minutes late.

SATA Air Acores is the main tenant with inter-island flights as well as domestic and international flights. PDL still has one walk on the tarmac to the smaller aircraft for boarding and disembarking. Larger aircraft park across the runway and passengers have to take shuttle buses to the terminal. This can be problematic if the weather is bad or passengers are in some way disabled.

If you take the AE (airport express) from the airport buy your ticket in the building at the counter - (they take credit card which means you don't have to worry about getting cash/finding coins). For some reason the bus driver wouldn't sell them to a couple trying to get on. Also make sure you validate it via the puncher on the bus. Going back I just took the city bus as I already had a metro ticket. It takes about 10 min longer and was more crowded but it was convenient as they depart more frequently. The public area has waiting rooms and other areas of seating. Some airlines only post check in desk info 2 hours prior to the flight and gate info goes up about 30-45 min before boarding so I wouldn't worry about arriving too early as security is at your gate. This means any water or beverages you purchase at the airport cannot go through. Once you go through security (was quick and efficient) you're in a ""general area"" which you then go through the motions of the airline checking your passport/ticket to let you into the actual gate area. my gate had 2 single bathrooms and a sole vending machine all of which was mobbed.

The arrivals hall had all the facilities one would expect of a modern airport but was let down by very long immigration queues. We had to queue for just over an hour. There were two queues one for nationals of Ecuador (plus nationals of a few other South American countries) and the second for Foreigners. There simply weren't enough desks open for Foreigners but there were plenty open for Ecuadorians so they never had to wait more than maybe 10 or 15 minutes. This really needs to be rectified and also there needs to be clear signage as to which queue to join. In front of us was a couple from Peru who could have used the short queue had it been clearly marked. On the day of our arrival (3 Sept 2014) the new road from the airport to Quito had just been opened that very same day so the journey to the centre took us just 45 minutes even though it was a busy time of the day.

Selection is good landside and even airside there are enough options for an early flight including a 24-hour coffee shop. Security is extremely tough. Be prepared to take off belt shoes wallet etc. Check-in machines strategically placed and few queues (although my departing flight was at 3.30 am maybe the situation is different during the day) - I arrived at lunch time though and no problems either. Excellent connections into Boa Viagem and downtown via bus 042 (Aeroporto Opcional) passes in front of airport very frequent (daytime only). Taxis are also readily available a trip to Boa Viagem Beach shall be about R$ 20 which is about USD 8. The airport deserves more international traffic as Recife is a major tourist hub. Current flights only to Frankfurt (Condor) Panama City (Copa) and Lisbon (TAP). A tip: if you are flying out of Recife be sure to take some ""bolo de rolo"" with you.

The terminal layout is compact and easy to navigate. There are plenty of slot machines but unlike LAS there aren't so many that they take up too much floor space and leave not enough room to walk past. Smoking is also not permitted anywhere inside the terminal which is a nice change from LAS. The food/beverage/shopping options in the gate areas are limited but there is a nice food and shopping court in the main terminal area before you pass security. The rental car facility is just across the street from the terminal so there are no time-consuming shuttle rides. The airport is only 3 miles from the city centre and traffic to/from the terminal is usually light. The TSA screening area however is too small and understaffed for a 25-gate airport.

Toilets are dirty some cubicles downright disgusting. Finding the train station is a challenge in itself: confusing signage uninviting walkways quite a lengthy walk - at least 10mins.

rome-fiumicino-airport,/airport-reviews/rome-fiumicino-airport,Rome Fiumicino Airport customer review,John Oram,United Kingdom,2011-02-11,My recent experiences broadly reflect those already posted except that of Alan Mackenzie who was presumably at a different airport one which actually does have light airy modern buildings. If there is one adjective to describe FCO it is tired; another is chaotic. Our arrival via shuttle and a long walk neither of which is unusual for a major airport today saw us through passport control with ease. There was a slightly protracted wait for baggage in a hall whose ceiling seems low although it is not particularly so. More hiking takes one from the baggage claim area to the faintly anarchic and poorly signposted outside. Few concessions are made to those pushing trolleys (carts) as seems likely at an airport and sightlines are poor. It is clear that many of the taxi drivers are illegal or at least unofficial and one feels for a moment that one might be slightly further south. Tempted by the train we tried first to get the cheaper coach shuttle only to find that the one on stand was destined for the entirely inconvenient Ostiense Station. We went for the train after all the amusingly named Leonardo Express which at speeds varying between 40 and 60 km/h (indicated on a moving map) makes less than express progress through graffiti land to Termini. People choosing this route should be aware that the train arrives at the remarkable Platform 28 which is about 1000m short of the main concourse area (and taxis). I was frankly astonished when the man selling train tickets at FCO tried to sell me alternative coach shuttle tickets with the explanation that this alternative went to the concourse area. He may have had a good heart but I cannot imagine that his sideline had any kind of official sanction. Our return to FCO was unremarkable. A taxi ride from the centre is sufficiently frightening to diminish considerably any fear of flying. The check in area was again 'tired' but efficiently operated and security was smooth and pleasant. Directions to the boarding gates are poorly signposted. We saw little of the rest as we hid in the BA lounge. There is pier construction on the north side of the terminal complex which is evidence at least of intent to improve. I did notice however during our weekday stay that no-one seemed to be actually constructing anything.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Transfer from C Staellite to baggage was smooth but we had a very long wait for our bags and after only one delivery of BA bags we started being drowned in Air Canada. I had to protest in poor Italian to restore the BA bags which then came in a torrent. However there had been a handling problem at LHR so all the fault might not have been at FCO. Good signposting to rail station and on time train though I would think they could do with better than 1/2 hr frequency. Word of warning to the hard of moving the train comes in at Platform 27 at Termini station and that is a good 400m from the concourse as it is a short platform. The environment at FCO was pleasant and seemed uncrowded although on the return journey Terminal C seemed a bit gloomy and looked its age. Loads of shops and conspicuous cleanliness.

san-francisco-airport,/airport-reviews/san-francisco-airport,San Francisco Airport customer review,A Lane,United States,2012-12-13,This is my home airport. I will admit I hate to pass through immigration control here and not because of the immigration officials who can be severe at times. It's the customs part of it all where if one declares food even if it's one tiny pack of biscuits it begins a whole chain of distrust. It has happen loads of times where I was only bringing in some pastries and biscuits both in hand and checked luggage where we got treated badly. The agents always feel when one admits to bringing in food-any sort of food-it'll be something illegal thus the chances of having one's luggage searched before exiting is quite certain. That is perhaps the only issue I've got with SFO. Thus I will advise anyone to declare that you're bringing in food of any sort. If it's edible it's considered to be food. Otherwise as stated earlier the SFO immigration officers can be gruff though some are fair. As a US citizen I think I've been quite fortunate as from what I've read from foreign visitors' experiences they have been given the third degree or more. However I think that's typical as visitors to the UK (and other countries). For instance I've been treated quite rudely unfairly and unprofessionally as well by their entry clearance officers. It must be a sign of the travel times. SFO itself I do not care for as for a major international airport it is quite small and lack good dining choices.

There is also no bar after security making spending colones more of a challenge. Well there is a bar but it is in the smoking lounge which is in the basement and is unair conditioned so unless you are a smoker who likes to sweat it's not really an option. All food options in the terminal are American. It's clean and spacious (except for the construction area) and the farther you are from the construction area the better the A/C works.

As of 3/20/10 you can pay the departure tax in colones or dollars - if you use a credit card it is treated as a cash advance so be careful.

santiago-de-chile-airport,/airport-reviews/santiago-de-chile-airport,Santiago De Chile Airport customer review,A Mackenzie,Canada,2011-12-09,I have been through this airport many times in the last few years. Overall I would it fair to good. Arriving international is usually ok as other travellers noted: if you hold a Canadian American Australian or Mexican passport you will have to pay the entry fee in a different line before proceeding to immigration. Lines are generally fast in the morning but can be slow in the afternoon. Immigration and customs officials are usually relaxed with the exception of plant/animal goods. If you are unfamiliar with Santiago I would recommend getting a taxi just before you exit the baggage claim area. Departing can be a little different. Depending on when you depart you can expect to wait. Check-in will be long in the early weekday morning and sometimes in the afternoon. If you are departing internationally you will again have to go through immigration. Again they are quick but it can take 20 min. If you are departing domestic security is lax but can be very long on weekday mornings due to high volume. International gate side has a decent selection of restaurants and shopping although expensive. Domestic side has a few stores and not as many places to eat. Overall the airport is clean and bright. Signage is good and easily visible. You can usually find quiet areas to relax if you have a long layover.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Duty free is very expensive. On a positive note the arrivals area was excellent very fast immigration and the hotel information desk was very helpful - down to advising me to pay for ground transportation - bus or mini van in US Dollars and to change my money downtown - as the change facilities at the airport charge high commission.

Terminal 3 in Guarulhos has transported the main International terminal from the 1950's to the current era. Fantastic improvement from 12 months ago. Upon arrival you are greeted by a wide arrival concourse with moving walkways rest rooms at regular intervals clear signage in both Portuguese and English high ceilings clean fresh look. Immigration took 4 minutes and most of that was talking to the immigration officer about the remarkable transformation. After that you are greeted by an unbelievably spacious luggage claim area. Bags still took a long time to arrive but this is normal for me. You also have a reduced immigration card to fill in. Certainly makes a difference after the long haul from Australia. Guarulhos Terminal 3 could be any modern airport in the world as compared to the run down shambles that used to greet you upon arrival. Absolutely no complaints at all.

Once again an absolute pleasure to use. My wife and I use this airport frequently when we travel to Hilton Head Island South Carolina. On arrival my wife goes straight to the car rental desks (about 25 yards from baggage reclaim) and I get the baggage from the belt. Baggage retrieval usually takes 10 minutes or so and by this time the car rental formalities have just about been completed. The cars are just outside the Terminal doors and in about 20 minutes we are on the Interstate. On departure checking in with United Express is a breeze after handing back the rental car and then there is a very pleasant courtyard with retail / café outlets before going through security.

Rumor has it there are more dining choices at the food court which is good since pick’ins are pretty slim down by the low number gates.

The airport also has many areas for relaxing too with many sleeping chairs and complimentary showers along with saunas. Aviation enthusiasts can spot departing and arriving planes from both runways located at either end of the terminal. The only drawback is that the satellite terminal that houses all international airlines is inaccessible to passengers who do not have departing flights there however the retail stores are the same as the contact pier that houses Korean Air and Asiana Airlines.

April 3 flying back with CZ from PVG to SHE flight was delayed 4 hours. In fact all flights going north from PVG were delayed 3-4 hours whilst flights going south left on time so what is this? Another military exercise causing vast delays or another VIP landing in PEK and creating havoc in the skies? Could not blame CZ airplane was there crew was there etc. After boarding on time we were asked to deplane and go back to the waiting hall. Just sit and wait - no announcements then suddenly I saw that my gate was boarding again without any notice or announcement. As many other reviewers say there is nothing to do in PVG - no decent food and far too expensive. Long walks to the end of the terminal while other gates are empty I think they want you to walk past all those shops with bored sales staff and overpriced items.

shanghai-pudong-airport,/airport-reviews/shanghai-pudong-airport,Shanghai Pudong Airport customer review,E Agamennone,China,2013-01-17,I often fly via PVG since it is Shanghai's main international airport. It is big well connected to the city (Maglev train 10min metro 45min tax 50min bus 1hr) and in my opinion it has the potential to reach the level of other Asian hubs like Hong Kong or Singapore. Queuing time for passport controls (especially for departures as arrivals seem to be much better) could be reduced and more facilities (restaurants bars shops) could be added to the departure hall (of both T1 and T2). Even smaller domestic airports like Chengdu or Hangzhou are better equipped from this point of view. The main problem however is the duty free area: bars/restaurants are expensive and of average quality shops are few and look all the same. An international airport should a better variety (see Shanghai Hongqiao Airport for example). Last but not least if the airport really aims to become a regional hub procedures for national/international transfers should be streamlined and all dedicated staff should be fluent in English. Overall however I will give a pass mark considering the cleanliness architecture and space of the airport.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

Transiting to Japan with a 7-hour stopover we were ushered to the transit desk which is not airline-specific. Due to the very common delays on Chinese flights the most pressing flights were dealt with first. Passengers were dealt with as if they were causing problems for the staff rather than trying to do something which is carried out with ease at most international airports. I was asked why I didn't have a boarding pass for the final leg of my journey which could not be issued in London because the airline could not issue it there. All very annoying. A 7-hour stopover was reduced to 5 hours just by standing in the queue at the transit desk.

Queues for checkin even for First and Business were awful- about 25 minutes- and nobody seemed to be in charge. I was annoyed because I had only hand luggage and had checked in online but still had to queue. Immigration etc very fast and friendly.

There are toilets on both levels (hooray) and large areas for waiting by the check-in desks etc. However they have messed up a bit by putting the main departures board directly in front of one of the entrance doors.

I have never considered flying to Sharjah but when I realised how much cheaper the flights were and that Sharjah was a short distance away from Dubai I decided to give it a try. The airline I normally chose to fly Dubai takes us to Terminal 2. There is very little in T2 so I was pleasantly surprised that Sharjah airport outshone T2. Although Sharjah is dry you can buy alcohol from the duty free. Also on the return you can also buy it from some of the eateries! From deplaning to passport control it was very quick with no queues - staff are surely but it's the same in Kuwait and Dubai. When we returned to the airport for our departure we were able to use the self service check-ins as we only travelled with hand luggage so no queues. Then a short queue to passport control. All in all an enjoyable experience and I would definitely use Sharjah again.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The transfer part was shambolic but not the airports fault. On departing Sharm pretty straight forward but a good 3 security checks and jobsworth staff who think they are actually Egypt itself with high authority. Too many Airport officials. The announcements were actually in English majority of the time toilets I did not feel safe as the attendant asked me if I was English and felt I was being watched then expected money off me.

Very long queues on domestic check in and security. Staff are incompetent and have no understanding of what they are there for. They insult you not because they are rude people but because they think that this is what their duty is. The airport is split onto three buildings: international departures (new but badly kept) international arrivals (old soviet style building shabby looking) domestic departures (new but not looked after) and small uncovered facility of baggage claim for domestic arrivals. You are bussed to and from planes which are parked within 70-100 meters from the building and it takes 10 minutes because buses stop at arrival and don't open door till they see that passengers inside are getting sick of unnesessary wait without air conditioning. Toilets with holes in floor instead of normal toilets. No words to describe how they smell. Overall impression is shame for what is a gateway to a major Ukrainian resort.

It's a huge terminal with many shops and restaurants and I can't imagine passengers getting too bored inside. However its problem is that it's really too big and sprawls to nowhere. Walking to Gate A21 completely tired me out. The most ridiculous thing is water. They sell bottled water after passing immigration but they don't let you bring the water bought into the gate. Why allow those shops to sell them if they aren't eventually allowed in? In the end I was forced to drink the whole bottle before entering the gate.

Staff was friendly and helpful and offered a free replacement immediately. Left at T1 via Cathay. Staff was knowledgeable and helpful and checked our bags through final destination. Note that immigration is the first check point which runs pretty smoothly and you can bring your bottle of water through immigration since security is not until you get to your gate before your flight (which is nice in my opinion) but this also means you need to plan extra time at the gate for security checks. We tried to get connected to the free wifi but it asked for local phone number or registration at the information counter (which was quite a hassle compared to Hong Kong or Japan where we transit); but as other reviewers have mentioned there are several free internet stations in the terminal that you could use just not so convenient if you just want to use your smartphone to get connected for a few minutes.

Taxi drivers in Bulgaria are bandits - do not accept an offer from a tout in the arrivals hall - you could easily end up having to pay €60 or €70 - there are two or three little booths opposite from where you emerge in arrivals. Go to them and tell them where you are going - they give you a little form to give the driver and there is usually someone to point you at the right car. If you do this the rate will be reasonable (but still twice the rate back from town if you get an honest driver - ask your hotel to get you a car).

So often you find yourself walking for miles before you reach your gate - here it's up some stairs through security down some stairs and you're at the gate. Forget gate #98 - there are only about 6 gates. You're not made to walk past hundreds of shops - there are just three airside and the only ones you need in an airport; a cafe/restaurant a newsagent and duty free. The lounge is basic but does the job and given the nature of the airport and the fact that you do not need to spend long there it is sufficient.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,S Brown,United Kingdom,2013-06-11,Having arrived from London we were treated to chaos in the customs area. Having been in London for 3 years I was shocked but the lack of forethought that had gone into the redesign of the area. Signs did not give accurate indications of where to stand particularly when there were crowds doors opens into queues the microchip scanning only works 50 percent of the time and seemed to have been designed by someone who assumed only 4 or 5 people would be using the service at one time. Staff couldn't care less that the scanning area was ineffective and that people were wandering around looking for assistance when the automatic machine wouldn't allow them to pass through. After queuing for the auto machines I was told the queue for assistance I then had to join wouldn't take long. Having seen the people in the standard queue who exited the plane with me leave the customs area I then had to stay for another 15 minutes. When I got to the front of the queue there was no apology or explanation for the delay or malfunction of the equipment in fact the woman was chatting to the other woman next to her about her weekend. Se was rude and when I didn't utter a word when my passport was handed back she commented to her friend that I wasn't very happy in a sarcastic tone. Out in the baggage collection the same issue with snaking queues and lack of movement was evident. The entire design seemed to be based on creating collisions with no forethought to the fact that people had to push huge trolleys throw queues of people with huge trolleys. Unsurprisingly the woman directing us to aisles for baggage checks was equally obnoxious. There seemed to be no supervision of the staff who couldn't have cared less about providing any sort of service. ve no customer service aptitude to employ.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0
sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,I Wright,Australia,2013-04-04,I have only one gripe about Sydney International Terminal why is there no smoking room? I do not envy any passengers having to transit through this airport after a long haul flight (or transfer to a domestic one). It seems every other airport in the world (maybe with the exception of Heathrow) is capable of having a dedicated area for this purpose inside the terminal.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,Ian Mackay,Australia,2013-03-05,I use Sydney on a regular basis and I like the airport but it does have its drawbacks. I have to mention the staff Check in and passport staff have always been friendly and helpful however that cant be said for the security staff who always are surly and unhelpful. International departures can get crowded and its not helped by a needless shopping area. There's far too many of them and they are all of the expensive variety including the food outlets. Once checked in you head for security and line up via a maze of lanes that are roped off. Fine when its busy but when its quiet why they don't provide a more direct route to the desks is beyond me. Once through security you head through yet more expensive shops to the gates. Your departure gate will dictate how much walking you have to do. If you need food or drinks be prepared because it is expensive. International arrivals is much the same but in reverse. You head through a shopping complex to reach passport control via another roped off maze and then onto the baggage hall. I've always been lucky and got my bags swiftly. Arrivals hall is always busy and its not helped by more shops! Depending on your destination will dictate what happens next. Buses / taxis etc are within easy reach and the hall is underneath International departures. If you have arrived off an International flight and want domestic its not so easy as the domestic terminals are the other side of the airport. These can be reached in a variety of ways and this is where Sydney lets itself down (other than the shops!). There is a train that you pay for that takes two minutes but you have to walk the length of the terminal and down a set of escalators because of where the arrival exit has been placed. You can also get a bus which are often crowded. The third option is a taxi. Whatever option you choose try and give yourself plenty of time it gets very busy at peak times. I should also mention that the approaches to the airport like the rest of Sydney can get very busy so also leave yourself plenty of time. In summary I like Sydney but there's far to many shops and arrivals especially if you need to transfer could definitely be improved. Walking the length of the terminal to get to the bus / train is not ideal - maybe they designed it that way to get you to walk past the shops!,NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1
sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,S Brown,Australia,2013-01-10,Both terminals run by Sydney Airport Corporation (this excludes the Qantas terminal) are dirty disorganised and incredibly noisy. The eating options are barely passable - thankfully most domestic travel is so short you don't need to eat anything. At international with the exception of one or two outlets the options and quality are pitiful. The airport's food offer makes airline food seem the appealing option. The shopping is the same offer as every suburban shopping centre and is largely irrelevant to travellers needs and interests. I have not had major issues with Customs or the other government agencies working in the airport which were not essentially the result of poor/inadequate facilities. There is room for improvement in service levels and general pleasantness - but that seems to be an issue worldwide. Sydney Airport is a patchwork of buildings and facilities which scream systematic under investment. The terminals appear to struggle to meet today's traveller numbers and needs - I cannot see this changing in the future which suggests at some point in the near future Sydney will not have a functional airport at all.

Australia has a rather strict quarantine check but I have claimed and told one officer what I've brought and she granted me to enter through the green pass gate! But my return flight was at around 10 pm and I can't believe that the queue was much longer than I previously expected and people were moving really slow! Until then I realized how small and inefficient the airport was during such busy mid-night peak hours! Eventually I was at the security check point after 25 minutes the staff were just indifferent! When I entered the departure area I had found that some shops were about to close! Since no WIFI is available there is really not much you can do at such time.

Both are very easy to use and get around with plenty of facilities and lounges to keep one busy should there be a flight delay (given how busy it gets there is potential for this to occur). In particular the food court in T2 (Virgin Blue Jetstar and regional NSW flights) has a great range of outlets with good views of planes moving around. For aircraft aficionados there are plenty of spots throughout this terminal for viewing planes taking off and landing. T3 is pleasant and is open throughout. It's easy to travel through yet doesn't have the same range of shops as T2. Staff are friendly and there is an interesting Qantas Heritage Museum located near Gate 14. Transfers between these terminals is easy through a subway that also goes to the railway station. T1 the international terminal has just been refurbished and is rather pleasant with a large range of shops to rival other airports worldwide. Going through customs etc. to leave the country is often a speedy process with queues minimal. However re-entering the country is a lot more difficult with queues for customs taking a while baggage taking its time to arrive on the carousel and immigration taking a while to screen everyone and their respective goods. I understand that they're trying to be scrupulous with who and what to allow in the country but surely there must be some way to speed up the process. A word of advice is to not arrive on a flight between 5am and 9am when most large long-haul aircraft arrive meaning particularly long queues for all arriving passengers. In general however it's an easy airport to use with all facilities that one could need.

On the other hand staff (including immigration) was generally helpful. One of the most pleasant immigration/customs experiences I've had going into a foreign country. Shopping is good all around but dining is pretty weak outside of the pre- security food court in the International Terminal. One thing that would be a big and easy improvement -- MAPS! There are almost no terminal maps to be found anywhere in the airport making navigation (or figuring out whether to grab a bite before or after security) a bit of a gamble.

Seems that the real peak hour is somewhat later than 0630 more likely around 0800 when the queues are much longer and the staff surlier.

Macquarie have turned the car park into a a narrow maze to maximise car park spots and have the nerve to charge every person that arrives through the car park. There is no dedicated pick up spot. This makes the car park a total mess to negotiate especially during the peak hours. In addition if one tries to leave the car park within the '3 mins' to avoid paying the 'car park tax' this is virtually impossible as you have to battle it out with tens of other drivers waiting in line who are trying to do exactly the same thing.

On departure things were not that smooth baggage system failed but much worse was the queue through security.

Pity since the facilities are quite nice once you get through security. When boarding the plane there was no one leading the way from the terminal so we had to find the plane more or less on our own. Hardly satisfactory from a security point of view. All in all it wasn't that bad. Szczecin Solidarity is one of the smaller regional airports and as such rather new to international traffic.

Ironically it's Songshan that is connected by metro and not as yet Taoyuan - it seems to be taking an eternity to finish the metro link and the high speed rail is miles away and costs a fortune!

The place is dirty dusty and has no soul. Its just like a temporary bus station. The immigration process was perhaps the best in the world. There was no queue and the immigration officers were extremely friendly and approachable. The luggage as usual didn't come out quick enough considering how empty the airport was. Then its a hassle to get to the taxi rank – again it had the feeling of a temporary bus station rather than an international airport at a capital city. Leaving the airport was another experience. I assume that the check-in area has been refurbished and the lighting was great. It might have difficulty dealing with large quantity of passenger though as the luggage belt at the check in area wasn't properly designed. After checking in I proceed to the immigration on the second floor. Again the wall and ceiling was covered by plastic for the renovation. Immigration and security again was no hassle.

tampa-airport,/airport-reviews/tampa-airport,Tampa Airport customer review,B Gordon,United Kingdom,2012-10-14,Tampa is a gem amongst airports. Clean free Wifi not crowded and easy to transit through.

I flew out on a Monday afternoon with few other flights going which probably helped. After having to lug bags upstairs to departures there was a brief security check at the entrance. Check-in was slow but went fine and they took my bag. Note that you have to fill out the exit form before checking in. Then you present the exit form at customs along with your entry form.

tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,Mark Bickerton,NA,2006-02-11,Tashkent airport is quite modern in design but tries hard to retain a flavour of Soviet bureaucracy in its overall service. I have been asked for bribes by check-in staff at least three times and one time had to spend 10 mins trying to find a member of staff so I could check in (the desk said 'Check in Open'). When I located someone I was eventually told there was no seat for me (which means 'give me money and there will be') so I had to argue with him to get my confirmed seat. There is not much to do at this airport; the gate cafe is rubbish and only accepts US Dollars. If you are stuck there because of a delay try to get out of the airport and go to a nearby choykhana or shashlik place. I spent a very nice few hours just sitting in the sun outside the domestic terminal once which was much better than being stuck inside the terminal.

tbilisi-airport,/airport-reviews/tbilisi-airport,Tbilisi Airport customer review,A Jansen,NA,2006-05-23,"I found this one of the most revolting airports I have ever been. The facilities have changed little since soviet times and are just too small. In arrivals there was only one luggage-belt. Some thugs monopolized the trollies and demanded money from foreigners who wanted to use them. Unruly taxi drivers even pushed their way into the arrivals hall looking for prey (foreigners). Departure was even worse. The departure hall is much bigger and supposedly better organized but still we had a very unpleasant time there. First of all most flights seem to leave very early in the morning (around 5 AM) which is already inconvenient. Secondly the check-in of several flights at the same time causes a lot of confusion. Staff works extremely slow and broad shouldered types simply push their way up the lines while people behind you gladly try to push you aside. The guards in the hall are uninterested in this and do not take any action at all. After receiving our boarding pass we had to go upstairs. In spite of the sign ""passengers only"" the stairs were blocked by people saying goodbye to their loved ones. There were only 2 desks for foreign passports. Even here some unpleasant types tried to push themselves in front. People from western countries were treated politely but my wife who has a Moldovan passport and a valid residence permit for the Netherlands experienced real trouble. An extremely unfriendly female official grabbed her passport and without any explanation went into some office rudely ordering my wife to follow her. I went after her and found some officer holding my wife's passport. I demanded an explanation as well as their names and registration numbers. One good thing about Georgia's rose revolution is the fact that officials are in fact required to identify themselves when asked and that it is also possible to make a complaint against them. Luckily this helped without even looking into the passport he gave it back saying that there was "" no problem"" . I am sure that without this intervention they might have detained my wife for hours. I am deeply disappointed that officials at this airport show a smiling face to westerners while at the same time they apparently take pleasure in harrassing people from poor countries. After this intermezzo we had to go to the metal detector. There was only one working so again a huge queue had formed. This detector did not work at all - it went off for almost everybody but not for me even though I was carrying a pocket knife with me! Finally we had reached the "" departure lounge""  an extremely small area with a bar and one sad "" tax free shop"". I am a smoker myself but the fumes exhausted by visitors of the bar were even too much for me. There seemed to be no toilet at all however when looking really well (a small corridor behind the bar) you could find it. Even though Georgia produces wonderful souvenirs there was nothing except cigarettes and some alcoholic drinks in the taxfree sold by some unfriendly women spending their time chatting to each other and taking cigarette-breaks. There were 2 "" exit gates"" (not indicated by numbers). Departures were announced in unclear english (no monitors). Travellers had to walk down to ground level were busses were waiting to take them to the planes. Since these busses stand next to each other and several take-offs take place almost simultaneously this leads to confusion when people get into the wrong bus. We were really glad to have the ordeal behind us. A terrible place unworthy of this beautiful country!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

tokyo-narita-airport,/airport-reviews/tokyo-narita-airport,Tokyo Narita Airport customer review,H Lee,South Korea,2013-06-20,Transferred through Narita airport arriving from the US and heading into Korea a few hours later. Passed through immigration to enjoy the landside. Has a notorious dysfunctional layout. I was unlucky to encounter the worst case scenario departing from Terminal 1 but having to taxi to runway 16L. As a result the taxi time itself already was over 20 minutes. Except for that the facilities are mostly quite well maintained. Spotlessly clean. Plenty of places to dine and shop. Convenience facilities like shower rooms also available. Carts free wherever you go. Free wifi also available. A spacious observation deck. Not many people speak decent English. Another rather big disappointment involves the never-ending queues at immigration and transfer desks. My impulsive decision to hit the landside was made when I arrived at the transfer desks with so many people that they were not even able to stand in lines. Immigration was not much better but at least in a seemingly interminable line for foreigners. Despite the efforts of the officers to divert some people off to the counters for Japanese nationals it took over 30 minutes just to pass immigration. Another minus 2 point for this. In conclusion a very well-maintained airport with professional people running it although some issues regarding the terrible layout long queues at immigration and transfer desks and multiple frustrations after failing to communicate in English almost everywhere I went in the airport complex.,NA,NA,NA,7,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

You cooperate with the airline / airport to make everything smoother but the airline / airport never seems to cooperate with the passenger.

We did get off first but then was left in a crowd of 6 people all in wheelchairs with 2 people to push all of us.

We missed our connecting flight to Tokyo (thanks to the inept staff of Air Canada) and had to spend the night in a hotel. The Air Canada customer service rep told us to go to ground level S-5 and a shuttle would pick us up. She also said it was a long walk to get there (true very true). We asked her how to get there and she said to follow the signs. What signs? We had to move against the flow of people to leave the secure area. We had to ask security how to go through screening in the opposite direction to leave they were not sympathetic to our dilemma at all. We asked no less than 3 airport staff for directions to ground floor S-5 and never got a coherent answer. The airport is the most confusing unorganized airport we have ever been in. Directional signage is woefully inadequate and confusing. The staff are poorly trained and not customer friendly. The food choices are scant at best. On our return trip through Toronto to Boston we found the airport dirty mush trash on the floors and in the restrooms. We waited at gate F55 which was drab with very little seating.

In the last month I've flown through Pearson from LHR MUC and IST and without fail I'm amazed at our archaic customs process and the ridiculously long wait for baggage. I'm a Canadian citizen. I'm pleased they have a separate queue for Canadian Residents now however Canada is the only country I've been to (out of 47) that is the most onerous and frustrating to enter. The Canadian Residents line is always the longest the three flights I took also required us to use the automated machines that promote ""faster entry home"" - the kiosks were slow couldn't read my passport and the organisation was a mess. You then still have to join another queue and give your printout (a waste of more paper and tax dollars as it's a scanned copy of the form you just filled out) to an officer who may or may not ask you questions. You then join another queue to show more officers your printout - and then once you get your luggage (which even for Priority can take ages - I waited 50 minutes for my bag from IST - easily wait an average of 40 minutes) you have to queue yet again to give your printed form to another customs agent. If the airport isn't busy it's not so much of an issue but these times are rare particularly when you arrive from European flight - most arrive in the early evening and you then have thousands of people trying to get through.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,B Walters,Canada,2013-12-04,I had two hours to make a flight arriving from the US to my connecting flight to Ottawa. One would think that it would be enough especially on a Tuesday afternoon. Not so. Canadian Customs clearance was relatively quick but upon arriving in the baggage pick up area and once finding the carousel for my flight as passengers congregated around it and waited and waited and waited. On board the West Jet flight it was announced bags should begin to arrive 20 mins after arrival. In fact it was about 45 mins before the bags started to trickle down and an hour before most bags seemed to arrive. Now depart this baggage area and looking for place to drop connecting bags off and again an area of mass confession. People everywhere one huge lineup that everyone got into then 10 mins later a worker said if only need to drop bags go around this corner. Fine 100 plus folks do this only to find another lineup waiting to drop bags on a belt that seemingly did not work. Slow slow slow! With 45 mins to spare I go out of this area to find that I must go upstairs and clear security again. Next big lineup about 300 people lined up to clear security in a queue that did not move. When I queried a worker about my flight leaving soon was put in a shorter line but this queue did not move either. Long and short of it made it to my flight literally as the door shut behind me. 2 hours of stress! I will from now on choose my transborder flights with flights directly into the US.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

We were kept waiting for a gate on arrival and this seemed in large part to be because of taxiway restrictions. My BA aircraft was parked about as far as possible from the body of T3 and the walk to customs and immigration was long. However no sooner had we left the aircraft than we were subjected to an unnecessary extra passport check. The actual immigration point was less friendly than my recent experiences in the US. The baggage hall was only adequate and had no immediately accessible restrooms. Another long walk was necessary for car rental which is at least on airport.

It was nice to walk to customs where you could see the rest of the airport. We had to go down stairs and it almost looked like we would enter Canada but then a left (not that easy to notice) led to an escalator up to US baggage claim for connecting flights. This was a long wait (about 30 minutes) but then through a passport control line (not bad) and security. International flights connect in the same passport control room with people flying from Canada to US but there are dedicated desks. The line (a maze) moved pretty fast and so did security. For US passport control there were few questions or hassles. After security you go down to the part of the airport for US flights - decent selection of food options.

Last week I met my daughter returning from Iceland. At least 75% of the signs had some or all of the lighting out including the lone washroom sign. Four of five Arrivals displays were on half power lighting. Her arrival to exit time was quite reasonable on a busy Friday evening. In March we waited at the International arrivals for my daughter coming from New Zealand. Discovered belatedly that NZ flights with Air Canada are considered to be domestic arrivals because they go through customs in Vancouver even though they remain on the same plane! Arriving passengers are expected to have Canadian coins for the baggage carts - an embarassing way to treat visitors. Food services are limited but priced the same as in the city.

People accompanying you can enter only after paying an entrance fee to the airport police station which is a procedure taking 15 min. The terminal itself is spacious with modernistic and actually pleasant looks. Even if I had an already printed boarding pass for online check-in I actually waited much longer than other passengers as their system wasn't working and they had to check me- in again. There were around 10 passengers for 3 members of staff at a time and they seemed totally overwhelmed despite the low volume of passengers.

vancouver-airport,/airport-reviews/vancouver-airport,Vancouver Airport customer review,M Doyle,Canada,2010-08-26,At first I was impressed to find the new Immigration kiosk system for Canadian residents. Just a few minutes and I was off to pick up my baggage. However after getting the bags as a passenger with a connecting flight to another Canadian city I experienced the most bizarre line-up to clear customs. In all my years of landing in Vancouver and connecting to another Canadian city I have never experienced such a horribly long line. In the past we walked out and deposited our checked bags fairly quickly. After which I assume they were security screened in the same manner that any baggage is. So why are we suddenly required to line up and wait while each passenger's bag is slowly screened? The more bizarre twist is that those people who are exiting the airport are expeditiously moved through customs and sent out into the country. Why are connecting passengers treated so differently? If for example a passenger brought an illegal item in their baggage they are able to exit and be let loose in Canada but if connecting to another city all their bags are searched and must be scanned in their presence? Why must a connecting passenger be present for screening when someone who checks in upstairs can simply drop off their bags? Simply because of this bottleneck due to an extremely illogical and inefficient system I will be trying to avoid this otherwise fine airport in the future. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I need is a pointless 2 hour wait in line to have my baggage screened!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

vancouver-airport,/airport-reviews/vancouver-airport,Vancouver Airport customer review,John Oram,United Kingdom,2009-09-18,I felt puzzled at the recent mixed reviews of YVR based on my own arrival there. Yes it is a walk from the gate to immigration but no more so than many large airports these days and it is through a bright clean and imaginatively decorated terminal. There was no wait at immigration and we were well treated. We were allowed to go through as a couple which would not happen further south. Baggage delivery was swift. We were in our taxi and headed downtown before even our scheduled arrival time. YVR gets absolutely top marks for multi-lingual signs. English French and Japanese with some Punjabi and Chinese. My only complaint – although I was not personally affected – is that just like America they have no concept of transit passengers thus creating a totally unnecessary workload for both passengers and staff in recovering baggage and going through pointless customs and immigration procedures.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

With reasonable space available to browse a number of outlets it soon became clear that the area was becoming very crowded and it appeared evident that passengers were having to queue for passport inspection in lines so long that they extended out to the retail area. Then followed a long wait with several anxious passengers worried about missing their departing flights. Once through passport control we were directed to Gates 21-26 where passengers were sat on the floor or left to stand because of overcrowding and lack of space. In order to try to clear space at Gate 21, passengers were boarded, in no particular order and by one member of staff checking boarding passes manually, onto a waiting bus to be taken to the aircraft. In very hot conditions and with no aircon, we were left for over 15 mins on the bus. Then after a slow drive to the plane the driver got out and again left the passengers on the hot bus before getting clearance to board. At the end of our flight the BA Captain advised that he would seek an investigation into what went on after what he rightly described as 'an unacceptable situation'.",Departure Only,13-06-2015,Couple Leisure,4,1,3,3,NA,2,3,0,NA,0

My father and I waited a tedious 30 minutes in the queue for a 5 minute flight to Vancouver. We had several trays of stuff and a man thought I dropped a SD card and when he took it up from one of my trays and asked me all the security people turned to me, glaring for no reason. The four trays blocked the traffic of baggages coming through the X-ray machine so out of respect I put them all onto one tray and moved away, and a security personnel said kindly to place it on a table. However as I was worried that we'd miss our flight as the security was taking forever to screen my father I was talking in a loud voice as he was across the room and all the security were busy looking at me and it just took forever.

The staff member helping my grandfather brought us to the waiting lounge until it was time to go to our connecting flight and he came back for us when it was time to go to the gate. Our stop over was 5 hours. The lounges and restaurant were not so bad. Service was very good at the lounges and the staff was friendly.

It is clear that the new ultra-modern Skylink terminal will not come a minute too late. I have constantly had to use extremely packed smelly buses to get from the gate to the plane and vice-versa.

Security was fast but the holding area for long-haul flights (right before boarding after security) is far too small. All the passengers on our 767 had trouble just standing in the space. On the positive side the washrooms were clean and the gates were modern looking though it was difficult to see through so many cramped people. We ended up sitting on the floor.

Be aware if you rented a car from Hertz at another location and return it at the Vilnius airport you won't have the keycard necessary to enter the rental car parking lot (which is not well-signed). You will have to pay to park or park semi-illegally in front of the terminal and run in to your rental company to get the card so you can enter the lot and return your card. I assume it is the same with other rental car companies. If you had a lot of luggage you may wish to take the city bus to the train station instead of the train as you will have to go down a flight of stairs at the train station. There's no elevator. Passport control and security was quick in the early afternoon.

The building is very small and displays a bizarre mixture of typical drab Soviet facilities and shiny renovated areas that you could almost call Scandinavian. Arriving at about 5 a.m on a red-eye flight I was greeted by a pack of stray dogs roaming the street outside the terminal but then I was able to wait for the first bus into town while having an excellent cappuccino in the new cafe inside the arrival area with plenty of seats and cheerful service from the very friendly staff. Immigration is the same as everywhere else in Russia even though this was the only place where I was asked to produce a copy of my invitation and health insurance. On an afternoon visit the departure sector which is located on the same level as the arrivals was almost deserted. Services on offer are scarce: one exchange office with ridiculously short opening times one Atm one cafe a couple of windows selling airline tickets and providing general information in Russian exclusively. Everywhere around the airport there are obvious signs of big renovation works going on I'm really curious to see what comes out of it in the future.

The facilities were all  and the concept of crowds and queues appears to be a foreign concept as only small planes operate to this small country airport. Its clear that recent terminal renovations have geared the terminal up for larger aircraft with room for security screening. In doing so extra facilities would need to be added (premium lounge tea/coffee making facilities).

Internet wasn't working cause of the annoying authorization process you had to go through unavailable on mobiles. Outrageously high exchange rates in the terminal - beware. Excellent railway link to the city and to the Warsaw region which is probably the best thing about the airport. Besides that nothing to write home about.

Airport continues to be efficient and pleasant to use on departure but arrivals are a little hit-and-miss: airbridges are still rarely used and waiting times in buses can be a little on the lengthy side. Security and immigration were cleared quickly on all occasions. Baggage reclaim tends to be rather slow. Transiting can be awkward when arriving from abroad - the signs seem to indicate the direction which passengers should go but this leads you to security then the main part of the terminal and not to passport control - the correct way to transit is to follow the signs which say ""passport control"" and only then to clear security but the signage is confusing! This is not an issue when arriving from another Polish airport however. I have been caught out twice like this and it is not due to language issues. As transit security generally consists of only one X-ray machine pax arriving in a full or widebody aircraft need to ensure that they have plenty of time to make connections.

warsaw-chopin-airport,/airport-reviews/warsaw-chopin-airport,Warsaw Chopin Airport customer review,Robert Szocik,NA,2009-06-13,I've flown to Warsaw Fryderyk Chopin many times in the past but this was my first time use of WAW T2 for both arrival and departure. The difference is incredible at least on departure. The new terminal is light well-ventilated and feels a little like a smaller version of LHR T5. The orange décor used throughout risks making the terminal feel like it's run by Easyjet but one gets used to it. Passing through passport control couldn't be quicker helped by the fact that the terminal has been divided into Schengen and non-Schengen areas by glass screens (passport control for the non-Schengen flights is about halfway along the terminal). Security clearance was quick efficient and friendly. T1 and T2 are linked together both landside and airside but one has to check-in at the appropriate terminal. Several airlines including LOT and BA now have long-overdue self check-in machines. T1 now looks increasingly tired and neglected with reduced facilities airside but retaining all its previous facilities landside. T2 however has few facilities landside but excellent facilities airside all the way from just after security to the far end of the terminal. Clearly this airport is finally making significant steps towards providing a quality service for passengers with improvements in customer service and politeness throughout. However it's not quite there yet. On arrival my and another passenger's bags were placed on the wrong belt without any warning which quickly stopped and hid our bags from view meaning that we waited for almost half an hour for our bags. On both arrival and departure there seemed to be plenty of free airbridges yet we were bussed both to and from the terminal as always seems to be the case at this airport.

Arriving at WAW is like taking a step back in time but not in a good way. Bleek airport - many flights do not have access to gangways - it's all via stairs and busses. Terminal itself is really grey and very outdated. Departures is worse. Left on a Friday afternoon and it felt like all of Poland was trying to escape to the West. No seating anywhere. Shops were full and it was more because there is nothing else to do. As a business class passenger I was given access to the business class lounge (used by *ALL* airlines) only to find a small cramped room with even fewer seats. Plenty of drinks yes but other catering was miserable. Also no good ventilation thus making it seem like a sauna. They are building a new terminal but looking at the rest of Poland I don't know if this will be any better.

I use the airport once or twice a year and in the last decade I've never had to wait more than 40 minutes at immigration and more usually only 10-20 minutes (I'm not a US citizen and have to use the 'long' queues). Security seems to have streamlined their process and in the last 5 years I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for security at departure. My suitcase is often waiting for me at the baggage carousel. Immigration and customs staff have clearly been taking some customer training and have become much friendlier over the last decade. I like the train between terminals. I even like the mobile lounges that take you from your terminal to immigration on arrival if flying internationally. My only real quibble is that duty free shopping options remain poor. I suppose it helps that by now I know to time my arrival time to avoid peak arrivals and departures where possible and I know how to work with some of Dulles' quirks to reduce (though almost never eliminate) my queuing time but compared to some of the other major East Coast international airports I really don't see much grounds for complaint in terms of either queuing times and facilities.

Then queued for a further 2 hours 15 mins at immigration (non-US citizen) - rows upon rows of unmanned desks no assistance or announcements. The queue got even longer behind me so some people will have waited for over 3 hours. After an 8 hour flight expecting families with young children to stand for so long is completely unacceptable. Then a hunt for bags deposited in a random location in the baggage hall and yet another queue for customs.

Flew into IAD Monday 29 Sept with BA to land just behind a Saudi Airlines plane. Immigration took about 1 hour after the little shuttle bus the up and down various endless corridors and escalators. Collected baggage and checked in with United Express for transfer to Savannah / Hilton Head International. We allowed a 4 hour layover so all relatively painless except the last minute Gate Change from C terminal to A terminal - just to keep the passengers on their toes and awake presumably. Returning from Savannah 13th October we then had the usual interminable walks through various buildings and up and down miles of escalators before collecting the baggage (which did arrived relatively quickly). The only problem was the signage to where we then had to go to check in with BA for our flight home - a very grumpy man at the Information desk eventually grudgingly told us the right direction to head. Check in at BA desk a breeze security queues minimal and Terminal B actually a very quiet and pleasant place to be for a glass of wine before flying home. Perhaps because it was Columbus Day. Would I recommend Dulles? I suppose as much as I would recommend any US Port of Entry or Departure - some are bad and some downright dreadful (Newark Chicago LAX Miami etc etc). Do allow plenty of time if you are transferring flights - we allowed 4 hours and got total peace of mind. And none of them are particularly good but Dulles was as painless as anywhere.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,G Meyer,United States,2012-02-06,One of my least favourite airports. This airport has expanded haphazardly over the course of several decades and is poorly designed and laid out. Amazingly the new Aerotrain which shuttles you from the main terminal building to the satellite terminals is no faster than the painfully slow so-called mobile lounges that used to be the sole means of transport between terminals. I always have to allow 45 minutes or more to travel from the drop-off/check-in area to the gate. Several times when arriving on a late night flight I've had to wait 20 minutes or more for the next Aerotrain. Security lines are the longest I've seen primarily because half the security lanes are normally closed similar situation with customs - never enough personnel to man the available counters and as a result lines are commonly 45 minute or more. While Dulles suffers from some irreparable design flaws it would be much better if airport management would simply ensure that they make better use of the facilities they do have - by having more customs and security personnel on hand and by running the Aerotrain at reasonable intervals at all hours to speed transit through the airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

The fire truck took about 5 minutes just to start lucky (there were no fires). The baggage hall was interesting all baggage arrived on a tip-truck which backed up to a slide (and you guessed it) up-ended the tray and baggage into the room (no carousel). Customs Hall is something else one over eager passenger put his head around the door before he was called; flashing lights and sirens erupted. You didn't need to speak Russian to get the gist of what he was told. Fortunately I had a Company courier waiting for me outside with a name board. On the way out similar system. this time however the flight was delayed due to heavy snow. No information given by staff no flight info boards all passengers JUST WAITED. In my case it was about 8 hours; this must be a fairly common occurrence in January as the same courier was with me and refused to leave until the aircaft was actually on the ground (most impressed).

The current electricity supply problem also means that the airport is totally reliant on generators. When we arrived early evening we discovered that the generator had packed up so the airport was operating by candlelight or battery-powered torches. Thankfully our plane was an 15-seater and the non-functioning baggage carousel wasn't required.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,K Cole,United Kingdom,2015-03-09,I've used Stansted since before the current buildings were opened and for years it was almost a delightful experience (for an airport) but since Manchester Airport took over it has gone just one way: downhill and very fast. The cost of parking has rocketed (£19 a day for long stay) the car park buses are now shared with JetParks and are absolutely jammed. They've built a ridiculously shiny new Duty Free shop which requires you to walk about a mile from security to the departure lounge all with the money they've made from parking. They even charge you Â £2.50 to drop off so they must be making money faster than they can count it. But when it comes to landing after your holiday you are stuck on the plane after landing because they have no staff to unlock the arrivals doors. This has happened to me twice now. After 10 to 15 minutes you might be able to get off. Staffing at passport control is laughable well almost non-existent so this now takes 30-40 minutes. At the 'do it yourself' passports 3 out of 15 booths are in use and the single staff member is occupied with moving the barriers to accommodate the growing queue. By the time I got to the carousels the luggage was almost falling off it had been there so long. All in all it took an hour from landing just to get out of the airport. This is not a modern efficiently run airport it is an appalling experience for passengers and a cash cow for the owners. Yes bring back BAA the professionals.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
amritsar-airport,/airport-reviews/amritsar-airport,Amritsar Airport customer review,Mikele Singh,NA,2008-04-10,Airport security is incredibly lax and inconsistent. You initially undergo a brief bodysearch when arriving at the airport. My dad and our driver were both searched but my sister and I were not subject to this search. Maybe they can tell that your not dangerous just by looking at you? Our baggage was not checked when entering the airport. Due to cancellations we had to have our baggage security checked twice. This means you put your own suitcase into a big machine for x-ray while a security official watches a screen as it passes through. This is the baggage you check-in. The first time all bags were aloud through unchecked. The second time one of the bags was flagged as containing a suspicious item. Why was this not flagged the first time? The security staff then wrap security tape around your suitcase to indicate that it has been checked. You then proceed to check- in on your own. This would allow enough time for you to insert dangerous items into your baggage. As far as i'm aware there are no more checks on your checked in baggage. The procedure is flawed. Then comes the second stage of security as you enter the departure lounge where your hand baggage is checked and you as a person. My sister got through with a nail file in her bag. In my opinion as long as you look like you're not a threat to the safety of the hundreds of passengers you're about to fly with you'll get through with anything. The security procedures here need to be over-hauled.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

They did not have a wide selection of restaurants to choose from. Our flight was a final destination flight but we had to change airlines to reach our actual final destination. To do this we had to travel to the other side of the airport check-in and then re pass through security. We were inside of the airport facility but still had to go through the process of the security check. Also our baggage which was supposed to be put on a belt at the baggage claim was instead put in a room without our knowledge. We were lucky to ask the right person about it and it was found.

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,Marc Guillemard,France,2014-03-31,"This review is regarding terminal 2G. This is important as performance varies a lot in this huge and very heterogeneous airport (although never outstanding). 2G is dedicated to ""Schengen"" flights (to and from countries under the Schengen agreement no passport control) for the AF group. For commuting passengers it is important to know that the usual commuting nightmare at CDG is a the worst if one of your flights is from this terminal as it is far away from the other ones and the only access is a bus shuttle. When you fly from this terminal the positive point is that queues both at luggage drop off and at safety control are usually very short. Also positive is the fact that you walk to the (small max is 100 seaters) planes to board like in a small provincial airport. Now the negative points: I don't know who selected the food ""services"" in CDG. Except for 2 decent places in the whole 9 terminals it is always bad but the only one in 2G is just terrible and much too expensive for what it is eat a sandwich at the small stand before safety control if you can. The terminal itself is bland and as everywhere in CDG the seating is insufficient. They call the doors in theory 20 minutes before boarding but manage to be a little late making boarding more mess that it should be. The AF lounge is ridiculously small not very comfortable and with minimum amenities. This is supposed to be a place where you don't stay long but you need to always take a good safety margin when you drive to the Paris area so waiting here is not a very pleasant experience. Luggage unloading is quicker than on other terminals but too long for small planes that are sitting ""next door"".",NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

We knew that traffic could be bad on Friday afternoons so booked the security express lane at a cost of £6 for the two of us. On arrival at 15.45 we had to join a queue in a temporary tunnel - which moved very slowly. When we reached the boarding pass desk situated below a sign saying ""Express Lane"" that was blocked. Staff member said they only have one lane. We joined the lengthy queue and eventually got to the gate at 16.32 (gate closure was 16.35). We watched another teenager who had inadvertently left something in a pocket that triggered the scanner alarm be treated with a similar attitude but with added obvious annoyance and eye rolling. My wife has had a similar attitude from security staff over the size of the liquids bag which she had carried on 3 other flights to and from USA. This is completely unacceptable but passengers have little time to complain there and then. Other passengers in the queue noted this indifferent hostile behaviour and said that it was typical for this airport. The express lane was sold to me a few days before the flight but we almost missed our flight because it didn't operate and security was so slow and inefficient. Surely the express lane is needed when alterations are being carried out causing extra delays? I realise that the express lane is no guarantee of getting through faster but it does reduce the stress of getting to the gate on time until the point when it is withdrawn and the staff at the airport have no idea what to do.

That having been said the taxis are ridiculously cheap by western standards (about the equivalent of UKP5 from Longyang Road to Yanchang Road in the old city about a 40-minute ride). Secondly the check-in desk for my return flight didn't open until two hours before departure time and although the airside lounge has a good range of shops and eateries there's not much on the landside.

The restaurants and bars are a bit on the expensive side but what airport is not. The toilets are clean and the airport did not seem crowded at all. The only problem is the long walk from Terminal three (the new one) to the old terminal. I found the sign posting hard to follow and it is a lot of walking up and down. This would be the drawback for the new terminal as I personally found the old Emirates terminal crowded and unpleasant but this one is much better.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,3,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Wendy R London,New Zealand,2013-08-20,Comments apply only to the Domestic Transfer desk at AKL - the rest of the operation at AKL is excellent. My husband and I arrived at AKL on EK 406 (First Class) on 8 August and once we cleared customs with our luggage went to the transfer desk to check-in and leave our luggage for our domestic connection NZ 445 to WEL. There was one family group of 4 ahead of us and one person at the check-in desk (a second one soon arrived). The desk agent refused to check us in telling us that we had to use one of the two check-in kiosks. At the time the family were attempting to use both kiosks and were having trouble the desk agent still refused to manually check us in saying that if that family could do it so could we. The desk agent still refused to help despite the fact that even by then there was no one else in the queue. My concerns are: There are only 2 kiosks and their position â€“ make it very difficult for more than one or two people to queue up to use it. Unlike the domestic terminal there are no staff members positioned near the kiosks to help. My great fear is the congestion which would occur if the remaining pax from our A380 had reached the transfer desk at that time or indeed if more than one aircraft landed at the same time producing more transfer pax. Upon arriving at AKL we had just flown 15 hours not including our MEL lay-over. Frankly we were too tired to have to deal with horrifically sub-standard customer service. This complaint is not about being a premium pax or a non-premium pax. It is about a serious lack of customer service for all passengers transferring at our major gateway airport.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

There is no way to drop off passengers without going to/through the express parking. There are hundreds of cars squeezed in all at the same time 90% of them unloading passengers and baggage while blocking the flow. Access signage on the highway is more than poorly done.

Passport control process changes all the time without any obvious reason. Loads of staff walking around or chatting in groups but not working. The passport queue is a joke with people cutting in line or jumping the queue. Immigration is a three ring circus pay no attention to the signage it means nothing.

(16 flights per day nowadays). The domestic terminal of recent days was International Terminal 1 (1980s~2001) so I think the passenger terminal is spacious enough and the structure is pretty simple you wouldn't miss your way. From 2004 KORAIL (the Korean Railway Corporation) begins the KTX( the high-speed train) service so KAL and JAL devote themselves to promoting people to use their fleet but the result is ""decreased domestic flight schedule"". So Gimpo Airport is not so crowded during weekdays (except early-morning of Monday and Friday evening). The interior decoration is modern and illuminance is well. Above all Koreans have the thought that the toilet makes the entire image of the building so you would be surprised at the cleaness of the toilets inside the terminal.

The toilets were unclean on returning the walkways were dirty with rubbish everywhere. To get through customs people with new passports were directed to massive queues with only a few gates open. Two people were on hand but they just stood pointing and gave no assistance to people when their passport wouldn't scam! They only offered help to non - English speakers!

This area is roomy and spacious with good seating and several shops and cafes of high quality. Clean toilets which had been recently refurbished and the time passed quickly. No queuing for check-in and security was managed efficiently with a minimal wait. Passed straight through one of the automated gates for EU passports again with no delay. After T3 passport control there are many more shops to pass the time and good eating facilities (although avoid Venchi with it's exceptionally rude staff) not many seats though although you will find some near the 'H' gates at the far end and again in the 'G' area once you have transitioned via people mover. If your flight leaves from the 'G' gates it is a good idea to take the people mover about an hour before departure as there is more seating there and additional shops to explore.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,C Whiteley,United States,2014-07-06,This airport has plenty of pros and cons. I was visiting India for two weeks with a group of friends flew in here from Newark on 23 June and flew out early on 5 July. Flying in was relatively painless. It was a bit hot inside the terminal but considering that this is India that's to be expected. At least the terminal does have AC. Passport control and customs were fairly efficient and the wait to get our bags wasn't that bad either. My only complaint would be the wifi. More on that later. So overall this looked like a pretty good airport flying in. Very beautiful terminal nice staff short lines. Seems like a decent airport. Flying out is where this airport can turn into a nightmare if you're not prepared. If you're planning on flying out of this airport have a copy of your flight itinerary on you or you won't even be allowed in the front door. Also if security decides to do a 'random' screening on you expect to get delayed by 30-45 minutes. Also be warned that this airport does have a second security screening at the gate. After security though the shopping selection is amazing. However the wifi here is practically useless. Sure it's there but it's very poorly thought out. First off it requires you to enter your mobile number as a login. Then you have to enter a security code which the system will text to your mobile number in order to connect. This defeats the purpose of 'free' wifi if you ask me. Anyway the system is likely broken as I used 3 different numbers with international texting and did not receive a text from the system. In the end I just gave up. Pros: Short lines Spectacular terminal Nice staff Great shopping selection Good signage. Cons: Bumbling and bureaucratic security. Second security check at gate. Unusable wifi also wifi that expects international travelers to have international coverage effectively defeating the purpose.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

The boarding gate areas were almost always crammed and stressful places. The terminal seems to have very few good shops and poor information on arriving flights. In fact no information was available for arriving flights on any monitors I could find. I was looking to see how delayed my colleague's flight was on an arrivals monitor but cound not find one anywhere including the American Airlines- One World Admirals Club lounge (although the staff there were very helpful). Another reason for referring to arrivals monitors is to assess how honest the departures monitors are - eg: if the arriving aircraft from a certain airline is running many hours late it would be unlikely if its associated departing flight was on time. I found the general staff overly officious the business lounges incredibly small and crowded (don't use the Iberia One World Lounge - it reminded me of a very small regional airport lounge in Australia) and the restaurant and food outlets extremely limited.

Not quite as bad as the inhuman misery of Marseilles- Provence but not far off it. Laughably it is called Billi - are we supposed to feel better about being treated like cattle if the shed has a stupid name? As you enter leave your dignity at the door you are now a piece of self-loading freight. They have not wasted money on seats information screens (there appeared to be one) staff computers and other luxuries. Surprisingly they have found the money for a 'duty free' shop (most prices seemed higher than in the supermarket). You will stand in queues with your luggage to show your boarding pass passport and of course a good 20 minutes at the 'gate' (ie a door). What really puzzles me is why they have done this; I have used the main terminal at Bordeaux several times with low cost airlines and found it perfectly adequate and not overstretched - why is 'Billi' necessary? I can only assume it is about putting people in their place and if you are a low- cost passenger that place is beneath contempt. If the people who design these horrible places read this have you ever tried using one of your terminals under normal circumstances? Probably not you are too busy enjoying the business class lounge. If you are responsible for managing one ditto and put someone who knows what they are doing in charge; also invest in some new technology - checking people by hand went out about 20 years ago at most airports.

It took around 15 minutes for them to put the stairs in place for us to leave the aircraft and we then had to queue for at least 45 minutes at immigration in a line that reminded me of zombies in a horror film slowly trudging and being shouted at by incomprehensible staff. Oh well we thought - at least we our bags will already be there. Not a bit of it! Luton's Piece de Resistance was to keep us waiting for around two hours for our bags along with passengers from at least four other flights. There was no explanation and only two announcements (thanks for your patience) in that time. I frequently travel worldwide and I state with confidence that Luton is an awful national embarrassment of an airport.

Contrary to what the posh departure terminals seem to convey the arrival terminal is cold and unfriendly. The staff are rude and unhelpful.

After a 10.5 hour flight from Paris my wife and I got to an arrivals hall that was absolutely jammed. We were marshalled around by nasty airport employees who had no problem screaming at people for not moving fast enough in the interminable queue. This was more like arriving in a backwater rather than in one of the primary gateways to the world's leading economy. Are we not welcome? After 90 minutes we got through amidst crying babies and numerous other distressed weary travelers. Once through passport control we collected our luggage which had been piled up with the rest of the flight's baggage in the middle of the claim area as the carrousels needed to be freed up for other arriving flights. Then we had to queue up for another 30 minutes to get through another control which consisted of an officer looking at our customs declaration and waiving us through. Add another 1.5 hours to deal with the inefficiency of the car hire company and we were on our way. From airport exit to airport exit close to 4 hours.

Like all BAA airports the concept of providing a customer service is completely alien to the company owning the airport instead they treat it as a cash cow with the intention of extorting every penny from the passengers passing through. The seating area airside is woefully inadequate but this is because approximately 1/3 of the available area is taken up with a very expensive noisy and smelly World Shopping retail outlet which you have to walk through to reach the departure lounge. Mitchell's Bar upstairs (airside) is eye-wateringly expensive; £4+ for a watery pint of beer upwards of £5 for a glass of wine overpriced food and snacks etc - even a packet of crisps is around £1. This airport's only saving grace is it's convenience and proximity to the mainline railway.

Through security there is plenty of shops and food outlets at the time cleanliness was not the best but I was there at the busiest time of day.

Many booths were open and there was a courteous lady directing people where to go she even allowed me to use the US citizens only lane for some reason!

The departure process has improved and the departure lounge could use updating. The air-conditioning system has significantly improved and is cooler and more consistent. The arrival process has also improved and this time around I was not too harassed by the bribers; I didn't see much of that on arrival however Ghanaians living abroad are still subjected to minor harassments and covert bribery attempts on both arrival and departures by staffers checking baggage and performing unnecessary baggage checks in attempts to part with travelers belongings.

Bushes and other attempted adornments neglected. Even the car parks looked dis-organised. The check-in facilities were opened too early and closed too soon. This inconvenienced and upset four of my fellow passengers. This was the fault of the young female administration staff who need better training and courtesy. The elderly male security staff are too severe giving the impression that you are entering/leaving a third world former communist country.

There is no warning whatsoever until you are within 20 metres of the only entrance into the Passenger Terminal which is at a traffic light controlled crossroad. The approach road from each direction is understandably designated as a no parking zone but once there one has no choice but to turn into the Airport Car Park unless you are prepared to do a 3-point turn in the road - which I will do next time. I took my complaint to the Customer Services Desk and was met with a good deal of weary autotalk about how 'all airports were doing the same every since the Glasgow bombings' - I don't think so. These charges are in my opinion made in the most devious and dishonest manner with passengers and their lifts having no option but to pay for merely being however momentarily on the airport land.

Baggage took more than an hour to make it onto the belt - you don't need a new airport for that.

Baggage came very quickly on one of the three belts the queues at X ray were short to leave customs (checking for alcohol and other goods) and we were quickly out into the fresh air to walk the 100m to our boat to take us to our live aboard. Checked-in for our return flight was very easy. The airport seemed quiet even though there were a number of flights leaving within the next few hours. There were very short queues at the security check to get into the terminal and no queues at the Sri Lankan desk. Wifi is available but it is of the pay a lot as you go variety. There are no flight announcements so you have to watch the screens. Airside there is a cafe (US$ preferred surcharge for local currency) plus a range of shops selling items you need and do not need and duty free goods at reasonable prices. For me the airport worked well and was reasonable to use.

There is even a metro station directly at the airport so there is no need for a taxi if you don't want to spend $20 for a ride. The one setback is that DCA is served only by regional U.S. carriers and Air Canada.

We had to add an extra bag at the last minute which involved paying Ryanair a surcharge. After waiting about 45 minutes at the help desk and watching staff disappear for about 10 minutes at a time or watching them have long phone chatty conversations and apparently achieving nothing I complained. This was greeted with rude dismissal by a young women manning the desk. We only managed to get the bag paid for by going to a different aisle. This is not service. We were then subjected to aggressive rudeness at the security check by a member of staff managing the supply of boxes for the scanner. In this case I made a compliant to his manager who appeared to take it seriously. Finally there was a walk through a huge shopping mall largely void of customers to arrive at an overcrowded departures area. The problems here are compounded by only announcing the departure gate 15 minutes before closure thus keeping passengers in the food and shopping areas as long as possible. This then results in a dash to the departure gate. Stansted airport is both a stressful and chaotic place. Never again!,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

kolkata-airport,/airport-reviews/kolkata-airport,Kolkata Airport customer review,Arnab Sengupta,NA,2006-05-31,Arrival – The airport terminal corridors look ancient and poorly painted with uncomfortable smell of old air-conditioners you have to be guided by airport staff for the baggage collection area as the signs were not prominent. Baggage Collection took a long time got delayed due to abrupt stopping of conveyer belt for sometime though started again eventually. Customs officials do take their own time but probably within acceptable limits. What is much appreciated is the officials don’t harass you unnecessarily (for money) unlike other airports like Mumbai/Delhi. This is why I prefer this airport as entry point to India. The exit points after green channel can be crowded depending upon how many flights have arrived. When you step outside make sure you have someone waiting for you otherwise book a pre-paid taxi before leaving (always ask the staff inside the airport in case of confusion). Otherwise taking a taxi outside can be a big pain and there are always aggressive touts waiting to pounce on you. Departure – The visitors lounge is small and looks ancient. The checking is average although the officials are good and helping provided you ask for assistance. The waiting lounge smells cigarette and this is because people can smoke at one corner with the smell spreading around. Also it is very cold at night as the air-conditioner is not climate controlled adding to discomfort. In both cases the passengers are taken to the plane through buses instead of aerobridge. The toilets are ok but not clean or modern. Don’t expect anything from duty-free shop. Security is very tight. Overall comment – Needs modernisation in terms of facilities and infrastructure upgrade. But this won’t bother you unless you are staying long within the airport. What is more important is that the officials won’t hassle you unnecessary unlike other airports and this is what matters to you when you are travelling in India.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I arrived in Mexico through SLP but did not depart from this point thus my experience is based on arrivals only (However I could see almost the entire airport anyway). Upon arrival I was greeted with very friendly immigration officials. I left my information documents that I was given to fill out en-route on the plane I didn't realise until I got the counter and went to hand them over. The friendly official was extremely helpful and gave me replacements and helped me fill it in as I looked tired. My bags arrived very quickly through the small carrousel and I was able to pick them up and move to a customs check point. At this point you are randomly picked for checks. I was picked however I was dealt with by another very friendly and helpful official who made me feel very welcome to Mexico. Finally I took a taxi to my hotel. Once out of the control area there is an area with information and helpers on hand to get you a well priced taxi or bus into town.

Time taken to clear through security for four adults was about 15 minutes with mainly helpful security staff.

It is light bright airy and wonderfully free of the normal hustle and bustle of a modern airport. Checking in took three minutes; passport control and security about the same - they have new full body scanner.

plymouth-airport,/airport-reviews/plymouth-airport,Plymouth Airport customer review,N Fotheringill,NA,2008-05-29,Plymouth is a nice little airport with friendly staff. Not much point in arriving too early - the check-in does not open until an hour before your departure. The cafe is just by the check-in and there is a further landside lounge with the aforementioned free internet. There is just the one airside gate so if there are two flights at once you have to take your turn. Once through security there is a soft drinks vending machine but no other catering. All the seating areas have views over the apron. Everything seems to happen efficiently and with that personal touch that is lacking with other larger airports.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There is a new customs area for the departure flights even though there were counters for about 30 agents there were only about 6 on at the time. The queue took 10-15mins to get through. Annoying going through duty free to get to any gate and annoying staff members trying to sell anything. The facilities are very basic no free internet and have to pay a lot to access it.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,David Boyland,United Kingdom,2014-09-06,I have used Stansted around 50 times. I will never use it again. Here are just a few observations 1) The official long term car park had to wait around 30 minutes for a bus. If the bus does not arrive we could miss the flight. 2) The security check process is a joke longest lines I have ever seen. The feelings growing that we are going to miss our flight. 3) Once you get through security you are then forced IKEA style to wander through a narrow maze of 'not duty free' shops. Now convinced we will miss our flight. A horrible feeling. I don't know if it's just me but I go to an airport to catch a plane that's why I go there. If you have trouble walking or standing for hours it would be an absolute nightmare. As far as I can see none of this relates to the airport redevelopment. It's the way it's going to be.

In addition to the too-tiny baggage carousel the Virgin Blue check-in area needs to be rearranged a bit. The queue for computerized check-in became entangled in the queue for the baggage drop. The computerized check-in area needs to be moved further away. I also appreciated the centralized booking desk for the shuttles to town.

Even though it's the newest of MAN's three terminals it clearly wasn't designed for the current levels of passenger throughput: huge queues snaking back from passport control on arrival and only two out of six desks were manned. Obviously this is a Border Agency issue but as most flights at this terminal operate to/from EU countries - and the same scenario is replicated at airports across the UK - surely it would make sense for the British government to finally join the European majority and sign the Schengen agreement?,NA,NA,NA,6,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,W Gilbert,United States,2012-07-13,I had an unpleasant experience for the most part at Barajas. Signage is poor. It took me a good 45 minutes to get to my BA departure gate after arriving on Iberia (fortunately my connecting flight was delayed). I had to take two trains and go up several escalators before finding my gate only to learn the gate had been changed after I became concerned that there were no other passengers or ground staff at my gate 1/2 hour before the scheduled departure time. Nobody told me the gate had been changed and there were no messages showing the gate change. I had to ask a staff member at another gate. There was very little in the way of food available nearby and what was available was very expensive. Pay-as-you-go Wifi was very confusing if you were not fluent in Spanish and the information desk was largely unhelpful and unfriendly. To top it all off my check-in luggage was left outside in the rain and was sopping wet upon my arrival at Heathrow. This is by far the worst airport I've experienced in Europe. Of all the airports I've flown through Nairobi-Kenyatta is the only one that ranks below Barajas in my opinion and only because it's much older.,NA,NA,NA,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Its a nice terminal since T2 is in complete renovation and I suspect they will return there and T3 is only Egyptair and Star Alliance. Arrival was on time but many passengers as there were 2 planes from Saudi Arabia. Bags already waiting and out in no time. Taxis hunting for arrivals so a good idea to avoid them and take an official taxi to avoid rip off. NO Sky Priority for any Business class passengers. Departure was a breeze at check in. No priority fro C class passengers at passport control. Couple of nice shops and cafes. The C class lounge is quiet and nice with non-functional internet which managed to irk most guests. The holding boarding gate is too small to hold a full B777 so it caused great discomfort to passengers and the numerable carts and wheelchairs. Very claustrophobic. Bussing to and the terminal is OK.

The worst aspect of it for me was the 50 metres my elderly mother had to walk in the icy wind from the only drop-off point to reach the terminal (200 metres to International Arrivals). There is neither roof nor windbreak. Wheel chairs are available only once you reach the terminal. Have a look at Auckland: out of the car/taxi/bus - into the terminal; Singapore Wellington and thousands of others including the old Christchurch airport the same. What genius designed this in Christchurch? The regional terminal is a zoo with grossly inadequate facilities - especially seating - to service the volume of passengers. The old airport used to be pretty good - perhaps a bit of a mess in terms of design but it had a lot of character and history behind it. The new(ish) International Lounge area is also good with lots of glass and natural light and good passenger facilities.

There is a coffee outlet and a news shop out there near the check in desks. And you can go outside. The airport operator plans to demolish the blue hangar to the left of the terminal building and to re-develop the whole terminal area. When? I think within the next couple of years.

Shopping is ok the queuing for immigration and baggage took about half an hour. Also one can check in baggage at KL Sentral railway station (for MH and some other airlines as well - it works). My main issues are twofold. First the security screening at the gates can be quite slow - a lot of people at once - when it might work better to have one screening point. Second the free wifi coverage is poor when you can get it to work at all and the free Internet terminals weren't working.

I (and I'm sure many of the other reviewers) have entered more than one other country as a foreigner (as well as the US through other airports) and so will have a fair idea of what to expect from immigration control officials. I witnessed an incident of an officer being unduly rude to a fellow traveller in a similar way to an incident in a previous review so this must not be all that isolated or unusual. Waiting times for baggage and to go through other security areas could also be improved. I was not there at a particularly busy period and yet waiting times were significantly longer than one would expect from an airport of this size. Further signage and direction finding must be improved. There were several information points around the airport that would have probably been helpful if there had been anyone at them.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,R Woodward,Australia,2013-01-02,I have travelled through the airport a few times for international trips over the past years. Depart from here has always been quite a smooth affair especially on Jetstar who seem to have extra short waiting times for check-in. Departures section is well-lit comfortable and easy to navigate. Deletion of the upstairs observation decks and windows to the food court on Level 1 are a sad move but place no impact on overall operations. Departures staff seem to be kind. International arrivals however are a completely different story. While they have added extra parking spaces for A380 aircraft's the immigration and customs facilities have become smaller and slower. MEL has the worst arrivals experience I have experienced more so than airports like Manila and Dhaka. On my most recent return to Australia it took 2 hours to clear immigration with the queues stretching through to the duty free section. Arrivals staff are rude and impatient hardly a welcoming face for first time foreign visitors. This is before we even get to the building itself which has almost no windows on the lower levels along with low ceiling heights cold lighting and an industrial-feel ambience. There is a real need for extra customs and immigration space (not just extra aircraft gates). The existing building has served us well over the past 40 years but is now outdated and unable to cope with the capacity demands of modern high-capacity aircraft. Other side notes are the over-priced parking and lack of meaningful (and affordable) public transport to and from the city 25kms away.

Having been an ill-fated passenger of XL last year my colleague and I were faced with a six hour wait at the airport before we were flown home.

kigali-airport,/airport-reviews/kigali-airport,Kigali Airport customer review,J Yap,NA,2007-05-16,A small efficient and fairly modern-looking airport. Immigration and customs on arrival was quick and painless. Departure was similarly painless although the layout can be misleading. We walked into what looked to be the main hall (where banks and foreign exchange bureaus were located) but the check-in counters are actually located through doors located more toward the side of the terminal building. After security and check-in I encountered the friendliest immigration official I had ever met who asked me about my impressions of Rwanda and said he hoped I would return. There is an upstairs restaurant where I sat with my colleagues until the airport staff actually came round to gather the passengers for our flight to Entebbe - apparently everyone had checked in and so we left 20 minutes early!

Great shopping along all of the 4 primary concourses with a city ordinance that prohibits shops from charging more than main street prices.

Inbound no issues & would agree with comments elsewhere re easy access to the rail network etc. Travelling home was a very different story the lounges are not airside of security & there was no indication of the length of time to get through the security checks. So we were called for the flight and then faced with just two open security channels and very long queues. Other customers waiting indicated this was often the case & no effort ever made on the part of the airport authority to improve things. There was no effort on the part of the staff to speed things along and their attitude was simply one of why should we care. We did make the flight I believe only as result of BA being prepared to wait and we were not the last on board. Overall a very unpleasant experience,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The worst things about the old Bali airport have moved across very comfortably to the new airport. Rude and arrogant immigration and customs officials. Deliberately lengthy immigration queues which always then have the option of paying extra to get through quickly. Ridiculously restrictive alcohol rules again so you can pay your way a round them. Endless hassling by porters. Then you end up in a beaten up taxi with a rude taxi driver charging you too much and taking too long.

Arrival was as horrid an experience as I have encountered in the US. After my plane landed about 2 hours late I found myself at the end of a long snaking queue for immigration. As a non-US citizen it took me almost an hour to reach an agentâ€™s desk. Ahead of me was an elderly man about 80 far too polite to ask to go to the front of the queue who was clearly in some distress. After I got through immigration I waited for half an hour for my bag to reach the designated carousel. On a trip to the restroom I found my bag with others piled up on the floor. The carousel screen was wrong and all the bags from my flight had been delivered. To my surprise my return trip from Dulles went just fine.

As others have said there is a security control at each gate so allow plenty of time to wait in the security queue for your flight. Most likely you'll be bussed to the terminal.

However the visual description of how to use them is not great! There was one man trying his best to assist people. After showing my passport I then had to pass into the next section but the gate did not open? I then heard a man yelling at me that I should come back and stand on the picture of the feet (which I had not seen because I was looking into the lens which scans your face) he then shouted to myself and other customers that 'it was not rocket science'. At this point I realised that it was a security guard leaning with his colleague outside the barriers shouting. I made my objection to the security guard about how he was treating people for which I received no apology he merely stated that he was not shouting at me but someone else. I was then told to 'go away' both verbally and with a wave of the hands!

The departure after our visit went much better in the late evening at Terminal B but could not compensate for the arrival experience: Trying to follow the partially missing signage I got lost immediately behind the entrance but apparently for compensation there were lots of support personnel placed in the entrance area which could be asked to show the way.

In short if you can avoid Manila do so as Manila airport is the worst. While Cebu is so quiet after a long haul flight and outside the taxi service and approach is managed well.

If you point out to a member of staff that you are going to miss your flight expect them to me very rude and totally unsympathetic (even though it is totally due to the airport's very poor organisation). When I flew from Frankfurt today I witnessed two separate members of staff being appallingly rude to several people. Fortunately I was not one of them but it was still extremely distasteful to watch.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,S Grynkewich,Philippines,2012-09-10,"Hong Kong International Airport is supposed to be one of the region's leading airports - and indeed it was and had been for a number of years after its opening. However I traveled through the airport twice in the last month and found it to be becoming crowded and on the second visit found the security screening slow inefficient and rude. So much so that the passenger behind me called it ""out of touch"". I agree. My flight arrived at around 6.30am from a long overnight run from Vancouver. Apparently security screening services are drawn down in lean hours - and this was surely the case. Tired from our trip we had to walk a long way to go through security screening as transit passengers (why such screening is necessary is never made clear and the rude security people don't answer questions). There was a line of well over 100 passengers some visibly annoyed that certain other passengers appeared to be jumping the line. When I finally reached the point of being ""screened"" I placed my things on the conveyor and walked towards the metal detector. I was told to stop for some unknown reason. When I asked why the security ""person"" rudely told me: ""don't ask"". It's time that Hong Kong authorities recognize that security is a two-way street. Passengers will co-operate if screening is professional and courteous. Passengers will not co-operate when screening is unprofessional and rude.",NA,NA,NA,3,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The check in counters have a weird system where you have to take your bag to another location at the airport to get it checked when you have checked in at the counter it would surprise me if everybody in the security queue were able to catch their flight in time as it was so slow that it almost took all the 2 hours that you got from check-in counters opening to the flight leaving just to get through the security queue.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Returning the Hertz rental car was joke also. Poor signage a random parking spot if you can find one and then deal with people that can't speak English well enough to assist with billing questions. Inside the terminal the signage directing you to check in is inefficient. If you don't know where your going good luck figuring out where the US flights check in. They love numbering the check-ins but don't tell you which airline is at what number. Be prepared to hike your bags a long way to check in then hike your carry-ons the full length of the terminal to a poorly mark Stairwell with the single broken escalator.

I would like to see a good airport hotel or 2 and a better expressway out to the city. Air Canada needs a better lounge.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,C Tovey,United Kingdom,2013-12-29,My daughter was due to fly to Edinburgh on Christmas Eve at 8.50am. Bad weather and electrical failure coupled with floods delayed most flights. Thousands were delayed but some flights were leaving. As the day wore on her flight was shown as active and she waited until 5pm when the gate was opened. She sat a further 3 hours at the gate and then the board showed that the flight had been cancelled. At this point all the easy jet staff turned off the lights and left together with the majority of staff from the airport. Thousands were left stranded and police were called and agreed that the situation was unacceptable. Will never use it again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
guatemala-airport,/airport-reviews/guatemala-airport,Guatemala Airport customer review,Norman Clark,NA,2004-05-30,I go through Guatemala City's La Aurora airport several times each year and am always discovering shops services and other pleasant surprises tucked throughout the terminal which I had overlooked on my previous visits. The only major drawback to La Aurora is that passenger traffic has outgrown available space. During the peak hours -- especially in the early morning -- there is simply nowhere to put the additional staff that could handle the passengers. This can produce a badly overcrowded and somewhat confusing check in area and long lines. Having to go to a separate (and somewhat obscurely located) line to pay a $3 airport security tax produces yet another line but it moves very quickly. These problems can usually be avoided by avoiding an early morning departure and taking a late morning or early afternoon flight. Once you get checked in and have found where to pay your security tax you will be in for a most welcome surprise. The terminal has some of the best shopping in Latin America ranging from tiny shops packed with local crafts at very low prices to the more typical upscale duty free merchandise. There are coffee bars and snack bars throughout -- both before and after passport control.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
tokyo-haneda-airport,/airport-reviews/tokyo-haneda-airport,Tokyo Haneda Airport customer review,Olivier Ragu,NA,2008-01-24,As a heavy user of this airport I find it clean and very well organized. Convenient facilities easy and fast access. (15 min train for monorail from central Tokyo). You can arrive 15 min before your flight at security checks and still make it thanks to seamless check in procedure. With SkipIt for ANA IC for JAL you can even avoid check-in machines or manned counters. Fast security lanes and friendly staff. Boarding very well organized either for JAL or ANA  the main carriers. Shopping and Restaurant extensive landside but after security not so many choices - but you normally stay long in the waiting rooms! You still have restaurants cafeterias or have a drink at a vending machine at an affordable price to be compared to LHR CDG or other airports. Baggage claim very fast and they check your baggage tag so no stress about someone else picking your luggage. All in all for an airport with more than 40 million passengers coming through it is more than satisfactory.,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

havana-airport,/airport-reviews/havana-airport,Havana Airport customer review,Julie Baxter,United Kingdom,2014-02-20,We have just returned from another visit to Havana after loving the place when we visited in Feb 13. The airport experience was much worse this time than last time. The taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong terminal but it was ok as we were still able to get to the correct terminal (3) prior to check in time. Check in opened and it took us around 1.5 hours to check in and we were about a 3rd of the way in to the queue so you can imagine how long it was for the people at the back! Luckily through previous experience we knew we had to check in prior to queuing to pay tax as otherwise that can waste your time! We queued for about 15 mins to pay tax then about 15min to change cash as we cannot change CUC back to sterling here. The woman at the change counter only had £20 in sterling so we had to have the rest in euros. Then to join the unmoving sea of people trying to get through immigration - there was 5 flights I think going during the same couple of hours and there was people being called for flights who were still stuck trying to get through immigration! It was crazy just standing there watching booths closing for the night whilst 100's of people needed to get through to the other side! The immigration people just seem to do each person in very slow motion - you can't spend 5 minutes per person when there are 5 large airplanes full of people to get through! It got to 20.50pm and our flight was due to start boarding at 21.15! My partner pointed out to me that there was still people on our flight queuing up at check in! The service in the duty free shop was beyond a joke and people panicking about missing flights ended up yelling at the guy on the till to stop chatting to his workmate and get serving people quickly - it was the only place we could get snacks and water to take on the plane as the food and service on the plane was absolutely dire. Needless to say the flight was delayed by 30 minutes purely down to people having such problems getting through check in and immigration!

I saw many people coming back on themselves. Immigration is confusing with the signage. Immigration is quite fast (one positive). Getting your bags is badly organised and not clear where to go. Coming out of the gate which way do you go? If you go left the people waiting for you won't see you going right is the correct way to go and then you just hit a wall of people waiting. Food upstairs - not great over priced and I imagine in the position it is that the profits are not maximized by the number of people in the airport.

Domestic arrivals and departures use Terminal B only Terminal F is used for international arrivals and departures. Terminal B is around 300 metres from Terminal F is served by small 20 sealer free buses or you can take a 10 minutes walk if you are flying on elsewhere in Ukraine. It is true that staff are uninterested but that is the Eastern European way so far as service is concerned. It is also true facilities are lacking and catering wildly over-priced. Nevertheless I found it efficient enough. Give yourself plenty of time. My flight from Brussels was well handled and my bag on the carousel within minutes. You no longer have to fill in customs forms unless you are in possession of large amount of currency (ies) or bullion and the customs men were fine agreeable and English speaking. I had to take it to Terminal B and check in once more for my onward flight to Odessa. Terminal B has only one cafe where it cost 184 Hrivinas (about $18) for a toasted cheese sandwich and a pint of Stella Artois. They didn't even blush when asking this shameful amount! Coming back (you take the transfer bus waiting at the plane steps to Terminal F) although my bag was ticketed through to the UK I actually had to pick it up where the truck drops all the plane's luggage and check it in again just inside the building. There were no signs or announcements to explain this. It was when I got to that modern airport marvel Schiphol at Amsterdam my bag failed to get picked up for its last leg of the journey.

Getting out of the building an hour after touchdown is the best you can hope for especially if you're arriving with another international flight. When leaving Melbourne make sure you grab something to eat before you go airside because there is quite literally nothing once you're through unless you fancy a dodgy sandwich bar with grumpy teenagers behind the counter or an overpriced ""wine bar"" that would be better suited to downtown Melbourne than an airport where most people just want something well-priced and appetising. I'm not much of a fan of fast food joints but even a Hungry Jacks would be welcome in the departure lounge.

If you're flying Southwest or American you will have to endure this. Fortunately once you're through the security it's usually pretty easy - the gates are very close by if you're flying Southwest a bit of a walk if you're on AA. Food choices are limited to a Starbucks McDonalds and other fast food outlets. Terminal C is the older terminal that lacks airbridges and requires the passenger to walk out on the tarmac and go up some mobile stairs like in the old days.

It's all very quiet in the wee hours the police with their German shepherds is monitoring the airport (but not bothering you) and there are seats around that can even become makeshift beds for a couple of hours. A smaller drawback of the airport is that all the stores and restaurants are rather pricey. Though the quality of the food in the restaurants is (typical German) pretty good it lacks a bit of variety. Just the usual fare from Pretzels to Schnitzels. And the only major drawback are the many bus rides to the planes that you will have to take if you're a frequent traveler to/from Stuttgart. Taking a bus to the aircraft might not be such a big problem for passengers of the proliferating low cost carriers that operate out of Stuttgart such as HLX.COM but for the rest of us it's a hassle that we would rather avoid right?

We stood for 30 minutes on what was a short line of people (clerk was simply slow), to find that we could only weigh the luggage and get the tags and that we had to drop off the suitcases at another part of the airport. No signs anywhere to show you where drop off was. The Terminal is small, and lines so long, we had to fight to through lines of people to find the bag drop. Once there, we had another 40 minute wait and a line that snaked around half the airport, just to drop off the bag. Crazy! Next another 30 minute queue to go through security. Rude staff and poor organisation sum up this experience. As we were flying to a non Schengen country, we had to use a small lounge on the other side of passport control, which was so full we had to stand. The toilets were disgusting and the only shop was a coffee bar, whose young employee was on a go slow. To reach the aircraft you have to use stairs and buses. Our bus stopped half way and we were left stranded for 15 minutes on the tarmac in 36c heat. Overall this is a poor airport, that is dysfunctional in every way.

ljubljana-airport,/airport-reviews/ljubljana-airport,Ljubljana Airport customer review,Graham Brack,NA,2006-04-01,I like Ljubljana and have used it quite often. There has been some recent development so some of the older comments here would probably be revised. It's small and when a lot of flights arrive at once it can get quite crowded but for EU travellers immigration has added more gates and generally we're outside the airport within 20 minutes of landing complete with baggage. I've never had any problems with public transport - the drivers usually speak English and the fares are very reasonable - around €5 to Bled for example. Departures are relaxed in the sense that they allow check-in very late. In fact when we tried to book a taxi to get us there two hours before our flight they refused to come and insisted an hour would be more than enough - and they were right. For quite a few flights they walk you to the plane which may be only a short stroll from the terminal building. All in all one of my favourite little airports.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

For the first time I flew out late at night (Dec 9th at 1.15 am) and I was very disappointed to see pretty much all the restaurants closed even around 11 pm. Ones that were open had little selection. I understand that there aren't many flights departing at night but still. Also they had problems with bridge retracting that caused a 90 minute delay in departure (Chine Airlines to TPE). Upon arrival around 6 pm two or three big jets landed and the immigration lines were horrendous. That whole area seems to be a bit too small already.

I normally head to LHR but I was tempted to give LTN another try because it's 15 mins from my house by car. Big mistake. I didn't actually think the airport experience could get worse but it has. The short stay car park is a disgrace. It's outrageously expensive, full of potholes, signage that's confusing and faded and there's an obstacle to exit where mopeds are parked next to signs warning not to park there. The security is a joke. Today I had to queue 15 minutes at 4.45am. How can that be justified? Staff are completely disillusioned, rude and generally unhelpful. There is barely any seating in the departure 'lounge' and limited food outlets selling dreadful food but don't worry, there's plenty of space for a huge duty free shop and a shellac nail bar. The toilets are dirty and in a poor state of repair. The newly renovated arrivals area which seems nearly complete has clearly been designed by someone who is blind. The final slap to all customers is the utilitarian railings that force you to walk the length of the 40 metre arrivals room and then back again to exit. This airport doesn't give two hoots about delivering a reasonable customer experience. I won't be coming back.

Once past immigration there's only a small vat refund counter and 1 small shop in the boarding area. The boarding area has 4 gates 1-3 for the domestic while 4 was used for the international flights.

Outside the check-in area of Terminal 2 it seems to look like a domestic airport. Upon entering one can feel the humidity right away. Air-conditioning is not good especially with lots of people inside and the temperature outside. There is no wifi in the check-in area which makes it difficult for us who are waiting for long hours. They said there is wifi in the boarding area but still we are not able to connect. There is only a few selection of food/restaurants in the terminal and it takes ages to be served. Inside the boarding area there is only one cafe that serves very limited food item. Shops for souvenirs and other items are very less also inside the terminal. Toilets in the check-in area is quite tolerable compared to the ones in the boarding area. The toilet in the boarding area is very disgusting and I did not even dare to use the cubicles and just waited for the boarding to use the plane's toilet. I thought also that being inside the airport terminal is safe already but there are beggars everywhere asking for money which makes it quite scary for foreigners who have heard different stories about the city's safety. They ought to improve the security of the airport first and also do something about the comforts of the travellers especially the tourists who bring money to the country.

seattle-airport,/airport-reviews/seattle-airport,Seattle Airport customer review,Lijing Han,China,2010-01-31,"Connecting flights coming from overseas? Seattle airport is set up to receive only one type of connecting flight the kind where the airport of origin can tag your bags through to the final destination. However when coming from some developing countries where your final destination (in the US) cannot be on your international itinerary the airports will not tag your bags through to the final destination. As a result when exiting customs in Seattle and given the choice of leaving security or going the route of ""connecting flights"" one should choose to leave security and collect their bags at the baggage claim of their international airlines then recheck in with their domestic airline. If your domestic flight is not on the same itinerary as your international flight (eg. you booked it online but your international flight was bought overseas) then the connecting flight sky hops have no idea where to send your bag (it's not on the tag). The main reason for this is that they ""assume"" your bags are checked through to your final destination. They fail to ask this important question and do not realize that every customer does not have the background to distinguish that there are multiple kinds of ""connecting flights."" However if they do not ask you the airline and CITY where you want your bag to go it will be lost in the airport. The airport is not small and you will be walking back and forth between the international baggage claim and your domestic airlines trying to figure out where the bags went. This is a common problem at this airport as reported to me by the lost baggage clerk in San Diego. He said that military coming from Narita through Seattle have this issue all the time. If the Sky Hop does not ask you where you want your bag to go make sure you tell him. If he says ""we'll take care of everything"" make sure that you discuss the destination as part of the ""everything."" Most likely he will tell you to take your bag off of the conveyer belt that is headed to another airline and put it on the belt that will take it to the international baggage claim. (In Seattle after going through customs the passenger takes a tram to the other terminals but the bags go on special conveyer belts either to the next airplane or to the baggage claim). Please be careful. If you are not you may have a very difficult time finding your bag or anyone who knows where your bag went.",NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,Pete Bond,United Kingdom,2014-07-03,We travelled out and back into Stansted to and from Berlin. We chose Stansted because of price after not using the airport for several years due to previously bad experiences. On the way out was pleasant and effective although quite slow but nothing to complain about. Nice transfer from Hilton by bus convenient and easy. On the way back was a completely different story and the exact reason why I stopped using Stansted 5 years ago. The plane arrived 40 mins late so around 11.35pm the stairs arrived but no ground staff 20 minutes in and people getting quite annoyed late at night and a lot of people having connections to meet. When we were allowed off and boarded the bus we arrived at the drop off point where the bus driver had to get out and open the doors into the terminal for us with his pass. The queue along the corridor to access an escalator was shocking due to other planes arriving at the same time and the passport control was absolutely rammed. We used the e-passport gate which was poorly supervised and with one of the 5 out of order a lot slower than any other. Surely Stansted should have a much bigger number of these units given the growing number of e-passports and make sure they are well supervised! When I did use it the man at the front had to come out of his booth and ask me to get out of the booth because I had my bag on my shoulder it thought I was two people. In summary there is good reason why East Midlands Birmingham Luton and Heathrow remain head and shoulders above this airport. Maybe ownership has changed in 2013 but the management of the airport still seems poor and the infrastructure needs to get up to date with technology to stop looking like they are trying to fit a pint and a half into a pint pot.

Hand luggage was weighed although collectively they were well under the 7kg each allowance some were over some under so we had to open them and move clothes between them. To add insult to this the handle of one of them was above metal frame and we had to either leave it or pay a £24 check-in fee. We chose to leave it and distribute the contents between other cases. The girl on desk was very nice and patient and even told us to just move things from one case to other however the whole thing was bizarre because leaving Dublin there was no problem with luggage and going back the plane was only 1/3 full so a bag 2"" over limit was not really going to cause problems nor was any extra weight {which wasn't an issue anyway}.

Immigration was quick and painless and without the usual aggressive cross-questioning I get as a solo female traveller - a great relief. The information desk was open and the staff member helpful and I got a taxi into town almost straight away. The return leg was okay - KLM/NWA check-in is self-service and efficient - but was slightly dampened by the disorganised security staff (how many times must people show their boarding passes?!) and lack of choice of somewhere to eat after passport control; but eventually Houlihan's proved a reasonable option with friendly bar staff and quick service.

Hence London bags could not fit even when they eventually started to flow (after about 30 minutes). Not a Pearson person in sight to help in any way. Baggage reclaim at Pearson T1 is legendarily bad.

Occasionally one of their associates would interrupt them so work would stop while they had a laugh. The atmosphere in the hall was tense I was expecting a riot at one point.

At one point another operative came on duty and spent 5 minutes preparing taking off his coat cleaning his glasses sharpening his pencil etc. a lady clearly flustered late and stressed approached his window and was greeted with a tirade of abuse.

We found everything to be very well laid out with clear sign-age in both Chinese and English as well as most of the staff being able to speak enough English to help point us in the right direction. We arrived with 4 other flights and more staff were immediately added to process all of the travellers so that we did not have very long and booking into our next flight at the transfer desk was fast efficient and friendly.

Thank goodness we did not have hold luggage (we live out there) and that we checked in online as the queues were horrible! But despite some other reviews on here the toilets look new and clean. On arrival from Bristol we herded off the plane onto some awful cramped bus and driven at twice the speed of sound to the terminal which wasn't very comfortable as we had to stand up. On return to Heraklion (to fly to Bristol) it was worse. Our easyJet flight was called early but we did not know about this I just happened to go and look at the departure screen where it said in very small letters gate 6 (or something like that) but it didn't say boarding. We queued up at the back with another lady who same as us had paid for speedy boarding. One lady seemed to shout in Greek that speedy boarder's should come and stand by her at the front. She then tore up my boarding pass (no efficient cutter or anything) and then we were told to go and stand outside on the steps. 10 minutes later a bus came for the Gatwick passengers (whose flight was leaving 30 mins after ours!) and then finally 25 minutes later a bus came for us. Awful service at Heraklion! When we got onto the brand new easyJet plane to take us home (very pleased) we sat right at the front so very good legroom.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,D Hananel,United States,2013-02-14,Generally a good airport though rather uneven very good in certain aspects and with serious shortcomings in others. At one end if you fly Emirates on business this is a fantastic airport with huge lounges minimal or non-existent lines for check-in immigration and boarding. At the other extreme if you are using Terminal 2 you are stuck in a small crowded space with a couple of restaurants not entirely clean bathrooms and a very long transfer from other terminals in minibuses with space so limited that you cannot even stow carry-on luggage. Most experiences in Terminals 1 & 3 fall somewhere in between. Excellent shops and a wide range of restaurants but not much space to sit if you just want to wait for your flight without spending money.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

I eventually found our second bag amongst a pile of others that had been removed and dumped! There are a lot of improvements that could be made such as a single queue for immigration services by all the desks rather than the current shambles where you pick the queue you think will be the best - I'm able to use the locals queue but it's regularly a source of annoyance amongst other passengers! I've not had a problem with check in but we normally check in early and either visit friends or go for a drink. It can be hard after 8 hours in a plane from the UK to remember that you have arrived in a country where ""western"" ideas of timeliness and service aren't really going to fit in - my experience is that the airport staff have two speeds and if you don't like the one they are working at now you are going to hate the other one!

I use this every couple of months and the same comments largely apply. Security and passport control are fine at this time of the day and are done in about 10 minutes. Some of the boarding areas (B26-29 for example) have had the seating moved back to create more queuing space for lo-cost flights. In T1 as ever nothing whatsoever is open at 7am your only source of refreshment is vending machines. Quite a lot of the ongoing refurbishment now appears largely complete although I didn't see any of the promised 40 new shops and restaurants. Return was fine too with luggage arriving within 10 minutes - the absolute opposite of the terrible experiences of T4.

It took two hours to go through customs because there was only one agent processing passports. After an hour another agent showed up and then we were told there was a shift change. During that time more flights arrived from overseas only to wait as we did. At no time during that time were there any communications as to why the delay. Many of us had to have flights changed due to the Lufthansa strike so that caused delays and later flights to begin with. Ironically my husband who has a Global Entry Pass sailed through only to have to wait for me for two hours. Does this mean we all have to apply for one too to avoid this mess.

We were ushered into the immigration hall which was already extremely busy although several processing desks remained unmanned while several immigration officers congregated chatting in groups. Joined a queue which moved unbelievably slowly indeed three people ahead of us were held aside and then escorted away for secondary screening. When we finally made it to the top of the queue (after standing for 55mins) the immigration officer was unbelievably rude and discourteous. If anybody was on a power-trip this guy was. Although my visa-waiver form was completed he claimed he couldn't read the telephone number I had supplied and told me to rewrite it. When I asked to borrow his pen he snorted that he didn't give out his pen and told me to go ask another passenger to loan me one. What is it with US Immigration? - Do they deliberately employ a certain number of people who have never had a decent upbringing? After finally leaving immigration I collected my luggage only to have to join a queue about 75 people long that snaked through the luggage hall in order to clear customs. I then had to recheck my luggage (which thankfully can be done in TBIT) before heading the few hundred yards stroll to T4. Thankfully I made my connecting flight - but I was glad I had the 2.5hr connecting window. All in all a horrendous experience.

It saddens me how uninviting that place is. As an entry port to The USA it seems like a horrible way to welcome visitors. The dozen different immigration officers over the years have all been robotic. The bathrooms are nasty and the security lines long. When we were traveling with 2 young kids we still couldn't get ushered up the queue as we have often at other airports. The prices for food are also astronomical. I had to switch Terminals to get to Delta which is in Terminal 5 and the first time I was quite flustered when getting any direction on finding the correct shuttle bus to take. Sadly when making the trips this airport visit had simply been something that we had to deal with. Because of our past experience we are now pretty confident going through there since we know where we are going we can deal with it. To sum it up the main issue is the attitude of the staff.

mexico-city-airport,/airport-reviews/mexico-city-airport,Mexico City Airport customer review,N Taylor,Mexico,2011-05-04,I wouldn't normally write a review like this but after waiting almost two hours (standing up) for my in-laws a few days ago I wanted to share my renewed unhappiness with this airport. We would have been able to escape to the American Express lounge but unfortunately my hubby had forgotten his card. I am British but I live in Mexico City thus I have no choice but to grit my teeth and face this horrendous airport several times per year. I therefore also mainly travel through Terminal One. Terminal Two is a bit more pleasant in that it is newer but my review refers to T1. Departing from Mexico City is much better than arriving however it still leaves much to be desired. Taxis are good and inexpensive (make sure you pre-book to get a secure white/red taxi and never hail the green/white taxis or the red/gold taxis. The special sirport taxis are white and yellow and are also safe) and the airport is located in fairly close proximity to the city centre so in theory it should be fairly quck to arrive there. However with traffic in Mexico City it can take much much longer than expected so be aware of this to avoid missing flights. If you make your own way there by car strangely for a major airport it is not signposted until you are practically there so you need to be fairly sure of where you are going before you attempt this. It is also located in a fairly off putting and run down part of town so it is not the kind of place you want to get lost in. This also goes for leaving the airport. Parking can be difficult at peak times. Inside the airport - during the summer months the heat can be awful I am not sure if there is air conditioning or if it just doesn't function when needed. It can be tricky to get to where you want to go as Departures and Arrivals are very poorly signposted and the lay out is confusing. So far when I have checked in here I haven't had to wait too long as I always make a point of checking in online and getting there early and using the bag drop when I fly British Airways however we did face a bit of a queue flying with Iberia. I have not experienced too many going through security either so they have obviously organised outgoing flights a bit better than the incoming flights. Passing security facilities are fairly average. As other reviewers have said the terminal is fairly shabby and could do with a renovation but at the end of the day that would probably cause utter chaos. Some of the gates have absolutely no seating areas whatsoever so you basically just have to stand until you are able to board which can take a long time. Arriving in Mexico City - a completely different story and the main reason for the very low scores. Do not expect anything to happen quickly as several large European flights all arrive at almost exactly the same time every day (approx 7pm). Strangely after disembarking the plane arriving passengers are ushered through the arrivals lounge and all is a bit confusing. The queues at passport control are generally frightful and can take over an hour both in the line for nationals and non-nationals (after receiving conflicting information about which I should use as a holder of a Mexican Resident's Visa I have used both). Baggage claim is equally horrendous with several flights worth of baggage arriving on one carrousel whilst many others remain empty. Again there is limited airconditioning so it can be especially unpleasant in the warm summer months. After finally picking up your bags you then have to queue again to have all your luggage scanned (don't expect any help with this - I was travelling alone literally moving my life from London to Mexico City and had a significant amount of luggage as a result three members of staff simply watched while I struggled to load the cases onto the belt - same story when I took them out and put them back on the trolley) and they never open up all the scanners so again this can take a long time. After scanning your bags you then have to hit a button - green means go but if it comes up red you have to have your luggage inspected by an officer. This is also worth remembering when picking someone up do not rush to get there when the flight lands as it is a waste of time as they can take another two hours on top of that. Queues for taxis can be long especially if you need a larger vehicle and once in your car/taxi there is still Mexican rush hour traffic to contend with through a not-so-nice part of town.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Nothing was mentioned about this substantial amount before. 2) Intra-terminal Transport: Although there should be a shuttle between the terminals it did not work. Official employees advised me to take the taxi. Since the cab drivers want to rip you off mine wanted 800 php in the end although I resisted on using the taxometer.

The Alaska Airlines terminal shared with Northwest and AA's seasonal flights is quite nice and renovated. There are decent bars and restaurants and many good shops. Then there is the North Terminal - used by Delta Continental US Air and Air Canada. This was the former International Terminal used before Russian airspace opened up and before the 747-400 and 777 came along and eliminated the need for a refueling stop on flights from JFK to Asia and Heathrow - Asia. It is indeed a relic of the Cold War - a dirty dated claustrophobic mess that needs to be razed. There are no facilities whatsoever. Avoid Terminal N if possible.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Very professional staff who are keen to help and were extremely polite. Airport tax not a problem although I wasn't expecting it $28 to fly to Rio de Janeiro and $4 to Cuzco. Had to have a yellow fever jab to fly to Rio although not visiting the jungle area. Varig airlines wouldn't let us on without a certificate. Our fault as we thought we didn't need it as we were not going into the jungle area. But the medical centre at the airport was clean and efficient and we were back at Varig's desk within 20 minutes.

Perhaps the International Terminal has been upgraded but I didn't see any of the issues mentioned in the other reviews that raises some concerns about what our departure from France would be like. We typically arrive several hours early for an International flight and print our Boarding Passes the day prior to departure both of which makes life easier.

Toilet facilities are spotless building and amenities are clean. Airport security efficient and polite. Terminal 3 lounge is a good place to hang out. The airport is very large; so budget up to 20 minutes to walk to the distant gates. Alternatively use the travelator or the shuttle train. While the shopping opportunities are extensive and the sales staff excellent be aware that prices are a mix (some competitive some clearly not).

Anyone who wants a plain cheese roll/sandwich without industrial mayonnaise or antisocial onions is out of luck. The usual dank offerings are on sale. Everything is grossly overpriced. The croissants are quite nice but ludicrously expensive. The miniature ones are over a pound. Sometimes the selection is not available because the oven is churning out those tasteless muffins. There is no proper bookshop only a Smith’s. The choice of reading material is not inspiring. Luckily we’ve never been delayed much.

The people did not know what to do with us and we asked to be taken to the arrivals - a bus came in and took us to the right building. Got in the building - the Visa on Arrival person charged us more than what we should have paid for our visas (no receipts) and instead of the double entry which was on my LOI he put in single entry. I made him correct it. But he forgot to sign it which spelt trouble when I got back to Tashkent from Almaty. Nightmare did not stop there. 6 immigration booths in a 30 square meter area and with loads of people jostling around. Uzbeks don't know how to queue! Got pass it. And even when you are in the Green Zone everything should be declared including your iphone camera etc. This involves two back to back pages of customs declaration and 1.5 hours queue at the customs.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,K Chen,United States,2011-01-04,We flew out of this airport two weeks ago. It was the most frustrating airport experience that we've ever had. They have the doors leading to the check-in area blocked so it created a huge bottle neck of people trying to get to the check-in and baggage drop off areas in Terminal 1. There was a nice gentlemen who looked to be a manger. He stepped in and helkped us and even let us skip in the first class line. If it weren't for him we would have missed our flight. We got there 3 hours early and got through security and to our gate right as our flight was boarding. Security was ok but once we passed there was a second security set up for Lufthansa which took a long time to get through and we were number 4 in the line. Once we got on the plane we had to de-board because security had somehow messed up. So we spent another hour or so driving in circles on a bus around the airport before being taken back to the airport and had to go back through security. They were nice and let us through early since we had two small kids. Then we had to go back to the bus and wait for everyone to show up. Then we were taken back to the plane. After waiting to have the plane de-iced we finally departed. We arrived at our destination 5 hours later than what the itinerary was set for. We got there just in time to secure our rental and call the hotel before our reservation had been cancelled.

oslo-airport,/airport-reviews/oslo-airport,Oslo Airport customer review,P Laroche,France,2013-02-18,I've flown to Oslo several times within the past year. I don't understand why it take 30-40 minutes for the baggage to arrive on the conveyor belt. It makes it impossible to catch many of the scheduled connecting flights. Security is relatively fast compared to other airports (usually a 10 minute wait) but between waiting 40 minutes for your bags running through customs running upstairs going through security and running to your gate at the end of the long crowded corridors (without any conveyors) there is no chance to make connecting flights. The airline staff don't even seem surprised! The other problem with Oslo airport is that it is somewhat dirty. Not disgusting - but definitely not clean. Like many other airports in Europe the corridors and walkways are becoming ever more narrow as the duty free shops get wider and wider. Trying to get to your gate in the morning or evening is like an obstacle course. On the bright side the airport has relatively nice architecture.

Immigration and Customs staff were fine - not pleasant but not unpleasant! Road links to the tourist areas are good but check your map first to avoid taking a wrong turn! On the return leg the $3 dollar charge for a luggage trolley to transport your cases from the car hire drop off to the terminal (about 200ft) is a bit tacky. Priority check-in was good with polite staff. The departure lounge is OK with a reasonably stocked duty free shop. Didnt use the food outlets but they didnt look horrendously expensive. The one really stupid aspect of this airport is that all the gates appear to be in one corner of the departure lounge so there is a scrum the moment that a flight is announced - if your row is called first you basically have to walk to the front of the amassed crowd which makes it look as though you are queue-jumping. They do have TV monitors asking people to remain seated until called but nobody seems to take heed.

The speaker who is really not fluent in English makes an announcement to welcome passengers for each incoming flight. He proceeds to drone on for 10 minutes explaining that each passenger travelling onwards needs to collect their baggage before the next leg of their flight. It does not stop there - he then reads a list of every local destination for which this rule applies. And again let me repeat in very poor English. He no sooner finishes the announcement when the next flight arrives and he starts from scratch. The other point is that the speaker system is not the best so it is very hard on the ears as it comes across full blast. The real point is does one need this after a long-haul flight?

Delayed 12hrs coming into CDG due to snow on the ground. Arrived 1am and told that luggage staff went home so no luggage. Went outside and queued with over 100 people for 2 hours in -4 degrees weather for a taxi (at 1am). On return I tried to use website for luggage to no avail (lost luggage had also gone home). I spoke to some deeply unfriendly French AF staff who fist chided me for forgetting my luggage - then told me that 'of course you can't use website we haven't updated it yet because we are so busy'. Right now I don't know how or when I will get my luggage. This is not my first appalling experience here - I've missed two connections recently because of the high levels of efficiency of this airport.

edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,Jamie Harrold,NA,2008-04-22,Unfortunately I have lost confidence in Edinburgh Airport. The last few years have seen it improve a fair bit from where it came from. However there has been a period of growth over the last year or so and the airport is struggling to cope. The transport links to the airport are poor and appear to be getting worse. There is no word of any investment into improving the traffic problems in the area either. I also find the queuing times in Edinburgh mean that the time spent in the airport is no longer enjoyable while it seems that delays hit the airport more and more. I travel to Heathrow often and use Edinburgh but it would appear that whenever a flight is to be cancelled it is from Edinburgh. Leaving us passengers late for business meetings.

Good check in procedures-quick and efficient staff. Now services to London Stansted with Ryan Air (7 days a week) and London Luton (4 days a week) with Wizz Air. Internal flights to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. If you need a taxi into town get a radio taxi by phone-ask at information desk for the numbers-the curb taxis at the airport are much more expensive and could rip you off.

Yes you can say there are few eating establishments and some of the simpler things like seat comfort might want to be looked at. But when it all comes down to it all I need is a clean and simple facility to board an aircraft.

montevideo-airport,/airport-reviews/montevideo-airport,Montevideo Airport customer review,Dale Hancock,NA,2006-01-27,Arrival at MVD was without incident. The TAM Fokker 100 parked away from the jetways & passengers were bussed to immigration. The line at immigration was effectively zero (Thursday about 10AM). Immediately after immigration & prior to picking up the luggage all hand baggage is x-rayed & the customs forms collected. As baggage is delivered to the terminal it is x-rayed before going onto the carousel for passenger pickup. Once the luggage was collected exiting was through another essentially non-existent customs station with everyone simply being waived through the “nothing to declare” line. Once exiting this area we exchanged a few hundred dollars at a 21.599 rate (the rate at the hotel was 22.14 and at currency exchange counters in the city about a peso more). Taxi fare into town (the Sheraton) was calculated based on a reading of the meter and a separate chart & came to $495 or about $23US. The cab did not have traditional cab markings on the outside. The ride took about 25 minutes. From the time of landing until sitting in the hotel room took less than an hour. On the return trip the cab rate was slightly less - $500 allowed a decent tip to the driver & all were happy. We arrived at the airport about 2 hours before flight time and had to wait about 10 minutes for TAM to open their counters. Once they opened check-in was quick this time (see report under SCL). From there down the hall (to the right of the check-in counters continue to the right of passport control & next to the pharmacy) to pay the $26US departure tax (they readily accept USD) then through the passport control line where a lady scans the tax receipts stuck to the boarding cards on to passport control and then on to the gate. Total time from leaving the TAM counter to sitting at the gate was about 10 minutes. There are only 9 gates at MVD. There is a restaurant before going through passport control but we did not stop. There were several tables & few if any customers – it’s between the airline counters & the pharmacy. If you need to eat at the airport stop here first. Once beyond passport control there is only a [very] small café (Vanila) that appears to have only the very basics. We recommend you eat before arriving at the airport. Duty free seemed expensive (JW Blue for $173US) – but it’s extremely rare when we believe we’ve found a good deal at any duty free shop. Overall MVD is a fine airport to visit.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The negative is that it can take a very long time to get from one gate to another which can be very difficult if you have a short connection. However if your time is sufficient it is a good airport with good facilities. The KLM Lounge is fabulous after its most recent upgrade. But the general facilities are also good as there are several shopping and food options available to occupy your time. The coffee shops are especially good. This airport is configured such that security checks are performed at each gate on a flight-by-flight basis. The process is reasonably efficient. The immigration checks can get backed up but things usually move at a reasonable pace and the staff are polite and fairly efficient. Signage in the airport is relatively good and flight boards are not too difficult to find. The personnel at the transfer desks are relatively helpful if information is required.

bordeaux-airport,/airport-reviews/bordeaux-airport,Bordeaux Airport customer review,Nuala Nic Ghearailt,Ireland,2015-07-14,"I travelled through Bordeaux airport last week (inbound and outbound) and it is the poorest quality terminal that I have experienced as a flight customer. As highlighted by a number of the earlier reviews there are many problems/inconveniences: As I approached the security area - I was asked to push my carry-on luggage along chip-board tables (while sometimes taking my luggage off to avoid the roof poles). The security area was so busy (and it appeared the staff were stressed) that a 200ml bottle of sunscreen that I had forgetten to take out of my handbag was not picked up by the security screeners. We could not proceed to go through the passport control (unusually enough this appears to be a requirement upon leaving the airport) as there are only 2 boarding gates (beyond passport control) and they were full with passengers waiting for their flights. Once we could proceed to our gate (called 35/45) it was clear that the facilities at the gate were extremely basic. It has very few seats (I'd say about 10-15 for a full flights of about 200 passengers), no air conditioning (or at least that is how it felt), no toilets (and in our senario our flight was delayed by an hour) and no snack / beverage areas (particularly if one needs water). The procedure to use the toilets requires one to give one's boarding card to the airline staff at the gate, take one's passport to go out through passport control and to use the toilets in the 'main' lobby of the terminal.  In some parts of the terminal, particulary in the arrivals area, there is a very strong smell of fish. A very pleasant security guard sought to explain what the cause of the smell is. I didn't quite understand his French - however, it is clear that the fish smell is a problem and the authorities are aware of it. The same security guard stated that the design of the terminal resulted in a very poor experience for both passengers and staff alike. I commend all the staff we encountered as they were very courteous and professional while working in a stressful environment. I think the Billi Terminal in Bordeaux Airport gives a very poor impression of the airport as a whole and it is should be a priority to upgrade it.",Arrival and Departure,14-07-2015,FamilyLeisure,1,1,3,1,NA,2,2,NA,NA,0

I'd previously come into Chicago and there also was processed very sternly that was my first trip to the US and I was then unprepared for all the personal questions about how much money I had what I did for a living etc. But this was something else the official asked me 3 times if I was in the country on business in a sarcastic unpleasant manner as if he were trying to catch me out. Each time I politely told him I was on holiday. It was genuinely distressing. I'd just come off an 11 hour flight and had waited an hour in line.

Surprisingly enough there was no subway to the downtown core yet a 10 minute bus ride to the city center is all it takes on bus 3247 for 1.15 Euro each o/w.

Punctual upon arrival - a quick easy check-in at LH counter - great lighting in the airport and nice to have the cafe with a view of the planes and tarmac while sipping cafe con leche once you have passed the security.

If you can avoid evening departures as this is when the live musicians play in the center area causing an already noisy airport ambience to become even worse. If you can avoid early morning flights as the TSA security theater is made worse by inadequate entrances resulting in lines that stretch the length of the terminal. For those with checked in luggage the lengthy wait times upon arrival can be problematic; however the airport restrooms are some of the best in the US. AUS has both a good heel bar and an excellent massage kiosk. The roads to the airport are very very poor and the signs are confusing at best just like the rest of the city so plan lots of extra time to get to the airport on the terrible Austin roads.

Management needs to realize that when there is a line with 100 arrival passengers but only one employee working this is extremely inefficient and irresponsible. There is no one monitoring this section of the airport so you'll have people who are impatient pushing and going through to the front of the line.

Once I cleared the security area there was some nice shopping: clothing stores for men and women leather boutique and jewellery stores. The food area was on the level above the boarding gates.

milan-malpensa-airport,/airport-reviews/milan-malpensa-airport,Milan Malpensa Airport customer review,Christof Baetz,NA,2004-05-20,We have travelled several times with Alitalia and therefore change planes at either Fiumicino or Malpensa. When the transfer time between two flights is short you have to hurry up and hopefully the lines at the security check through which you have to go in transfer are not too long - but usually they are. Three times my baggage got lost at Malpensa. This happened nowhere else until today. The number of shops is little compared to airports like Barcelona or Frankfurt. If you are a SkyTeam frequent flyer and have access to the lounges we suggest to rather go the Air France lounge (smoking area and self-service of drinks and snacks) than going to the Alitalia Lounge (no self-service no smoking area). Recently we experienced a very unfriendly and unprofessional check-in procedure at one of Alitalia's Magnifica Class check-in desks. However the check in there was done by SEA ground services and not by Alitalia staff. In total I would say Malpensa is a rather boring airport with unfriendly staff.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

zakynthos-airport,/airport-reviews/zakynthos-airport,Zakynthos Airport customer review,Tom Maule,NA,2008-10-28,On arrival this airport seems to operate fairly well with quick passport control and a reasonably quick delivery of baggage - although there must be problems if more than two flights arrive together (as often happens on ThuRsdays and Sundays) as there are only two carousels. Departures is a different story - for a new terminal no opportunity has been taken to improve the check in system. You arrive in a large check in hall so no waiting outside but check in desks and baggage screening in crammed at the right hand side. Scanners for checked luggage are so close to the desks that there is only room for about six people in each line. There is easily enough room for these to be placed well back from the desks. Tour Op. reps. are left to control numbers going through. Without them it would be chaos. Security is a joke - the scanner operative spend to much time trying to get people into the right line he never seemed to check any bags going through. The same at passport control where one policeman was checking passports then going round to check the hand baggage and body scanners - by the time he got there most people and bags had gone through. The main lounge is a fair size but there is very little seating. My flight was the only departure when I was here so was not a big problem but again chaos if more than one flight. The snack bar can only be described as a rip-off! Duty Free is adequate with the normal holiday airport items for sale not always as cheap as in resort.

Baggage problems are especially bad if you are connecting through a commuter / small plane out of Terminal F. I fly almost every week and Philadelphia is the only airport where I have had this problem. Last year they lost my bag at least twice once for 3-4 days. The other issue is that the Terminal F flights can experience much worse flight delays than the big planes. I've experienced 2-4 hour delays due to incoming flight delays stacking up on top of outgoing delays. This last Friday I told them to put me in a hotel overnight rather than waiting 3 hours to leave and arriving at my destination at 3am.

vienna-airport,/airport-reviews/vienna-airport,Vienna Airport customer review,Robert Bush by,NA,2007-11-21,Earlier comments are agreed but to add to them note that on arrival we took the City Air Terminal train (branded as 'CAT') to the city just 16 minutes away and buying a return saves a euro or so on two singles. Ticket purchase is from machines in the arrival hall or on the platform but 50 Euro notes are not accepted so if paying cash have some lower denominations. You can also use a slightly slower but less expensive train on the same route - a bit like Gatwick Express v Southern from Victoria I guess. Some airlines including Austrian allow check-in at the City Terminal and this was real boon on the return leg meaning that we were unencumbered with baggage at an early stage. Note that taxis seemed reluctant to stop immediately outside the city terminal and we found it easier to cross to the rank diagonally opposite where there were more taxis passing however they also pull in at the rear of the terminal for dropping-off so keep an eye out in that direction as well.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Fog meant that we didn't use BVA inbound the flight was diverted to Lille. On our return we utilised the connecting bus service which worked well though there was an argument about our tickets which we hadn't used when we arrived due to the diversion. Best idea is to purchase them at the time - you don't save anything by buying them online and could be lumbered with them if your plans have to change. Our flight departed at 22:50. Unfortunately four other flights were also departing at round about the same time and Beauvais struggled to cope. The space available airside is limited and staff struggled to inject some order into those passing through security and passport control. The other side was just a seething mass of humanity with people sat on the floor or milling about waiting for their flight to be called. There was a duty free shop and a cafe but these could not provide respite from the hundreds of passengers awaiting departure. If you are lucky enough to be there at a less busy time I am sure that Beauvais will be a perfectly good little airport but it certainly could do with some sort of expansion to cope with increasing demand.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Exorbitant Car Parking costs and no Pedestrian access are the first obvious signs that you are going to be ripped off. I am here to drop off my wife and sister for a short break and a flight to Dublin. Arriving in the Departure Hall is like visiting a vacant planet - 12.15pm and not a sole in sight anywhere. Eventually one will spot a Departure/Arrivals board with possibly all 3 flights showing! You may have some time to kill (don't you always at airports) so you wander over to the only outlet ""Joe's"" only to be greeted by an attendant who appears to have better things to do than speak with customers! Told they haven't got any food as the delivery is late. We make our way to an enquiry desk - 2 ladies appear to be engaged in critical discussion so being the only other people there - we stand and wait and wait until finally one lady looks at us as though we were aliens and virtually demands with a yes!

Having read all of the reviews I can pretty much agree with all of the negative comments. The security staff are generally quite rude and always seem to be standing about not doing much. Even when the airport is quiet there still seems to be queues for security and if my bag goes down the separate channel for inspection it usually takes over 5 minutes before somebody comes over and takes the bag for a check. The departures lounge looks tired and even with the new restaurant and shops it is still not that great. One of the biggest benefits was the season ticket parking which was available. It was a good price and in my opinion value for money. No surprise then that this has now been stopped and I have to go through the tedious booking of car parking every week when I use the airport. From January I will be using Manchester Airport.

Immigration queues were poorly managed and very understaffed. It took two hours to clear immigration and another hour to exit the baggage and customs hall. Checking in the next morning (business class) took 90minutes. I changed my flights on the way back through Dallas because I realized my original connection time of just over two hours was impossible.

Lots of places to shop when you depart with prices that are not too far out of line for an airport (but few bargains).

Good sized Baggage Reclaim and quick delivery of bags. Out past the usual Red/Green Channel and into the Arrivals which is at one end of the building.

A reasonable selection of Duty Free shops and cafe airside. NB Serbian currency is a ""closed"" one so you must change back any money before going through passport control as everything is then priced in Euros and whilst they will take Serb Dinars there is nowhere to exchange them.

I was shocked at how bad it is. On arrival we landed evening time and waited nearly 2 hours at immigration as there were 6 European flights all in around the same time - Chaos! No AC anywhere. Finally got my case and made my way to the exit where we were met by a driver. Departure was a different story. On arrival at T1 we were met with a shoe shine boy outside who hassled us for money. Check in security and immigration passed relatively easy however when you are airside there is absolutely nothing inside apart from two over priced cafes and an even more over priced Duty Free shop. The building is falling apart and we couldn't see any renovations being done for the World Cup. Also no AC and the building stank. I suspect serious problems leading up to and during the World Cup and I pity any tourist or fan going to Rio (and possibly onwards) in the next 12 to 18 months as the airport is simply not capable of handling general passengers let alone anyone else.

There are literally no signs written in a language other than French. With Paris being a global tourist mecca and given the phenomenal amounts of foreign tourists that pass through here one would expect staff members there to speak multiple languages.

The airport is getting much more busy and is starting to suffer from overcrowding especially during the peak periods there are 2 terminals but you could be fooled into thinking that there was just the one as both terminals are joined and so the terminals are one long building. When departing getting through immigration can be slow especially during the evening hours when there are many international flights departing as for arriving the immigration can be extremely slow especially during the morning. From my experience the waiting is not too bad during non busy periods. The airport has a lack of sitting and eating areas and there are times when you will need to wait for a place before you can sit down to eat. One good thing is the amount of toilets/restrooms - plenty and they are usually clean.

The many comments on the board about disinterested personnel engaged in important personal conversations see it every week. Checking in this morning the security officer demanded that bins be turned lengthways on the way to the scanner (not vertically where you could fit twice as many and move more quickly).

The airport has only two departure lounges where passengers seat like they are in school bus all facing in front. On Fridays and Saturdays when there are several flights departing almost at the same time the departure lounges are full to capacity. The situation is worse when flights are delayed and it is normal to find more 500+ passengers in a lounge meant for not more than 200 people. Air-conditioning in the lounges does not work well and the TVs make so much noise that it is impossible to hear the announcements. The Duty Free shops are extortion points selling items for prices that are way above the normal price. Indeed there are renovations going on at the airport but the benefits are yet to be seen. A couple of years back customs officers used to connive with “helpers” (trolley pushers) and armed robbers and several passengers arriving in Accra had their items stolen. The Government moved in and cleared the airport of “helpers”. These people are back again.

vancouver-airport,/airport-reviews/vancouver-airport,Vancouver Airport customer review,Serge Grynkewich,Philippines,2012-09-10,My review focuses on two matters: Transit passenger handling at immigration and Staff knowledge of the airport and its facilities. I arrived in Vancouver at around 9pm to transit for a transpacific flight at around 2.45am the following morning. On the Air Canada flight I advised the steward that I was transiting and he advised me that I did not need to complete a customs and immigration form. On arrival the transit lane was closed and I was advised to proceed through the normal channel and to advise the immigration officer that I was transiting. I did so. The immigration officer (courteously) advised that I did need to complete the paperwork which I did. When I was called back to immigration it was by another officer who when I told her I was in transit gave me a pink card and told me the paperwork was not necessary. Someone in immigration is confused as am I. After all was done at immigration I proceeded to the lady who had directed me to immigration in the first place. She advised me to proceed up to the next level. When I asked her for the location of the Cathay Pacific business class lounge she advised me that it was upstairs but that I should proceed to gate 64. To make a long story short no one was at gate 64 as the flight was still 5 hours away. I asked several people including a janitor a Customs and Border Officer and a shop attendant where the lounge was. Only the shop attendant could direct me correctly. Amazingly the Customs and Border Officer - though very courteous - laughed as he told me that he was responsible for security but had never been there. Vancouver has a beautiful airport - as do most Canadian cities. However Canadian authorities should see to the education of those working in their airports.

The gates did not have enough seating people leaned up against the walls of a restaurant. It is difficult to even locate a gate because food services seem to share the same spot as passengers boarding a plane. When deplaning you are on your own to figure out how to proceed through immigration customs baggage etc. After leaving Heathrow and Frankfurt this airport is shameful in comparison and a very poor first impression to anyone visiting the states for the first time.

Flying into the airport isn't too bad although the pick-up point for arrivals is now as big a shambles as the drop off zone for departing passengers. Departures is a different story. Apart from the scrum at the aforementioned drop off point the check in desks are partitioned off from the rest of the departure hall and you're not allowed to proceed to check in until instructed to do so. Fair enough but the amount of seating in the departure hall is completely inadequate for the number of passengers waiting for their check in desk to open. Also there is only one channel through the partition and when check in for a particular flight opens this is immediately mobbed by the waiting passengers with no attempt by the authorities at managing the process or – heaven forbid – organizing a queue. Once airside things do improve but since passengers have already gone through full security screening at a) entry to the departure hall and b) entry to the check in area why is there a need for a third security check at the gate itself? Still not a bad airport but the management ought to think about making the departures process less painful for passengers.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,M Lee,United States,2012-07-31,(This review pertains to Terminal F). Seating: there is virtually none on the first floor. Architects did not allow for the numerous (and terribly overpriced) duty-free shops that have been added since. That left a very narrow passage almost completely devoid of any facilities except for a couple of bathrooms and some broken currency exchange machines. You can go to the second floor - there aren't any seats there either but at least there aren't any duty free shops so you can camp out on the floor. For that reason the second-floor gallery looks like a refugee camp. Transfer times: you are forced to have your passport and boarding pass checked before being allowed to proceed to your gate. No line there as such just a crowd of desperate passengers and a lone staff member who tends to take long breaks. If you're desperate and your flight is leaving soon push your way to the counter. Boarding areas are actually enclosed and guarded and you are not allowed into that area - which is unfortunate because they have seats there - until shortly before the flight. They do not announce flights so make sure to make regular runs between departures/arrivals board and the gate to makes sure you're still departing from that gate - ask the staff.

The basic problem is lack of competition by carriers in the Albuquerque market. Southwest has significantly cut back service to/from ABQ and eliminated non stop service to a number of cities like Seattle and Portland. I addition this lack of competition reflects in much higher fares to the same cities when compared to fares from DEN. Why the airport management at ABQ is not more aggressive in attracting carriers to the Sunport is a mystery. Without more competition in the Albuquerque market to only alternative for non-stop service at reasonable prices is to fly from DEN and do the drive to the Denver airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
newcastle-airport,/airport-reviews/newcastle-airport,Newcastle Airport customer review,Muhammad Elamin,United Kingdom,2012-11-28,Last flew out to Boston via CDG in September. What we really like about NCL is how relatively short time you require to check in especially with KLM/Air France which was pretty useful this time as my wife was finishing her night shift at 9am and our flight was at 11.50am. Following check in with an infant and infant travel system we still had time for breakfast and tea at Starbucks on the check in side. Security checks with the new extension building has improved and staff are friendly (especially with travelling with an infant). Arrival via Amsterdam was pretty much straightforward and painless. We now recommend this airport to friends and family visiting from overseas to avoid Heathrow but obviously some restriction as not all international airlines serve this airport.

newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,D Ole Even,Germany,2013-04-02,Flew in on LH and left 2 days later on Swiss. Coming in I must have been quite lucky because both immigration as well as baggage collection were quite fast - it wasn't a busy time of day and getting out of the building and into the cab is a matter of 2 minutes once you're out of security area. Personnel wasn't particular friendly but nothing to complain about. Flying out I was lucky again as it was not a busy time but that was about the only upside. As one other reviewer already wrote: don't arrive on an empty stomach. Next to this advise one clear warning: avoid the Duty Free shops! The price tags at least on cosmetics are hefty. I had 4 people in front of me at security and it took about 20 minutes. I don't want to think about what it would be like if it had been a regular hour or even a busy day. The airport itself has some structural drawbacks and on top of that seems to be very poorly maintained.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,T Potter,Canada,2015-04-03,"Let me add my voice to the many here complaining about the new process for U.S. flights at terminal 1 (Not sure if the same issue exists at terminal 3 but I expect it does). My wife and I had an early morning flight to Houston and arrived almost 3 hours prior to our flight time (as we have always done in the past). No time for breakfast at the hotel since we were very early. We expected to be through check in security and U.S. customs in plenty of time for a leisurely breakfast and shopping prior to boarding. Imagine our surprise when we printed our luggage tags then were told we had to trek with all of our luggage down to the far end of the terminal. There we were kept in a waiting area with no restaurant or anything other than a vending machine until less than one hour before our flight was scheduled to leave. At this point we were ushered in and marched halfway back down the terminal where we joined a long line to use the ""convenient"" terminals. This process took a while. Then into another line to hand over our printed ticket then finally check our baggage and went to security. We finally got through security less than one half hour prior to our scheduled flight time. No time to eat or relax just rush right onto the plane. This was by far the worst experience we have ever had flying out of Pearson. I advise anyone flying to the U.S. to fly from somewhere else! What's the point in arriving early only to sit until they finally decide to let you go through? I guess if you have NEXUS or fly business class you can go through right away. This does not apply with the majority of travelers however. I hope they do something about this ridiculous bottle neck situation or I will never fly to the U.S. out of Pearson again!",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

portland-airport,/airport-reviews/portland-airport,Portland Airport customer review,M Atkinson,United States,2014-09-28,"There's a lot of bad and good to say about Portland International Airport. First the good: PDX has a lot of restaurants and shops to visit. Prices aren't too outrageous and it feels organized and easy to navigate. I've read a lot of complaints about the TSA in Portland but I've experienced very few problems especially compared to other airports. The lines usually move fast and they don't make me remove all my liquids from my luggage which some airports do. Now the bad: the pick up for PDX is a mess. It doesn't need to be but it really is. First of all is the smoking problem. Everywhere along the pick up line are signs that say ""No Smoking."" There is a designated smoking area at the very start of the line where cars come in. However whenever I'm at PDX there are smokers standing all over the place in any location along pick up. I have yet to see PDX enforce them. The second issue with pick up is that there are signs posted everywhere asking people to not wait. That's why there is a very useful easy to find cellphone waiting area nearby. However often the pick up lane will be entirely blocked with parked cars who are still waiting for people to get out of baggage claim or off their flights. I've watched multiple cars sit in the same spot for over fifteen minutes while the drivers played on their cell phones. On many occasions I've picked up and been picked up at this airport and if anything I've always seen cars blocking the entire pick up line with no one in sight to pick up. There was no one to enforce the many signs stating this was illegal. It's been a problem several times which is why I'm finally writing about it. Weekends are the worst and I usually try to avoid that but sometimes that's impossible. Let's use common sense PDX! I can understand giving people a few minutes so the person being picked up can run to the car from wherever they were waiting outside and drop their luggage in the trunk but anything over five minutes to fifteen plus minutes is ridiculous.",NA,NA,NA,5,3,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Main issue is completely inadequate seating to the extent you have to go and buy something from the fast food joints just so you can sit down somewhere. I saw people dead asleep across what seats there were lying under them or collapsed over piles of luggage. The toilet facilities are characterised by long queues plus many people pushing their way to the front. Once you actually get to a cubicle you generally find excrement and urine all over the floor - maybe they are scent-marking their territory?

Inside every other airport lets you know the gate in advance - not here - you have to physically walk through a shop (having already been accosted by credit card sellers) to get access to the main shopping/waiting area and you are kept there in the hope you spend money until they finally let you go to the gate just before departure.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,M Craven,United Kingdom,2015-02-12,"First experience of Terminal 3 on a Tuesday afternoon in February for some daft reason I thought it might be a pleasant and quiet experience. The first issue was immediately being shouted at by a charming young lady handing out clear plastic bags before security. She just seemed to scream at everyone (and anyone) for no apparent reason. Next up was the carnage which was security a wait of 45 mins underneath the hottest roof spotlights in queues which went nowhere fast. The number of passengers waiting was actually quite low it just took an excessive amount of time. Finally once it was our turn to be screened we were met by incredibly rude staff. Now sometimes people say that staff are rude whilst they are simply just being efficient and doing the job with no fuss this wasn't the case. These security staff were frankly disgraceful rude remarks to simple questions and then providing zero information when the whole screening machine/process temporarily broke down. So got through security and looked forward to grabbing a coffee. Exited the security section to be met by a red barrier across the corridor it turns out that a toddler designed this section of terminal 3. If a plane is disembarking from some gates you cannot walk from one section to another speechless! To make this albeit slight inconvenience worse we had to listen to the two female ground staff who were guarding this red barrier and supervising the disembarkation of the British Airways Airbus (at 16.25ish on Tues 3rd Feb 2015). They seemed to relish being able to control a large group of passengers who were now running rather late thanks to security delays and who were now stuck between this red barrier and security. Some passengers were really late and asked if they could be let through to the gates it turns out that at least this is possible. But only once you had been spoken to like a child and told ""your too late"" and ""should have got to security earlier"" (really). They then spent the remainder of this lovely encounter laughing and joking about the plight of those late passengers in front of about 50 passengers. Brilliant. Finally boarded a nice peaceful aircraft after one of the rudest most uncomfortable airport experiences I have ever encountered. I will never fly from this terminal again at Manchester. Why is it so much worse than the other two terminals? Maybe I had a bad experience but not once did I come across a ""non-rude"" member of staff until reaching the departure gate.

kolkata-airport,/airport-reviews/kolkata-airport,Kolkata Airport customer review,Vijay Sampat,NA,2006-01-02,On my recent trip to Calcutta I arrived at the international airport on October 21 and left on December 6 2005. I was much distressed and made uncomfortable by the physical condition of the airport and by the process of entry and exit. As a former resident of Calcutta visiting there annually (or every 2 years) I was reminded of the late 60’s and 70’s Calcutta. Dim and grimy light fixtures and signage soiled and unclean washrooms with water seepage and nonworking water taps and the general dinginess did not make me feel welcome to the city. The lines at the immigration though generally disciplined were much slowed down by the staff occupying the counters and working at a very slow speed. What should take minutes took more than a half hour. The baggage collection depended on one single belt for the entire area; the belt looked like a relic and needed replacing. Customs officers were scattered about near the final exit in an unorganized way not at any counters adding to the confusion and delay. When I left on December 6 a crowded and altogether too small a departure area left me aghast. The currency exchange with only one money-changing agency was in a cramped space with no upright tables or counter space to fill out the forms. I gave up on the idea and was able to exchange money only in Singapore: the process took less than 5 minutes. The long wait for the passport and exit paper check was tedious and time-consuming and made more so by the speed at which the staff was working. I had come in very early to the airport because I had been warned. All this makes me wander if Calcutta will ever be ready to welcome the international passenger or attract the international business client that it so desperately seeks. In contrast my domestic flights from the adjacent area of the same airport were smoother more orderly with the processing much faster. This area however seems to have reached its maximum capacity and could use expansion more maintenance and sprucing up.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Low cost airlines appear to avoid using the airbridges so arrival into the terminal building was on a bus. Arrival was pleasant: toilets clean and adequate luggage was out in a jiffy and getting ground transportation was hassle free. Departure also pleasant though I suspect this was at least partially because of the 10.25 am departure when few other intl flights leave. The check in area is large and has an international look and feel. Not having to screen bags through Xray before check-in (normal practice in most Indian airports) is a big help. Porter service is efficient professional and reasonable priced (Rs 70 per cart - which is less than $2). Immigration and security check were a breeze because our flight was the only intl one around that time. Immigration staff well turned out and looked more professional.

I agree that the facilities leave a lot to be desired. There are too few gates and there is not enough seating for people waiting. Thank goodness Jet2 has its own check-in area. The forecourt work is a disaster. While one appreciates the need to create stand-off in front of the terminal it is made ridiculous by the fact that the extra short-term parking area is within lobbing distance of any old projectile over a wire netting fence to where the aircraft are parked. Good job I'm neither a terrorist nor a litter bug. Every time I drop someone off or get collected by kind relatives the parking situation is worse and the distance for luggage heaving longer. Oh for adequate parking a decent eaterie and more seating in the arrivals waiting area. The contrast between hand baggage checks at the respective ends of my journey (Düsseldorf and Leeds Bradford) is like day and night. In DUS they are sensible humane polite reasonable.

Also, once I was delayed and as there are no tannoy announcements you are left wondering about that status of your flight which if you've travelled TACV can be understood.

Arrival is at best a free for all with queuing outside exposed to the elements. Departure is just a joke. On the day we departed the queue for security occupied the majority of the check-in hall disrupting most of the check-in desks as it wound around the building. Having joined the queue to ensure that we made our flight we stood for 1.5 hours while people were rushed through to catch their flights. It appears the best solution at Grenoble is not to join the queue at all but to wait until they are rushing people through and get taken to the front and straight through security. The fun really started when we came to board. Having watched our luggage loaded to one aircraft at least we knew the plane we would be boarding! Wrong! Initially the wrong flight was called they called the flight 1 hour later. having questioned the staff at the departure gate they realised there take and called the correct flight number. As we walked to the plane across the tarmac we realised they were taking us to the wrong plane same airline.

We both walked slowly to the baggage carousel and once we got there it was another 35 minutes for the first piece of luggage to come out. Her bag came ten minutes later. If Melbourne Airport is the first destination for incoming international travelers then I fear it paints a black picture for the rest of the country.

la-guardia-airport,/airport-reviews/la-guardia-airport,La Guardia Airport customer review,Vicki Rosenzweig,NA,2009-12-28,Check-in and security are mostly pretty efficient (I've flown Northwest Air Canada and Midwest in the last year so two terminals and three different gate areas) but as noted there's not much in the way of concessions especially once you're through security. Do expect delays especially later in the day: more flights are scheduled in and out of New York than actually fit especially if there's any kind of weather or other problem (Air Canad will not let you book a flight online into or out of LGA JFK or EWR without showing a warning that there are likely to be delays due to weather and New York air traffic control). Not a big deal if you're doing a nonstop but worth keeping in mind if you're going to be making a connection. Getting into Manhattan by mass transit works okay but if you're not a local or have a lot of luggage it's probably worth your while to pay for a cab or airport bus to midtown.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Nasty cramped dirty and poorly laid out waiting area for the departure gates at terminal 3 which has only wildly overpriced junk food available to eat. The approach to the check in counters from the underground must rank as some of the worst anywhere in the world with water leaking from behind a wall seeping across a filthy floor making it extremely slippery and dangerous. However the absolute worst aspect is the understaffed immigration queues. I know it's a constant complaint of those of us unfortunate enough to have to use this airport but management seriously has to start to listen. Clearly understaffed the few officials who are tasked with processing arrivals are obviously over stretched and are struggling to cope with what is being asked of them. I don't blame them for being snappy and irritable as the job they have been given is close to unmanageable but its an absolutely appalling way to welcome visitors to this country to make them stand in endless queues while only 3 or 4 counters out of an available 20 or so are staffed.

Two three hour waits are normal in a lounge bereft of anything in the way of amenities except for a vending machine.

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,Peter Bates,NA,2009-08-13,My most recent experience of the Adelaide terminal was flying as an international passenger. After previous poor experiences I was prepared for the worst but was very pleasantly surprised by the general lack of congestion in the processing areas both departing and arriving. There are now self service machines for passport verification for incoming passengers with the latest electronic passports and that has seemed to ease the waiting problems previously encountered. In the customs and baggage collection area too processing was ultra fast but then it was only one plane load. Nevertheless the best experience I have ever had here as an arriving international passenger in terms of the efficiency with which I was processed. If this is the new normal standard I can only say a heartfelt congratulations to the airport management for at last lifting its game to meet the level of organisational efficiency expected for the fees charged.

Waiting time at the security was well over 30 minutes with only half of the security gates staffed and a priority row eating away half of the remaining capacity. That's a disgrace. I ended up having only five minutes to get from security to a D-gate.

STR still does offer some attractive connections and make it a real alternative for intra-European flights. But beware: Although they promise a minimum connecting time of 30 minutes this is absolutely not manageable. The problem is that in some instances you can't transfer airside but have to land yourself. This is definately valid for those flights arriving from non-Schengen airports. You have to go through immigration control and customs go out to the public area go one level up and proceed through the normal security control. Depending on the time of day this can be VERY lengthy. And from here it still might be a pretty long way to your departure gate. In the end this is even more hazzle then transferring in Frankfurt.

Terminal is quite large for a regional airport and of a modern design. Passport control seemed quick and efficient in all queues apart from mine I guess I was just unlucky in getting the fussiest immigration officer in Madeira I eventually hopped over the ropes to the next desk and was processed immediately. Bags arrived quickly and I reckon the whole process from disembarkation to clearing customs took no more than 15 minutes albeit the airport wasn't busy at the time. Departure - no major problems. Just two check-in desks open for my flight so a queue built up quickly and only one member of staff carrying out security / boarding card checks en-route to the airside area. Once airside plenty of retail opportunities but limited seating both in the terminal area and at the departure gates. Passport control has several automated e-passport lanes in addition to good old fashioned immigration officers. Toilets were clean.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,2011-12-13,We arrived at 06.30 on a fairly full Qantas 380 from Singapore. Expecting the worse we were pleasantly surprised perhaps because of luck perhaps because of planning. We were quickly off the 380 because we got seats near the front of economy hence when we arrived at Immigration the queues were short. Staff were moving non nationals into the nationals line as soon as a booth became free and we had none of the long queues reported elsewhere. We looked back and the line looked reasonably short. Whilst our bags took a long time to come this was because they were some of the last to come off the plane - the carousel was full of bags by the time we got there. The pain came when we had to check-in for our domestic connection - we had to take our bags landside and check-in again rather than being able to use a fast bag drop airside. The new Qantas bag automatic bag checkers accepted one of our bags but not the other and so human intervention was required (others were also having trouble). Never-the-less we have experienced worse. I suspect the terminal would be under strain if a number of big jets arrived at the same time we had chosen a flight when this would not be the case.

It is very easy to walk out of the security area without meaning to. I used to live in Denver so when I was scheduled to transit through DIA enroute from Atlanta to Sacramento I decided that I would have dinner at a restaurant in the main terminal that I used to eat at. When I lived there the upper level in the main terminal was part of the secure area - now it isn't. I came out in the main terminal and realized that I was outside the security area. It took me 45 mins to get back inside the security area. Fortunately I made my connecting flight. Needless to say I didn't have dinner.

hyderabad-airport,/airport-reviews/hyderabad-airport,Hyderabad Airport customer review,David Reece,NA,2006-01-29,Efficient? Not in my experience. Arrival is painful: the immigration officers take about ten minutes for each Indian passengers (foreigners are faster but are few and far between) so unless you are among the first off the 'plane you will have a very long wait. Then you have to wait for checked baggage -- the screening procedure means that two hours can easily pass between touchdown and your bag arriving. Departures: note that once you have checked in you cannot leave the departure area and so are at the mercy of the limited and over-priced catering that the airport offers. Check-in was slow and inefficient with staff who couldn't be bothered to handle requests for exit row seats etc. There is a cyber-cafe in the departure lounge but its computers have loads of pop-ups and probably spyware as well so not a good place to do your on- line banking.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,Shaffin Tobin,Australia,2013-05-12,Shambles of an international airport. The last time I flew back into Perth International there were constant apologies over the public address system for delays in immigration waiting time because a couple of flights had arrived at the same time. I don't know why they bothered apologising because there is no excuse. The airport knows when flights are arriving and should schedule the appropriate number of staff and the same problem has occurred each time I have flown back to Perth for the last 15 years - hardly a once off issue. Combine this with inadequate baggage carousels to handle the multiple number of flights arriving and it really is an underwhelming experience flying back home. Departures are pretty average. Pretty tired and unimaginative waiting departure lounge area. The gates are from another era in aviation - you have to walk down stairs to get to the aircraft walkways thankfully I am still able bodied otherwise it would make boarding the plane just another unenjoyable experience of using this airport.

On the not-so-positive - the bus service from Manila is infrequent and the Philtranco bus timetable meant I had to arrive 4 hours before departure. There is very little to keep you occupied once in the departure area with no news stands and little eating and drinking options. The only smoking lounge costs 300PHP to use although they do include coffee and small snacks in the price.

The security queue was quite short but still waited 15 minutes to get through. 2 of the 5 lanes were closed. As on previous occasions at T1 I found the security staff to be officious slow and apparently unconcerned about people missing their flights.

The advertising blurb tells of facilities that are never open and it has a help desk that is manned only when the staff feel like it which is as good as never. It looks like an uncompleted job on which the builders have walked off because the service pipes are all exposed and there is not so much as a false ceiling to hide it all. It has been like this for decades. To then ask the public to pay £10 each to refurbish something that should be done out of the operating profits over many years is a disgrace.

glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,N Fotheringill,NA,2004-06-10,Prestwick is my 'local' airport and I use it more than any other. The terminal building was built in the sixties and remained chronically underused for many years. Government interference stated that all of Scotland's transatlantic flights should land at Prestwick and not surprisingly few airlines took them up on the offer. This restriction was removed in the early nineties and it seemed as though Prestwick might be closed for ever. However with new owners touting for buisness Ryanair entered the scene and the airport has not looked back. Plenty of money has been spent in making the airport a viable alternative to the much more handily placed Glasgow International. Firstly a rail station was built on site giving passengers two trains to central Glasgow per hour. Car parks were expanded whilst internally a number of changes were made. Overall though the terminal is showing its age and such things as check-in have a distinctly low-tech feel to them. However the staff are courteous and the queues move quickly. Groundside catering has improved lately though the grandly named 'Graceland' bar (Prestwick is the only place in Britain where Elvis Presley is known to have set foot) has gone. Airside is an odd experience. You a channeled through the duty free shop (everything except booze and tobacco available to all passengers) to the waiting area which is below the level of the aircraft stands. It can get a bit crowded in here and very messy if a number of flights are scheduled at the same time. As most flights are with Ryanair the rush for unreserved seating leads to long queues through the one door that leads to the aircraft gates. Ryanair are supposed to have a priority system for boarding but no one pays the slightest bit of notice to it. Once through the door you walk to the appropriate gate underground emerging up the stairs on the tarmac for a short walk to the aircraft. On your return another walk brings you to the bagage reclaim which can be either very quick indeed or annoyingly slow depending on your luck. The worst part of the experience is paying the car parking fees which are huge. Book in advance if you can or better still use the train. Overall though Prestwick is not a bad airport to use and access will be much better next year when the road to Glasgow is upgraded to motorway standard.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

First of all announcements about departures are made in both Slovak and English with the exception of Slovak charter flights which are often (but not always) announced only in Slovak as the passengers are Slovak and perhaps Czech nationals. On the other hand arrival announcements are only in Slovak as there are quite a few monitors/screens which are directly linked to the system here at OPC and hence automatically display current information. The arrival announcements are made in Slovak as they are not aimed at the passengers (they have the monitors) but at different workers at the airport i.e. mechanics catering bus drivers as we bus passengers to/from the A/C with some minor exceptions baggage handlers etc). Announcements in the gate are made if the airline wants them and these are made at least in Slovak and English. I would also like to state that often we make announcements also in other languages ie. for the twice weekly SU flight to SVO also in Russian and sometimes in Hungarian Italian German French but that only if unnecessary and very seldom.

lanzarote-arrecife-airport,/airport-reviews/lanzarote-arrecife-airport,Lanzarote Arrecife Airport customer review,Howard Barker,United Kingdom,2012-12-07,Saturday lunchtime flight. Found the security queue snaked right back to in front of the check-in area probably due to several German charter flights at the same time. In fairness though it moved fairly quickly and from arrival to airside took no longer than 40 minutes I have experienced much worse as would those with longer check-in queues. No queuing ropes or staff to monitor the queue. If you have a pre-booked transfer these appear to be leaving from the upper departures level requiring negotiating a ramp up to it far less convenient to the previous arrangement when you walked straight from arrivals to the coach bays.

cebu-airport,/airport-reviews/cebu-airport,Cebu Airport customer review,Corey Shreffler,NA,2005-09-12,"Mactan-Cebu International Airport (CEB) is a much better entry point to the Philippines than Ninoy Aquino (unless your final destination is Manila of course). However despite the fact that Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines there is nothing overly impressive about its airport. I arrived at CEB on a domestic flight and was quite surprised how desolate the terminal was. This was in stark contrast to what was waiting just outside. For a flight of 60 or so people it seemed like the whole city of Cebu was waiting to greet us in the ""welcoming area"". I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only Cacuasian around but never once felt threatened by the smiling faces of Filipinos. I was immediately greeted by a sonata of sales pitches as taxi reps competed for my business. I gently waved them off since I was waiting to meet my friend. They were persistent but not obnoxious. The availability of transportation is not a problem at CEB but you will need to learn the art of negotiation to avoid being charged unfairly. Thankfully my friend is quite skilled in these matters and we never had to pay an elevated fare. A few weeks later I left from the international terminal at CEB for a flight to HKG. I don't remember much about my actual impressions of this terminal since I was contemplating a heartbreaking goodbye to my friend. However I do remember that the security line was not long at all and the entire process of getting my boarding pass and clearing customs took about 15 minutes max. The airport workers were quite friendly except of course for the customs official. CEB is a utilitarian airport and nothing more. It helps you get around the Philippines and S.E.

Fast track was indeed fast and then up to the departures lounge which was crammed with people and no clear signs as to where the business class lounges were.

On our return journey the customs software went down (Aug 2013) which happens but the time to get the system back up and operating was extremely slow (2 hrs). With major events like the Grand Prix coming up I really hope they ramp things up to accommodate for the crowds expected. Just small things like customs staff wearing iPhone headsets under their head dress and they have absolutely no interest in being welcoming at all. Then the Taxi system waiting outside was totally out of control there were no lines or order to the process the waiting passengers it was every man for himself with Taxi's at one stage 3 deep across the road with people walking around moving cars.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,S Paterson,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,A needlessly stressful experience which will make me think twice about using LGW in the future and flying regional instead. Checking in for a flight to Edinburgh the airline's computer system crashed for approximately 30 minutes during which time the increasingly long queue of passengers was kept in the dark. All in all it took me one hour to check in for a domestic flight; so it's a good thing I arrived with time to spare. Our flight was delayed by the fact that there was an insufficient number of dispatchers available (according to our pilot) so we had to wait on stand until one became free thus delaying us 45 minutes. On the return leg dispatchers were again unprepared for our early arrival and had left a flight of mobile stairs blocking the gate so we were delayed in disembarking the aircraft too. The pilots on this particular airline had no qualms in strongly hinting at their frustration with the handlers. I live closer to Southampton and will probably just pay a bit extra next time in order to avoid London.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Security is fairly tight due to the general problems of PNG and only passengers with tickets are allowed into the terminals. The domestic terminal is somewhat more crowded and more confusing with limited facilities but is relatively clean. Returning from outside POM you may well find that there is no international baggage transfer - you need to walk the three hundred or so metres between the terminals with your baggage - but it is a covered walkway with lots of security staff everywhere. After check-in there is then a wait (with few available chairs) until customs is opened about an hour before the flight. Once through things go fairly smoothly though there is not much airside apart from the small Air Niugini lounge which is pleasant enough. For the size of Port Moresby a reasonable enough experience though more seating would be good.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The front of the UK/EU passport queue had a very large number of Saudi's from a large Saudi Airlines flight and I admit that they could have been dual passport holders however the amount of time to process them I would say not as we were waiting over 1 hour with young children and elderly persons forced to be herded like cattle. Some members of the Large Virgin 747 flight verbally displayed their concerns and disbelief at the lack of efficiency within the immigration hall to be confronted with a large presence of police (more than actual immigration staff) standing there in a display of power and authority telling us to pipe down. 12 immigration desks with only 6 staff manning them? As many if not more police were present! Wouldn't tax payers money be spent more wisely on more UKBA immigration officers as opposed to overt unarmed police presence at the border?

One passenger with a visa problem could be catastrophic for everyone else coming off a long flight from NY. Baggage was fast and customs as usual in France was easy. I felt that the cost of the taxi to the hotel was too expensive - I definitely felt ripped off. The taxi back to the airport upon leaving was much cheaper. Be warned there are taxi touts in the arrivals hall trying to get you to take their more expensive ride to the city. The airport is a perfect medium size and is easy to get around. The lounge airside (non-Schengen) was quite nice with good snacks. As they have divided the airside areas into 2 components: Schengen and non-Schengen they have created 2 small and confining areas. I would prefer one large departure hall with access to all the shops and lounges vs. being restricted to one area where I wouldn't want to spend too much time. The int'l passengers enter the airside via the Schengen hall and then enter the int'l area via passport control. The Schengen pax have no access to the int'l area.

Services are very poor (food offerings no better than a typical US highway plaza and do not expect shops of any quality) orientation to the city virtually non-existent currency exchange and ATMs limited. The airport is extremely difficult to navigate with multiple international arrival and departure terminals with no central information point or monitors (recently I had to go to 3 separate terminals to locate an arriving international flight). Amazingly for an airport there are few seating areas and what do exist are cold uncomfortable with no electrical service. The entire airport is aesthetically dreary and ugly. Be prepared to ask strangers for help (there are few airport staff available) and beware of hucksters at every turn.

It used to be ok and fairly spacious but a revamp in the last few years has seen much of the seating airside cut and freezing cold rabbit warren gates to serve the low-cost airlines. At the same time they built a stupidly oversized shop that you must walk through to get to your gate which has also cut the amount of space for passengers. I wouldn't want to be stuck with a delay airside here as it could get quite claustrophobic. To cap it all off unless you drive out there you have no choice but to get the Bristol Flyer bus link - £10 return or £6 single. There is no other option and no competition for bus routes to the airport. On my recent visit passing through security was painless even if staff were a bit rude but I have faced long queues there at the weekends.

If passengers arrived consistently early as advised followed the instructions about liquids emptied their pockets properly and basically followed the rules (all of which are well publicised) then the process would be much simpler and easier for all. And next time you are waiting in the queue just think its all for your safety. Outbound security is there to identify possible threats to the airport and your flight. Would you rather they skipped through things. If they are taking time to scrutinise an x-ray then its because there is something they are not sure about.

There's an abundance of interesting shops and good places to eat (my favorites are Garduno's and Quizno's. It's rarely too crowded except at peak times at the concentration of gates at the far ends of the two piers. Large windows afford great views of the planes taking off and landing; I've never actually climbed the stairs to the special -- and expensive / controversial -- observation deck however. My only ""complaint"" would be that the terminal can resemble a ghost town if you arrive on a late flight (say after 10 or 11 pm or so).

Arriving passengers are quickly processed through immigration and there is a separate line for foreigners which is quite short. Baggage arrives quickly and trolleys actually work. All bags are x-rayed and then passengers can leave the airport. Since no one but employees and ticketed passengers are allowed inside the terminal the breezeway outside is where the Asian experience truly begins. Touts taxi drivers and a myriad of people with no discernible purpose mill about. Hopefully you have a hotel meet-and-greet and you can leave quite easily. For departing passengers once you enter the terminal things are quite civilized as only passengers are allowed inside. All bags are x-rayed and there are several additional security screenings. Check-in is usually quick although outbound immigration queues can be longish. There are shops selling duty free but I would suspect that prices are fairly inflated. CIP lounges are sub-standard with limited food and beverage selections. Without fail staff are polite and helpful. Even security personnel though armed to the teeth are professional and courteous.

milwaukee-airport,/airport-reviews/milwaukee-airport,Milwaukee Airport customer review,M Keenan,NA,2010-02-19,I’ve flown through a few times and found it works very well. Baggage has always arrived very quickly and rental cars are close to the terminal. On one occasion I was able to get off the plane get my baggage rent a car and get checked in at an airport hotel all within thirty minutes. Outbound Milwaukee is similarly straightforward - I experienced minimal line-ups to check in and only a few minutes wait for security. The departure areas are nothing special but there's plenty of comfortable seating while you wait and reasonable concessions to purchase food drinks or reading material. MKE gains some points in my book by also including a small museum that deals with the history of the airport and aviation in Milwaukee a nice touch that other airports should consider. MKE is further proof that it's far less stressful and time consuming to fly in and out of medium sized airports than mega airports.,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Beware of the said website because it is hardly ever updated and the info on the shuttle bus service to Brussels is misleading. You CANNOT buy your ticket on the bus in spite of what it says and the place is full of disgruntled passengers hauling their gear back into the airport to buy a ticket. Amazingly this has been going on for at least a year and will continue to do so because this airport clearly follows a strict policy of ignoring all complaints and e-mails. Still the coach is the least bad way of getting to Brussels as the local bus and train schedules are hopelessly mismatched. Another major pain at this airport is the lack of seating and practically nothing to do landside and absolutely nothing to do airside. Boarding is invariably annoying as the hapless staff makes no attempt to control the free-for-all. All you can hope for is that things will change with the new terminal due to open ""in 2007"".

On one occasion I arrived 1.5 hr before my connecting flight was scheduled to depart but the bus journey from parking bay to terminal took me 20min then I had to clear security and walk from T3 to T1 for transit which took me another 20 min.

The only good thing is that they seem to be bussing fewer flights from remote stands than a year ago but a 2-hour connection is as tight as you'd want to get. I prefer the Emirates Business Lounge in T1 to that awful place in T3. Also Emirates have a bad habit of going from Gate Open to Boarding and onto Final Call - all in the space of 10 minutes some 40 or 50 minutes before scheduled flight departure time - and having passengers all dashing across this very large terminal only to have to wait 20 minutes before they can actually board.

Awful in all regards - even after their improvements. They are never staffed appropriately. The line/crowd management is terrible. Their transportation system continues to leave you walking forever and still takes too long. Hard to believe they can't learn from other airports. My most recent case was yesterday when it took me 2 hours to move through check-in and security. So poorly managed that they had to hold people in the main airport area and not let them down the escalators until the security lines moved. Flyers have to make reservations. Knowing how many people are moving through your airport at any point during any day should not be guess work. Far from it. They have all security lanes open when there are no lines and far too few security lanes open when the airport is packed. Many of the facilities (e.g. escalators) are broken on a regular basis.

Given the huge passenger numbers using it for access to the Angkor Wat temples I wonder if it isn't time for another upgrade of the current facilities. Immigration control on arrival is carried out by a row of five officials at a counter who process your visa one by one and costs $25. Another gentleman in a Soviet-era uniform then proceeds to meticulously stamp your passport and other paperwork. All painstakingly slow but quite comical. When leaving I would advise plenty of time even for a short flight to Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh as the departures terminal was heaving with passengers who first need to have their luggage screened check-in queue again to pay the $20 airport service charge and then another security check. According to the Bangkok Airways agent this was apparently quiet season !! There isn't much to entertain other than a few free internet desks and the wonderful Artisans d'Angkor shop whose prices are the same as their shop downtown. You can forget about any business class lounge although above the departure gates there is a restaurant.

The check ins are very fast - except for those belonging to SAS where you will have to stand in line for a long time. But Oslo does operate a clever self service check in that will tag your bags all the way to your final destination.

On arrival all went without a hitch from arrival (bussed to terminal) passport control and bags were delivered fast. The T3 is used by Egyptair and Star Alliance. Modern and airy. Official taxis at 6 am refused the official taximeter price but there was no other option. Departure was all right but the crowds at the first X-ray and checking the tickets as only passengers are allowed to the Check In counters. So many people and bit of chaos. Watch your bags as they seem to send them through the scanner and you end up stuck by the metal detector for your turn. Once you cross that everything else is s breeze. Check in took seconds passport control fast. Air side several interesting shops but I have to say they are truly expensive. So shame on you Cairo airport charging for a small 500ml bottle of normal water 25EGP when it costs roughly 1.5EGP. Second X-ray and documents check when entering the gate itself.

Firstly long queues to pay your departure tax then long queues to check in.

Getting through immigration was not too bad but security queues were enormous. The only saving grace was there was a much shorter women only queue. Hand baggage was hand searched as well as scanned and one of my group was asked for baksheesh (bribe) to let her take toiletries on board. (she refused). After security there are just 2 departure lounges with no shops or cafes and uncomfortable seats and very smelly toilets.

Whilst waiting observed many passengers late at gate missing flight due to severe delays at check-in - never again - Luton is the pits. On return flight again penned in on tarmac to allow other flight arrivals to go ahead again 45 minutes to clear passport control - again a shambles - totally negates any price reduction.

Arrived from Prague on a late night easyjet flight landed at around 2250 at the South Terminal the same day when the UK security level was raised to severe. When we disembarked the plane we realized that the door between the jetty and the terminal was closed and there was no one inside the airport. We then managed to ask the flight attendant to help and managed the first door. Then we realized there was another second door locked. Again no sign of any staff at Gatwick. The flight attendant had to open the door again and here we are at the departure lounge rather than the arrivals. Then all the passengers wander around the almost empty airport without being approached or questioned. Eventually I managed to get the attention from a security personnel and he directed all the passengers though the arrival hall. No explanation whatsoever. They blamed easyjet of course. I have written to Gatwick airport but no response at all. It is ridiculous that they operate the airport link the jetty to the airplane and then when something went wrong they said it wasn't their responsibility.

Unfortunately our experience of Melbourne Airport was pretty poor. On the positive side of things our baggage arrived on the conveyor belt promptly. However we were way over at Conveyor Belt 5 even though there were closer Conveyor Belts available. Exiting into the arrivals hall we followed the signs for Qantas domestic transfers. We quickly discovered that the travelator up to the Domestic departures level was not functioning and there was no marked alternative. In the end my father had to push our loaded trolley up this conveyor belt. Once we got up to Qantas departures there was no indication for where International Transfer passengers should go. Having finally sorted that out we went through security and struck the most rude abrupt security staff ever.

There has been an upgrade since then, but you wouldn’t notice. Arriving on Jetstar from Sydney we had to negotiate the stairs (no airbridges) then literally battle our way between two 30m lines of passengers, with hand baggage, waiting to board flights. The gap between the lines was about half a metre and my small wheeled back-pack was hitting the bags of the waiting passengers. What a totally ludicrous situation! Surely the designers of the upgrade could foresee such a situation and keep arriving passengers separated from those queued to board. Departure 5 days later at 0700 was much more comfortable experience through gate 3 at the other end of the airport. With an increasing number of international flights arriving at OOL, well-travelled passengers must wonder about the backwardness of Australia when they step into this terminal.

Flight over from Ireland was good and Turkish Airlines were good. Returned to the airport on a Saturday morning at 6.05 for a 7.45 departure and then the nightmare began. I lined up along with hundreds of others in a common queue to check-in until I was eventually called out of the queue with the rest of my flight because time was getting short. I have never seen such chaos at a check-in desk. Staff did not seem to care and there was no sense of urgency. Next step was to go to the passport control line and this was another disaster with really long queues. I have never in all my time flying witnessed airport police so obviously arguing with ground staff in front of passengers in an airport but saw this happen twice in this airport. I then made my way directly to the departure gate only to be faced with another series of horrendous queues to get through the x-ray machines it was organised chaos. I heard my name being called with other passengers for our flight. I pleaded with an official to let me through to get to the plane but he refused point blank saying that I had time. I missed the flight and had to go back out into departures and fight my case with Turkish Airlines.

Last weekend was shocked that my daughter was refused hot water at a coffee shop to warm up a baby's bottle. Had a very strange surreal exchange with the coffee shop manager which bordered on open hostility. Went to the baby care room no hot water facilities dirty smelly unhygienic. Terminal inside was reasonably clean but food and beverage operators rarely clean up their tables so you have to do it yourself. Outside the terminal was dirty and smelled of urine. $4 for a luggage trolley $16 for less than an hour's parking.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,Mark Crowther,United Kingdom,2015-04-27,I think Stansted is a good airport overall. There are improvements being done to the shops and cafe which are already making the experience more to the level expected. As much as I'd rather not have to walk through duty free I get it. The security heading out of the UK is much improved especially with the new multi-person conveyor belts. They have them in Edinburgh airport and it makes the process far quicker. However regarding Arrivals security its a mess - as with other reviews mine is s typical story. Landed at 12.05am on Sunday 26th April and on arrival at passport control the hall was completely full. As always to the left we could hear the e-passport gates siren going off as a failed scan happened and to the right the half full line for non-EU arrivals. For us EU and UK citizens it took 20 minutes just to get from the off-loading area of the shuttle train to the point of being in the queue. It then took just shy of an hour to get through security others were tweeting the same so it wasn't just my bad timing. Half way through one of the UK Border staff wandered off (break time?) and 3 gathered around a desk with an issue with a passenger. I overheard people talking about just pushing through and maybe if we all start jeering. If this took place anywhere else there'd be a near riot being an airport people are contained let's hope peoples frustration remains verbal. The double whammy for anyone trying to travel late at night is the Stansted Express train finishes at 12.30am so the 3 or 4 plane loads of passengers have no chance of using it. Good job the coaches are available. But be warned they are NOT family friendly and the queue to buy tickets is often long with just 2 staff to serve customers. Your option from there is a taxi from inside the airport. But be prepared to pay around £100 to get to central London. I travel through Stansted almost every week and the story is pretty much the same. A good airport well served with facilities outbound security and transport ruined by an atrocious arrivals security. a) Get more staff checking passports (set a time limit from arrival to processing and publish if you hit/miss it) b) increase EU/UK staff and reduce non-EU staff due to volume of arrivals c) let families through in a priority lane you then switch to other passengers no one will mind people already usher families with crying babies through anyway.,NA,NA,NA,5,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Once you're finished clearing customs visitors are subjected to lines in a cramped dingy hallway prior to being re-screened by the ever faithful TSA.

bratislava-airport,/airport-reviews/bratislava-airport,Bratislava Airport customer review,Marián Ondrišík,NA,2005-12-08,"Bratislava Airport most traffic is operated by low-cost airlines. These don't have any connection flights (low cost carriers do not offer transit flights and only some of them offer transfer flights) and one of their rules is that the check-in opens two hours before the scheduled time of departure. Therefore a passenger cannot expect to check-in her/his luggage seven hours prior departure. Condition of the particular airline of this kind should be written at least on website. But in local conditions this is how it works also for passengers of global airlines alliance members Air France Austrian Airlines Czech Airlines Delta Airlines Lufthansa or Spanair codesharing on flights from Bratislava. One of the reasons is also baggage sorting area limits. There is no additional space for luggage waiting to be loaded in seven hours what can cause a loading mistake so the baggage can be loaded incorrectly and ""be lost"". However baggage sorting area is now under reconstruction (as well as baggage screening system whole check-in area ticketing area or arrival area) and its space should be doubled at least. Bratislava Airport is improving its services according the EU and SR legislation and regulations as it can. To compare annual capacity of the terminal build in late 60s and early 70s and enlarged in mid-90s is 350000 passengers a year. This year BTS expects approximately 1250000 passengers. Left luggage office was closed under new management regulations because of security reasons (no satisfactory baggage screener) in mid-2004. Under this decision it will be according the airport spokesperson closed until a new terminal with relevant security facilities in 2007 will be build. Regarding this interesting is that Main Railway Station as well as Main Bus Station have no satisfactory baggage screeners in their left luggage offices and these offices are opened. By the end of 2005 a name of new investor and future 66% shares owner of Airport Bratislava (BTS) should be announced.

I didn't have to wait too long for the luggage to arrive - it took about 10-15 mins.

The check-in area is massive and the ACJ counter is at the very end. Going through security was a breeze.

Coming was ok but leaving was bad the Delta people were on strike so our plane was 2 hours late due to cleaning and restocking the plane. Check in people were intentionally going extra slow and some people waited long hours to check in. No one at the airport would talk to us and let us know what was going on or if we were even flying out the same day. Many people were there from the day before.

Newest concourse D is quite nice. Some parts really showing their age - US departures area is utterly awful as are B gates. Also a total lack of any real services or shopping in the C (USA) gate area. U.S. Customs clearance wait times can be horrendous. Wayfinding signage is ridiculous awful horrible amateur in some places! Best example: exiting the customs hall. When the first batch of amateur signage confused passengers they put up more. That clearly didn't help so they put up more. Then somebody installed red LED signs with flashing words and arrows (which are just as poorly designed as all of the other attempts). Now someone else has tried to rectify by putting up handmade and laser-printer-ed signs.

Indeed design a fab new building but not for the purpose of architectural vanity. You forgot the passenger experience here. I have travelled widely internationally but the distance travelled from check in to my outgoing SQ flight and baggage reclaim from my incoming SQ flight takes some beating quite bonkers. What should be a relatively smooth and stress free transition to and from flights has become a heck of a long walk but at least it got my leg muscles working after a 13 hr flight! As for arriving by the Heathrow Express or Tube - add another 30 mins after you have your bags once you have negotiated the barriers and stranded trolleys. Why are we unable to access these services from within the building rather than having to exit and then descend via slow elevators or escalators? Give me T4 any day. So the important point here is make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to the departure gate indeed the 2-3 hr check-in timeline from ticketing to the gate has never been more relevant with the new T2.,NA,NA,NA,3,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

islamabad-airport,/airport-reviews/islamabad-airport,Islamabad Airport customer review,N Ullah,NA,2006-01-13,I recently visited Islamabad airport after almost three years. I was hoping that things should have been improved a little bit over the past few years but I was disappointed to notice that nothing much has changed. Even we are in the 21century and every time I landed ISB airport I feel like I have travel back in time. Keeping in mind that ISB is the capital one would expect a better standard of facilities and services. This is the main contact point for the country with the outside world and the airport does not give a pretty picture for someone visiting the city airport for the first time. The airport building itself is so small that it cannot handle more than two or three flights at a time. I landed ISB airport late night. There were already few other commercial flights on the ground so I expected a rush inside the building. The minute we touch down the runway almost everyone switched on their mobile phones even the steward request clearly not to switch on the phones until plane is topped. As a result the whole cabin sounds like a mobile shop and customers testing their new toys. Eventually the plane stopped and we were taken to the terminal building in a bus. The bus drop you right outside the immigration lounge and everyone just run toward the door. I believe the main reason is that public knows how long it would take them should they decide to let everyone go first and that is the mistake I made. I was last in the immigration queue. Immigration officers have started taking USA style pictures at the counters before they stamp your passport and let you go into the next hurdle. I joined the existing queue and it took almost an hour before I could reach the immigration counter. Then everyone just rush to collect their luggage. There are not more than four luggage conveyer belts in total but only two were operational at that time. I managed to collect the baggage after half an hour and then it needs to be scanned again by the customs. It does not matter whatever the size of your luggage or suitcase they ask everyone to put their luggage on the scan belt. There seems to be no rules or regulations to follow and no one seemed to be interested to differentiating between passengers with just one hand luggage and a passenger with five suitcases. It seems that the immigration officer are not capable to judge that it is rather impossible to carry a TV stereo or any similar electronic item in a small bag. Eventually I came out and faced by people who wanted to carry my luggage including porters in uniform as well as taxi drivers acting as porters. One of them even pushed my bags without even asking me and expecting me that I would follow him to his taxi. Upon return to the airport same people try to push my bags and force fully tries to take luggage to the airport terminal. They will not even ask you to where I am flying? They just push luggage and expect me to take the lead once in the airport building. Passing through the security was simple but then I was welcomed (or should I say challenged) by the customs. The custom officer wanted to see inside my luggage without even asking me any questions. Once I pass though that then my luggage was put through the scanner and again another custom officer asked me to open my luggage again. If only I knew what they were looking for I could have told them. Then I get in the check-in queue. The facilities were not up to international standard at all as one would expect adequate level of service at an international check in desk. The whole set up is of poor quality as well as the building and surroundings are old and not very well maintained. Toilet facilities are not clean and up to international standards. People including staff shouting at each other across the terminal building. Most of the signs are in English keeping in mind that some of the passengers might not be able to read English. As a result passengers asking each other to which check in desk to approach and queue? Eventually I checked in my luggage and was sent upstairs in the lounge after passing through the immigration. Duty free is non-existent as compared to other international airports. The shops are of old style and looks like small stalls stuffed with local ornaments due to the size of the shop. The goods are over priced as compared to outside in the market. In essence there is no concept of duty free. There are waiters roaming on the floor asking passengers for tea coffee or sandwiches etc. I do not even get to see where the restaurant is? So cannot tell who is cooking what? And whether anyone is monitoring any standard of cleanliness in the cooking area? All in all it was an experience that I will remember for a while. Islamabad desperately needs another airport of international standard as the current airport was mainly designed to handle a small number of passengers with domestic flights. The airport itself gives a poor impression to any new passengers arriving to the Capital city. I heard that the Civil Aviation Authority are planning to construct a new airport building though I have also heard that works is yet to start!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

So when you empty your water bottles at the security check point there is no way to refill your bottles before boarding your flight. This is a very handy scam for the shop owners who make a lot of money by selling bottled water. Why they built a new airport terminal without one drinking water fountain beggars belief.

Off airport rental cars are an extreme time sink and on-airport (Hertz Avis National) not much better. Why someone would design an airport such that you have to go down the stairs to get your bags on arrival go back up the stairs and then back down the stairs to cross over to parking or shuttles is beyond me. Lindberg Field was great until redesigned. If the airport wishes international traffic I am not sure why downtown in the current spagetti configuration makes no sense. Current proposals include a tunnel to a remote runway across the bay! Why not just build a proper airport and keep Linberg local.

Had some trouble figuring out how to get to immigration and customs because of poor signage. Got through with few problems. Remember to get 2 customs declarations on the plane present both at customs and get one back and keep it because you'll have to present it when you leave Uzbekistan. Leaving June 8 2012 first security point where they check documents and x-ray bags is located right at the entrance door so people are lined up outside the building waiting to go through that first security point. There are at least four maybe five check points before you get to the gate so don't get too comfortable just because you've passed through one or two. The call to board the airplane was not made clearly and everyone in the waiting room bunched up at the one door that was open to go out to the plane. You have to go out and walk on the tarmac to a stairway to get on to the plane. There are two doors front and rear but they did not direct passengers which door to use according to seat number so there was chaos on the plane with people boarding in the back had sits up front and vice versa. Only after people were bunched at the door did they announce business class first then people were allowed through but in no particular order.

Only 4 lanes out of 16 were open plus loads of people were pushing in. We waited for ages and due to being understaffed we missed our flight. Disappointedly we were then told we would have to pay €110 euros to catch the next Ryanair flight back. The man at the Ryanair desk also informed us that Dublin Airport purposely put the gate number up last minute in the hope that more people will spend more in the Duty free section and that this has also resulted in passengers missing their flights. This is a total disgrace and what should have taken me a few hours to get home resulted in taking 3 times longer and costing me 3 times the amount.

The interior is still rather drab much like the Indian airports of yesteryear but the airport is much less congested than Delhi or Mumbai. Upon entry signage for the baggage screening machines (i.e. which one to use for your airline) is poor so you end up having to guess. Immigration counters were well-staffed and took no time at all and customs no longer goes out of their way to harass you like they used to 10 years ago. Shopping/food is dreadfully limited inside the terminal so if you need something to eat try the small food court outside the departures entry gate (the Anjappar restaurant serves decent local fare) or the restaurant on the second floor between the international and domestic terminals. The best thing about MAA is that unlike BOM or DEL the domestic and international terminals are next door to each other so if you have an inbound/outbound domestic connection it's a short 5 minute walk over - thus saving you from getting harassed for tips by the touts running the terminal shuttles or getting ripped off by the taxi/auto drivers.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,/airport-reviews/houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport customer review,Pierpaolo Messaggio,Singapore,2015-07-06,"I was in transit a few days ago. Arriving from GDL (Mexico) and continuing for NRT (Japan). The airplane landed 20 minutes ahead of schedule but we had to wait on board for 30 min because the ""gate was not available"" 2 hours and 40 minutes were just enough for me to rush and run to catch the connecting flight. First the immigration check. The queue was quite ordered and regulated by members of the staff, there were about 500-800 people in queue with just a few (about 7) lanes open. There is no fast lane for tight connections or for transit. Some of the officers were taking their own time chatting and laughing to each other while performing their duties. Baggage delivery. Even if my luggage was already tagged to the final destination I had to collect my luggage, queue for the customs clearance and go to the baggage check in counter. Security check. After all of this there is the security check. Despite the long queue and the thorough inspection, it was very well organised and extremely efficient.

My connecting flight was slightly late the transit security line was a mob scene and I had to move to the side and shove my way to the front where it seemed airport security was selectively letting people without boarding passes through. When I finally arrived at the gate there was a shouting match going on between the gate attendant and a guy who was trying to board the flight without a boarding pass. When I arrived the attendant said I could not get on the flight because my bags were too big even though boarding was still going. I argued back and forth then finally tried to walk away from the mob scene at which point the attendant began shoving me and my bags.

Totally unreasonable connection experience. Had to walk down very long dreary hallway dragging bags over very dirty carpeting. A pretty unimpressive and difficult welcome to the USA. Then told we had to walk to terminal 2 for domestic connection outside up ramps across streets with auto traffic down ramps or stairs about 2-3 blocks in the rain no signage dragging bags to be rechecked. Airline rep said if we had been there before 7 pm we could have done it in same building as arrival. One of our party used wheelchair but no provision was made for their bag which also needed to be rechecked in terminal 2. Another member of the party had to drag both her bag and the one for the wheelchair person. Plus carry-on luggage for both. I expected a cleaner more attractive and smoother welcome to this country. I am a seasoned international traveller but have never had a transfer this difficult anywhere else. Where is the shuttle train or bus service? Where are the automated baggage transfer belts?

However this fine city is now totally let down by the incompetent management of arrivals procedures at O'Hare Terminal 5. The reality that I experienced on arrival into O'Hare T5 on September 24 was anything but welcoming. There was a 2 hour line for immigration followed by indifferent/rude airport and airline employees in the baggage claim area. Ironically in the weeks before this visit Chicago was being promoted as a welcoming tourist destination in commercials on UK TV networks. I fully understand that the Mayor's tourism dept. does not control the activities of Dept. of Homeland Security or airline employees and while I can respect that immigration procedures are very necessary for the security of US borders it is completely ridiculous to use resources to promote the city in overseas TV markets but then not adequately resource immigration procedures to facilitate those visits.

dalaman-airport,/airport-reviews/dalaman-airport,Dalaman Airport customer review,M Shortridge,United Kingdom,2010-10-03,How I wish I had read these reviews before going on holiday. Normally my husband and I never go into any airport bar as usually we pick up our car from our arrival airport however because there was 6 of us we had a bus arrangement and due to flight being delayed for over 3 hours thought we would go and have a drink at the bar. Never again 3 pints of lager 2 fantas and a small bottle of water cost Â£49. We were utterly shocked but should have realised the moment we entered the bar as there were only another couple of people there. The prices at the fast food outlets was also extortionate. We had the foresight to take sandwiches and soft drinks with us although had to drink liquids before customs ( wish we had had similar foresight for the airport bar!). The airport was also very stuffy hardly any aircon. I felt so sorry for parents with small children as they would have definitely needed drinks. Also agree with reviews regarding lack of seating downstairs. The airport authorities really need to sort this out. If we go back to Turkey again we will take food and drink and will not go through customs until the last minute. Lovely airport totally spoiled by rip off prices!,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
tokyo-narita-airport,/airport-reviews/tokyo-narita-airport,Tokyo Narita Airport customer review,G Lazaro,NA,2007-01-21,Used Terminal 1 this past December and January as a transfer point between Osaka-Itami (ITM) and JFK. Was checked through to my final destination each time at ITM and JFK using ANA so I didn't have to bother checking in again at Narita. But the international check-in area of Terminal 1 is fairly spacious modern and bright though still quite busy. You can kill time at the number of stores and restaurants in the mall-like area (before entering security) along with the massage chairs (which feel pretty good after a 14 hr flight) and outside observation deck which seems to accompany a number of Japanese airports. Immigration usually has a long line but it does move at a reasonable enough pace. Transferring from international to domestic was pretty easy with enough signage and staff ready to handle my bags and inform me that my connecting flight would be delayed. The domestic portion of Terminal 1 offers a lot less in terms of amenities. The waiting area past security could use more seats and felt a little cramped as people were lined up on the floors. Overall though I like Narita for its efficiency and its cleanliness which is true also for my usual airport Kansai Airport.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I was yelled at for even attempting to use the fast lane (marked ""Crew Only"") and not the zig-zagging labyrinth made of those removable lane dividing ropes. There was absolutely nobody at the entire security area and absolutely no difference whether I would use either path as they both ultimately led to the same metal detector/X-ray security check. The only difference was that the first one was about 10 feet long the second one - about 200 feet long. Having undergone a recent knee surgery I thought maybe I could save myself a couple of unnecessary strides as again I was the only passenger/crew in sight and there was no difference as to where either path would take me.

bangalore-airport,/airport-reviews/bangalore-airport,Bangalore Airport customer review,S Sankar,NA,2008-09-05,Used BIAL 4 times within 2 weeks for 3 domestic flights and one international departure. I found the whole experience very good. Everyone cribs about the distance of the new airport to the city centre. Over time people will forget about the old airport and will factor the distance to the new airport into their overall journey. Once the Namma metro is complete the journey will be even more convenient. At the moment one has to travel either by taxi or take the city bus. The city bus transfer is clearly signposted and very efficient with around 8 different routes into the city departing every 20mins or so. My journey to/from Indiranagar took just over an hour on all occasions. The airport itself is finally the first international standard airport in India (I haven't been to the new airport in HYD) with decent shops the Kingfisher bar cafes lots of immigration and security queus and clean tiolets! My personal overall experience was very positive. The only issue I could see was with the size of the international departure lounge. My BA 747 was full and the 350 passengers took up around half of the available seats in the international departure area. I imagine that at around midnight when AF LH TG SQ and KL all operate 777s or A330s that the departure area will be bursting at its seams. From reading the press I understand this has been recognised and they are already talking about extending the airport which will probably take 4-5 years.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Amazing congestion. Were they never expecting any one to use it? Did they not anticipate that people might have luggage. Shuttle to North terminal quick and efficient. Emirates lounge does not give access to Qantas Club passengers even though they've paid for lounge access. (This is an emirates issue not a Gatwick issue - though it does make the whole experience seem cheap. There is lounge access for example at Heathrow.)

Only once did I use it for outbound international travel so have not experienced the inbound international travel situation as described by others (I re-entered the US via EWR). I have always encountered courteous employees throughout the airport and I think the layout of the airport was well-planned I especially like the subway that connects the terminal and all the concourses together. And I really like how you can go from concourse to concourse withOUT having to go through security again like I experienced at a major European airport. Also I like the many dining options available in every concourse. Rarely have I experienced any flight delays as I normally fly in the early morning hours to avoid any weather-related issues like those that usually occur in summer afternoons! Last month I chose to travel in the afternoon and sure enough our inbound flight was put into a holding pattern for approx. 15 mins and the outbound flight sat at the gate for 20 mins before backing out due to the local weather situation. Now with all that said the only real drawback I can find is the lack of moving sidewalks in the concourses.

The airport itself has good signage to get you on and off Route 60. The terminal is also easy to navigate although the security procedures are more intense than any other major airport that I've seen. Show your boarding pass and ID when you get in the security line. Show your boarding pass and ID before passing through the metal detector. Show your boarding pass and ID AGAIN before leaving the security area and getting on the train to the gates. Once off the train and up the escalators there is ample shopping and many places to eat. The gates branch off of this main area like spokes on a wheel. There is an added bonus for computer users: FREE wireless internet access is available in the food court area. Get a bite to eat check your email catch up on the latest news. Other airports have wireless available but they use clients like T-Mobile or AT&T who charge $9.99 for a couple of hours use. I was able to pick up a mid to low wireless signal while sitting at my gate. Surfing the web made the time go by a lot faster.

It has the wonderful Hawaiian/Pacific style of outdoor areas mixed with a modern terminal good shops and extremely friendly staff. The check in staff are kind and lines move quickly. Remember you have the US Agricultural check and then the TSA check which is a pain. The TSA security staff were too slow and only had 2 security stations open which is not acceptable. 9/11 has passed long enough that we need to get security clearance up to speed or it will discourage travel. The shops are good although they close too early. There is a bank of flights heading out to the Mainland around 10pm and most of the stores were closed by then. The one airport bar/self-service restaurant is terribly overpriced and the quality is low. With no meals on many US flights now there need to be opportunities to buy food/drinks before flights.

sanya-airport,/airport-reviews/sanya-airport,Sanya Airport customer review,Harry Tsui,NA,2005-04-07,Sanya Phoenix Airport is a small and efficient airport serving mostly tourists going to the Hawaiian-like Yayong Bay resorts. The airport is close to the city center with about 20 minutes ride. It takes about 45 minutes to go to Yalong Bay. Once you arrive at the airport it takes very short time to go to the exit gate. But when you are exiting there are so many people there waiting for you especially the taxi drivers. You have to negotiate the price before getting on the taxi. To avoid any confusion you should contact your resort before coming to Sanya. Most hotels would have their own hotel transportation at around $120 yuans for Yalong Bay bound trip unless you are are local Chinese who knows about all the tricks. Taxi drivers there are usually contract drivers. They take you around the area for sightseeing and shopping. It costs around $300 yuans for a day's tour. Most of them are friendly people who just want to make a living. Local transportation are almost non-existence. The city center is like a war-torned zone. Instead of shopping around the main streets (nothing to find anyway) try to go inside the food market on the back streets. I tried the noodles there ($2 yuan) and they were tasty. But personal security is a main concern. When departing Sanya airport has a nice departure hall on the second floor. It is well lighted with natural light. The big plus is the nice shops there. They sell many local items like the yellow chilli and coconut products. Prices are only a bit more than the local market. Those are very nice as the gift items. Overall the airport itself is very clean and efficient. The only draw back is the airport connections between the airport and the city center as well as the famous Yalong Bay. If they can either open the routes for competition or set one up by the airport or the city itself it will make Sanya even a better resort designation!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

These works were accompanied by a much needed upgrade of car park facilities and the relocation of car rental firms to a new purpose built facility outside the Domestic Terminal. Completion of Stage 1 brought with it modern and bright facilities including new retail outlets operated by Australian Way and Delaware North incorporating a separate news and book shop gift shop cafeteria and food and beverage bar. New personal care facilities were constructed including toilets disability facilities and baby change facilities (airside and landside). It is anticipated that an internet cafe will be operating shortly along with an additional airside ATM. Stage 2 of the project has commenced with a further $2000000 expansion of the departures lounges. Expected to be completed by October 2005. It is anticipated that Stage 3 of the project will commence in 2006 with reconstruction of the Qantas and Virgin ends of the Domestic Terminal Building installation of contemporary ""Check In"" desks facilities to accommodate ""checked bag screening"" and arrivals lounges.

The ceilings are low but it is still spacious and the art is fantastic. I wish there were more restaurants that I've actually heard of and a door to the smoking area would be appropriate. There is very little traffic and the staff is very efficient. Thanks to the multiple runways (with another on the way) we always leave on time and our luggage is always waiting for us at the baggage claim.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,C Peck,United Kingdom,2013-01-11,After reading several reviews I was not looking forward to the experience but I have got to say arriving just in front of another Transatlantic flight was lucky as our wait to clear immigration was quick maybe 15-20 mins max some off that flight looked in for a long wait. Our bags were on the carousel when we arrived at the collection point and the shuttle to the main terminal was hassle free. We departed the following Saturday which was 22nd December amid reports of one of the busiest days in the year to travel but had no problems at all. TSA had plenty of channels open and got through in under 5 minutes and from a personal point of view the TSA staff were polite and efficient and the best we have come across.

tontouta-airport,/airport-reviews/tontouta-airport,Tontouta Airport customer review,Mark Thomson,NA,2004-02-14,Tontouta International Airport is located 45km outside of Noumea. If you catch a cab to the airport be prepared to pay for a two-way journey as cabbies are not guaranteed a return fare back into town. There's no point turning up early for your flight. The airport only operates when flights are due to arrive/depart. Check-in counters the small souvenir shop and cafe don't open till 90 minutes prior to scheduled departures. Duty free shopping is only available air-side which can only be accessed 60 minutes prior to departure. Surprisingly smoking is permitted in all parts of the terminal. In summary Tontouta is a very basic facility offering very basic services.

Got to Immigration to a sea of people. There were probably 24 immigration officer desks - for US citizens 7 were open for non-residents there were only 5 open. After being in line for at least an hour we had moved up about half the queue - it took about 10 minutes to do one end of the line to the other end then make the turn. Then a 'traffic control officer' moved us and another 200 people through an empty officer desk to another room equally as large with just as many officer desks. These officers were obviously clearing only international travellers and less than 12 desks were open. Took us another hour to get cleared. Certainly a big problem is the amount of time each officer has to spend doing a picture and fingerprints of both hands - as much as 15 minutes. We had endured that experience in LAX 3 years ago so when we finally saw an officer we were cleared in less than 2 minutes. Luckily we had 3 hours to make our connection but this was still a rush to get to Terminal D to ensure our seats weren't given up to someone on standby. However original itinerary was to give us 50 minutes between connections but having to clear security in terminal B took only 5 minutes. Worst US Immigration experience we've had in over 50 trips.

guangzhou-airport,/airport-reviews/guangzhou-airport,Guangzhou Airport customer review,E Baxter,United States,2010-11-26,We passed through CAN as transit passengers. We missed our connecting flight because there was no one at the transfer desk for China Southern Airlines for a good half-hour after we arrived causing us to miss our flight. We were rebooked on a flight several hours later giving as ample time to enjoy the departure area. Transfers at this airport even between international flights require passing through immigration and the process seems fairly disorganized. Someone takes your passport you wait and wait and wait not knowing what's going on. Eventually you are escorted to the departures area where you have to pass through another security checkpoint. When we were there security staff were not allowing transit passengers to take through bottles purchased in the duty-free areas of their initial departure airports which caused considerable argument from passengers. Once through security the departures area is spacious and clean enough. There is no airport-wide wi-fi although one can surreptitiously find a connection and log on if standing close enough to one of the airport lounges. There are a number of the standard kinds of duty-free liquor tobacco and luxury goods shops and several souvenir shops. The one bookstore has books and magazines only in Chinese. There are some restaurants/snack bars with comfortable chairs and good views of the tarmac and planes and staff don't seem to mind if you camp out there for awhile if you order something. Food prices are probably high for China but didn't seem outrageous. Still given the badly organized transit procedures and in our case apparent lack of concern for customer service from airline staff. this airport is best avoided if you're only transiting through it.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The walk from where our A320 landed was at least one km long two small moving stairways. An airport staff member passed everybody quickly on a 4 person golf cart but never offered to take anybody with him.

We thought this was reasonable timing not having been warned by our travel advisor or Alitalia about the 'normal' horrendous queuing problems at FCO. We got to Immigration control 45 minutes before our flight departure time. There were hundreds (no exaggeration) of people there trying to get through the non- EEC gates (my wife is American so we thought we had to go that way). Only two lines were open. The crowd was getting restless and eventually two more gates were opened where the Immigration officials merely looked at the cover of our passports and waved us through. By this time we had missed our flight by no more than a few minutes. We eventually made our way back to Alitalia ticketing (no easy task going the 'wrong' way through the airport). We had to pay 420 euros for a flight to a different London airport (London City) the following morning. To add the final insult there were no hotel vacancies so we had to spend the night on the departure lounge floor. No fun as we are both 70 years old!

We had to circle a few times as it was snowing in Istanbul we landed on a runway not cleared of snow! Waited for the flight to UK they called us and bussed us to the aircraft. No snow clearance was evident at all it was only ankle deep and fresh snow not compacted ice so fairly easy for snow ploughs shovels etc. We boarded but unfortunately could not take off because of poor weather (not the airports fault). We got back into departures which was absolutely heaving we were not given any information and were left to fend for ourselves. The problem for us is the system stated we were flying because we boarded without cancelled flight status you cannot re book another flight. This took about 5 hours! We then had to question in essentially what was a scrum at Turkish airlines desk. There were the queuing lanes which most people adhered to but lots pushed in at the side by the desk and the 5 staff who were helping allowed this to happen and assisted the people cutting in. We eventually got re booked for the next morning. We figured out (again no information) that for the airline to put us up in a hotel we needed to go to the hotel desk. The desk was situated outside the airport beyond passport control but you could not go through passport control until you got a photocopy of your passport. There was total lack of order system or control at the area identified for photocopying. We eventually got a copy of passport so could go through passport control to hotel desk. So far we had been 7 hours trying to ticket transferred and out of the airport to the hotel desk. Back into the chaos in departures to try and bed down for the night hard marble floor and metal seats no blankets very limited water and dry sand which supplied-the lack of information and any care was frankly astonishing. In the main the staff were incredibly rude and did not really want to help. When we finally found an area of floor to sit we expected to see a hive of activity fritters snow ploughs etc-after all there was less than a foot of snow.

riga-airport,/airport-reviews/riga-airport,Riga Airport customer review,Johan Vanderhoeven,Belgium,2014-08-18,Mixed feelings. We went to Riga for a short city trip. Arrival at Riga airport was no problem luggage handling went very quick so we were satisfied with the service. Unfortunately the departure one week later was a horrible experience. After our in time arrival at the airport the electronic check-in devices did not work properly. The staff helped some passengers and refused to help some others in a completely arbitrary manner. We were sent back to the enormous waiting row for normal check-in. Time became short but the staff assured us there would be no problem to catch our flight in due time. For the control of documents before entering security checkpoint only 1 (one) lane was open for the big crowd. And the rows became longer and longer. We asked information to staff members who seemed to be totally uninformed job students note able to deal with the problems. 10 minutes after the start of the boarding of our flight we (and a lot of other travelers) decided to switch through the priority lane: first we were allowed then a staff member tried to send us back in a rude and impolite manner which we refused to do (one older women in front of us already started crying). The lady who already refused to help us before even had the courage to laugh us in the face while passing by. The checking of documents went very inefficiently also in the priority lane. We managed to get through 10 minutes before departure time made a run at the gate and were lucky enough to catch our flight to Brussels just in time. I understand that in a small airport handling a big crowd of departing passengers is a challenge but I'm convinced that here a more better handling would not only have been adequate but also possible with a more efficient organisation and a more professional attitude of some staff members.

The Satellite is identical to the main building but in a much more human scale. No calls to board which is partly good because the airport is quiet but bad because you need to check the screens constantly -though these are plentiful throughout the airport.

The new McNamara terminal used by Northwest and its SkyTeam partners is a monumental improvement in terms of quality over that awful old Davey Terminal. Some distances can be long but unlike many airports of this size there are moving walkways (and the A concourse tram) the entire distance to your gate. The architecture though not entirely cutting-edge is very light and welcoming and the center mall area contains a wealth of dining and shopping. The Smith terminal (which serves all non-SkyTeam domestic airlines) on the north side of the airport is uncrowded but astonishingly dilapidated and depressing as some reviewers mention below.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,Miranda Walker,NA,2008-03-10,With regard to domestic terminal congestion - WAC (airport administrator) is aware of the problems and work has been continuing over the last year or so to improve things- this has included extra aircraft bays at the domestic terminal 2 (Virgin Skywest) and a new parking area to the north end which frees up taxiways etc during peak times. The problem with Perth was the 20-year plan did not anticipate the phenomenal increase in flights hence the congestion at peak times (5-8am & 3-7pm) I agree it's taken far too long to address the problems- a multi-storey car park seems the ideal solution - however it seems the airport is more interested in building commercial buildings. Have read reports of a planned spur line from Bayswater station on the Midland train line to the airport to (finally) link the airport to the rail network. If driving to the international airport during peak times avoid intersection of Leach Hwy & Roe Hwy - if coming from south on Roe better to go Abernethy Rd take a left at Grogan road- this takes you through the warehouse/back areas and eventually joins up with Horrie Miller Drive.

Also only allowing people with their names on the manifest to enter the building whilst not completely foolproof adds to the layer of security. I have never found the staff rude or unhelpful anywhere in India. They are respectful probably because I am respectful to them. I live in Cyprus and it depends who's on duty as to how thoroughly they check. I forgot to put a nail-file in my checked baggage and it passed through Cyprus security unnoticed.

Not anymore. Returning to the US from Costa Rica we had to clear in Houston before transferring to a flight to SFO. There were approximately 3000 people in line at immigration and only 16 inspection stations operational (there appeared to be around 50 inspection booths). People were queued up outside of the immigration hall into the terminal. No effort was made to prioritize clearing by transfer flight time. People were left to their own to shuffle their places in line to accommodate those transferring to other flights. The officials who monitored the queues were completely unhelpful and almost mocking of passengers' plights arrogantly telling passengers to blame clearance delays on the airlines! The queue for US residents/citizens was 4 times the size of the queue for non-residents but they refused to move inspectors over to the US resident/citizen queue to balance the load. Two hours and 10 minutes later we cleared immigration. The slowest clearance I have experienced in 30 years of travel at any airport in the world. Mercifully our connecting flight was delayed for mechanical issues (although I felt bad for the passengers already on board). A brief chat with the gate agent (Continental) prior to boarding indicated that this is an ongoing problem. DHS refuses to put on any more than 27 inspectors. The airlines send DHS their plane loading plans in advance so they will know what the passenger volume will be and they do nothing. It costs passengers thousands of $$ every day to have to stay in hotels because of missed connections. It costs the airlines thousands of $$ every day to issue vouchers. Wouldn't it be a lot less expensive to put on 10 additional inspectors every day?,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The facilities were cramped poorly lit and shockingly dirty with terminal seats being stained with all manners of drinks/food. Due to unknown security regulations there were three separate security checks on top of Customs and Immigration that often created long bottlenecks in the airport. Once in the terminal area there were few food and beverage options with only one female bathroom for multiple gates of large intercontinental aircraft. Worse still you could not access the restroom without exiting one of the three security layers and having to be re-screened again.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,M Burd,United States,2010-01-14,"Nightmare. Arrived at 0635 for a 0800 NW flight to MDW via DTW- hundreds in line. Self- service kiosk could not provide boarding pass (tried all 3 methods of accessing) with instruction to ""see an agent"". No airline personnel were available to help passengers (there were many with the same problem with kiosk) only airport personnel ; one of whom just shrugged and walked away. Angry very vocal crowd! We waited 4.5 hours in line obviously missed flight. We were rebooked on a 1425 flight to ORD. Happy to get out of Miami; however since my car was at MDW I had to pay $16. bus fare to MDW and then a 2 hr drive to my home in Michigan. Not one Delta or NW employee could explain the problem. There did not appear to be any weather delays or cancellations posted on monitors. I cannot understand why this airport checks in international passengers as well as domestic passengers in the same lines. Entire families traveling to South America or Asia needed translators which of course meant all others had to wait until a translator could be found. Unbelievable. Another customer in line with me wanted only to check his bag - he had a boarding pass. He said he was at airport at 0616 for 0715 flight and only wanted to check his bag. Curbside checkin was a disaster with long lines and then closing down so passengers then had to go inside and get at end of long long lines there. ORD and MDW work in a professional efficient courteous way. Never will I go near Miami airport again.

Arrivals apart from a small delay in getting the jetway lined up was smooth and efficient. The area prior to visa payment and passport control is large and airy. Formalities took minutes. The baggage hall is also spacious with an adequate duty free on arrival shop. Being the only flight in or due in baggage delivery was very quick - althouth the angled conveyors do move a bit too quickly for some and I saw several people chasing high speed bags round the carousel! Through passport control there is a bit meet and greet area leading to a pick up and set down area with car parks opposite. Everything was pretty much a straight line from plane to kerbside. Departures is equally impressive. The check in area seemed to have about 50 desks although quiet at 7pm on a Friday night with only two or three flights checking in. Only British Airways has a single line check in system and I can see it getting a bit chaotic for other airlines if things get busy. Again very quick through passport control into a very spacious departures area. being a new terminal facilities were limited to a huge duty free shop (cheap) an 'english style' pub that is fairly expensive at 20YTL (£7.70) for a sandwich and coke a Burger King on the mezzanine level (again expensive) and a small coffee area next to the BA Gate (you guess £2.50 for a small coffee).

The airport itself is modern and clean and the transfer counter was clearly marked. After lining up to obtain my boarding passes my passport and baggage ticket was photocopied and I was told to take a seat and wait approximately 10 mins for my boarding pass which I thought was odd. After 30 mins of waiting I lined up again to ask where my pass was and I was rudely told to sit back down and that my pass was at the gate and that they would arrive shortly. A number of passengers were taking the same journey and we were all quite nervous about boarding our connecting flight on time. A further 30 mins later someone came out of the gates with our boarding passes and handed them out. How on earth is this normal practice in an international airport? What made the poor organisation worse was the temper of the people behind the counter and the three females sitting behind him literally filing their nails while 50 people were waiting for passes.

However, no airport on earth takes as long to get your checked luggage from the plane to the baggage carousels. It has been like this for decades. We always sit in the back of the plane, therefore always the last ones off. Stop in terminal for a restroom break, then head down to baggage claim. The plane has already been at the gate for 15 minutes. This is not the biggest airport. When you arrive at baggage claim, you have a choice of 3 baggage carousels (Terminal 2, Southwest). None of the three carousel signs have your flight number on it. You stand in the crowd of people all looking from carousel to carousel to see if your flight number has shown up yet.

Passing through a few days ago the queue for departures security checking had over 100 passengers waiting and stretched outside the terminal to the ""arrivals"" taxi queue! ""Upgrading"" the security area is currently causing regular 40/50 minute delays-after check-in. Airside insufficient seating had passengers standing and blocking walk ways whilst awaiting their flight departures-and this was mid-afternoon in November as opposed to a peak high season departure time. The arrival of Ryanair and the proposed January arrival of Easyjet (from BFS-Belfast International) has added to the considerable strain this facility was under over 3 years ago yet there are no signs of the expansion of passenger facilities. The ""passenger collection point"" was once a tin cabin in a far off point in the car park has dissapeared and has been replaced with an open plastic covered ""wind tunnel"". Add to this the proposed extension of the single runway to accept bigger longer range aircraft and total chaos will surely ensue unless passenger areas are at least DOUBLED in size and facilities. Perhaps the smooth spin-talking management should have to catch a flight from their own airport as ""ordinary passengers"" to experience just what their ""customers"" have to suffer. If this airport was a retail outlet it would have closed down years ago through its atrocious customer services and lack of management concern for those who pay their wages.

It may be big but it is never a real chore to walk from one point to another and in many trips through the airport I have perhaps fortunately not found myself seriously having to race from one flight to another. The shops the bars and restaurants are generally of a very high standard as are the lounges and staff are generally very pleasant. I have but one criticism and that is security for flights to the UK. On my outward journey last week security check for the leg to Helsinki was fair and thorough but just a common ordinary security check; on the return journey from Amsterdam to Aberdeen the security was oppressive and obtrusive. Some staff were thoroughly unpleasant process was slow and perhaps amusingly and reassuringly the captain was forced to go through the scanner three times before he was allowed to board the flight. Nevertheless I find it strange that flights to the UK should be so much more thoroughly checked than others. Are we a greater risk or at greater risk or is this just a reaction to our not being members of the common border agreement in the EU? For all that I would still say Schipol is my favourite airport of the majors in Europe.

It made me cringe to watch a BA check-in team member twice shout loudly and rudely at a woman because she accidentally overstepped a line she should have waited behind. Or the immigration woman who was quite abusive to a lady who merely asked - not complained - why a retina scan was needed.

Having been in a holding pattern we arrived 15 mins late. As seems usual there were no gates so we had to wait for a bus which added about 15 mins to the delay. Upon arrival the promised displays which were to tell us our connecting gate were nowhere to be found. Airport personnel were unfriendly and obviously overburdened trying to handle the many people demanding to know where to go. All I got was a general direction 'go the left'. I followed that for a few minutes and found someone else to ask and was given a gate number which at least was in the general vicinity. Finally I found a display monitor which showed the correct gate which was 10 gates away. My recommendation is to avoid this airport if you need to make a connection.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

After 14 yrs in operation HKIA is still holding its own in the brutally competitive world of airport efficiency. I'd like to see timely expansion to HKIA as there are signs that the facility is under pressure from rapid demand growth in some vital areas. The last couple of times I used the airport which were in Jan 2013 Nov and Aug 2012 the immigration queues were getting depressingly long. Although as a local I got to pass through by the fast e-channel the excessively long immigration lines were worrying and must be unpleasant for visitors. Baggage claim was also taking longer and certainly lagged behind HKIA's rival Changi. It's about time the Airport Authority got to work to up HKIA's game yet again to stay ahead of the competition.

belfast-airport,/airport-reviews/belfast-airport,Belfast Airport customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2011-09-29,Small changes (yet again) from my last trip through. There is a new food area called 'fed and watered’ where 'Rankins' used to be (nice but usual airport high prices). Also after leaving security you are deposited into the recently refurbished original food court area looks nicer but is still over-priced. My personal impression of security (see previous reviews) was a little better than usual on this trip but only just and from observing interaction with other travellers it's still poor. The term 'officious' in previous reviews reflects my experience of security well in general. The web site shows that the current round of investment has now finished so that unlike the last few years the airport probably won't change layout every couple of months. Finally I have neglected to mention before my experience on return. UK boarder control has been excellent and the baggage hits the carrousel very quickly.

Luckily we arrived before the Virgin and UA flight from LHR as there would have been huge lines otherwise at immigration. I raced to immigration and was attended to immediately. The immigration officer was extremely rude and did not have a good knowledge of English. She asked also very detailed questions about what sights I will visit during my stay in SF and I had to talk about 5 minutes about attractions I want to visit. I found this a bit ridiculous but I guess that's normal nowadays if you enter the US. Luggage took quite a while as it was a full 747 but afterwards I got through customs within seconds where a very friendly customs officer took my form. From there the BART station was a short stroll away and it is very cheap and quick to get in to town (USD 8.10). Departed on Southwest at T1 and found the experience not bad. Took the BART to the airport and then the SkyTrain to Terminal 1. Check-in was very quick and security was also quite efficient and fast. Facilities are so-so with a few places to eat and one or two newspaper shops. Terminal was quite crowded as some planes where delayed due to the weather.

Two good parts of the airport are the well-lit spacious feel to the building and the little masseuse station near gate 13. Otherwise the dining opportunities are very weak. If you want a Starbucks for instance forget it. If you want pale imitations of local restaurant chains you are in luck. Even more useless is an entire store a large store devoted to a local college football team souvenirs. The roads to the airport are terrible. Poorly-designed traffic flow is compounded by missing or misleading signage so visitors in rental cars give yourself plenty of time to find the airport and return your car.

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,Eric McPherson,United Kingdom,2014-03-26,What an awful place CDG is we tend to avoid it like the plague unless we have to. Booked a flight from the UK transferring in CDG only to find that the connecting flight was cancelled then it appeared to be delayed then it became a technical issue. Air France clearly could not make up their mind what was the problem but it was clear that they just pushed all passengers on the next flight so the delay (in the end they settled for a delay even the airport information signs changed from cancelled to delayed as otherwise they would had to come up with compensation payment of course) and accidentally the delay was rectified at the exact same time the next flight was meant to leave. Clearly there weren't 2 aircraft's waiting they just bumped us on the next one. We were stuck at the airport for six hours with a child oh dear what a disaster. Don't know what they were thinking when they designed the place but it's just such an awful place to waste your time. The design of the place is bland industrial soulless and boring and there is absolutely nothing to do but feel sorry for yourself having to spend time there. They have a handful of shops but many of these sell overpriced French design stuff which an average passenger can never afford. Staff in the shops make you feel awkward. Having these shops just sums up what this airport is about presumptuous style of substance. To make things worse the airport staff do not exactly understand the meaning of what good customer support is about. Some staff are rude and one just made us wait just to finish a chat with their colleagues with a queue waiting to speak to them. Again avoid the place.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,S Shepherd-Stubbs,United Kingdom,2013-10-15,Luton drop off zone where it can cost 9.21 pounds per minute. We use this airport for 10 return trips a year on average flying in and out of Spain if we had the opportunity to use a convenient alternative we would not hesitate. On 17th July we went to collect some Spanish friends their flight was delayed by 15 minutes and like a previous reviewer we didn't see the sign that said 15 minutes maximum wait. So we sat in our car for the extra 14 minutes not leaving it once. We then left and went on our way on the 18th July we flew back to Spain. When we returned in September there were two letters waiting one a fixed penalty notice for £80 sent 10 days after the collection and a second legal letter saying the case had been referred. We were not given the option to pay the reduced amount and to cut a very long story short this has now cost £131. Coupled with the rude service from security staff who insist that even with toiletries in a clear bag that their own need to be used this airport and it's staff are probably the worst in the UK and you have to take a deep breath to walk through smokers polluting the entrances and exits.

The queue would have progressed well if a number of journalists had not been given priority treatment which held up one of the desks for 30 mins. Also the non-US line was divided into two by a very elderly man working for Immigration who waited until there was a jam then released some people into a second queue but did so in such a way as to prolong the queue and queue-jump some people. The real problem however was that there were simply not enough staff on duty there. There were more desks closed than open. Once through the rest of the experience was fine.

As we previously had visited the USA, had a valid ESTA and a machine readable passport we were able to use the passport machines. Quite straightforward and my wife and I were able to get clearance in the same transaction. A little tricky getting our finger prints in the correct position on the scanner. The machines printed out a form which we handed to the immigration agent. A few brief questions and a passport stamp and we were through. This was much the quicker route than traditional queuing. Bags arrived promptly and 30 minutes after getting off the plane we were standing at the taxi rank. Some airport hotels don't send their shuttles to the international terminal so we took a taxi to the Hampton Inn College Park. About $15 and well worth it. The alternative would be to take a shuttle to the domestic terminal and then wait for a hotel shuttle. A most pleasant arrival, we were having our first beer in a restaurant 60 minutes after arrival. Departure - Dropped off our car at the central rental centre. A shuttle bus took us to the international terminal. The bus arrived after 5 minutes waiting - but it was small and some people were left behind. We arrived at the terminal 3 hours before our flight at about 7pm and no queues at the BA check in desk and security was very quick. Didn't do any shopping and went upstairs to the food court. I cant say I was impressed. An expensive restaurant and 4-5 fast food outlets. Similar to a shopping mall but twice the price. My recommendation is to eat before you get to the airport if you want a good meal at reasonable prices. Fortunately, we were able to use the Club lounge. Boarding a little bit chaotic as a full flight and a lot of carry on luggage, that the gate agents put many bags in the hold.

And of course if you don't like the food and shopping options in the arm of the terminal you're in your only option is to yes wade through a security checkpoint all over again! The problem is compounded by poor signage often courtesy of Lufthansa (could someone please instruct them that white lettering on a yellow background is not a readable choice). At one point I didn't even notice I had exited one security zone to enter another until I was almost past it (no sign saying ""Leaving secure zone"" only a ""no entry"" sign facing the other way!). When I asked the security officer who saw me there trying to see what the other side of the sign said he forced me to go through the security line all over again if I wanted to turn back! Of course this wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem if each section of each terminal had adequate food and shopping options but all but one of them most emphatically do not. International travelers going through a major hub expect more choices (without a trip through security) than just one sit-down restaurant one coffee shop one news stand and a duty-free! I won't even get started on the small infrequent and hard-to-find restrooms. That said if your destination/departure is Frankfurt the range of ground transport options hotels and car hire makes it quite convenient. For everone else I'd much rather connect through a modern efficient hub like Amsterdam or Zurich!",NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The small amount of seating available in the departures terminal and departures “lounge” is all absolutely filthy. Far too filthy to sit on. The management seems only to be concerned with charging passengers at every opportunity - we are forced to pay for dropping off passengers in the short term drop off area then a £2 non-refundable charge to use a trolley then a small plastic bag in which to deposit our medication etc before passing through security.

Things come out in random order with empty bins interspersed. Items pulled for further screening aren't announced. You have to notice that one of your bags is in a different area while any other carry-on's sit in the chaos. One long security line was diverted suddenly to a completely different area requiring a ten-minute walk with no explanation given. The signs indicated different terminal letters from the one we needed. When we asked for clarification we were just shouted at to do what we were told. Food and drink and far away from many gates.

Not the best impression for an international entry point for the USA. Do not even attempt to make a connecting flight with under 3 hours to spare. We had to queue 25 mins for an automatic passport check queued 20 minutes to see an immigration official then picked up luggage then queued again to someone to check our reason for visiting rechecked bags then had to clear security again (more queuing). On top of that the boarding cards from LHR didn't work so we were sent back to the American Airlines desk to be reissued new ones. Until we got to a gate staff were almost universally unhelpful (we were told by all that we had time to make our flight easily). American airlines blame the airport and take no responsibility for the systematic chaos and the airport staff apparently don't get any feedback that people are missing their flights because of the queuing. We missed our flight to SLC were put on standby for the next one late at night were booked onto one the following day in the end which was cancelled when we arrived at the airport the next morning. Not to mention last minute gate changes causing havoc and confusion for passengers. We did get to SLC in the end having been issued 5 separate lots of boarding cards. The journey back through DFW was much easier but from other reviews it sounds like our experience of entering at this airport is not unusual.

The distance from arriving at the gate to baggage reclaim is verging on ridiculous. It took 45 minutes from arriving on stand to clear immigration and reach baggage reclaim and the bags still didn't arrive for at least 10 minutes after that! Signage is either non existent or completely useless the general facilities are very poor. On arriving back at the airport when we eventually found the bus stop in the city centre we had a wait to check in but there is no where to sit! The place is enormous with miles and miles of nothing literally. No seats no shops no where decent to eat or drink no staff to help.

Transport from the airport to Cancun is frustrating as you are guided to the $60 taxis. There is no signage or other directions to the $1.50 shuttle that departs every half hour.

Another drawback is that in the newest part where the non-Schengen flights leave there is only one place to get food or coffee.

We had booked a flight allowing us some 2.5 hours to navigate the complexities of MIA processing systems and get to our flight on time. According to all documentation this is some 1.5 hours more than the minimum required. MIA were in a state of “reduced staff due to budget cuts” according to the signage. We were held prior to immigration and passport control for a term that combined with the queues at immigration resulted in missing the return flight to the UK. AA informed us that the airport was 100% at fault. AA informed us there was no options available to us to return to the UK that evening and for the next 2 days due to flights being fully booked. Only option given to us was a flight to JFK – arriving at 12.15 am on Sunday 17th – then a 9.30am flight to the UK in the morning. The only option we had was to stay on the JFK airport floor for the duration or until an airport lounge opened at 7.30 am.

new-york-jfk-airport,/airport-reviews/new-york-jfk-airport,New York JFK Airport customer review,Richard Vrolijk,NA,2009-04-22,JFK Airport T4. For departing flights it's really a nice terminal with quite a bit of choice on stores and 2 or 3 places to eat. Getting through check-in isn't a big problem and rarely takes long. On the times I've had to go through it took about 15 min on average. Arriving at T4 is a different story though. I forgot the exact number customs counters they have think it's about 22 they rarely are all open. Most times there were only 4 or 5 open at a time. Bare in mind that it takes roughly between 5 and 10 minutes at the counter itself to go through and that there's usually 3 or 4 flights coming in at the sametime it builds up a line of roughly 600 to 800 passenger. sometimes more sometimes a bit less. So you do the math of how long you'll have to wait in line. For me it was an avarage of 2 hour waiting whereas 30 minutes of them there was no movement at all. My advice to everyone traveling to JFK and arriving at Terminal 4 get a front row seat in the plane or as closest to the front as possible and when you're allowed to get off the plane hurry to the line as the difference between a front row seat and a rear row seat can easily add a few hours to your waiting time.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,D Sengupta,India,2013-03-27,The worst airport I have transited through in a western country. Aside from the dated concrete-tunnel design of the terminal building the way the entire clearance process is laid out for passengers arriving on international flights and transferring to domestic ones is quite illogical. Arriving passengers have to walk through a narrow walkway to arrive at the immigration checkpoint which is in a room clearly too small to handle the number of passengers passing through. Our flight arrived in the afternoon together with 12 other international flights as a result of which the room was overflowing and stuffy. TSA had 10-12 counters open for US citizens and about 6 for non-citizens. The total time taken for us to clear immigration and customs was 1.5 hrs. The flight we were connecting to was placed at the other end of the tunnel and had our incoming flight not arrived half an hour prior to scheduled time we certainly would have missed our connecting flight despite a planned 2 hour gap from disembarkation to boarding! The terminal building is narrow overcrowded and full of stores in the middle of the corridor which make it difficult to run from one end to the other or (if these are available at all) to take a cart.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Surprisingly shops and restaurants are present after immigration check and were not bad given the size of the airport. Excellent wifi and sufficient car parking space. The airport is located near some large shopping malls like Jekta that's something I really like. Domestic arrival: OSL-TOS - As it was a domestic flight there was no need for us to go through immigration. Really quick to get to the terminal and our baggage came fast too. Domestic departure: TOS-ARN - Available SAS counters were really limited. Long queues in the afternoon as there were quite a number of SAS and Wideroe flights departing that afternoon. It took 15-20 minutes for us to check-in our baggage. Departure hall is located on the 2nd floor while the check-in hall is located on the 1st floor together which is the arrivals hall. Quite cumbersome here. Security check was fast though. International departure: TOS-LYR - This is the only international route at TOS and gate 20 has been designated for this route. Only two counters so long queue for passport control. Quite poorly controlled. International arrival: LYR-TOS - Same problem. Only two counters again so long queue for passport control. CCTV is absent and I saw one man just passed through the door (which is supposed to have been locked but turned out to have not been locked) to the baggage reclaim area without passing through immigration.

Added to that everyone I encountered was unfriendly. While I expect that from airport security personnel I don't expect it from Lufthansa customer service. I asked a simple question of the check-in person at the lounge whether this particular lounge has shower facility I got a curt and snooty reply: ""Of course this is Lufthansa lounge.""

Since tourism kept increasing every year a new international terminal was needed. Terminal 3 started on 1998. Since it is not a big airport I think is running fairly well. I had been in Havana 5 times arriving from different countries. As a rule Immigration is fairly quick although I found it particularly slow one night when 3 flights from Europe arrived almost at the same time (1 hour waiting) . Luggage collection is OK. Public transport from Terminal 3 is non existing but they are plenty of taxis and the ride to the center takes no more than 30 minutes.

On departure, whilst the security was not exactly top class prior to the changes made over the past year, it has now become comfortably the worst I've experienced in the past ten years. Only two lanes were open despite a long queue. Those lanes which were open were a complete shambles - the system simply doesn't seem to work. To make a bad situation worse, as others have commented, the staff are extremely abrupt (possibly they are frustrated with the shortcomings of the system they work with, but who really cares?) to the point of being rude.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Harry Burlaque,United States,2011-07-21,Mumbai air terminals are far from international standards. No internal connection between the international and domestic terminals. The bags need to be checked out and depending on the airline you may have to carry the baggage to the other terminal by yourself in a dingy bus. This bus makes about one trip per hour; and puts you out of the secure area so be prepared to be screened again by the airport security. The domestic terminal has loud shrill announcers on the PA system. Between the loud security-check operations and the loud announcers there is no quiet spot anywhere in this domestic-terminal. If you are flying internationally out of Mumbai airport be prepared for some heavy-duty paper work and lines. Be sure you get hold of all necessary forms to be filled in before lining up for the immigration.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

However my experiences at T5 have been dreadful - long queues for Border Control and Security. So much so that I cannot rely on two hours being sufficient to get from an inbound international flight to a domestic connection. Border Control staff are impassive and unhelpful but BAA staff are downright rude inefficient and ill-informed. Schiphol can manage 45 minutes gate to gate - are very friendly and obviously want my business. Likewise Newark. It is obvious that the Border and Security facilities at T5 are inadequate for the numbers passing through but a look at other airports would show that significant improvements could be made with little investment - moving a barrier here; moving a machine there; better training and utilization of the existing facilities and staff.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

MRS is a well built and user friendly airport that provides a reasonable service to travellers. Mr Parra does not mention at all which airline or which Departure hall he was using. All departure halls have business lounges indeed the International hall has a lounge called ""Cezzane"" and provides very good facilities for business travellers (you need a key pass from the check-in but if your flying business you will receive one) the Domestic (AF and codeshares) has a smaller but none-the-less comfortable business lounge. All airlines with the exception of the ""North African"" and charter/low cost flights have dedicated business check-in in both halls. Again there is a large duty/tax free shop in the International hall very well stocked and in fact perhaps a little to big for its size. All departure halls provide F&B facilities and all are open untill the last flight has departed. There are technically 3 departure halls at MRS and all have access or provide the above.

After a 10 hour flight we arrived in the customs hall only to be greeted by screaming and unhelpful customs personnel who didn't seem to care how they treated people.

My first time to Toronto and I received clear information on how to proceed from the gate to customs and immigration from the airline staff and the security officers (who were very helpful and friendly a marked and positive difference to their colleagues in the United States). The only brief confusion I had was about whether I had to pick up my baggage and re-check it or whether it would be sent all the way through. Airport personnel were friendly and cleared up my questions. As I had a very long layover (11 hours) I decided to take a bus and tram into downtown Toronto during my layover. The information booth staff was nice and recommended the bus and subway I should take gave me a map and wrote instructions on it and also pointed me to a Toronto Transit vendor for the appropriate passes. Upon returning to the airport security moved quickly the agents were once again friendly and I found my gate without delay.

The facilities are quite good with separate gate areas for Qantas and Virgin Blue/Regional Express. My only gripe is the stupid policy that only allows you to drop-off near the terminal but not pick up passengers and their luggage even if they are waiting at the kerb. This is supposedly for 'security reasons' but why then do they allow drop-offs.

Be prepared to be frisked for no reason because the alarm will go off though you have no metal on your person whatsoever. Be prepared to miss your flight because that is the likely outcome of the complete and utter inefficiency and disorganization. Be prepared to have no one care whatsoever about your plight. I will say that during our last segment out of CDG we used Sky Priority through terminal 2E and we never had an easier time. The man at the desk was very polite and helpful the security line was non-existent and we couldn't believe how easy the experience had been when our flight from CDG to Rome (FCU) a week earlier was an absolute horror.

For safety (to ensure a reasonably well-maintained vehicle) and reliability it is best to have a driver meet you rather than trying to get into the city center on your own. Departure area amenities are minimal due in part to renovation works. (After renovation is complete LOS might rate three stars.) Security of baggage is a concern at LOS.

From the baggage claim area you need to take an escalator or elevator up a couple of floors cross a walkway over the main airport road then find your way to the monorail (and decipher the confusing signs to know what direction you need to go). Don't try it with lots of bags unless you have a cart (and know in advance how to lock the wheels so it doesn't roll down the monorail car).

cardiff-airport,/airport-reviews/cardiff-airport,Cardiff Airport customer review,Bob Alexander,NA,2008-04-29,We flew into Cardiff airport on Thursday 24th April intending to get public transport to central Cardiff. We missed the two buses that could have got us there (one direct and one via a rail connection) as they left the stand within a couple of minutes of each other and then we had to wait an hour for the next to arrive although one was scheduled to have arrived after about 45 minutes it did turn up but having dropped passengers off it drove away without picking up the waiting passengers. This was at 5pm so hardly an off-peak period!! We returned to the airport on Monday 28th April to fly to Malaga. It took us an hour to check in with bmibaby although there were only about a dozen people in the queue ahead of us. When we got to the desk we were a kilo overweight so we removed a bag of magazines from our suitcase and put it in our cabin bag which was almost empty. This put us below 20 kilos but the girl did not seem too happy at what we had done and insisted that we put the cabin bag in a measuring cradle even though it was a regulation size airline cabin bag. It fitted easily needless to say. Was she resentful at not being able to charge us excess baggage? We have travelled dozens of times all over the world with that bag and never been asked to prove its measurements before. Then it was the turn of the security check into departures. One desk open a large queue of people and further delays. We and others expressed our annoyance at the fact that there were 11 other security staff just hanging about chatting to each other. To add further insult to passengers some 'staff' who had been waiting to clear security were called forward and given priority over paying customers! The general facilities of the airport seem good but clearly there is a major management problem which causes problems for passengers and probably results in loss of revenue for airport shops/cafes etc. as passengers spend so much time in queues they have little time left for anything else.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I found the airport staff to be very rude and surly. They have no idea how to be polite to travellers. The point is if it wasn't for travellers they would not have a job. Another thing is they take your duty free away from you even when you are in transit. If you travel from England (for instance) and you are in transit you have to collect your luggage and book in with LIAT or what other airline you are travelling with and then when you check-in at customs they take your duty free that you have with you. Surely people are entitled to take their duty free to their destination. I think the airport should have a transit lounge so that travellers don't have to go outside and back in again.

That means you have to walk to the main terminal on arrival or before going into Departures. Once you have passed the frontier police there are no toilets until the plane. If there are two jets leaving close to the same time then the departures area is absolutely swamped. The queues go through the middle of the restaurant and down through the (duty) free store.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,Rebecca Rogers,Australia,2013-02-26,Just through the new A380 terminal in Dubai which opened fully a couple of weeks ago. Really good idea having the Business Class Lounge as a linked series of lounges grouped to the Gates. So we arrived in to the terminal and walked through the general concourse of shops easily found the signs to follow to find the Business Class Lounge which is on the top floor. Once admitted to the Lounge the thing is to go to your Gate Number and use the lounge area there. You can wander all over and sit anywhere you like but it makes sense to park yourself near your departure gate. Boarding then is easy just put down the champagne glass (in my case!) and go through to the lift which takes you down 3 floors to your aircraft door. The lounge is well set out well appointed good shower rooms (for women can't say about the men) and a series of hot and cold food and drink counters throughout. Very comfortable chairs the usual magazines etc (happy to find a locally printed copy of The Australian). I like the concept and the execution of it. At last a lounge big enough to take the volume of passengers going through in comfort. Well decorated.

However there is a US$49 departure tax which is taken at the same time as checking in. It is a very haphazard process with the money just being stuffed in a brown envelope. We paid US$50 and 80000 Tanzanian shillings for two of us as I didn't have another $50 note. No change was offered and when questioned the official said that the tax is actually 85000 shillings (if not paying in $) which is way more than $49 so he was doing us a favour!

The document check and the customs control are surprisingly smooth and fast. It takes about 20 minutes to pass the airport building including the controls.

edmonton-airport,/airport-reviews/edmonton-airport,Edmonton Airport customer review,Justin Patrie,NA,2005-06-30,Edmonton International Airport is a wonderful mid-sized facility. After its expansion and renovation the airport now sports a brilliantly clean modern open and airy look that is refreshing after coming off a long flight. 3-story atriums with vaulted ceilings and floor-ceiling windows mark the wide and rarely-crowded departure halls. Services at the airport are also impressive for a facility of its size with many good shops and restaurants and great touches like an observation deck free power outlets and desks for those with a laptop. I also like this airport for its lack of crowds (with exception to the mornings). Compared to the maddening masses at the big hubs Edmonton is one airport which has actually not maxed out its capacity yet but has in fact already built to accommodate further growth. The only downside is the distance to the city. A taxi can cost over C$40 (US$32) though there are shuttles which charge less than half that and when push comes to shove it very rarely takes over 35 minutes to get downtown.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

We finally got our boarding card but after this everybody had to move their luggage to the one scanner that was working at the other side of the departures hall. Again chaotic queuing and pushing.

My mother and I plus several other EasyJet passengers had to ask where the check in desk was as it was not clearly sign posted and the airport was very busy with long queues. After waiting at the Baggage Drop off I was told when I reached the desk that as I only had hand luggage I didn't need to be at that desk! It would be very helpful if there could be a sign saying that passengers flying with just hand luggage may proceed to wherever they have to go next rather than stand in a queue they needn't be in. Also could there be signs (or maybe a friendly human) informing passengers when they need to have their passport/boarding pass ready so that they don't hold the queue up any more than need be. Plus signs well in advance saying what items need to be taken out of their luggage before its scanned as again that can cause unnecessary delays. Finally could ALL airport staff remember that they do their job every day and know the routine but a lot of the travellers going through this airport may be nervous or first time flyers in a different country or tired from a long haul or early flight and would appreciate being treated with courtesy and having any problems dealt with politely. Travellers can be stopped from flying if they are aggressive or rude to staff so could airport workers return the courtesy as good manners cost nothing but go a long way.

If you are flying direct to the US you do pre-clearance before boarding which is a real timesaver and it was quick and effortless. Downsides of this airport is getting to the car-rental site although a short walk across the street from the airport the entire area is under construction and each rental company has a small construction site type building which can only accomodate a few people so you if there was a line up for a particular car rental you might end up waiting outside and getting to these also means walking through construction scafolding with no overhead protection from the elements.

It is simply a night mare going through this airport. The size is not the problem it’s the people working and hanging around the airport. The new bigger airport will be bigger problem for the passengers. With correct education and management the current airport is sufficient. An immigration officer to stamp an entry stamp on Pakistani passport takes 1 hour to deal with 7 to 10 passengers as he/she is forced to use some sort of database. Their typing speed is about 1 character per 40 sec provided they are undistracted by relatives arriving same day. While departing for each passenger there is change over of 10 counter staff before you are issued with boarding pass.

I once waited in line for 2.5 hours there for my ongoing boarding card - folks were missing their flights because of the wait. However - the staff are friendly and helpful once you can get hold of someone who knows. For folks with a long in airport wait for ongoing flights its wise to book into one of the special lounges. The restaurant on floor 5 is good. By the way - if you have to wait for a connecting flight you won't get a meal voucher unless you ask for it that is if your flight qualifies for one.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,P Baxter,Australia,2010-09-27,Just spent 7 hours waiting in transit lounge at Delhi Airport whilst travelling London to Delhi with Air India and Delhi to KL with Air Asia in circumstances where my wife and I could have and should have spent no longer than 5 minutes in the area. The rule operating in practice is that you cannot transit until the airline which delivered you to Delhi signs you over and you are accepted by the airline taking you out again. This is so even where you are appropriately ticketed and have an internet boarding pass for the ongoing flight. So if there is no one available at your ongoing airline or no one processes your request from the arriving airline you simply sit and wait and are effectively left in limbo. The only way to get through is to constantly harass the staff to keep checking on where matters are for your particular case. You are invariably told each time you approach the desk by the person on the counter that they do not work for the particular airline that you are flying out on and the matter is not their responsibility. Air India appears to be the only company represented in the transit area. Many people are forced to spend long periods (in some cases more than 24 hours) confined in the transit room with no shops or other facilities. This is completely unnecessary where passengers hold ongoing ticketing. No one appears to be in charge or available to deal with passenger transit. You are just locked in a room and left to fend for yourself. I saw many very frustrated and distressed people unable to have their individual transit situations appropriately dealt with. The many individual staff members at the transit desk whilst personally pleasant were incompetent to handle the situation. The whole shambolic situation is a debacle.

There was a line for Channel Island passport holders why not for UK citizens? Yet another way that British citizens are treated unfairly. There was no extra visible security. You need to look at the way the States run their airports!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,A Ennab,Jordan,2012-08-21,Used this airport twice last week once arrived off-peak and had an excellent experience. The other time I arrived in the late evening when the immigration area was crowded with what must have been thousands of passengers. It took exactly one hour and ten minutes hour to pass through with only 4 or 5 immigration offers actually at desks which is nothing for such a huge airport and one of the officers actually left his desk halfway through! There were about 3 or 4 other officers just walking around directing people and managing queues which would probably not actually be necessary if they just got behind a desk and stamped passengers passports instead!,NA,NA,NA,6,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

philadelphia-airport,/airport-reviews/philadelphia-airport,Philadelphia Airport customer review,W Ryan,United States,2010-02-11,"Recently flew US Airways PHL -SJU (San Juan PR) - PHL. Departure from PHL went smoothy except that it took longer than expected to go thru the TSA checkpoint. (We did make our flight.) However on return to PHL plane arrived at Terminal A but (as is procedure) bags are sent to Terminal B. Saw no signs indicating how to get from Terminal A to Terminal B. When we finally realized we were ""lost"" we asked the Info Desk. She told us we had to walk outside to get to Terminal B. Having come from PR we were in only shirtsleeves and it was 19 degrees out! She said it's about a 3 minute walk and she was right! If somebody knows that there is an ""inside"" connector hall between A and B please post on this PHL chain. (I tried to see if there was an A-B Term. connector hall on the US Air website but couldn't see one for sure.) The other problem we had and have had it almost every time we've flown into PHL is that they rarely put the correct flight numbers on the monitors over the baggage carousels. And there are 6 carousels in Terminal B. So you don't know which one of 6 carousels your bags might be on. (Or else they'll put the flight # and say ""Carousel 2"" but in fact the bags from that flight end up on Carousel 4."" (Kind of an on-going April Fool's joke!) Fortunately our bags are fairly easy to spot. Choice of restaurants is good and food prices are not a rip-off. Prices were a good bit higher at SJU airport than at PHL.

It is possible to access a hot spot however it isn't free it requires a Chinese mobile phone number and the login page is displayed only in Mandarin. The information desk staff need to speak and understand decent English (because it's an international airport after all) and also need to know exactly which facilities are available in which locations.

The airport is full of temporary surprises and mediocre or missing installations signage toilets. Queuing up in lines as check in is semi-manual. Many pax miss flights due to poor or incomplete announcements. Lots of delays. Domestic uses cargo building. Luggage handed out one by one or are picked by pax from trolleys. One has to inquire about flights and crosscheck info on departures and arrivals all the time.

Airside quite busy the only positive is the new security area which is a big improvement. On return an unbelievable queue for immigration which stretched round several corridors and a shambolic effort to separate inward domestic passengers from international arrivals.

The security staff at the x-ray checkpoint took their time though while the Air Serbia personnel at the flight gate in plain view were calling us to hurry as if the delays were our fault. They started by checking our duty free allowance and receipts then the hand luggage to check our watches and jewellery (we were moving back to Europe with all our belongings) and then had to wait another few minutes to have my shoes x-rayed. When we finally departed the clerk was still working our still screens. We flew from Sydney for 24 hours then. We have been re-checked in Abu Dhabi. We have just descended from the previous flight and we have been escorted to the checkpoint. What was there to check so thoroughly again? Since when were watches and jewellery a security point concern? Or was there an over zealous clerk on duty? Aren't there any clear instructions of what they are to check?

We walked into the terminal at about 8.30 am, and it was chaos. It looked as though they weren't expecting any travelers to show up. The Southwest line was ridiculously long. (A Southwest employee said they reason they were so busy was because Sunday was a busy day for international travel). No express lines for those of us who already had our boarding passes and just needed to check our bags. The check-in equipment would not even scan our boarding pass. Once we finished checking in our bags, then came the TSA security lines. No one in line could believe how they had us snaked around the terminal. From the time our taxi dropped us off to the time we arrived at our gate, it took almost 2 hours.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,R Orme,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,Going through security is not a good experience - you have to go upstairs (and down again afterwards) - presumably to maximise retail space. Also there is a problem if you're 'patted down' or sent through the body scanner - the tray with your valuables has now gone through and anyone could pick up your phone/tablet or take your handbag - not a good experience. Then when you get back downstairs you're taken on a long detour through retail but unlike IKEA there's no cut-through. Do they want you to feel a valued customer and offer you a user-friendly experience or are they trying to get you to spend money?

Check your airlines departure point - may not be from the separate domestic terminal which is a taxi ride away from the international hall). Good and clean facility security to enter the airport checks bags and persons through detector gate. Toilets clean and well signed. Gates clearly marked for departures. An outdoor cafe offers croissants pastries sandwiches coffee and teas - with a table service - but as with all the other comments - watch the prices - 2 coffees 2 crossants costs 22YTL - and from the cafe inside at departure 24 YTL for 2 glasses of fresh orange juice. Upstairs a further cafe offers meals but closed at time of day at he airport and can't presume the prices were better. One small shop with a few sweets and gifts - but no stamps sold here so don't plan to post any last minute mail. Limited seating in departure hall - 10 seats in total - (plus others for the cafe) before going through passport control. Prompt and efficient check-in procedures handling a fairly full flight. Good signs for departures and quick passport checks. Ample seating at gates. No air bridge to planes though so expect to get wet in poor weather. Apart from food prices - a good and efficient place.

Considering that the competition for that ""honor"" includes JFK and Miami that's how bad Dulles is. The fundamental problem with Dulles is that it looked really ""cool"" on the drawing board in the late 1950's when it was designed with no airplanes at gates and everyone being shuttled to and from the aircraft in people movers. It worked just fine when there were two flights to London and one to Paris every day. Then they built the ""mid-field terminals"". Now there are so many international flights that immigration and customs on arrival can take hours and here's a real kicker-there are two separate immigration and customs areas. If you are ending your journey at Washington you go to the main terminal if you are making a connection you stay in the mid-field arrival terminal. If the guy sorting luggage at your origin put your bags in the wrong container you could wait for hours for your bag to show up at the correct customs terminal.

The trip to Georgetown Bahamas on American Airlines was satisfactory and uneventful. Changing planes at the American Airlines terminal in Miami while not bad had one curiosity that I do not understand. It turns out that the terminal has a small train service that can whisk you from one side to the other in less than 5 minutes. There was no signage in the terminal indicating that this convenience even existed. When I finally asked for help I found out about the train and where to catch it. Terminal 3 at Heathrow has much better signage for its labyrinths. On the return it took us an hour to get through Customs get our luggage and check-in to TSA security. While waiting for our aircraft to arrive 3 hours late we noticed that the airport restaurants coffee shops etc. started to close down at 9 pm! By 10 pm there was nothing available.

That could be a problem with the airline but actually managing the bags at Oslo was hard. Having got our bags and already in possession of our boarding passes we were shunted away from bag drop off to the main (long) queue where in effect we had to check in again. After security we entered a lounge area absolutely packed with people were we had a 4 hour wait for our next flight. It was hot and noisy and it took my wife and I almost an hour to get 2 seats together. There were very long queues at all the shops and cafes. There were far too many people for this terminal. Finally at boarding the agent held my wife up as she is not a British national. Even though my wife doesn't actually need a visa to visit the UK and even though she does have one the agent insisted on checking by phone thereby holding up the queue of people trying to get on the plane. It was resolved after about 5 minutes but over the years and in many different countries we have never experienced a similar problem.

They have 60 booths for immigration when I went through they only had 3 open for non US Residents which is not a great impression when arriving into the US.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,N Werner,Switzerland,2010-09-01,I was prepared for the worst when I arrived at Bali airport after reading all those terrible reviews. I was arriving on Malaysia Airlines from KL and our flight was delayed for 1 hour. Maybe that was the reason that there was nobody queuing at immigration and we were outside within 20 minutes after arriving. Immigration and customs took no more than 5 minutes as my passport allows for a visa free entrance to Indonesia. Once you leave customs there is a long row of money changers but don't be a fool and change money there. The rates in town are much better. Our arrival was very efficient and I could not fault it except the long walk from our gate to immigration which took about 5-10 minutes as gate 2 is at the far end. Departure was not as good as you already have to pass through security just to enter the building. Check-in was ok and took a while even though we were already checked in online. Paying the exit tax was pretty straight forward and involved no queuing. Once pass immigration there are a few shops but the prices are not competitive if you compare it to other Asian airports in the region. The airport is old but I have seen worse. You pass through security again at your gate and once inside there is nothing much so do not bother going to early. Boarding was civilized but the infrastructure is really outdated. The gate agents set up a microphone and stereo set to announce the boarding calls as the gate did not have a speaker system.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,Steve Koenig,NA,2009-01-13,"A modern relatively comfortable airport. Also extremely busy with many families starting or ending holidays there which adds to the chaos in the check-out lines (lots of overweight baggage on the way out and far too few attendants at least at Delta). After checking in getting your bags weighed etc. you need to take all of your bags to a security area to leave them off for scanning (agents said to just leave our bags and leave which seemed to defeat the purpose of security; also not clear what would prevent one from adding items to their luggage to get around weight restrictions). Security line was relativey quick for us but have heard it can be very busy. Plenty of options for shopping and dining but far fewer once you go through security and take at train to your individual terminal. Returning a rental car can be a bit confusing since some companies have their return facilities next to the terminals (need to walk) and some are off-airport. Worse when we stopped to top-off the tank of our rental car several blocks from the airport entrance and with no price signs outside the station we found only at the tank that gas cost TWICE as much as we had paid several miles away.

paphos-airport,/airport-reviews/paphos-airport,Paphos Airport customer review,S Langston,United Kingdom,2012-12-06,Arriving was fine with no problems but I agree with the last reviewer on the holding cages. We flew from here on 4 December 2012 and were called urgently 1 hr and 20 mins before the flight was due to leave in fact our plane hadn't even landed. It was really cold with driving rain. We were herded into the cages where there were 6 fixed seats at the front and 6 at the back of the cage. These cages have 3 foot bars with spaces in between some flyover metal roofing and sail like material but with great gaps. There were many OAPs and several people with small children. This was a full Easyjet flight. There were many objections to this but the ground staff were unsympathetic. When objections kept coming the ground staff held the remainder of the passengers in the Terminal. The actual Terminal was by no means busy so it seemed ridiculous to hold us there. We were all soaking wet and frozen by the time we got on the plane. Goodness knows what the heat will be like in the height of summer with everyone on a full flight standing in these cages for an hour and a half. Buses eventually arrived to get us out of the rain but of course we were still standing and had to wait in the bus for some time I think the Easyjet pilot had realised our plight and insisted we were put on buses. He made an announcement to the fact that our boarding had been totally inappropriate and he would put it in his report.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

hannover-airport,/airport-reviews/hannover-airport,Hannover Airport customer review,Alex Mackie,NA,2005-10-08,An unusual 'system' in my view. At Hannover you first clear your luggage with security before checking in. This is done in the middle of the terminal. You are then not supposed to leave this 'secure' area until you have checked your bags in. However this simply doesn't work and people are able to leave (eg to the toilets) with their hold luggage labelled as 'security checked' and then check in. Another novelty (to me anyway) is that you don't go airside until you actually enter the holding lounge for your gate. So each gate has it's own secondary security check & immigration desk. Worth not going airside until the last possible minute in my view. Other than that a pleasant enough location with a good observation deck.

I didn't and sat jealously sweltering and being zapped by mozzies as I waited for my inevitably late flight. Otherwise if there is only one flight due there seems to be enough room and seats probably get too crowded if more than one flight waiting to depart. Arrival and getting through customs is a fuss and very slow although the security people are friendly I got my passport stamped as well as the visa when I asked (nice free souvenir). Toilets were a bit smelly and not totally functioning but did have toilet paper (Gents). Stuff is sold in both duty free shop and kiosks around the departure lounge. Note as expected the duty free shop is much cheaper. You can only pay in CUC's - or at an exorbitant markup by credit card. Good views of the apron from the lounge and the only downside is if you are a fervent anti-smoker. This is cuba they sell cigars you can work it out! Tip a few people had stuff confiscated from their hand luggage tobacco and spirits - I think it was all stuff that the proper export tax hadn't been paid on. Keep a few CUC's to slip the staff at the airport and they also really apreciated a drink or two. As everywhere the porters are quite bullish.

I have travelled Ryanair a lot but I have never set foot in what must be the worst airport they fly into. We fly out of Terminal 1. The airport is well sign posted from the road. We took the bus and it dropped us beside it. The check-in area was basic but efficient. My tip to anyone is do not go though security until about an hour before your flight is due to leave as once you get though security there is nothing there. Only enough seats for around 50 people in the departure lounge. We stupidly thought that maybe there would be better food in the departure lounge. All there is is a small Illy cafe which cost us 12 euros for 2 bags of crisps and 2 cokes. I know airport prices are bad but that took the biscuit. The departure lounge is so small and there was around 600 people there with only seats for 50 of them. One other poster said this airport reminded him of a barn I'd agree with that.

southampton-airport,/airport-reviews/southampton-airport,Southampton Airport customer review,Nathan Fotheringill,NA,2006-05-17,Our arrival at SOU was made remarkable by the fact that the baggage made it to the belt before we did and it was not as if we had to walk a long way from the aircraft to the terminal. We did have to wait for a taxi though (about five minutes) but I expect that was due to our arrival at 10pm the penultimate arrival of the day. Our departure was at 6:30pm on a Sunday. This is a busy time for the airport and Flybe in particular and we ended up at the check-in queue for about half an hour. Flying with hand baggage only would have been an advantage as there was a fast moving dedicated queue for those lucky souls. The delay did not leave us much time to explore the airport but it didn't matter as there isn't much to explore. A reasonable duty free shop confronts you after passing through the efficient security and that is about it. There is a cafe on an upper floor with views over the runway but no other retail outlets. My advice is to obtain your chocolate bar and newspaper in W H Smith before passing through security.

The result: more seats available but hardly anyone using them because of the need to get up to find a screen.

Having seen that the terminal building is a dump and needs replacing with a modern facility my expectations were very low. However immigration staff were helpful and the queue took about 45 minutes to clear. We were using a shuttle bus service to Disneyland while this was signposted it was a bit vague and we needed assistance from a rival bus company to find the right spot - which turned out to be a tiny traffic island overcrowded with fellow tourists.

san-juan-airport,/airport-reviews/san-juan-airport,San Juan Airport customer review,G Arce,United States,2014-07-27,I arrived yesterday at SJU. The airport looked clean but it has changed a lot since my visit last year. A lot of the eateries were removed so choices are few and far between. The biggest change is moving the car rental companies to a parking lot across the street. There are no shuttles to take you where the car rentals are. If you have a lot of luggage you are going to have to hire a baggage handler to take your luggage where the car rental companies are at. Even if you don't have a lot or no luggage at all you have to walk a significant distance to reach the car rental companies. There a no pick ups for the disabled if you have to go there you'll have to do that on your own power. When asked about it to the car rental person she said that the Mexicans that operate the airport changed it.

After 1 hour trying to figure out where our luggages were and where we were supposed to get our new boarding passes, we went from T1 to T2 as they were unable to issue us the boarding passes at the ticket counter.  After check in was completed, our luggage was still in the transit area, we went through security.

We were met off the flight by airline staff who did not identify themselves as such until asked then placed in quarantine in a locked area with two other transit passengers. The only facilities were a water fountain and a dirty toilet with no paper. The staff took our passports boarding passes and luggage receipts. To my relief they did come back an hour later with new boarding passes and luggage tags and let us out of the locked area.

As we passed by hundreds of the latter being shoved to one side in a barely air-conditioned terminal we winced upon finding an equally mammoth group of international travelers waiting for customs clearance around the corner. No more than 50% of the agent stalls were active as if the influx of travelers into the JFK facility was somehow unexpected! The outright rudeness combined with an obviously flawed system made us embarrassed to be Americans. Several other people in our U.S. line expressed the same sad sentiment. At the very least one would think that CBP could muster some employees with a sliver of civility who might greet arriving passengers in a friendly and apologetic manner especially considering the wait ahead.

First we checked in using the awesome virtual checkin machines. This went great. It was quick and easy to do. Then we had to try and find the place to check our bags. Well that was a different story. We asked the lady who was supervising the check in machines and she just sort of pointed in a random direction and said ""over there"". Well over there turned out to be an area a quarter of a mile down the corridor which we found more by accident than because the signage was helpful. When we arrived in this area they were filtering people through by their flight times. The area was way too small to hold the number of people who were coming through. There was a lot of yelling and pushing by the staff. They kept announcing the flight times they were taking and when no one was coming to the front the only person who was filtering people through would wander away to yell the info to the end of the line. 90% of the time no one there was waiting for that time. So the line up just kept getting bigger and bigger. They managed to create a bottleneck that was just ridiculous. We waited in this area for over an hour and 20 minutes before they would let us check our bags and go through to customs. We arrived at the airport as instructed 3 hours before flight time. This should have given us enough time to check in, grab breakfast and relax before boarding. Instead we had to rush just to make our plane. I'm still not sure why they were filtering people through this remote area. When we finally got let through we had to walk back to basically where we started, another quarter mile. For anyone with mobility issues this would be cruel. When we got to the next area there was nobody there but there were about 500 hundred of us that got let through at the same time because almost everyone in the holding area was waiting for an 8:45 flight. So again we had a bottleneck that took forever to get through. When we finally finished we barely made the boarding of our flight. We were unable to grab food.

The airport is OK but could be a whole lot better. The usual temptation for airports to prioritise income from rents over the smooth movement of passengers has prevailed. Many of the corridors in the satellite terminal have become narrow passageways because shops have been plonked in the middle of them. I'm sure the designers didn't intend it this way and it really grates on me that space and convenience for the users is sacrificed at the altar of the almighty ringgit. Add to this the propensity for people to shuffle three abreast in these narrow spaces and you have a number of unnecessary choke points. F&B outlets are plentiful but expensive and the airline lounges are generally pretty average. There are few places to sit in the terminal unless you're spending money (by design?) and the sanitation in the restrooms is not great although miles ahead of the disgraceful LCCT (thankfully now superseded by KLIA2) Taxi services like elsewhere in Malaysia are terrible and the access roads in the arrivals and departure areas are chaos with double parking in no standing zones the norm.

In view of the serious security problems at British airports someone in a foreign airport who can steal items from baggage could just as easily be putting something in! Almeria to Stansted appears to be the main problem and whilst the pilfering could be taking place at Stansted this is unlikely due to the limited amount of time the bags are available to the people doing the pilfering.

Are these multi-million Euro full scan machines less effective than the previous scanners requiring an additional fondling of passengers?

I do use the Qantas Business Class lounge which is usually not too crowded and definitely a bonus and worth it if you are prepared to fork out the fee for the Qantas Club; the priority boarding is also a huge bonus! Inbound I find usually OK even weaving through the Duty Free shop where at least the booze is significantly cheaper than retail. I use an ePassport now and haven't had a problem yet but even when using the agents didn't have a long wait. There's little point worrying even if it is slow because the baggage is going to be a longish time in arriving. Lifts to the various exit points outside Customs in the Arrivals Hall are far too small to handle more than about two luggage trolleys and far to few to move people at any reasonable speed or volume. Parking is obscenely expensive for anyone picking you up. My experiences in the past with the domestic terminal however are poor - unhelpful staff inefficient check-in even with the self check-in kiosks rude staff at the security screens. Overall international works OK and is at a standard comparable to any terminal I have been though anywhere around the world; domestic I found below acceptable standards but it may well have improved in recent years.,NA,NA,NA,9,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2015-05-25,First transit through T3 in years. Everything went reasonably smoothly on our outward trip. There were no delays in Security and staff were both cheerful and helpful. The whole terminal was busy but we managed to find seats till our gate was listed. As an infrequent user of T3 though I find the geography of the place confusing but to be fair there does appear to be more than adequate signage. The only slight hiccup before departure was having to thread our way through other queues to reach our gate. Minor irritations on our return: our Ryanair flight had to wait several minutes before it could access its designated stand and the e passport readers were being temperamental (my wife had no problems but I had to be re-directed to a manned desk). Overall however a better experience than expected though we still find Liverpool our preferred option simply because Manchester is so much bigger and busier and consequently everything takes much longer e.g. without any major holdups or any luggage to reclaim it still took us an hour from landing till exiting the car park.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

My connection flight to England with Brussels Airlines was delayed 2hrs which was actually good because the ways from the arrival gate to the departure gate B30 was a nightmare of a walk. After passing through yet another security land and yet another passport check (Schengen my butt) I had to walk another few kilometres to the gate in order to wait there for my flight. Being used to rather posh German airports the overall appearance of this airport was: a bland megalomaniac hellhole of gigantic boredom with everything outdated. Endless corridors to the gates and ending with dirty and tasteless seats in the waiting areas not to mention the toilets. It's like entering a 3rd-world country. If you are a smoker you'll appreciate the extremely sparse smoking areas. Very few bistros (I actually saw only one) that close very soon in the evening and a saddening mass of saddening vending machines top off the overall horrible experience with that airport.

This works relatively 'well'. Our flight arrives late to Heathrow though, and then the real fun begins. After a thorough security check by British officials in Edinburgh, we are subject to that all over again after an excruciatingly long bus ride between idiotically poorly connected terminals (arrival at T5 and departure for LAX at T3). Both times we're ""randomly picked"" for a 2nd level security check. So OK, through all that and then we need to re-check in again for the AA flight to LAX (after printing boarding passes online with all docs verified). Why? Then we are so lucky to actually learn of the departure gate a full 5 minutes before all the other clueless passengers who are anxiously watching the monitors. This is one of the silliest parts of the operation: holding the gate secret until 20 minutes before boarding. Anyway, rush to the very far away gate, and then into a new secure area- yes another check of passport and boarding pass that gains us access to the usual ugly 'stall' with no services and no bathrooms. There more poor people (thankfully not us) being checked by yet more random searching. Heathrow, the world's worst large-sized airport in my opinion, needs to have its security and other logistical systems completely overhauled by efficiency experts.

johannesburg-or-tambo-airport,/airport-reviews/johannesburg-or-tambo-airport,Johannesburg Airport customer review,R Mortara,United Kingdom,2011-12-29,A mixture of positives and negatives. The positives: quick processing of luggage on arrival and quick check-in on departure. Facilities clean and well maintained. As others have commented lots of eating options with competitive prices (for an airport). Staff friendly. Departure halls airy and well lit with some nice shops. There is also an observations deck in the public area. Negatives: On arrival on a domestic flight the corridor to the baggage claim area is gloomy with few windows. Also signage is v.poor. I almost missed the escalator down to baggage claim and finding the bus terminal for the hotel shuttles is not easy.

Different story outbound cannot understand why there are limited seats in the departure area. If you come early get ready to wait uncomfortably until the check-in opens. This happens to me all the time because the traffic in Manila is unpredictable and best is to come in early. Security check is better now as it is done once entering the air side.

However our recent trip was the first one through the new terminal. First impression was wow - this is huge and easy to navigate. Payment of the arrival visa of $35 US was quick and easy. Then we noticed the 'cattle grids' to get through immigration and the queue to get into the cattle grids this took us just under 2 hours. By the time we got to the luggage carousel many flights had landed after ours so our luggage was piled in a heap against the wall. Moving on another very lengthy queue of disillusioned passengers was waiting for us to scan everything on the way out. Fortunately our driver was patient enough to wait - 2.5 hours from plane to exit is beyond ridiculous. The way out was worse - Our flight departed at 12.20am. Our driver dropped us at the airport around 9.30pm we expected to check in find our gate and perhaps sit and read for an hour. Lengthy queues again - lost count of the security checks and how many times we had our luggage scrutinized paid the 200000 IRP exit visa negotiated our way through passport control to be affronted with what can only be described as a duty free shopping mall with the gates hidden behind more attempts to part you with what money you have left only to find our departure gate but no seating. After standing around for a while checked the departure screens to find that our flight had been moved to another gate at the opposite end of the (enormous) terminal. Arrived at the rescheduled gate to at least see a very welcome seating area queued up (again) to have our hand luggage checked (again) to find out that the departure gate was changed back to the original gate we were at with no seating! Apparently this gate is only a standing waiting area where you are crammed in like sardines to wait for your standing room only bus to take you out onto the tarmac to climb the steps to your plane. Ours was not the only flight leaving from this gate - 5 others were at the same time well when I say gate it was more like a bus terminal - without seating! So if you find that your flight is departing through gate 10 - prepare for a long wait on your feet! Needless to say we spent the 3 hours departing this terminal waiting in queues and walking from gate to gate when we were anticipating a lengthy relaxing read! Needless to say - we had a wonderful trip to only be tarnished by this airport - Initial thoughts from the front it looks absolutely amazing sky high vaulted ceilings beautifully decorated and planted but it just does not work..

Completely agree with previous comments on the lengthy queues as the airport failed to deal competently with the Monday departure of about eight flights to the UK. Passengers on our flight (Jet2 to Manchester) suffered the added frustration of being advised by the display that the aircraft was boarding at its expected time. Passengers passed through passport control only to arrive at the jammed departure gates area for British flights and eventually be told that the aircraft was not even at Funchal having diverted to Porto Santo.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,Ali Jacques,Australia,2014-04-21,"Generally speaking my views are identical to Mr Powell's review below. There were no ""aero bridges"" available for both my arrival flight or my Departure flight. The arrivals hall wad enormous spacious. I had arranged the VIP service through Garuda Orient Holidays so it took around 5 minutes to have my visa in my Passport. When my flight arrived from Brisbane there were already 2-3 International flights that had arrived before mine so was a rather long queue ahead but all Immigration counters were open and fully manned so the queue moved at a steady pace. All luggage came out at the one carousel what a mess. I waited around 10 minutes for my suitcase I was then whisked away to yet another long queue to have all luggage X-rayed. This process over you exit the arrivals hall into the mass of people from Hotels/Tour companies and the like waiting for arriving passengers. The traffic is non stop out of the Airport. Now the Departure information: You are dropped off at a ramp where you can get a trolley for your bags it's a short walk up to the first Security check where your bags are X-rayed takes a couple of minutes. Then if you decide to have your luggage plastic wrapped there are around 4-5 stations where this can be done. The ""check in areas"" are spacious plenty of signage areas A-E and the entire area is spotlessly clean. There are no restaurants/Cafes in the Check in areas a huge mistake as there were many passengers in need of a cup of coffee. After check in there was ample seating in the Departure/Check in areas whilst waiting. After check in you walk the short distance where you pay the IDR 200000 Departure tax (A$20.00). The waiting tine at this point was only a couple of minutes. Then more Security screening separate lines for both men and women moved quickly. Then we have the shopping Duty Free and a lot of high end makes Designer and beautifully displayed very impressive. They are set out whereby all passengers must pass by every single shop. There are a few restaurants as you pass by the endless shopping a little expensive but convenient. The Gate areas are well laid out but the carpet is somewhat worn. The Boarding gates they cannot get it ""right"" too many passengers running all over the place with the constant changes. The worst gate being Gate 10 where the majority of Aussie bound flights depart from and as in my case my Garuda Indonesia flight to Brisbane was scheduled to also depart from this gate along with 4 other flights on Virgin Australia Jetstar bound for Perth Adelaide and Melbourne. It was total chaos. Headed down the escalator to yet another holding area where all passengers on the four flights were jammed in like sardines with airport staff screaming out the flights to a lot of confused people never seen anything like it in my 40 years of traveling. The airport may be lovely when first observed but the organization of the Departure/Gate areas require urgent attention. My holiday in Bali was just wonderful but with the airport debacle at the end put a sour taste to my Bali experience.

Airport itself is chaotic very long queues for passport checking on arrival (and when I reached the front the officer did not even glance at mine). On departure Terminal 3 security took 30 minutes to clear. There was then a very long walk and short train ride to the departure gate. One good point was that we went straight from having boarding cards checked to sitting on the aircraft so the crush that often develops in the aisles did not.

A great option if you're visiting Southern Ontario (or Niagara Falls) if you want to avoid the Toronto traffic and is 80 km from downtown Toronto. Not the greatest airport for public transit links to Hamilton and Toronto and beyond likely due to the airports small size.

For the return flight the check in queue did not move for ages. The airside/shopping area was cramped and far too hot. There was far too many people in this area considering the size of the airport.

Had pre-booked a return ticket on the Terravision bus to Termini and was in the middle of Rome by 00.50. The driver didn't drop us off at Termini but on the Via Giovani Giolitti which runs down the side of the Railway Station. On reflection this was a good move as Termini is not the sort of place you would want to hang around after dark. A five minute wait at the taxi rank on the Via Giovani Giolitti and 13 euros later I was in my hotel room. Absolutely no problems. On the return journey took the metro to Anangina and then the Cotral Bus to Ciampino. Don't buy a ticket from the Cotral Ticket machine in the bus station. It's not valid for the journey to Ciampino. Buy one on the bus. The bus leaves from platform one and costs 1 euro. Checked in airside at Ciampino without any problems but passengers accustomed to American or British customer service standards might get a bit irritated with the rather off hand manner off the staff although by Roman standards it's pretty good.

They also confiscated a 1 ltr bottle of Baileys Irish Cream which we had bought at Domodedovo in Moscow. It was purchased from duty free and sealed in a plastic bag with receipt.

For those wanting food and drink there are plenty of places in the terminals to get these outlets in the international terminals as expected are overpriced.

krakow-airport,/airport-reviews/krakow-airport,Krakow Airport customer review,Mike Thompson,NA,2006-09-21,Forget earlier comments about leaving it until the last minute before you go through into boarding and the departure lounge. We have just come back from a brilliant trip to Krakow but it did take us 2 hours to get through airport security. Our plane eventually took off one hour late. First there was a mad 'crush' to get to the boarding area followed by long queues to the baggage x-ray machines. This took about an hour and twenty minutes. We then had to queue through passport control. Because all flights were being delayed because of security priority started to be given to certain flights meaning we were being queue jumped making us even later. We didn't clear passport control until 5 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave which caused us a lot of concern especially as there were no announcements telling us the flights were being delayed. Once through passport control we then had to queue to go through another security check during which they checked our hand luggage all over again. I've no problem with all the security but the time to get to the departure lounge took us by suprise. Yes there is nothing in the departure lounges make sure you take something with you to eat/drink and keep occupied with but go through boarding just as soon as you possibly can after checking in.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Andy Williams,United Kingdom,2014-11-12,Terminal 1. I have just returned to the UK from Manila via Terminal 1 NAIA. I visit the Philippines 2-3 times a year and have done for several years. The last time I used this terminal was May 2014 and I honestly didn't think it could get any worse. How wrong I was! It's almost like the authorities set about doing everything they can to make it bad. On a plus side arriving at this place is not too bad. I always try to time my arrival for a Sunday afternoon which normally means immigration queues for foreigners are not to bad. Baggage reclaim slow as normal. The noise and chaos of the meeting area can be off putting for foreigners who have never been there before and I would suggest if you haven't got transport organised or are being met then walk out to the main road and get a normal passing taxi. Departing is a nightmare. The renovations continue which now means there is virtually no drop off area which causes traffic chaos. There is no clear signs to direct people. Once you have got past the initial security check just to enter the terminal the check in queues stretch from one side of the terminal to another and despite arriving over 4 hours before my flight it still took me 2 hours to check in. Terminal fee still exists so another queue followed then by another queue for immigration and then yet another security check with another queue. All in it took me 3 hours just to get from my taxi to duty free and this was at midnight when the place was quiet! Seating is still an issue as is places to get food or drinks. You can pay 650php to use the lounge upstairs which has a a smoking room constructed from plywood here is sadly probably the best seating in the house where you can enjoy a lukewarm beer and a smoke while listening to the airport announcements telling you that you are in a non-smoking airport! The departure gates are still not big enough and involve yet more queues. I unfortunately cannot avoid this place but if you can then do avoid.

When we got there he had no record of our ski equipment been booked for carriage though I showed him the document which plainly showed it had so he had to call his supervisor. The check in itself was makeshift with half a dozen tee shirt clad youths throwing bags onto trolleys once finally checked in. Then another queue for security. Few trays to put things in when you got to the departure area (4 gates) it was completely full. I suspect there were at least a thousand people in a room designed for 200. When we arrived we had to circle for 30 minutes as there was no where to put us. There are tent like structures all around the terminal building serving as arrival security baggage halls etc. the main issue seems to be greed in that they are taking far more flights than the airport can handle.

Signage could be improved in some areas as (for example) you get half-way to the coin-operated left-luggage lockers and the signs stop (they're on the bottom level of Terminal 2 at the bus station end of the building). Amongst my six uses I had a late night departure and an early arrival and just about everything other than the food outlets was closed. However immigration was quick (first time) but very slow (second and third times in) - baggage on the carousel each time but considering how long it takes to get from the planes all the way into this area that's not really surprising.

After waving farewell to your luggage you go upstairs through security which on the face of it is quite good Boarding card check point - yes hand baggage and body scan - yes Passport Control - hmm there was a roller shutter door open between the scan area where you could see through to the departure lounge which was cordoned off with the sort of barrier posts and tape used for queuing in your bank. Duty free is average until to come to pay for your items. After standing in a queue of about 15 people for what seems like half an hour you present your purchases to them which they present to the barcode scanner from many different angles to get it to scan they then ask for your boarding card which has a lovely neatly printed barcode on it ripe for scanning - do they scan it? Of course not they continue on with their one finger typing hoping they manage to input the correct details. Whatever you do please do not try to pay with a combination of your left over currency and your plastic - this throws them into utter confusion. The departure gates were obviously designed when air travel was a rarity and planes only held 75-100 people. They are small cramped and with very little seating - you will end up sitting on the floor in the main departure lounge like some homeless refugee in a displacement camp. When your flight is called if you're lucky you will be able to walk to the plane however in our case we were loaded on to a bus driven by the star of the local rally scene who drove at full speed pulling tight turns to get us to the plane - make sure you hold onto to your luggage and small children tightly.

When the airport management announced 10 years ago that a new terminal and a new concourse would finally be built I was really ""thrilled"" because it meant that Vienna Airport would catch up with other hubs worldwide. I hoped that all the knowledge about airport design would be taken into consideration leading to a state of the art aviation facility. The result is a mess! The architectural design (black and white) makes it a very dull place. You need to go one level down to reach the restrooms hard for people with slightly reduced mobility. The flooring of the concourse couldn't be less beautiful (linoleum) signage is horrible - what do people with impaired vision do? Food has become very expensive. On the positive side security was fast building is very clean. The new train station is very nice it is now very easy to reach the terminal. Unfortunately they do not display local trains (route S7) going to Vienna which are very cheap.

Lo and behold the button for the second floor landed us on the third floor which was supposed to be inaccessible from that particular elevator. Pushing all the buttons and going up and down a few times we did catch the second floor. Would have left elevator but had so much luggage in there and there was so much hustle for spots on elevators.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,J Miles,United States,2014-09-17,Airports come in all shapes and sizes and you kind of take them for what they are a temporary waiting room. Some are better then others and the really nice ones like Paris-Orly bring a certain romanticism back to flying. Unfortunately Luton is about as romantic as flying bricks to the head. It's as if someone turned a functioning airport and flipped it upside down then turned it in side out. Terminal concourses that are 4 stories high with no sky bridges for planes like the 737 and A-319. This means walking down 4 flights of stairs to get to the tarmac then climb back up stairs to get onto the airplane. I wasn't even mad I was dumbfounded. I really couldn't believe what I was seeing which made me chuckle a bit. Just to hammer the point home said concourses were extremely narrow and lacked any visible seating so it was standing room only until the plane was ready to board. I've only flown out the once so I don't know if this is just one terminal and concourse leg or an example of the entire airport. Judging by the spartan check in hall and uninterested security screeners talking about their weekend across two lanes I'm going to guess it's par for the course.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

toronto-city-centre-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-city-centre-airport,Toronto City Centre Airport customer review,Jeff Cowen,United States,2013-12-02,"This airport receives a lot of hype from Torontonians. I flew Porter from Newark NJ to Billy Bishop in the beginning of November. Porter itself is fantastic. The tickets were cheap the free lounge access (with free snacks coffee and sodas) was generous and the entire process as a whole was exceptional for a ""budget"" airline. Upon arrival we promptly received our luggage safe and sound upon entering the baggage claim. From there we followed the somewhat confusing (not that bad now that I think about it but at the time it seemed odd) signs to the ferry. I don't know if I liked it or not. Thankfully they are implementing a new system of accessing the city but that is not yet finished. You have to wait in a line to get onto the ferry which you are only on for about 2 minutes. Then it's the same process again getting off. It just seems a little excessive and unnecessary. Not sure why this was the solution in the first place. Then came immigrations. I can't remember if this was before the ferry or after. But for the sake of this review I'll say it was after the ferry ride. My father was carrying a styrofoam box (clearly for airport food-which we bought at Newark). Upon meeting a border agent she rudely asked my dad what he was holding. He told her it was leftover food from the flight and she yelled at us for not filling out the part on the card that says you are bringing in food to Canada. She was one of the rudest people I have encountered. For people who are renowned globally to be very friendly she was a terrible first impression of the Canadian people. On the way back security is oddly organized and slow considering how few people actually were in the airport. It took us half an hour while every other airport I've been to that's comparable in size can accomplish this in half the time. Other than that the return experience was fine.",NA,NA,NA,7,3,5,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1
toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,J Winter,Canada,2012-11-14,I had to make a connecting flight here from Tampa to Regina and I have mixed feelings about this airport. I had a 2.5 hour layover all of which was either spent going through customs and security or running. Customs would have been a very irritating experience had it not have been for the pleasant workers. However even though I was given good directions I was lost in minutes. Hardly any signs anywhere! It's an airport not a shopping mall. There should be more focus on the flights than the shopping. However the TSA officer scanning my carry on when I went through security had a problem with my bag but he was very polite and friendly about it. By the time I made it through security I had less than 20 minutes to get to my gate. I had to run from gate D all the way to B7 with 5 minutes to spare only to get there to discover they'd changed my gate to B27. I understand that it's unforeseeable but I would like them to delay boarding a little if they're going to switch gates at the last minute. Overall I did have a good experience and I plan to go through this airport again on my way home for Christmas but just make sure you have a substantial layover time in order to get through crowds and to find your way to your gate and then to get there when they change it on you.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

If US Airways and the airport authorities want to make the place more appealing then they need to get customs and TSA sorted. Customs - 3rd time to the US and the longest wait by far. We all complete ESTA but then stand in a long queue with people who seem to have a library of documents that need to be checked. When we eventually get to a desk we breeze through. TSA - are they providing a service or do they think they run the show. They are amongst the rudest people I have encountered and need to be told so and told to sharpen up their act and their ""customer"" skills. It would also help if they didn't randomly bark out orders and could speak in a language that at least approximates to English. I couldn't wait to leave the place - felt and treated like a criminal from the moment we landed. What a welcome to the US. As for the airport - no real complaints - enjoyed the food court and some decent shops to occupy the layover time. Although the kids tell me the toilets there (M&F) are a disgrace - I took their word for it and went elsewhere (have to say the toilets I used were very clean). I've read other posts complaining about the size of the airport - well it is a US hub and it is big  but no different to London Schiphol etc. My only gripe is the poor signage (what are you supposed to do with your bags for the onward flight where do you go). This needs improvement. Was a bit taken aback to find the baggage dumped on the floor (after a long wait for customs) so had to wander about looking for cases - and there was a lot to get around.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,D Edwards,United Kingdom,2015-07-20,"Terminal 2 - This Terminal appears to have been deliberately designed to make things as difficult as possible for passengers to negotiate. If you are not young and fit I would suggest you avoid it. I have some mobility issues and I found this Terminal difficult in the extreme. Plenty of room in Car Park then lifts take you to area out in front of Terminal Building. When you enter you are met by automatic check-in machines with desks behind but no staff to help you find out what you need to do. I decided to avoid the machines and eventually find the EVA Air Business Class check-in desk. Staff here were excellent. I make my way to Security. Despite being very quiet, passengers are still made to snake through the movable barriers forcing them to walk about 20 times further than necessary. Fairly quick getting through the checks and then passports. Now the problems really begin. The signs inside the Terminal building are unclear and totally inadequate. I eventually work out I now need to go down a level. The lifts throughout the terminal are generally tucked away, difficult to find, and at least half appear to be marked 'Staff Only'. At the next level I again can't find any clear signs to show how to get to the Business Lounge, which I was told was near the gate. The design of this level is awful. There are no clear, easy routes to get across. Passengers are forced to walk much further than necessary. It appears to be in order to make them go as close to as many shops as possible. I eventually find the exit I need in the far corner. I now have to go down yet another level. I am now faced with a lifeless corridor. It is a very, very long walk from here to the gates and the Lounge. There are some moving walkways. By the time I get close to the gates I am in pain. I now discover I have to go back up a level to get to the Lounge. Unbelievable! I then have to go back down and walk a little further to get to the gate when it's time to board. Boarding was shambolic. No information given. One mad scrum and slow moving queues. Arriving back in the Terminal was no better. On leaving the plane I have to immediately use a small, slow lift to go up a level. There is then quite a walk. I then have to find a lift to go up another level. The lifts are an even further walk, with confusing signs and most of the lifts marked 'Staff Only' or 'Buggies Only'. The sign in the lift says I need Level 3 for Arrivals but there are only buttons for 0 and 2! There is then a very, very, very long walk and the need to use yet another lift. I eventually get to Passport Control. I have a Priority Lane pass but there are very few staff in it so there is quite a wait. Through Customs then outside to find the way to taxis. I find I have to walk to the other end of the concourse and go down a level in the lift. I then have another quite long walk to the taxi queue. There are plenty of taxis for the number of people waiting but only one member of Airport staff doing the taxi bookings. A long wait. I have travelled a great deal over many years and Heathrow T2 is, without doubt, the worst one I have gone through in terms of access, passenger convenience and ease of use.

We flew from London with Virgin Atlantic and to Brisbane with V Australia. It took 2.5hrs to clear customs and immigration and we were only in transit. No signage of how to find V Australia. We did find the correct terminal which advised ticketing was upstairs. (Even though they were both Virgin flights you may as well be on different airlines as no through ticketing). Upstairs was another problem - how to get there - no one in the building escalator blocked off. In the end asked a cleaner who pointed out a lift outside the building tucked in a corner. Once up there chaos reigned and it was another 45 mins before we reached the Alaskan lounge (V Australia). Was too tired to notice cleanliness but surely something can be done about the ridiculous performance of clearing customs and immigration when in transit. We arrived in at 7.25pm and our flight due out at 11.55pm. We did not have much time to spare even with 4.5hrs.

Arriving at the airport more than 1 hour and 20 minutes prior to the scheduled flight-time of the plane to London should be sufficient enough. First the automatic check-in facilities did not recognize my reservation number even though there had been no changes in the reservation since the purchase 10 days prior. I and a handfull of other passengers were sent to a line for passengers with problems using the check-in machines. This line was handled by one person only and 25 minutes prior to departure after being in line for 40 minutes we finally convinced an employee to check us in separately and bypass the line. We were met by another big line at the security control but just managed to get on the airplane by running through the entire terminal. The staff appeared to be in a bad mood no wonder and one member even critizised us for arriving at the airport too late.

I have been using this airport for many years and found it very comfortable to arrive on the ground floor buy a newspaper chocolate and a bottle of water I also could stop to have coffee at the bar. Since I need to take a bus to Oxford I was also able to check with the Bus Enquiries counter about any delays. On this occasion it was not helpful to be directed down a winding roadway arrive at the bus stop and be told by someone waiting there that the bus was due to be 30 mins late which someone had told them more than 30 mins before. In the past a small screen above the stop always indicated the expected time of arrival - that no longer exists. Also no shops bar or any facilities other than car-hire offices are on the ground floor. By this time I had a very small amount of water in my bottle that I'd taken on the flight (it was a very hot day) no newspaper to occupy me on the bus nowhere to buy anything at all. I had already waited some 15-20 minutes for steps to arrive at the aeroplane followed by some 20 minutes for baggage arrival. The last time I made this journey was after new year 2013. This new layout was a surprise and a big nuisance since with the time of bus arrival was unknown I could not risk taking a lift back upstairs to the shopping area in Departures.

When I've arrived by coach in Bilbao to catch a flight however it's a bit of a drag as there's no direct airport bus from the coach station so you have to catch the underground to the square in Bilbao from which the airport bus departs. The airport bus is cheap though at 1.10 euros. Inside the terminal I find it's all concrete and a bit spartan and claustrophobic the darkened glass doesn't help. The cafe area is pretty small but looks out over the runway so you can watch the planes while sipping a coffee. Having the exit from the baggage reclaim area lead straight out to the outside concourse rather than into the terminal building is a bit unusual as it means that people waiting to meet arriving passengers must wait outside in the cold.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

You can be very lucky and get straight through in no time at all if your plane is the only international arrival. I have taken the evening AA flight from LHR many times and found immigration bags and customs superb. However at other times it is a nightmare. Certain times of day you have 4-5 widebodies full of Germans and Koreans and I have waited in a hot immigration line for 2 hours+. Not quite as bad as Miami or Delta at JFK but worth avoiding. Unfortunately you do not know until you get there. They open a second hall when busy and that helps but it is still horrible at wrong time and wonderful at right time. Walk from plane is not too long. The shuttle between terminals is efficient and quick (wish LHR had one) and the Hilton Hotel in the airport is very convenient for overnight connections (otherwise you need 3.5 hours minimum to guarantee international connection (which is a pain when you get through in 20 minutes).,NA,NA,NA,4,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Congested too few lanes waits that require you to stand on steps. I flew through CLE two years ago and I thought then I hit the occasional bad day. Flew through yesterday was worse though not really that busy. What was really disappointing is that nothing has been done in two years to improve the situation. It's way past the time knowing these security stations are going to be a permanent requirement so Airport mgt needs to step up and get some over due renovations done. In addition the restrooms in concourse A are undersized narrow halls to get into then way too small with too few facilities. The rest rooms and security the Airport can do something about. The last comment has to do with the location of the car rental facility. Common sense would have had the facility as close to the airport as possible for customer convenience along the main road but no site selection put the at the end of a dead end street the bus passing empty acreage which would have been much more convenient.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,5,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

The shambolic organisation just to drop your bags off coupled with the horrific security queues are bad enough but the audacity of charging in order to drop someone off is disgraceful. Not only does it cost £2 for 10 minutes or £3 for 15 minutes but if you stay in the ""express set-down"" area (and believe me there is nothing ""express"" about it when the queue to get into the area stretches all the way back down the road that runs parallel to the airport) for longer than 15 minutes you can expect a £50 fine. This is a cynical money-making plot by the airport's owners to extract every last penny from anyone doing a friend or relative a favour by dropping them off. Plus although the area was busy the parking spaces further away from the terminal were completely empty so the fine has no real standing when you consider that anyone who does actually overstay the allotted maximum time of 15 minutes isn't in any way depriving someone else waiting to park from being able to do so. It's the same at Southend airport you have to drive into a car park in order to be able to drop someone off as there is no set-down area to the tune of £5!

Domestic and international are very open and easy to find your way around. However alo of the positive points are lost on two very odd aspects at the international terminal: firstly CHC Airport still requires the payment of departure tax at the bank outlet - airlines are not permitted to include it in their fares. Secondly the entry to customs and the departure lounge remains closed even though the airline check-ins are open and processing passengers. The result is a long queue of angry passengers waiting to clear customs when they eventually decide to open it. This is very unusual and highly annoying (as noted by previous reviewers).

No skycaps except in the baggage claim area. And no apparent curbside check-in facility. This was a big factor since you have to first take your bags to a Department of Agriculture inspection area to be scanned then take them to your airline's check-in counter then take them to the x-ray security station.

I was last here about 10-15 years ago and remembered it as having been cavernous and neglected. Now it seems even more cavernous but relatively up to date. The distances can be vast and the signage often is confusing - gate numbers appear and disappear and it's easy to think you have got lost despite being on the correct route. There are a few spots with moving walkways but people with mobility concerns will need to use the complimentary golf carts that ferry people around the terminals - these are annoying to walkers and fewer in number than at some other airports like Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson or Cleveland Hopkins where they also are a necessity. There are a great many food options but all are pretty generic and unhealthy. The book stores seem to be good places to buy right wing political tracts but sell snack food at prices a bit lower than is typical at major airports. I was glad that I had a complimentary pass for the United lounge - I wound up with a healthier breakfast than I could have found on my own and access to a shower.

While it is better than that now there is no room for airport expansion (seems short-sighted) and access by car remains a nightmare. True that the City of Montreal (strangely) pushed for this and financed most of the improvements but I cannot imagine that the residents near Dorval like the noise and congestion.

brasilia-airport,/airport-reviews/brasilia-airport,Brasilia Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2011-10-23,As noted the check-in area is open air and spacious. The shopping area beyond that was expansive. All in all nice. The gate area used by most domestic flights however would be more suited for a small provincial airport with few flights. There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports.

The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers.

I travel out of and back into Pearson T1 around 25 times a year and I cannot recall a time in recent memory where clearing US customs took less then 45 mins. The security screening process isn't too bad however its not as much a credit to Pearson as simply a by-product of the inefficient customs process before security. Once you have cleared that nightmare its generally not too bad an experience assuming you are traveling US Airways Air Canada or United however if you are one of the poor souls traveling Continental out of the 200 number gates then get those running shoes ready. From the end of the escalator at security to the 200 series gates is upwards of a 10-15 mins walk. Coming back into the airport from an international flight is terrible - the walk from your gate to the customs office could be upwards of 20 mins and once you get there there is no separate line for Canadian Citizens if a Jumbo Jet landed 5 mins before you - expect an hour wait. Even with the wait in CDN customs its still highly unlikely that your bags will have reached the carousal by the time you are done. T3 is a little better however the amenities are lacking. The one positive I can take away from Pearson is that the Air Canada Lounge in T1 is great aside from that generally unimpressive.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Facilities in the satelite terminal are great and there is a lot of shopping to be done. MAS Golden Lounge is good as well. Shopping is a bit cheaper than downtown KL since it's tax free. Sometimes there is some congestion at the gate area as security checks are done at each gate. Staff is usually friendly but you sometimes come across one or two souls who are having a bad day. Immigration officers are probably worldwide a special bunch of people and you never know what to expect. Usually in KL they are ok but give you the silent treatment. Customs is ok and once outside the KLIA Ekspress is the fastest way to KL. Train rides are comfortable quiet cheap and efficient. Once you arrive KL Sentral you can catch the subway to KLCC or other places. You can also check in at KL Sentral when you go back but currently they only offer it for MH CX and RB. Heard they are expanding it though. If you fly domestically things are not as brilliant as in the satelite terminal but still good.

DIA has a huge variety of gift shops book stores restaurants and coffee houses though the restaurants do tend to be kind of generic. If you are planning on connecting from an international flight to a domestic flight I would recommend keeping at least a two-hour gap as customs in Denver can be a little slow but you should be able to get out in about an hour. Domestic arrival into Denver is easy as baggage generally comes quickly RTD skyride buses get you into the city for about $10. Thankfully due to the recent surge by Southwest DIA isn't dominated by United Airlines but flying out of Denver is still a little more expensive than other US airports.

washington-reagan-national-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-reagan-national-airport,Washington National Airport customer review,M Hartt,NA,2003-10-19,National is a beautiful airport with a great area for departures on the top level with views out towards Washington. You go down one level to the terminals but there are also a number of great stores before you go through security including things like Brooks Brothers. In each of the terminals there are some decent food options though pricey. However the airport is very clean and kept in good shape which is unusual and appreciated. Complaints: First to go between the different terminals requires going in and out of security a pain if you have a tight connection. Second National is very pricey for certain flights considering it's a little domestic airport. The airport has a heavy US Airways presence but because it brings in a lot of business and political traffic that can evidently afford it both US and other airlines jack up prices on non- competitive routes - the ones I've dealt with included DCA-BNA (Nashville) and DCA-SDF (Louisville). And it's not like the shuttles to Boston and NYC are dirt cheap either. Comparing costs between DCA and BWI says it all often 350$ out of National when only 190-225$ out of BWI (but you have to deal with going out of BWI). But it is incredibly convenient right on the Metro (one of the best subway systems in the country) and an easy cab ride to downtown and easy to get to from all of the Virginia and many Maryland suburbs.

barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,Gerry McGrath,Ireland,2012-09-07,Terminal 2 is an absolute dump - a depressing way to leave Spain. Very little seating so no consideration shown for elderly disabled pregnant women families with small children or worn-out travellers of any age or condition. We were a family travelling with elderly grandparents and while the special assistance staff were prompt and helpful everything else about the experience was tiresome and miserable. They have acres of space and just a handful of seats/benches. The coffee bar we used was a rip-off and overpriced coffee served in cardboard. Tables and chairs packed so tight there was no room to manoeuvre baggage. Outside temperatures were around 34C that day but AirCon was barely functioning. I can't speak about Terminal 1 as I haven't passed through it for at least 5 or 6 years but I doubt that the service standards are much higher. It pains me to say that while I love Spain and its clever charming people generally speaking they don't do customer service well compared to other nations. Travelling as we do every year through Barcelona 2 however we have met some of the rudest snarling staff.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,G Pan,Greece,2013-02-25,Without a doubt the worst hub in Europe. I have to use CDG 2-3 times per month. Big problems if you are not travelling on the Sky Team. Terminal 1 is a mess. Transfer time (including baggage claim) from terminal 1 (Star Alliance etc) and terminal 2 (Sky Team) can take up to 50 minutes with plenty of walking trains etc. Allow yourself at least 1 hr 45 mins if you need to catch a flight from different terminals. Due to heavy loads from AF flights most of the domestic flights require a long bus ride to the airplane. Catering is poor in terminal 1 and average at terminal 2. A bit of a mess to find the train station to Paris Centre. There is a TGV station in the airport. The only good thing is that they are pretty efficient on security with many gates and personnel. I wish I could avoid CDG but unfortunately this will not happen for the next 2 years at least.,NA,NA,NA,2,4,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,S Draginich,United Kingdom,2011-09-11,This review pertains only to Terminal 3. Overall unimpressed especially considering it is only 3 years old. Enormous (takes at least 30 mins to walk end-to-end) overcrowded stuffy and a severe lack of toilets. I had to queue to use the men's toilets which is almost unheard of anywhere. Showers were entirely useless as they didn't provide towels soap or shampoo. It seems when they designed this place it was meant to be a shopping mall first and an airport second.

Last two occasions they lost my luggage in transit. Last three occasions faced lengthy queues to go through transit checkpoints which are understaffed and have too few security lanes.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,M Chalmers,United States,2014-03-30,Last week we arrived from Barbados with 2 hours before our connecting flight no problem you may think not so. After claiming our bags we waited 2 hours to clear customs by which time we and hundreds like us had missed our connection and since there were no more flights available that day we had to scramble to find a hotel for the night. The airlines staff were swamped with rebooking which costs us all more in the long run. There was no orderly lines so people were line jumping constantly and heaven help us should we have needed to evacuate the terminal it would have been a stampede and disaster. People had their bags and were jostling and shoving to try and advance. It felt like we had landed in a Banana Republic.

If possible avoid Chicago airport. immigration lines for non American are simply endless and when you finally exit you will find no indication about baggage claim belt. On the contrary it is likely to find airport staff gathering suitcases in some corner or even worse taking suitcases to ""somewhere"".

I was there 4 times between 17 Dec 2012 and 7 Jan 2013 for international trips (SYD-JKT- SYD) and domestic trips (JKT-MES-JKT). Firstly the international arrival area looked quite old. Secondly the luggage handling was horrible. They mixed all luggage from 2-3 airlines in the same carousel. The problem was it took them so long to get all luggage out onto the carousel belt. There was a sea of human waiting in the baggage collection area with extremely long and messy queue. On the departure as usual we had to pay airport tax.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,2013-11-21,Connected from Bangkok to Cairo and back. First experience in Doha. The colour system they have for various passengers is great (yellow tags and cards for transfers Orange for quick transfers etc.). The terminal itself is just a glass box (I expected a larger venue) but functioned well. Clean with a couple of shops here and there but I believe the new airport is to open soon and would reflect Qatar's ambition to offer a world class airport. This one works but lets say it lacks any lustre for me its a non issue as long as all worked fine. The internet is free and appreciated even though works only on one side of the terminal and closer to gate 20 21 22 the signal is barely there and connection almost impossible. Staff are polite especially in the x-ray checks (which is a big issue for me especially in other Middle eastern airports). The only negative point is the people jammed downstairs when boarding the bus. For 2 flights the passengers were lead down but the bus wasn't there yet and it was very uncomfortable having a small room packed with people kids and screaming toddlers. But all in all it went rather well. Toilets need a bit of a face lift!,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Will agree service in cafe upstairs is very slow - but they have recently got rid of the benches & put loads of tables & chairs. Seems to me that there was plenty of room to sit down - although you might have to go back downstairs. They have also added a WH Smiths airside - which is about time.

Full of daylight even in rainy season and the windows give a great vista of the mountains. The restaurant serves nice food although I wish the airport authorities would install free WiFi. The check-in counter is getting stuffy and quite small but the queue is still tolerable. Comfort rooms are still in good shape yet needs proper maintenance to keep it looking brand new. The arrival area during high traffic days gets a bit congested. Parking security is not a problem although the toll is quite steep for countryside standards.

The security controls are not done very seriously they do not ask you to remove your laptops and hardly look at the screen anyway. Gulf Air employees at check-in have always been very nice and smiling. The duty-free is quite big but the price level is not interesting at all except for cigarettes.
