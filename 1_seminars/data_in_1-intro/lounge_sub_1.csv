aer-lingus,/lounge-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus Gold Circle Business Class Lounge - Dublin Airport,Patrick Jordan,Ireland,2011-09-13,The new lounge spans two floors with views of the apron A water feaTUre dominates one wall.

aer-lingus,/lounge-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus Gold Circle Business Class Lounge - London Heathrow Airport,Patrick Jordan,NA,2009-03-18,The range of food and beverages is reasonable. The main attraction of this lounge is that it is beside boarding gates. This evening I noticed the red wine bottle was empty. I asked the attendant to replace it but she wasn't able to open the new bottle. I can understand a bottle of wine being used but to have a staff member unable to open another is beyond belief.

air-canada,/lounge-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada Maple Leaf Business Class Lounge - London Heathrow Airport,Stephen Lloyd,United Kingdom,2015-05-29,Having flow out of T2 twice on Eva Air recently this review covers both visits. Eva use the Air Canada lounge along with a couple of other Star Alliance carriers. It is close (2-3 minutes) to the boarding gates but suffers like some others on T2 in that it's a fair hike from immigration to the gates/lounge. One inside it is very modern and comfortable with a nice bar and service good range of food and good personal space. Travelling on a Wednesday evening there were not many people in the lounge and it felt quite and comfortable. A vast improvement on the old T3 lounge shared with SAS.,AIR CANADA MAPLE LEAF BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,London Heathrow Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,4,5,4,4,4,5,5,1
air-canada,/lounge-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada Maple Leaf Business Class Lounge - Calgary Airport,D Carter,Canada,2015-01-02,"I am always pretty pleased with the Air Canada Lounges (Vancouver is very good and so is Edmonton). Calgary has always been a large and crowded one. They have just done some renovations and while it looks much better (and the staff are invariably courteous and helpful) there is one down-side. There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down. I only had a 35 minute change of planes and could not get anything for the first 15minutes - waited at the bar got my wine drank half and had to leave. Again - it looks great but it is tougher if you are in a hurry. Staff still very courteous.",AIR CANADA MAPLE LEAF BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Calgary Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,4,4,2,3,4,4,5,1

We went out of our way to fly Air Canada back home from Europe. Had a 6-hour layover in Montreal which was nice. Easy access to the lounge staff speaks English and French (and possibly some other languages) quite fluently. Food in the lounge was not up to par (about 900 ml of cold pasta salad and some other similarly sized items were available for everybody). I went downstairs to the Burger King. Other than that however the internet is fast and functional there is a television and a wide selection of alcoholic beverages in an open-bar format.

The place was packed at 4:30 and stayed that way when we left at 6:00. Two planes including ours had slight delays. The food selection was nice especially the Thai soup. Because it was so busy the cleaning staff had a lot of work and empty dishes sat for 20-30 minutes. There didn't seem to be a place for us to drop off our used plates.

air-canada,/lounge-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada Business Class Maple Leaf Lounge - Vancouver Airport,K Chen,Canada,2012-05-21,A very disappointing lounge which I have used several times for the past four years. Nothing much has changed in the period. Granted is a domestic terminal lounge but given the number of people who use it it is far too small. There are many international passengers who connect at YVR but there is not even a shower for people to freshen up after a 10+hr flight! There is no separate area for people who want to take a rest and because of the large number of people present it is very crowded and noisy-- not much different from the terminal building itself. Food is pretty average and always the same salad and soup options (but nothing vegetarian!).,AIR CANADA BUSINESS CLASS MAPLE LEAF LOUNGE REVIEW,Vancouver Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,0

I wish they had dedicated wifi for the lounge rather than using the general airport wifi which is fine but slow. Boarding announcements in a non intrusive way.

air-france,/lounge-reviews/air-france,Air France Business Class Lounge - Paris CDG Airport,Olivier Ragu,Japan,2013-07-20,I took the opportunity to test the new AF lounge at the newest boarding satellite called S4. A completely new experience from the other lounges I have visited at CDG. Very large seperated in several areas with a real bar with the usual selection and great wines and a first for any AF lounge a self service Hot food corner including some risotto pasta cold meat and some pastries for dessert. A huge step from the S3 lounge. No problem at all to find a table or a sofa to rest. Plenty of working space and reading material too. Modern design with a nice view on the tarmac.

Curry or Curry with rice for a meal. Samosas in an oven that had been there for at least a week. 2 beers in the fridge dirty plates stacked everywhere toilets that need a pressure cleaner desperately. Truly third world and nowhere near international standards. Flickering or dead light fixtures tired interior no staff no food if you are sick of curry just no point.

It is divided in several zones depending on what you are looking for. Usually AF lounges are not very good for the catering but this one offers a wide choice of food and drinks. I took advantage of the Clarins Spa that is free.

air-france,/lounge-reviews/air-france,Air France Business Class Lounge - Paris CDG Airport,D Rose,United States,2012-05-21,I don't understand the Air France business class product at all particularly compared to similarly priced business class products like British Airways or Virgin Atlantic (which actually are less expensive). At a BA or Virgin lounge you get a fully stocked and staffed bar. At Air France the self- service selections at Air France are limited. At a BAR or Virgin Lounge I can order a full sit down meal. At Air France I got to chose from slices of cold pork some cheese some crackers and potato chips.

air-india,/lounge-reviews/air-india,Air India Maharaja Business Class Lounge - Mumbai Airport,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,Visited whilst in international transit. Good points - this new lounge is huge has a varied selection of seats including recliners shower facilities are good OKAY selection of reading material and half a dozen internet terminals for free internet access. The bad points are that whilst Air India's website shows alcohol is available to international travellers none is available or on show. In fact there's one small fridge with water pepsi 7 up fanta or fruit juice - that's it. The food selection is similarly limited and the hot selection was particularly unsatisfactory (2 veg 1 meat - however there appeared to be no chicken in this!). Wifi is the airports and not the lounges - limited and very slow - had to use the dedicated terminals instead.

Good points - plenty of seating good wi-fi newspaper selection tv drinks selection notified when it was time to board. Bad points - except for the shami kebabs the food selection was poor and in the case of the sheesh kebabs revolting. Had the crackers and crisps instead once the shami had run out. The staff were overstretched (there appeared to be only 2 of them) and as a result items were not cleared or refreshed.

air-new-zealand,/lounge-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand Business Class Lounge - Melbourne Airport,M Duffy,Australia,2014-10-04,Thai Airways uses Air NZ's Koru lounge at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport. TG462 departs at 0030 and it is sad to relate that this excellent lounge has very little to offer the business class traveler at the end of the day. Eats such as they were consisted of a very tired salad bowl a few biscuits and a bowl of fruit salad. In the drinks department there was no chardonnay only Marlborough Sav/blanc in the white range and one brand of red (cab/sav). I have used this lounge on several occasions earlier in the day when it is sparkling clean with plenty of food and drinks choices. I got the impression that the staff just wanted the Thai travelers out of the lounge ASAP in order to close the facility for the day. In fact the whole of Tullamarine Airport at that late hour is a shambles.

We arrived just at the end of the breakfast service but you could still pick up some items off that menu – cheese & bacon muffins were delicious! The soft drinks were dispensed via a soda machine and my only quibble was that the glasses could have been done with being bigger. The ones there were more for adding a mixer to alcohol than someone just having a soft drink.

Good selection of NZ wines cold meats cheese biscuits and bread with salad all self service. Several work stations with a rather slow internet connection. Staff polite and helpful. One grudge is the seating arrangements all of the side window tables are set for four people they always seem to be occupied by just one person who takes over the whole space confining the rest of the passengers to squeeze into the area in the centre.

The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (7:30 a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons.

Nevertheless the WiFi should be improved or the instructions to be made clearer on how to connect. In the central area of the lounge there is a TV showing CNN.

avianca,/lounge-reviews/avianca,Avianca El Dorado Business Class Lounge Customer - Bogota Airport,M Chia,Australia,2013-11-15,After being deprived of a lounge in Santiago I was hoping to be compensated by the new lounge in Bogota. But I was rather disappointed. First the directions given by the checkin agent was go straight after security. Unfortunately there was a T-junction where the sign board had an arrow pointing UP. I asked a staff but the directions was confusing. Having heard that it was past the food court I look for this sign reach a dead end a construction area. So I backtracked and saw the food court UPSTAIRS. Going into the lift I pressed 2 the floor the agent told me. It didn't move. I try 3 and it moves. Actually the lounge is no longer after the food court but to the side especially if you take the lift. Next I looked for the toilet. I could see the female toilet but not the male one. I walked to the other end - still no toilet. Backtracked all the way to exit still no toilet. You see the male toilet is beyond the ladies but it is not visible from this direction or that. And there are no signs to overcome this. Then I went for the food. The spread was astonishingly poor. Many plates of ham and cheese. Some salad and juices. That's it for food. (I hadn't checked the alcoholic section.) I gathered some food and look for the cutlery. Not obvious again. After going around i found forks and knives but no spoon. I asked the cleaning lady and she obliged. Huge traffic during lunch time is no excuse Then I go the work area. Plugged in my video camera to recharge. Power light doesn't come on. I jiggled here and there. Still no power. So I waited for another table to be vacant. And there's power. So my verdict. Great potential. Lots of shortcomings which can be easily rectified. I hope Avianca realises that most people only use the lounge once. And some older people are not so mobile so they need good direction signs.,AVIANCA EL DORADO BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,Bogota Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,3,3,1,3,4,1,0

Tasteful decor imaginative catering reasonably comfortable. Since then it's gone sadly downhill. It is impossibly packed at peak hours food is pathetic (dusty sandwiches no plates plastic glasses no service) computers generally occupied by kids playing games the main lounge dominated by blaring TVs so work impossible. The best you can do is hug one of the little chairs in the front room and use earplugs. Another strange habit of the airline is to call US flights in the lounge while there is still a half hour line for secondary inspection at the gate.,AVIANCA EL DORADO BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,Bogota Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,2,1,1,3,2,1,0

A real drawback is that they don´t provide plates not even plastic plates for the snacks one has to use napkins! Strange for a Business lounge. The catering itself is not bad but nothing special either. Self-service bar unlike the real bar service at Lima airport for example. At peak hours it can be really packed especially between 7pm and 9:30pm when many AV international flights leave. Nevertheless a nice place to relax after check-in and security procedure.

I realize that lounges get busy at certain times of day but I don't understand why conditions need to be worse than at your average Starbucks or even (on this occasion) Café Rouge.

Empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables. As I had only recently eaten on the inbound flight I did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private.

Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language.

I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often. When my flight was called the gate was literally 30 feet away. This lounge certainly was a relaxing retreat away from the crowds and I wish more were like this.,BRITISH AIRWAYS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,Kiev Borispol Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,5,4,4,4,4,0,3,0

Although the lounge did fill up while I was there seats were available. The breakfast food was fine and plentiful and beverage selection is what you'd expect in a lounge. The staff were pleasant; they greeted as you arrived and farewell as you left. There was a bartender on hand to mix drinks. I had excellent WiFi connectivity.

Given most really long hauls like to Australia leave very late one would expect an option to eat before boarding. Well you can have snacks but that is about it. The other thing about this lounge and the business class lounge is finding them. They are on the 5th floor but given entry through immigration at the tom Bradley terminal is a bit like entering the corridors of an underground prison the narrow corridors and lack of signage give little indication of where to go for anything. Incredibly on the 3rd floor which is the departure level there is a completely new world of shops and glitz so why can't Qantas get with the new Tom Bradley theme. The other thing is the very good BA/Qantas premium check in area is gone. Now if want to check in early because your hotel has thrown you out it is an all in check in affair which despite the sign saying business/ first class means nothing. For those of you have tried to understand the psyche of the US travel who wants to pay nothing for the airfare but then argue at check in for a first class seat delays can be considerable.,"QANTAS ""ONEWORLD"" FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW",Los Angeles Lax Airport,First Class,NA,NA,3,3,5,4,2,3,3,4,0

Three time I have been refused access here - you have to go back down the stairs go to the internal desk hope it is manned or the person is free get a pass from them and go back. it is more hassle than it is worth. In Edinburgh twice they said ""no"" then looked at a card document and realised it was ""yes"" but this apparently changes in September and the SQ card is no longer welcome there.

The Business Lounge in A is massive and runs the whole length of the building with several food areas, seating areas, bathrooms with showers, business centres etc. The beauty of this lounge is that it has a proper smoking lounge with good ventilation so as a non smoker traveling with a smoker I don't mind going in. It's a proper bar with chesterfield sofas and TV's on the walls, not just a smoke room. In the food areas there's a hot buffet and lots of cold choices, fruit, yogurts etc. Plenty of drinks options and coffee machines that make a very nice macchiato. A is also the A380 terminal so has the 2 deck air bridges and you board directly from the lounge.

The lounge is always packed and with Israeli backpackers and whole extended families that are clearly not traveling in First or Business Class! I think they have some kind of deal with a credit card company or something which allows easy access to the airports ONLY lounge. It only has two toilet cubicles that are unisex and one was out of order so men women and children all had to line up to use the one cubicle! The cold food and beverage table seemed more like a school lunch line with children and youth grabbing things and small children playing with the espresso machine. Last but not least airport staff and airline maintenance and ground crew come through to grab food and drinks laid out for the passengers. I witnessed an aircraft maintenance guy come through a back door and with his clearly dirty fingers and overalls finger several pieces of cake till he found one in the middle he liked stuffed it in his mouth leaving the others aside and walked out the same way he came in! Ben Gurion need to open several lounges to meet the need of its passengers and levels and status. Truly the worst airport lounge I've been in.

The cappuccino button on the coffee machine is disabled (saving milk?). There are no newspapers. The only thing there is are armchairs at least 10 years old and uncomfortable. I mostly use the lounge before the Avianca flight to Bogota in the morning and I thought that Avianca is the poor cousin in the Star Alliance and its passengers get correspondingly offhanded treatment. Not so. A couple of months ago I took Swiss First to Zurich and used the F section of the lounge. Indistinguishable except for a simmering pot of unidentifiable meat and half a bottle of champagne.

It is also the type of lounge that appears to be accessed by anyone paying a nominal fee or having a paid-for lounge pass. As such it was absolutely crowded out - we got two of the last seats available on a Thursday afternoon. There was nothing to eat apart from soup (unnamed) and crisps and only quarter bottles of indifferent wine (the white ran out about an hour after we arrived) with a few general spirits such as G&T. This is not a proper business lounge of the type you would expect from Virgin and we were very very disappointed. There were no UK papers hardly any magazines and the room was small and cramped. We watched people come in walk around looking for a seat and then leave again. I asked the woman on the reception desk what happened when the lounge was full and she told me that she ""sent them away"". When I asked where to she replied ""out of here"".

It is the worst lounge I've ever used. Having said that it isn't quite as bad as some other reviews across the Internet might lead you to believe. We arrived about 90 minutes before our British Airways flight from Bordeaux to London Gatwick and the whole Club Europe check-in process was very friendly and smooth. We were issue with an invitation to the lounge; you then have to go through security (no fast track of course!) and present your invitation to the ""Cafe News"" on the airside. They will then give you the code for the lounge's front door. You have to enter this yourself; the lounge has no staff at all. However the member of staff at the cafe was very pleasant. There is a vending machine serving hot drinks which I found acceptable but be aware that the default choice adds sugar to everything which I did not want. There are a couple of local wines in a cooler and various spirits with soft drinks and mixers in the cooler. A few food items are available; in our case since we had a morning flight there were some quite fresh croissants and pains au chocolat which were actually quite good. The seating is rather old but not uncomfortable. The lounge itself was mercifully quiet which I suspect is usually the case for what is most probably a mainly holiday destination. Some of the tables could have used a quick clean but nothing serious here. So all in all if you can get a good price for your business class seat it may be worth it for the additional pre-flight comfort but anything like standard business class prices are definitely more than it's worth paying for this lounge.",SALON DES VIGNOBLES,Bordeaux Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,4,3,3,3,1,2,1,0

Another of those huge impersonal lounges that can get crowded. Without wishing to be snobbish this seems to be as a result of allowing access to non Biz/First class passengers who are on other airlines' FF lists or have just bought passes for cash. I suppose the rather bizarre almost 'speakeasy' hidden alcohol bar is a sop to the religious people in the country and the choice/quality is OK but no more. Also food is adequate without being impressive. Seating is reasonably comfortable but the toilets/showers are starting to show their age. To be quite honest the MAS Business class lounge in the domestic part of the terminal is a far nicer experience less impersonal better seating and food (including an absolutely fantastic malay chicken curry).

If you visit the First Galleries Lounge opposite the Concorde Room you can request items from their buffet selection and they will be served to you in the Concorde Room. There was a good choice of premium spirits and champagnes as well as teas coffees and soft drinks. I booked one of the private cabanas when I organised my trip which is a dedicated day room with bed TV shower toilet free telephone use and room service. You can request a cabana for a maximum of four hours it's an oasis of calm within an oasis of calm. I also had lunch and afternoon tea there good quality food and friendly and efficient service. I also used the Elemis Spa facilities which can be booked twenty eight days in advance if you are a First passenger. There is also a boardroom style facility to log on to the internet and printers so you need to produce any paperwork. My only criticism is that some of the soft furnishings are beginning to wear slightly.,BRITISH AIRWAYS CONCORDE FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,London Heathrow Airport,First Class,NA,NA,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1

Not having experienced the previous one I'm guessing this is a vast improvement on what it replaced judging from the publicity. Decor is pleasant & modern with good bar / food facilities (if very cramped). Biggest problem is the First lounge isn't yet finished. As a result the new lounge is like an overcrowded food court with people using chairs as tables and footrests for sleeping that's if you can find a spare chair. The overall noise level is much like a shopping mall. There are also only 9 showers which seems inadequate for an international gateway port. It seems destined to become undersized only soon after opening. Having flown extensively on CX through HK & EK through DXB this lounge falls far short of those facilities. The biggest issue is zero privacy or quiet space which are what most long-haul business travellers crave and get in those cities. I guess considering the hell American air travellers endure in North America it's probably a welcome haven. But by international standards it's a falls quite a way short of the mark.

Reasonably comfortable place with good views over airport. What seems somewhat mean and petty is that on checking in to the lounge you are given a voucher for just one alcoholic beverage. From a European perspective this is strange - especially since at AA Admirals Lounge in Heathrow there's an open bar. Most customers in this situation in my experience do not come into these lounges to drink the bar dry - but the option of a second drink without paying more would be nice - especially after buying an expensive business class ticket. On my way back to London through DFW used the smaller British Airways lounge and they have no one drink voucher policy. It's a pity AA do this - as their service from LHR to DFW is a great business class product in the air in the new 777 ER - probably best transatlantic.,AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,NA,Business Class,NA,NA,4,5,5,2,2,4,5,4,1

A quiet section for passengers who wish to catch a moment of rest. Wifi is free. Bathrooms and showers well maintained and staffed. The lounge has a great view of the runway.

As there was no catering (only rice crackers and savoury crackers) for this just-after-lunchtime departure. This added to an unsatisfactory experience mostly on the account of the rude and unhelpful staff. I do not consider it a problem to have a limited command of English in a non-english speaking country and working in a mostly non-english speaking place but it is very problematic to combine this with such a rude attitude.,KOREAN AIR BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Tokyo Narita Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,3,3,0,4,0,1,0

american-airlines,/lounge-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines First Class Lounge - New York JFK Airport,H Rowe,United States,2013-11-22,"Thankfully on my return flight home that had a long layover at JFK I was able to use the AA lounge instead of the horrid BA lounge. There are actually 2 AA lounges in the same terminal one is on the top floor. I utilized both because the gate for my flight changed and they offered me the opportunity to go to the lounge closer to the gate. Both of these lounges are good and you can choose which one you use. Really it depends on what you're after. The one on the top floor gave me great personal service when I arrived and when they noted the length of my last flight they offered me use of the shower. I didn't have to wait they had plenty available. This lounge had self serve bar with a decent (though not extensive) amount of options or you could use drink coupons at their attended bar to order cocktails. The attended bar was a little lonely looking and didn't look well stocked but I'm not positive. The lower level lounge also had great customer service the front desk person greeted me nicely and assisted me with updates about my delayed flight changed my seats etc. They didn't seem to have a self-service bar but the attended bar over here was lively and had a very sweet older bartender who called every customer ""mi amor"". She was so sweet. When my plane unexpectedly began to board after many delays she quickly got me a drink so I'd have time to finish it and she got me bottles of water to take on the plane. Computers were set up next to the bar area and had high top chairs making it comfortable to have a drink while checking your email. I don't think this lounge had showers but since I'd already showered at the first lounge I didn't go looking for it either. Only gripe was that despite it being around dinner time they didn't have food options except a few limited things to purchase. For that I might as well step out into the airport and buy the food of my choice.",AMERICAN AIRLINES FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,New York JFK Airport,First Class,NA,NA,4,5,5,5,2,5,4,5,1
