I got the 22.15 flight from Heathrow to Athens on the 13th and then the 09.15 flight to Chania on the 14th. At Heathrow the flight was over-subscribed so they were offering people a large sum of money a night in a hotel and the flight the following day - I wish they would have asked me! Then they were asking people to (voluntarily) check their hand luggage into the hold - so I offered because of the long wait I had at ATH! The flight was smooth the hot meal was served early on into the flight and we landed slightly early. The only criticisms I have is that the seats are a little hard and the cabin was stiflingly hot and very bright! Great to have a free meal though. On arrival at Athens at 03.40 I collected my hand luggage and checked into an airport lounge before my flight to Chania - which was well worth the Â£20!

I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole ""Irish"" routine which went on for a while.

In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience.

aerolineas-argentinas,/airline-reviews/aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,B Aldridge,United States,2014-08-26,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,2,0

On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies.

This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled.

What is going on with the re-instated check-in / bag drop queues at Brussels? I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter. I think they need some better identification or barriers between the two to snake the queues to make it work better. Or a staff member guiding people correctly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,2012-09-26,Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,3,4,0,NA,NA,2,1

This flight has only one type of customer: oil & gas people. I have found the service as fair overall crew friendliness and meals are actually in good category (crew friendlier then Air France). It's a pity Aigle Azur does not have baggage transfer handling agreement at CDG which means that each time we transit at CDG to / from other airlines we need to go through the immigration to recover our luggage no automatic transfer between Aigle Azur and other airlines at CDG (leading to LOSS of luggage at CDG for those not in the know such as in my case).

After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on.

The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered.

FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board.

When flying Economy Aeroflot is very good for short haul flights to EU. When flying Business quality issues arise. Lounges sometimes are packed both in terminals D and F especially in the morning or late in the evening. Secondly onboard quality service is unsustainable: sometimes attendants are nice and helpful sometimes rude and evasive. Aeroflot always forgets about its Business class passengers and priority Boarding especially in terminal F for long haul flights. However the major problem is the home airport of Sheremetyevo. In most cases people are spending an awful long time just to leave the airport area. Queuing in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2 week vacation and Business Class experience crosses everything out about the Aeroflot flight.

Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights. Two meals are provided;1 warm meal two hours into the flight and the second cold (and small) approximately 60 min before landing. This was the same for in/outbound. This means no refreshments or snacks for approximately 6-8hours!! So BYO! In addition make sure you select a low row number 1-35 rows in the back of the aircraft cannot select meals and get whatever is left. Meals are rather poor in quantity and quality. Note that AB is a semi-LCC though with mostly regular fares. This could explain the poor Food and Beverage service. Flights were all remarkably on time.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,2,4,NA,NA,4,1

air-botswana,/airline-reviews/air-botswana,Air Botswana customer review,Justin Bell,Spain,2010-12-13,Air Botswana to and from Johannesburg and Maun. The staff were friendly and outward journey JNB-Main was fine. The return journey was chaos! To start with the check-in at Maun airport was chaotic. The lounge was completely full of passengers trying to check in. Air Botswana had chartered another aircraft and upon boarding some passengers had no seats so they were told that they would have to catch the next flight. Once aboard they told us that the aircraft couldn't take our bags and that they would be in JNB on the next flight (apparently 2 hours later). I was connecting with a flight to Europe and if I had known that earlier I could have labelled my bag accordingly and I might have tried to check my bag through the whole way. I felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers. They couldn't take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough. The problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard. We flew via Gabarone to refuel. Then in Johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow! At least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later. However that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as Air Botswana must have known this in Maun. He took down all our details and where we wanted our bags sent if we weren't staying in Johannesburg. I honestly didn't expect to see my bag again. Three days later at home in Spain an Air Botswana rep phones me and asks me which airport in Spain I want my bag sent to! Zaragoza is 1.5 hours drive away and the nearest airport. My bag arrived there 2 days later. If any other airline flew between Main and Johannesburg I would try them. I think Air Botswana needs some competition!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time).

Aeroflot does not serve any alcohol on flights to Bangkok but they also have not replaced those alcohol drinks with anything else. You are served only Cola Fanta Sprite water tomato juice apple juice or orange juice tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment was excellent with many films and games as well as music. The only negative thing we could find was the fact that Russian passengers do not take safety matters very seriously.

Arrived at check-in and found a queue that stretched all the way back to Zone A (the entire length of the check-in hall). After some time waiting I and another passenger in fear of missing the bag drop cutoff for our flight left our positions and went to in search of somebody from Aer Lingus at the check-in desks. It was then a race for our flight. Narrow claustrophobic corridors and even narrower aerobridges. EI I suppose can't be held totally responsible for the terminal area assigned them by BAA or probably even the number of counters they can open but I think they could have been a little more pro-active in providing a queue host rather than wait to be prompted by waiting pax in the queue. On the return check in at BFS was smooth no queues at -90mins and despite late arrival of the inbound aircraft we left only 5 mins late. On board both flights were unspectacular and the crew polite and efficient. Although I miss the days when EI was a full-service airline and a member of oneworld they have carried off their transition to a LC carrier successfully. Their website and all rules are simple and clear and there is no ambiguity. If you want extras you pay for them and you get them if not you don't. Simple.

The plane was clean and tidy and the overall comfort was not much different to Etihad. The meal I had was typical Plane fare and a little less presentable than Etihad but edible non the less.

I was abruptly awoken by a male flight attendant who knocked me with a trolley. I awaited an apology but instead was yelled at for having my knees in the aisle. The other flight attendants did their utmost to make us feel as uncomfortable and unwelcome as they possibly could. It was as if they were going out of their way to be rude and unfriendly. Our return flight (mid October 2012) which we were dreading was delayed by over 2 hours. No staff available in Phuket to advise what would happen with our connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to London.

After we boarded in Boston we sat for another 35 minutes before the plane left the gate. Needless to say we missed our connecting flight to Tokyo by 5 minutes. When we got to Toronto Pearson airport-which is the most unfriendly and confusing airport we have ever had the misfortune to be in-we got to our gate the plane was still there with the bridge still at the plane but we were told the gate was closed. After I informed them that if they could sit our plane for 35 minutes at the gate in Boston without moving then that would give us time to board our flight. We were rudely informed that that was not possible and were directed to go to customer service. Air Canada told us that they could not get us to Tokyo that day and that we would need to spend the night in Toronto. They paid for the room and some of our meals but the customer service was horrible. No attempts were made to book us with another airline as we have had happen in a similar situation in the past. Two years United screwed up and caused us to miss a flight to Hawaii but they bent over backwards and got us there only one hour later than our original time.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,A Johnson,Canada,2015-03-18,I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for. I'm sitting here in the airport probably with 100+ passengers looking as exhausted and frustrated as I am and probably thinking the same thing - never again.

The distance between the gate and exit is probably not more than 30m. Flight to TXL was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and flight back to ZRH was delayed due to ATC regulations. Inflight service is rather simple with free drinks and a choice of crackers or a chocolate bar.

To Honolulu AC1831 5.30 pm on time departure seats 12 D and E (Zone 5): 1) How the new boarding works at YVR airport - when they call out Zone 3 (back of the plane) you must wait about 10 minutes before boarding. My complaint is that none of the gate attendants called out Zone 5. It became a free for all where no one bothered to call out Zones 4-5. Having Prestige status and/or one of the Visa Infinite Privilege credit cards will not bump you into Zone 2 for priority boarding on rouge. 2) Our cabin and cabin seats were clean. My partner is 6'2 and I'm 5'4. We found the seat pitch (35) to be comfortable and the recline to be sufficient enough to enjoy a snooze. I brought my Android kobo reader and downloaded movies/TV shows beforehand and was happy with that. Yes they charge $10 per iPad rental but as stated in previous reviews the connections timeout and any Air Canada app show you watch will intermittently stop and take up to a few minutes to load and continue (as my partner experienced on his iPhone). 3) Flight attendants are attentive and aim to be very pleasant. 4) I ordered cheese cubes with crackers as a light snack from the OnBoard menu. We had visited the Priority lounge prior to for some light snacks. 5) Flight came in to HNL 25 minutes early. We waited 40 minutes for our luggage in the partial open-air airport which still looks the same as it did in the 80s as with most dated American airports. To Vancouver AC1830 01.00am departure (delayed from 11.15pm) seats 12 A and C (Zone 5): 1) If you are a Nexus card holder you get pre-TSA clearance at HNL airport which is handy for moving quickly. This open-air airport is not air-conditioned in the main corridors. Lounges are closed after 6pm. Check before you leave hotel to make sure flight is on time. 2) HNL gates are open only when the incoming flight has landed and completely deplaned. 3) Nothing past Zone 3 is called out. At YVR gate attendants admit that the system is new and they are still figuring out how it works (whether or not to bother calling out Zone 5 at all). 4) By the time we boarded we noticed that the plane was not full. Because the plane arrived late (weather reasons) although the signs said ""delayed to 12.05am"" we didn't take off until after 1am. However we arrived only 20 minutes later than we normally would had the plane left on time. 5) Both directions there are no means to control air and there are no power outlets to charge devices. HNL airport has plug-ins throughout to pre-power up however. 6) Cool air was blasting in our window/aisle seats and we felt it. When we were mid-cabin flying to HNL this wasn't a problem. I'd recommend purchasing a beach towel merely to cover up and keep warm on the plane. We were fully dressed for chillier Vancouver winter weather which helped. Would I fly it again? Yes booking seats 12 D and E or D and F. Why? Good price decent leg room served first with drinks/snacks - they offered twice and in a very timely manner. You de-plane faster.

All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake!

air-china,/airline-reviews/air-china,Air China customer review,J Kim,Australia,2015-07-30,"When we arrived at Beijing airport at 10:30 pm to check in for our flight to Paris we were told that the flight was delayed to 5:50 in the morning due to thunderstorm. I couldn't believe that as we had previously flown in much worse weather. It wasn't even raining but I won't argue with the decision Air China made as safety is a priority. We were already so tired and we weren't happy as our return flight to Korea with Air China had already been rescheduled inconveniently. It was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so It was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in Paris. I asked the Air China Duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid Beijing weather. I am very unhappy with how we were dealt with. One of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us. Furthermore, He said he would do anything he could for us so I requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call. After he was on the phone for a short time he said, unfortunately, there were no rooms available . As much as we were frustrated and annoyed, I thought he couldn't really do anything more for us at that time. I asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least, so if any rooms became available we could get one. He said that wasn't a problem and he said our names were on the list. Although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative, I wish I grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie. After we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as I wanted to double-check our names were actually on the waiting list. They informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay. We explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that Air China said they were not willing to pay for it. With the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the Air China Duty Manager but of course he wouldn't answer the phone. I also called the customer service desk of Air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold. The lady told me that she couldn't help because I chose English therefore the line went through to LA Air China so that she couldn't help us. I don't know where to begin to complain about this situation. The way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable. First of all, how the manager lied to our faces like that I still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers. I have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company. If customer service is only for Chinese speaking people and English speakers only get a dummy speaker and they can't actually help anyone with the problems, they might as well be up front about it. Then they could have saved my time and money for making all the international calls like an idiot at 2am in the morning. I emailed the customer service.

The new planes are a very welcome addition and a solid improvement over the dated 767. AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment. AC's switch from T3 to T2 is a good move as the terminal is much nicer and easier to get through security although the walk to the Heathrow Express is a long one.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,4,2,3,NA,NA,3,1

All planes were on time and embarkation was efficient. The Singapore legs used clean new planes with excellent entertainment systems. The longer London legs were both on a very old plane. It was clean but decidedly tatty. The food on all legs was unappetising and fell well short of any other airline food that I have ever had. Cold drinks were offered but we had to work hard to get anything other than orange juice or apple juice. There was very limited wine and my requests for tea or coffee were met from the trolley but not graciously. All of the above were not deal breakers but the following are - the old London-Beijing planes were very uncomfortable. The seats were old and tatty and the entertainment system was atrocious. If it worked it was extremely complicated and mine didn't work at all on the outbound leg. To add insult to injury a black box linked to the entertainment system was placed under the seat in front of you and this severely limited leg room and forced anybody with normal length legs to sit on a twist. The Singapore plane was more comfortable so would be put to far better use on the longer flight to London as ten hours is far to long to sit in a crooked seat on a tatty old plane.

Flight 847 was on a new ""High density"" 777-300 with 10 abreast seats resulting in narrow seats and reduced pitch to 31"". I am 5'10"" tall and 170 lbs and the height that aircraft seats were originally made for. It was impossible to reach down and get things from the floor without getting up and bending over. The price of this flight was not cheaper than others and Air Canada did a bait and switch changing the configuration after I purchased the ticket. The cabin crew did their best . The galley for the 400 seats in economy was very small. The food was almost non-existent. Air Canada has the worst food for an international flight I have had. The second meal was a heated wrap essentially a ""hot pocket"". Inflight entertainment was new system on this plane and was quite good but the second flight had a slow outdated system. Overall service good and AVOD good everything else terrible. Flight 787 was an Airbus A320. Bad AVOD only two bathrooms for economy. Turbulent flight so when not turbulent long lines for lavs. Service Satisfactory everything else not. Hopefully Air Canada will get new 737 MAX equipment with 3 lavs in the rear for these medium haul flights. The Pearson Airport transition with US customs is terrible. Would be better just to have customs in final destination.

This was on July 23 2013. I was happy with the service I received. I did on-line check-in and printed my boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport. To print my baggage tags I went to the check-in kiosk but the kiosk unfortunately did not want to print out all my tags meaning I could not go to the quick express bag-drop queue. This wasn't really a problem though because as a Star Alliance Gold customer I can use the quick Executive Class check-in queue to drop off my baggage. Check-in agent Heather was very nice and friendly! She actually gave me individual attention to the fact that my baggage should be labelled as fragile. I then went past security and with a friend I went to the Maple Leaf / Star Alliance Gold lounge. Lounge had a calming and not too busy atmosphere very pleasant and recommended! The flight itself was great! Cabin crew were attentive (although not the very friendliest AC cabin crew I have encountered but still very good) and the in-flight entertainment options were actually I think the best part of the flight.

Check-in painless lounge ok although the time from 'go to gate' to 'closing' in departures is ridiculously short. Inflight meal was ok - child's meal was well received adult's meal perfectly ok and served promptly with additional drinks available on request. Only downside was the bassinet wasn't available. IFE ok when it worked although it needed re-booted at least 3 times. Return flight. Check in at Toronto an utter shambles check in online but to get to bag drop you need to print out all your bag tags. This would be fine but their system can't cope with a booking including an infant. Thankfully the desk agent took pity on us and printed them out. Toronto lounge pleasant. Inflight pretty terrible. AC seem to persist with ancient aircraft without winglets so turbulence is amplified meaning the seat belt light on most of the trip. No food service during 'turbulence' so meal service took hours and the lights were left on so neither of the children (or us) slept at all. Asked for lights to be dimmed and 'we can't dim them' was the reply. Didn't get a drink before food due to the apparent turbulence cutting short the drink run and the never came back until 'breakfast'. At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. 'Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling. AC would have been better with a light snack for dinner (given we took off at 10pm) and a decent breakfast. Some of the staff were quite friendly and chatty but it couldn't describe a truly miserable flight. I could only really describe it as 'United in disguise' expected far better from AC.

air-europa,/airline-reviews/air-europa,Air Europa customer review,A Ross,United Kingdom,2015-02-11,LGW-MAD-GRU - Having done this journey direct from the UK I was dubious about the change in Madrid and sceptical about the Â£2k less difference in the BA price. Check was a bit gruff at Gatwick with the handling agents doing their best to ignore customers while discussing their weekend plans and gossiping about a poor member of staff who had just gone of shift . However the Lounges at Gatwick and Madrid were not as good as the Heathrow Terraces but much better than the rude and over booked facilities of the JFK Terraces. I felt the weak link here was the lounge in Sao Paulo on the way back which reminded me of a provincial airport with basic service and low quality decor. Air Europa may wish to consider changing this. The first thing that strikes you about this airline is the service and the pristine staff who respond to you every need as if their life depended on it  nothing was too much trouble. Dinner service was on a par with old BA first class with leather menus and five courses although the food was on a par with lesser Club World. The seat - was not a lie flat bed but very similar to Club World London City although the Air Europa Corporate colours are a bit garish for my taste. There were plenty of films to watch and an I pad if you ran out the regular on demand service. There was a the obligatory amenity kit comforter blanket and pillows at bed time.

We waited on the tarmac with most of the doors open in the 3' C weather for about 45 mins. The food was atrocious. First of all is it too much of a luxury for AF to provide actual milk instead of powdered milk with their tea and coffee? The meal was a little sugary cheese something bun which was barely edible. The configuration of the plane was a little odd with small narrow and pretty uncomfortable seating with a very wide aisle. The staff were friendly enough but the IFE was non-existent. For a full service airline I thought that this flight was pretty poor.

For example when the purser was meant to make the safety announcement she looked around and saw a flight full of foreigners. As a result she actually shrugged rolled her eyes and sat right back down instead of briefing us. That it was a 30 year old Tupolev made that nagging feeling of 'I should probably listen to the safety announcement in case I jinx the flight' all the more pressing. That said the flight was a dream. The plane felt so heavy we barely realised we were touching down. The food was passable but the experience was unforgettable. Our seats tilted forwards rather than backwards. But for a 2 hour flight the sense of wonder far outweighs any actual discomfort. The stewardesses seemed more interested in reapplying thick strata of foundation and redoing their 60s overdone hairstyles than actually serving their passengers but the sight was certainly more entertaining than the sad slightly desperate propaganda movies played throughout the flight.

I took a short hop DEL-JAI and a 40 minute flight turned into a 3 hour ordeal. Arrived DEL airport and check in staff said flight was on time. Went to gate and no plane or agent to ask questions. Told by uninterested ground staff flight was changed to different gate. Went to new gate and waited for 90 minutes and finally asked what time boarding would begin. Told flight was delayed by 1 hour due to late arrival of incoming aircraft - no announcements no information nothing. Ground crew stood around chatting on their cell phones as passengers got annoyed and angry. Finally boarded 90 minutes late and hustled into seats. After 30 captain says airport at JAI Is closed waited another 60 minutes then abruptly push back fro gate. Flight to JAI uneventful crew had a few smiles.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,2,2,0,NA,NA,3,0

At Chennai airport for an A320 flight they had only 3 operating check-in counters whilst planes from other airlines had 5-6 counters. This led to long delays and lengthy queues. The Air India ground staff at New Delhi airport seemed to be helpful in helping the passengers getting to their connecting flights. The Dreamliner for the Delhi - Sydney leg seemed to be a good one. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to 3 stewards reporting sick at the last moment and they had to bring in replacement crew. The announcements were spotty and not easily forthcoming. The food served was tiny in portion with only one round of drinks offered for a 12.5 hour journey. The IFE was limited but worked. The toilets didn't have any amenities for a long-haul flight.

Booked 9 months in advance to get a good price for the peak season and felt it was good value because everything was perfectly fine with the Dreamliner (seat pitch cleanliness meals staff service with a sense of humour at times good on-time performance IFE). The domestic sector was served by an older single-class A320 which was far inferior to the Dreamliner but the staff were good both ways and served hot meals during the 2 1/2 hr flight. Cannot fault Air India in any way and loved the Bollywood films onboard the 787. However the transit arrangements at Delhi International Airport are a nightmare which easily bring the spirits down after a good flight. Air India management should work closely with the authorities to make transit arrangements flexible because their European flights (LHR CDG FRA) as well as Melbourne/Sydney seem to depart within an hour.

Got a very good deal back in May which was only Â£100 more than my usual Etihad economy trip in economy for the dates. There were some good points to the trip but several bad points to mention. All flights on time except last leg back to Heathrow that was compensated though by my bag being first off. Lounge quality was varied which I'll review separately. LHR-Delhi on B777 - very good seat for sleeping (slept probably 7 hours) though privacy lacking. Good choice of drink selection but food for business class very poor in both presentation and quality. No amenity kits on board for overnight flight. Entertainment on demand but western choice limited with only 3 recent films. Delhi-BKK. Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky). As noted before chicken or veg should not be the default option for business class and the quality of both was poor even for airline food. No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers. Entertainment system on the A321 from the 1990's - no on demand and a choice of 5 channels 1 English. Ended up watching an Indian cop movie. BKK-Delhi - more of the same but breakfast of better quality. Delhi - BKK - although late best of all the legs with attentive cabin crew calls answered on request for drinks a good quality meal this time. Still could see the cost cutting with the amenity kit in business class being a cheap pair of flight socks and eye mask. No explanation given either of 90 minute delay.

Once after booking online on their website my trip I realized I made a mistake and although it says that all flights can be cancelled within 24 hours it took a lot of effort to get my money back. They seem to nickel and dime you for every little thing. More than once the flight from LAX was late and my connection was lost.

The cabin attendants were friendly and responsive both ways however there was insufficient water provided during the return flight which in a warmer than usual cabin was disappointing. The food was only fair to be honest but the wine pretty reasonable. My main issue was the ground staff and boarding process at MRU. A lack of updates on the delay and a temporary breakdown of the boarding card readers slowed things down even further.

Brand new A330-200 (delivered 2013) serving Frankfurt - Windhoek route with relatively simple business seats (2 setting only meal/upright and lie flat) any other position in between could be adjusted by pressing continuously either one of these 2 functions.

Meals are served in very basic cutlery (on plastic tray) but the taste is surprisingly good (choices between meat/chicken and fish/seafood plus entree and dessert).

Very positive is the fact that you can deliver your hand-luggage next to the aircraft and thus not check it in or wait for it at a luggage belt. The stewardess was very friendly and well groomed. In general the cabin crews of Air Nostrum are young and good looking. The old CRJ200 was noisy and small not my favourite regional aircraft. The flight was short and uneventful.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,F Odds,United Kingdom,2014-10-22,LHR-AKL via LAX and return; premium economy. It's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the design of the premium economy seats. There is a lot to like particularly the legroom the extra bits of storage space and general layout of the seats. Where they fail is with the reclining system. It allows you to incline your lower body but what's needed to place people for sleep is a facility to lower your head. In that respect the traditional tilt-back seats were vastly better despite the problems they can cause for other passengers who don't want to sleep. By airline standards food and drink were excellent on all four legs. Service too was great but why can't drinks as well as small pieces of food be left out for pickup between meal services? The entertainment system was OK but lacking in recent blockbuster movies. I was glad I paid the extra for premium economy but found it very hard to sleep in these upright pod seats.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,3,5,5,3,NA,NA,4,1

As of to date we still have to go home next week Dreading this painful event. Tried to request quote to upgrade to business class. Several emails sent asking for assistance and only received generic emails with no answers. Got quote by phoning NZ $1700 per person. We can't afford it.

Flew Air New Zealand from Melbourne - Auckland and then Auckland - Los Angeles - both legs in business class. Had issue with bags as initially they refused to transfer them from one flight to another because they were separate tickets meaning I would have only 1 hour 50 minutes to go through NZ immigration/customs and then recheck for the LA flight. I was astounded and eventually they relented agreeing to do it making it clear that it was only because I was in business class. Cabin crew on both legs were great food was excellent. Disliked the herringbone window seat arrangements as made it hard to see out of the windows. My allocated seat was not available as it had malfunctioned so they had seated me in another next to the galley which I objected to. I was then moved to another seat but the gate agent did not tell me that this too was near a galley. Not impressed! The seat on the AKL-LAX leg was comfortable but just not up to scratch. If you wanted to lie flat you had get out of the seat and then it was folded down and a mattress put on top. This means you could not sit up easily during the night as to sit up the mattress had to be removed and the seat unfolded and returned to an upright or semi-reclined position. Kind of all or nothing! Lack of storage in seat area. Would I fly Air NZ again? Only if the price was right.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,5,5,3,NA,NA,4,1

air-tahiti-nui,/airline-reviews/air-tahiti-nui,Air Tahiti Nui customer review,L Nelson,United States,2015-04-20,We flew on April 7 and 14 back and forth to Papeete. While the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights. A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea.

Missed out on preferred meal but only because I was right down the end. Food was the best I've had in a long time. Entertainment was great and the ability to order drinks from your screen is very handy. It also means no bells going off through the flight for service. Flight attendants were pretty average. Not great but not rude. I drank a lot of Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious and from New Zealand. All in all or was an average flight.

It is not a premium service and you need to manually check that your baggage is tagged priority. AKL boarding is a schmozzle with very small gates and loads of passengers. Forget about trying to access the premium boarding gates! So all in all great on board but lousy on ground.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,5,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

The service and the crew onboard was fine nothing special and the meals were not the best. On the return leg there was an unscheduled stop in Shannon for refuelling (probably because of the weight restrictions) and we were informed when we were onboard.

The handling agents (aviator) at LGW tried to charge for a hold bag which had already been paid for. Then the agent concerned to add insult to injury upgraded her friends who were on the flight in front of me at the boarding gate. The cabin crew were rude, surly, and never smiled once during the flight. On the flight the on-board service was rubbish, just fell short of them throwing the food at you. The pre purchased hot meal was over cooked which meant most of the meal was wasted. The cabin crew were a total let down to the airline. However the return flight was different and I cannot praise the cabin crew highly enough, they were friendly, and could not do enough for you. The pre ordered food was excellent and the cabin service was slick and efficient. On the return there were regular updates from the cockpit - outbound there were none only the internal messages to the crew. My advice is be careful when booking as the flight arrival times in Riga can make the outward travel in Latvia expensive or may mean an overnight stop in Riga. Also the airlines fleet of Boeing 737 is fairly old with an average airfame age of 11 years.

airbaltic,/airline-reviews/airbaltic,airBaltic customer review,W Wynants,Belgium,2015-01-14,I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,0,0,NA,NA,2,0
airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,Bruce McLaughlin,Australia,2014-08-28,SYD-KUL-PVG 23 August 2014. I chose Air Asia X because I wanted a multi-destination itinerary rather than a return flight and the budget airlines (Air Asia to China and Scoot back to Australia) were a much better deal than a legacy airline open-jaw fare. It was a great experience. Check-in at Sydney was quick and easy: the queue was less than 15 minutes and the check-in person was friendly and efficient. Transfer check-in at KLIA2 had no queue at all. I used OptionTown to try to get a row of three seats to myself for the SYD-KUL leg and an upgrade to Business for KUL-PVG. I got both. The row to myself from SYD-KUL cost about A$ 30 I think and the business upgrade from KUL-PVG cost about A$ 50. Both were a bargain. In economy for SYD-KUL there was more legroom than I've had on many legacy airlines. The seat was comfortable - it was fairly soft leather. It was even more comfortable with three seats to myself. Food - biryani - was excellent and good value. For KUL-SYD the business class seat was amazingly comfortable and folded almost flat: I could sleep comfortably lying on my side. On both legs FAs were friendly efficient and unobtrusive: they did an excellent job. One tip for people flying out of Sydney or Melbourne. You may be tempted as I was to buy drinks from a vending machine on airside so that you don't have to buy drinks onboard. Don't. A bottled soft drink at the airport is A$4; cans that you buy on board are RM6 which is much cheaper. The airline's only shortcoming is that you don't have IFE (although you can rent a tablet). But if you bring your own pre-loaded tablet that doesn't matter. I'll certainly fly Air Asia X in future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,1,NA,NA,5,1

The meal out of BNE was served immediately upon take-off and fell well short of the 'French-style cuisine' advertised on Aircalin's website consisting of a stale bread roll 4 slices of cold meat and a bland lettuce salad. The seat pitch in economy was reasonable and the PTV's on the A320 offered a good range of options including movies games and destination info. FA's were efficient though it was obvious that French-speaking passengers were receiving preferential service. The return flight was delayed by 2 hours due to the crew needing a rest (bad scheduling?). Meal on the return flight on the smaller 737 was better again served immediately upon takeoff. FA's were not to be seen for the rest of the flight once the meal service was over. No PTV's on the 737 and the entertainment on the main screens was only in French with no subtitles.

airnorth,/airline-reviews/airnorth,Airnorth customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-07-15,I have to put in some severe criticism of Airnorth's customer service during the ash cloud disruption in June. My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The aircraft on the YYZ-FCO leg was a refurbished A330-200 with personal entertainment systems and decent seat pitch. Flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and arrived on time. I rated a vegan meal (VGML) which was surprisingly good and nutritious and ample drinks were offered including wine. Staff spoke good English and were alright not the friendliest I've had but sufficient. The 3 hour flight from Rome to Tel Aviv was on an A319. Busses took us to the remotely parked aircraft and we departure about 30 minutes late. Nevertheless arrived on time. Food was served on this short flight which was surprising; cold appetizer but you definitely can't complain! Staff was actually friendlier on this short leg. The slim leather seats weren't very comfortable but alright for a short flight. Overall excellent value for the $800CAD round-trip.

The aircraft was pretty worn (737-400) and the IFE non-existent. The legroom was frightening. Once the pax in front of me reclined my knees were against his seat for the duration.

The agents were friendly but they were completely oblivious to what a Schengen Visa meant. Anyway once on board everything was fine. Brand new A330 with comfortable seats. Recline and legroom was decent although it did feel very tight once the person in front of me reclined. Entertainment options was decent and they had some recent movies as part of their selection. My only complaint is that the screen was extremely unresponsive. Food was average ordered the Seafood Meal and it was delicious. The pre-arrival snack was a disappointment it was literally the same tuna salad served as the side during dinner but slapped between sliced bread. Crew was professional and efficient but were not warm or friendly. Only complaint in terms of service is the lack of beverage runs during the flight. They seem to be too worried resting in their crew rests area (at the back of the plane) and even turned off my service call without asking me if I needed anything. Appalling.

I really can't say one nice thing about this flight. The lighting is awful fluorescent mood lighting which appear not to work and was directly over the bassinet no method to dim. Seat arms are solid and could not be lifted up (unique to the front row middle) which is crazy. In addition all the galleys have been removed so there is one at the front and back with just row after row of seats.

On any airline the quality of the crew is all important. I have persevered with Alitalia but no more. Crew do not assist with the boarding process hence it takes far too long to get passengers seated and flights are often delayed as a result.

The planes are relatively new they leave and arrive on time staff are efficient and friendly and ensure that safety standards are met. There could however be more variety in the hot meals offered. Most importantly the airlines provides value for money and offers very good promotional deals. The one problem however is the inability to provide transit services at KL's LCCT airport.

Transiting through Rome itself is a case study in how not to organise an airport for transit and boarding the flight was a nightmare. No priority for families or business no possibility to upgrade to business with miles from the alliance even though the business class was completely empty (meaning not one seat was taken). On the flight itself food was very poor and the cabin staff just disappeared. There were no sick bags in the seats and the staff did not answer the call button at all - too busy chatting in the empty business class - and then spent 10 minutes looking for sick bags. Also no announcement for landing or beginning of landing. In fact no pilot communication whatsoever after taking off.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Terence Verney,Netherlands,2011-01-20,"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

The flights were on time aircraft very clean and well-maintained and service was very friendly and professional. I paid a small supplement for one of the 'hotseats' and it was well worth it. The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket. Their regular fares are often only a bit cheaper than other carriers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation.

Service onboard very professional with an excellent hot snack (omelette and salmon) for a duration of 2.5h. Transfer at Rome Fiumicino painless using fast track lane and the airport has lots of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia Giotto lounge was packed but the drinks selection was fine as well as the variety of sandwiches. Boarding A330 to Rio quick using Sky Priority lane. The aircraft had the new Magnifica Class with a 1-2-1 configuration. It was half full. Plenty of space in overhead lockers however if you seat in the middle there are none and have to use the ones on the side. Pre-taking off drinks given great selection of appetizers and the best moment was the food. Alitalia won best Airline Food recently and I was very much looking forward to it. Succulent Beef with Roasted Mediterranean vegetables as main course and for dessert a light unctuous Neapolitan Almond Cake. A 5 stars food and the espresso is served in a very beautiful cup and lid. The IFE had a good variety of recent movies but I thought the international selection was lacking. They have Flat beds (Only Skyteam airline in Europe to have these) and managed a good 7h sleep with a very comfortable duvet. The amenities given were a Bulgari bag with lots of toiletries products very much appreciated and high class. Staff very professional smiling and very happy to go for the extra mile for the customers. Breakfast consisted of a selection of Italian pastries and cakes with fresh fruits excellent! On the return leg Alitalia uses Air France/KLM lounge that can be cramped at times but it has great selection of hot snacks (the palm tree heart quiches are gorgeous). Boarding the A330 was painless again and the Magnifica class was full this time. Despite taking off 1h later we managed to catch up 30 minutes. The amenities given was another Bulgari bag and the best highlight was the food again with Pork Milanese as main course. Slept a good 7hours and had a copious breakfast before landing in Rome. The A321 to London was on time and service very good again. Overall a good value for money their new Magnifica class is an excellent product their Flat beds very comfortable and it's the Best Food I've ever had on an airline.

On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,5,5,1,NA,NA,3,1

It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,5,3,4,1,1,NA,NA,1,1

I have been flying for 45 years - this is without question the worst possible round-trip experience I have had. We were 90 minutes late leaving MLI (first flight of the morning) due to problems with a thrust reverser. Had a 45 minute wait. Overheard the pilot tell another passenger what the problem was - why was there never an announcement to the rest of the passengers? As a result we arrived ORD 15 min too late to make the connection. Next flight to LEX was 6 hours later and was sold out - next possible seats were 9 hours later. American did agree to let us travel to Louisville (SDF) instead but had to rent a car with a hefty drop charge. Finally arrived in Lexington 3.5 hours later than planned. Return trip a few days later was worse - left LEX and arrived ORD on time. Had a 2.5 hour layover. The time came to board with no announcement. 30 minutes later told the aircraft had landed and we would board ""shortly"". Another 30 minutes passed and the gate was changed requiring a hike down the concourse. Finally boarded 2.5 hours after original departure time. Clearly there were mechanical issues at work and AA does not want to admit to them. I would avoid this airline completely in the future but unfortunately their competition is equally indifferent to passengers and equally incompetent.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,2,3,0,NA,NA,3,0

The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster.

Went with a mix of western and Japanese meal options and both were tasty - steak cooked well and pork noodles delicious. Small mattress and nice blanket provided for sleep - but the cabin temperature was insanely high. Both myself and my travel companion were sweating trying to sleep. That was the only complaint from this flight and would deter me from using ANA in the future. Seems like many Asian airlines are now keeping the heat on compared to airlines in the Americas.

I was herded into a pen with hundreds of other Allegiant travelers and subjected to an Allegiant Airline agent who took great joy in yelling at everyone to check-in online so that they could be fast-tracked to a different holding pen. Many of us tried to explain that we had already done so prior to arriving at the airport - but it was to no avail. Eventually (25 mins later) we were divided into two lines. One for those of us who had checked in online and one for travelers who had not. Standing in this new line the same agent began yelling for travelers who were supposed to be going to various destinations - supposedly in order of departure time. Those travelers were fast- tracked to the front of the online check-in line regardless of whether they had actually checked-in online or not. Even though some of those travelers were ""fast-tracked"" - many missed their flights. I ended up playing dumb and getting in line with some people who were leaving on a flight that was scheduled to depart before mine - just so that I would not miss my flight too.

Check-in staff very helpful to our party of 6 after arrival from London. Given access to Admirals Club because long-haul had been business class. Pleasant lounge but only stayed about 20 minutes. Priority boarding and seats comfortable for a medium-length domestic flight. Captain announced that he would delay take-off whilst 35 passengers from a delayed European flight made the transfer and took off when about half that number had boarded. But the real surprise was when the flight attendant came round and said that because of the timing (early afternoon) there was no catering on the flight.

Staff seems to do the best they can under the circumstances. Lately I have not been getting very good rates either by the time everything is added in.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,P Miller,United Kingdom,2014-06-17,LAX-LHR. Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films. Breakfast was plentiful and really fresh. Sorry to get off at LHR!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am. I've got no apologies form the company and was left with missing our afternoon in Washington.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,1,1,1,NA,NA,3,0

Boarding delayed as 15 min before scheduled departure the plane was just coming to the gate. Gate agents were horrible - that is the only part of the trip that was bad. Flight boarded quickly and pilot apologized for the delay. Flight attendants in economy were really great - friendly and prompt to respond to requests. Breakfast was french toast and there was a lot of food provided - I was surprised as usually breakfasts on AA Int'l are small. 2 movies shown on the overhead monitors - this is where AA fails without excuse. These planes need AVOD in each seat - end of story - period. But the service made up for it. Left Chicago 45 min late - arrived London 15 min late.

The 767 was the most cramped aircraft I've ever been on and the food was mediocre. The legroom was so poor that my knees hit the seat in front of me when I reclined (and I'm not all that tall). The flight from NRT-ORD was excellent though. There was plenty of legroom on the 777 food was delicious and plentiful and nothing was too much trouble for the FAs.

After reading about the new business class cabin on American's 777-300 we decided to book our trip with them. We made a great choice. At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good. Crew warmed up after a while and responded well to all requests. The walk-up bar had loads of snacks and was topped up throughout. Flight was on time.

Seat 23D which looks appealing due to being a mini cabin had substantially less leg room. Couldn't straighten my legs and was in pain when getting off the aircraft. Food was average for lunch and poor for the second meal with a disgusting hotdog on outbound and some dodgy sliced meat on return. Return was again delayed this time due to servicing issues at LHR. Left me with short time for connection at NRT. Guess what again delayed both on take off and then delayed for another 40 minutes. Cabin crew polite and friendly as normal for Japanese airline.

Fast talking agents resulted in penalties which were more than the price of the economy class ticket even though I spent 4 times that to upgrade the tickets to business class using cash not miles. ANA C-class seats and AVOD are getting dated - pitch is much poorer than UA Cathay or Asiana. Cabin service was technically perfect but lacking sincerity. AVOD was spotty partner's AVOD did not work on the return flight. Indifferent attitude from the FAs. For the price paid almost any other airline is better in my own opinion even if you have to transfer in Incheon. On the positive side ground crew check- in gate staff were excellent.

So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks.

After 2 hours on hold for the ExPlt desk (completely ridiculous but with the storm issues expected) I got a friendly agent who booked me on the 12.55pm to LGA then Tuesday flight to Chicago. YYZ-LGA flight an hour late with only 8 passengers aboard. Great flight attendants - lots of humor. Landed in LGA and went to AA desk to see if there was any flight leaving for ORD that night. Only one was scheduled (6 cancelled) and she got me a seat in coach - was very happy. At the boarding gate got my upgrade by an excellent gate agent who had a fun attitude in dealing with all the craziness at the gate. Good flight to ORD - had a nice squash gnocchi and salad. Cookies offered also. Landed 15 min ahead of schedule as there were no planes landing at ORD. It was a bad weather period but I think AA did a good job.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,9,4,4,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

Went from LHR to SYD via ICN and then return. Quality was definitely variable. The flight attendant's command of English was not brilliant so when requesting anything other than a drink or something to eat they really struggled. Food was ok but nothing out of the ordinary - nothing served for pudding except fruit. Air con was extremely cold on the outbound flight and seats very uncomfortable. On the newer planes the legroom is superb and much more comfortable but the older planes have standard legroom.

Then when the moment to board came we didn't have any news and the Azerbaijan Airlines ground staff disappeared. Just after 1 more hour a staff member was found by the other passenger and was obliged to give a public statement just in Farsi announcing that due to heavy fog in Baku the plane was delayed without indicating the exact departure time.

At 7am the mob almost attacked an Azerbaijan Airlines staff member and obliged him to give some news : he made a phone call and after 10 minutes the we suddenly started to board.

It's not just that food is getting worse (the new menu to NYC is basically inedible) you can't get a glass of wine on domestic routes (free rum and whiskey only) the uncomfortable A320 turns up on more and more NYC routes and the lounges are stuffy and overcrowded. The most disappointing part of the service is that Avianca makes absolutely no effort to ease the way for premium passengers through the deplorable Colombian airports. There are no dedicated security lines no fast track through immigration (which can take up to two hours in BOG on bad days) and when you finally make it to the plane there is no priority boarding. Obviously equal misery for all is a well tested concept - it's called the discount airline. That seems to be where Avianca is headed - surely with its present state of service there is no way to mistake it for the serious world class airline it wants to be. The only reason I keep recommending Avianca is because Delta Continental and American are hardly attractive alternatives.

When I asked for a vegetarian option I was told directly and with no apology that there was not any. Mints offered after we had landed as passengers were on the way out. Another problem is that it is a very long walk at Heathrow to and from the gate used by Austrian. There are various means that help people a long but it can take up to 20 minutes.

Utter chaos as returned to airport kept in lounge and after 3 hours of people shouting and 2 staff trying to sort out the mess we eventually got on a flight to Vientiane after a long walk through the terminal and a complete lack of direction from Bangkok Airways. Arrived at Vientiane had to pay for own hotel. Arrived airport next day to find out we were just on stand by. Luckily on flight at 9am after some drama.

In Milan Bergamo the boarding was fair and those who booked and paid for their seat like me were allowed to board first. B737 is very old but the legroom better than Ryanair and the seat relatively comfortable. The crew were quite young but not very friendly. On the way back the boarding in Bucharest was chaotic and many people were trapped by an employee who checked the dimension of all baggage. Many were forced to pay 55 euros to load the luggage and very intense discussions took place between some passengers and the employees. In short flights were ok and we arrived on time on both legs.

Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level.

There is no customer service on this they palm you off to a third party insurer but the latter claim they haven't been sent the claim by bmi. So I have to follow up with bmi but discover you can't call bmi on such issues you have to write. Very strong feeling of being kicked into the long grass. Probably okay for short haul in the way easyjet is but I can't see a future for long haul low cost airlines at a high price unless you operate a monopoly/duopoly - which strangely enough appears to be the bmi model.

I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. Cabin Crew were fine, but lack warmth of some other Airlines.

The food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and I was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows.

We did have some negative vibes after having read some reviews but the connection was good and price attractive. Turned out to be a wrong choice. It started out with an overbooked flight from Oslo and an advice that one of us would have to stay behind. Only after reminding the ground crew that Luanda is an not an easy destination to reach, that we had confirmed tickets and that we hold Star Alliance did we get on board. The flight from Brussels to Luanda was just not good. The cabin looks and feels fresh and clean, food is acceptable but there end the positive comments. The seats are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that's only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back. The recline is ok but as long as you have someone behind you, reclining is not an option. The fact that my traytable was very loose of course did not help.

Missed Club World check-in. Next day very efficient priority security straight to lounge. Very crowded but found seats eventually. Ordered champagne delivered promptly but it was difficult to get a refill as staff a bit overwhelmed so fixed own G&t. Boarding on B777 efficient and shown to 2 back facing seats, basically a double bed. Glass of champagne provided as we settled in. Take off a little strange as traveling backwards but when in cruise no problem at all. Several drinks services before and during meal service. Very relaxed and very professional crew. Food mackerel pate and steak quite good but not business class in its heyday which I was privileged to enjoy. The seat was strange. Very narrow and a lot of the time you are looking into a strangers face. BA has 8 across seating, more than any other business class operating the B777 in the World. Entertainment ok. Reasonable screen but hardly World Class. Things going fine until, 3 hours from touchdown they said that champagne was finished as they had to save enough for returning passengers. What about we passengers who had paid a lot of their own money to fly Club as a special treat. We persuaded a very nice first Class CA to raid first Class to provide a glass of champagne. After that we were on our own with the Club Kitchen. What a joke. Packets of crisps and a choice of red or white.  Very poor indeed for business Class.

The biggest let down was the screen that was blurry in comparison to the Bling Airways screen I had in economy. The main meal was really nice. Beef fillet that was tender and cooked.

Just enough seats. Nice snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was a big disappointment. Expecting a cooked English breakfast we got fruit in a plastic box followed by an egg and bacon muffin. I took one bight of the muffin and it mad me want to gag. Good crews on both legs.

Brussels airlines operates this route as a duopoly with SAS and it shows in the fares that are charged. My travel plans depended on the weather forecast in Denmark so I was only able to book 72 hours in advance. The cheaper of the two economy cabins had sold out on all 3 flights. The flexible ticket cost about 3 times the advertised minimum fare. Despite this I was charged 8 euros for paying with a credit card (none of my debit cards were accepted by the airline's web site). The ticket allowed fast track security although as this lane was merged into others there was no advantage. Extra cabin baggage was also allowed but as the ground staff did not enforce the cabin baggage policy this was again no advantage. The flight left 20 minutes late as the handling agent had not loaded the bags in time. The seat had no head rest and felt like it had almost no padding a bit like resting on a leather covered ironing board. There was no magazine in the seat pocket. The advertised free light meal/snack was a bread roll with two slices of cheese with terrible coffee served in a small paper cup.

The 777-300 has the newish seats that were quite comfortable except for the headrest which does not have adjustable wings. The situation was helped by the fact that I had been able to select an emergency exit row aisle seat (22B). Departure was on time. Bar service was just before and with the meal. I had used the facility available on this route to pre-order my main course. Overall the meal was quite good. The Mixed Fleet staff commendably avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers of closing the window blinds after the meal service. The seat was a bit stiff in adjusting to a recline.

European business class seemed to be down-graded too. In business you get now what you used to get in b.flex. Intercontinental flights in business class however were quite a different matter. On the way out to Banjul the plane was equipped with the new business-class seats. In one row the seating arrangement is 1-2-1 in the next 2-1-2. Beds are fully lie-flat beds now. Meals were of an excellent quality for airline food and flight attendants were attentive and constantly refilled your glasses.

Embraer aircraft are a fairly small but I like them particularly if they are not full (only one of these four flights was nearly full); they are light smooth and the leg room is fine for a short flight. My one complaint is the price one of my trips was economy (B.Light) and the other economy plus (B.Light+). Although the latter was over twice the price (and even economy is not particularly cheap) there was virtually no difference in the quality of service - a bit more food and that is it.

The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. I would definitely fly BA again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,3,5,2,2,NA,NA,3,1

Also advised that we would have to pick up our luggage at JNB and check in again at JNB for MUB so we wasted time looking for luggage which was being transferred. We have never liked the premium economy seats on BA but connections in JNB made it necessary to travel BA. Seats have plenty of knee room and general space is good but are far to hard after a couple of hours my backside begins to suffer. Crew were good. As far as airline food goes it was reasonable. Return on BA56 on 29th Jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you.

Food was pretty decent for airplane food. Seat was comfortable and certainly better than sitting in the back of the plane. However we think this configuration is a failed experiment by BA. Eight seats across is too many for Business Class. The seats were too narrow. The backward facing seats are disconcerting for two reasons: If you are traveling with a spouse or friend and neither likes to face backwards you can't sit together.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,S Morley,United States,2015-01-19,Washington (IAD) to Heathrow on Christmas Day returning January 5th. I find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA especially considering what they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it was Christmas Day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and I along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. The same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. Again the other airline lounges were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (I was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747. It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. BA seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the Asian carriers. The crew were very good - friendly and attentive. Breakfast before we landed was very average. The bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. Yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which I went for. Check in for the return journey was lamentable at Heathrow Terminal 5. Dedicated Club World positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. Not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending Avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,2,4,4,4,NA,NA,3,1
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,M Gibson,United Kingdom,2015-01-19,San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Flew Manchester to LAX via Heathrow on Christmas day in Club World on the A380. Check in and boarding were extremely smooth at Manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. When it came time to board the aircraft it was quite frankly carnage. There didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for Club passengers. The downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft I now find. Seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13A and 13B) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line. The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for Club World tickets.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,2,4,5,NA,NA,3,1

The domestic airport is nothing to write home about but is clean and Benghasians are very friendly with smiles all round. This flight operated with a rather long-in-the-tooth 737-200 you know the ones with long cigar-shaped engines but was clean and the cabin crew were well polite engaging and presented themselves in smart uniforms smiles all round again.

We booked our original flights on WTP on the A380 and B777 both fitted with the revamped World Traveller Plus - far more comfortable than the old style WTP with an infinitely better IFE system. So guess how pleased I was when BA changed the aircraft on both flights to the now very aged and decrepit B747's with the old style WTP. The 747's really should be pensioned off and replaced with A380's - they are old grimy and falling to pieces. Our B747 was filthy. The catering on the way out to Washington was not too bad - a half decent fillet steak. On the way back beef again but nowhere near as nice and a truly horrible pathetic cold hard croissant and jam that passed for breakfast. Inedible and disgraceful. Good grief BA can't you even pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds? The good points: both flights were on time and the FA's were OK. That's it. This would almost be acceptable except for the final insult - charging for choosing your seat after confirmation of the flight. This is cheap nickel and dime low cost airline stuff and not what you should expect from the nation's flag bearing airline. No other major airline that I regularly use does this - not even small ones like Bangkok Airlines or United Express. It is shameful - even our American friends who flew BA back to Chicago were dumbfounded. You expect it on Ryanair or other low cost outfits but this really shouldn't happen on your national airline. I recommend BA but with enormous reservations - try to book on the B777 or A380 and if you don't need to choose your seat before check in you'll be OK.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,6,3,4,1,1,NA,NA,3,1

I have had more polite service at Macdonalds than at the desk in the Galleries. There was nothing business class or tranquil about the space. The spa was a fully booked with no appointments for two hours and ""the sorry we can't be of service today"" was more than disappointing especially given the Â£6K ticket price and the message was delivered with such insincerity. How can BA get it so right offering 1st Class service in London Miami Boston Seattle Hong Kong and Sydney (to name a few) and offer budget airline service with a mediocre selection of sandwiches in JFK. Boarding was a mess. They were boarding a Qantas flight at the adjacent gate and all the passengers got mixed up. We asked a BA member of ground staff where to queue and she said she did not know and it had nothing to do with her! First and Business class passengers were directed down a cul-de-sac marked fast track which came to a dead end in a sea of passengers and eventually all the premium passengers joined the line behind the economy passengers and boarded last. We ask ""why"" as the lady gave us back our boarding cards and she said ""nothing to do with me"". Upstairs on the 747 in Club was excellent professional attentive staff good food and wine good entertainment BA at its best the only flaw was no menu cards because of a mistake at JFK no surprise.

Early morning flight from T3 so breakfast in lounge. Usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). As is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. Plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. Had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. Managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. Plane had been refitted with the new layout. Beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in Club. Big disappointment. It feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. Not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. Friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. Coffee still poor however. No IFE apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. BUD airport a disaster. No time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. No aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. Very uncomfortable and unpleasant. On return the lounge BA shares at BUD is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. A short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. Priority boarding worked well. Same plane configuration on return. Excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. FAs free with the booze and nuts. Food was again a surprise - I had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. Very tasty.

Unimaginative and largely tasteless meals - the so-called English breakfast looked like it was thrown together by some greasy spoon in downtown Singapore. Trays not cleared away for a very long period of time (ploy to keep passengers in their seats?) no offer of a second cup of coffee/tea disappearance of cabin staff for much of the flight once the meals had been got out of the way (odd since there were loads around during boarding) - so for vast swathes of time passengers were left to their own devices to obtain water - many went off into the darkness in search of refreshment. Peremptory and insincere attention from cabin staff when they did show up - one had the sense that they wanted to get any kind of interaction over with as rapidly as possible so they could disappear again. IFE not at all user-friendly - the touchscreen didn't like to be touched and the range of films/programmes was limited and tired.

They also allow other airlines like Sri Lankan to use it too. They really need a decent lounge there to cope with the many flights to HK.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,John Frewen-Lord,United Kingdom,2014-07-06,Flew from LHR to YYZ on 23 June on new 787. Not impressed. Very bumpy taxiing. Smooth inflight but I couldn't really notice the extra cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to be so wonderful. I was seated in a window seat. Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since I paid Â£30 extra to choose my seat! Cabin crew friendly and efficient though why they didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it I don't know - safety issue if nothing else.

Overall quite good. Good things: IFE good but not out of this world - same programming on short programmes for all legs but films varied although quite safe. Comedy section good classics but limited and again very PC. Planes clean. Comfortable seats although (see my not so good) but nice space and storage. Cabin temperature not too cold not too hot. Service attentive and really worked hard. Toilets always clean. Food - This was the one great disappointment and I eat anything! On two legs of the food was cold and had to reheat. Choices really limited taste not great - really tasted like plane food rather than business class plane food. Servings small and presentation poor.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Mackenzie,Denmark,2014-06-30,CPH-LHR 26th June. Club Europe. BA standards are slipping. The Galleries Lounges are a shadow of their former selves. In the latest round of savings a famous business broadsheet newspaper has been axed the food offerings curtailed and sub-standard and a lack of attention to clearing tables. However the on-board service continues to be of a high standard and the Airbus 321 clean and tidy with very helpful cabin crew.

This was my first time in 20 years traveling round-trip to Melbourne from London. The lounges were generally goodwith decent Chinese food but little or no choice in wines. On board I found the seats comfortable. The service was polite and generally efficient. I didn't see much spontaneity or anticipation: You end up having to ask for what you want. The main disappointment was the food particularly from HK to Melbourne and back. It wasn't terrible but it was worse than I remember it 30 years ago.

I had flown CX before and was looking forward to the experience. The First Class Lounge was as usual excellent. I had a light breakfast in the dining room so as not to spoil my appetite for the meals on board. The 777-300ER was updated with the new First Suite fabric and seat/lighting controls. The Flight Service manager was wonderful as were the other two Flight Attendants in the cabin. As it was my birthday the crew surprised me prior to landing with a birthday card. The food was as expected - stellar and love the caviar course. Studio CX consistently delivers with plenty of entertainment and the bed is a favorite part of the experience with actual turndown service and so comfortable. The wardrobe/closet is a welcome touch to store shoes hang clothing and more.

Simple and tasty flatbread and drink ideal for the 1.45 journey. The return was a tad delayed due local ATC but even though only 10 mins or so the flight deck kept us very well informed and the crew came round with juice or water. Delay was made up enroute and bag appeared as I reached the carousel. Advance booking and using a few points (some I earned back on this flight) made the fare cheaper than low cost carriers.

SYD-HKG operated by A333 all other flights operated by 77W. Seat comfort was very good even for such a long flight with adequate back support and leg room.I found it relatively easy to sleep on Cathay. Food was of a very high quality for an airline - especially the Asian food options. The IFE system Studio CX kept me entertained for the entirety of my flights. The highlight was when I was flying from HKG-SYD and was stuck in a row of crying toddlers. The flight attendant came and asked whether I would like to move seat without me even asking.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,A Moreitz,Australia,2014-12-31,I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Peter Bedson,Oman,2014-06-01,MCT-LHR-MAN and LHR-MCT I think you need to fly BA every so often to remind yourself why you don't do it any more. The first flight was just poor - from check in to landing. Although they have now changed the aircraft on this route and the IFE is better they still treat the passengers as self-loading cargo. It took me 3 hours to get a drink - the staff were cheerful they simply didn't do anything. A full flight and at least one washroom out of action was an additional pain. Transit through LHR is always an unalloyed joy and this time I had to go through immigration which added to the fun but despite this I still had time for a very quick shower between flights - hooray and full marks for the lounge staff. LHR to MAN was fine. Coming back was much better the crew were responsive and pro-active and the food was actually edible - if all BA flights were like this I would use them more - I only used them this time because Swiss have axed the route temporarily while the work on the Dubai runway is happening.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,2,2,4,NA,NA,3,1

When I told her I recognized her from my outbound flight on 4 Aug she was thrilled that I recognized her. Seats were spacious great leg room but I would have appreciated another 2 inches of recline to make sleeping that more comfortable. The downside was the food what was served was tasty but the portions were small and served on a tray not much larger than an A4 size piece of paper. The meal service was rushed and as it was a night flight there could have been more patrols with drinks and snacks. They need to improve on their snack quality which mainly consists of processed food. A few choices like fruit and sandwiches would have been nice.

On the first leg KUL-HKG there was no drink service before takeoff or a hot towel in sight something Cathay hypes about in their commercials for premium economy. I was disappointed with the meal service as although we were served economy class meals the portions were tiny for a 14.5 hour flight. Staff were great pleasant and courteous and it was always service with a smile. They weren't around much after the meal service but did respond to calls. Personally I do not think these seats are great value for money due to the inadequate meal service and the general similar cramped feeling of economy.

The 777 seating between Hong Kong and Japan was particularly uncomfortable food on all legs was some of the worst we'd had eg. braised beef between MEL and HKG was almost all fat while 3 of the 5 Western meals on the HKG-MEL leg had onion sauce &/or onion ingredients. We were laughed at by the cabin staff member when in response to her question we asked for diet coke with our main meal between HKG and MEL. The entertainment system is good but there was little difference between the May programs and those on offer in June.

Food was okay (sandwich only since it's a 2 hour flight). Plane was a B777-300er. Transfer is a breeze.

The MEL-HKG leg was okay again minimal services. The entertainment choices however were excellent. I have learnt from many other long haul flights and now take a soft full size pillow rolled up it makes the world of difference. They are pretty lenient with carry ons I feel the luggage limit of 20kg was a little lousy compared to other carriers. The meal was pretty normal airline food. The flight however was on time and our luggage got there safely. However the HKG - Rome leg was the horrible shell seats. Almost no padding. FA's were really very nice. I spoke to one about the seats and she said they use the old planes to Rome as there are facilities for the staff to sleep and that they use the newer planes for the Melbourne leg. On the return leg we were given a few little packs of cookies. On our trip from Rome to HK we found for some unknown reason our pre-selected seats were changed and my husband and I were apart. We asked about this and they fixed at the check in desk. However onboard someone else had a boarding pass for one of our seats so staff had to quickly find her a seat somewhere. All in all it was a negative experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,3,2,4,NA,NA,1,0

Cathay has rolled out a new ""regional business class"" seat that has partially addressed the upgrade but has totally ignored passenger comfort in the seat. First the seat is hard. On a short sector Manila/Hong Kong I found the seat uncomfortably hard and actually found my back aching. How can they have padded the seat so sparsely? Secondly the seat does offer some recline and an opportunity to snooze although not quite enough especially if one is tall. I'm short 5'8"" and my feet were bumping the apparatus in front of me that housed the next seats. Truly 2"" more of leg room would have been very good and one wonders why Cathay made the pitch so tight. Thirdly the seat has no foot rest - a true failing. How did this happen? In all Cathay's service is good and attentive but the seat in the new regional business class needs a respectable amount of padding 2"" more pitch and a place to rest one's feet when reclined!",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,1,5,2,5,NA,NA,5,1

The HKG-NRT flight was serviced by a B773 with the old economy class seats. These seats were not the most comfortable but thankfully I had three to stretch out over.

Good usual Cathay service in Premium Economy I have found to be remarkably consistent over recent years (I tend to travel on Cathay to somewhere of other about once a month). Premium Economy is excellent if the smallish PE cabin is not full otherwise it can become rather claustrophobic. Cathay Pacific lounges are always first rate in my opinion - great for working or eating. Inflight food also seems to be improving. Only hassles I have is on very long sectors where I seem to have become the target of inconsiderate fellow passengers - getting kicked in the back every 20 minutes all the way from London to Hong Kong overnight is not much fun maybe a function of the seat pitch in PE.

Regular water runs through the cabin. Food was fine and there was plenty of it. Entertainment was varied with several full series of tv shows as well as a wide selection of movies which was welcomed on these long flights. There is also a usb socket for charging your phone etc. If you have an iPod you can plug that in however you'll need the correct plug shame it's not compatible with android etc. Air conditioning was cranked up on all legs so a jumper is definitely needed or you'll freeze!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,S Fletcher,United Kingdom,2015-03-18,I undertook 6 flights on Cebu Pacific in February 2015. On 5 out of the 6 flights were delayed and the common excuse was traffic issues at Manila. This while other airlines plying the same route were leaving on time without any delays. Cebu Pacific announce proudly on their website when you book that they have a 69.1% punctuality rate for February! Onboard seating is comfortable and service is good though I do wish they would stop playing those silly games which can be annoying if trying to sleep on a night flight. There doesn't seem to be a consistent set of rules regarding use of ipads during flight. Some of the flights it was announced that it was ok to use ipads/ tablets if in flight mode throughout the flight from pushback to landing. On other flights they weren't allowed to be used till at cruising altitude. Since Cebu Pacific took over Tiger Air for domestic flights in the Philippines there now is really only Cebu Pacific of Philippine Airlines and as a result a number of routes have been cut completely and fares increased significantly. Cebu Pacific announced no more fuel surcharges however the price of flights increased so customers pay the same or more. When booking online beware of the add on's such as insurance / seat selection etc which are automatically added and must be removed by passenger if not wanted.

It was no more expensive for our family of four to take the CMA flight than it would be to take the ferry to Vancouver and back and for a couple of nights in hotels to make our connecting flights south. Being a smaller plane it was open seating. We were in the emergency seats going both ways and both times the pilots made sure to make eye contact with us when explaining the procedures and asked if we had questions. CMA is very good about the schedule. Both flights left on time and arrived on time. It's a nice short flight. Being a smaller plane it was a bit bumpy both ways but as someone who has become airsick on bigger jets I had no problem at all.

The food had an odd aroma as did the damp hand towels that were kindly offered before the meal. The champagne was okay although it was served in a thimble sized glass the fruit was sweet and the rice was positively offensive. How can rice be bad? Not too sure what was wrong with it but it wasn't edible. The flight attendants were observant and wanting to please but everything was done without any smiles. Perhaps that's a cultural thing. Bathrooms were spotless as was the plane. The seats were super comfortable perhaps more comfortable than United Global First seats apart from the slightly restricted foot space.

Return flight showed a film about the Nazis (not exactly the most cheery thing to see coming back from vacation) and the menu offered a German sausage dish-simply bizarre.

china-eastern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-eastern-airlines,China Eastern Airlines customer review,Biswas Jayant,India,2014-06-12,PVG-CCU via KMG June 8-9 Economy. My ticket clearly stated PVG-CCU. Flight was via KMG with a 23 hr. stopover. My booking for 8th June was cancelled by the airline due to cancellation of their KMG-CCU flight on June 8. At that time (a month before) I was given the option to cancel the entire booking but it was too late and any fresh booking would cost me much more so I opted for the date change to June 9. However when I arrived for check-in at PVG they refused to provide through check-in to CCU and said that I would have to collect my baggage at KMG and go for a fresh check-in. This was ridiculous since PVG is the home base of China Eastern and they can easily manage to put systems in place for through check-in for through bookings. But they refused and when I met the duty supervisor she told me to contact the check-in counter at KMG for immediate check-in. However as expected when I arrived at KMG at midnight none of their counters were open. I managed to locate the duty supervisor who refused to help out. I had to spend money and stay in a hotel. When I returned to the airport the next day around 6 pm again they refused to check me in until 9 pm.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,2,2,NA,NA,2,0

Aircraft was a A-330-200 which was quite new. Seats were good and the crew service also good. They were serving beverages and water throughout the 12 hour flight. The toilets were also being maintained by the crew. Two meals and a snack were served; which were reasonably OK. There was option of chicken-rice and beef-noodles for lunch but by the time they reached our seats (62) they ran out of the chicken. I had to wait some time and was given a vegetarian option instead.

These flights employ well-used A330s. Flights smooth and on time. However my economy seat was narrow and very poorly padded - little better than a city bus. The entertainment system was old and tired with a limited selection of movies. Flight attendants did the basics but disappeared for long periods. They did however keep the toilets very clean. Loading procedures were amateur and chaotic as if the ground staff were improvising. Individual staff were OK but as a group they lacked management. This unpleasantness was magnified by the loading at Beijing. For reasons unknown the SIN and YVR flights had to load using buses out to the tarmac (when gates at the main terminal were obviously available). This is not appropriate for a large plane at capacity. Beijing airport is a liability as a hub. It is very large dreary inefficient and immersed in a toxic smog. Moreover as a passenger in international transit I had to go through a passport check and then through the general security check. This gobbled up most of the 3 hours I had for my connection which I almost missed. Unacceptable. Avoid this place.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,2,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

Stated the only way to get to Hong Kong was to get on a flight on 09/28/13 or get on a flight to Shenzhen the follow day 09/24/13. Told the employee that our temporary visa was only good until 9/24/13. The employee then proceeded to rudely state that once we get to Shenzhen we were on our own to pay for the train into Hong Kong that the airline will not pay for. Told that we had to get out of the terminal and go to the booking counter to get our flight changed. We proceeded to head out but was stopped by another Air China employee that rudely said we cannot leave because we don't have a ticket to fly out. Finally was able to get my new ticket.

china-southern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-southern-airlines,China Southern Airlines customer review,G Chin,Australia,2015-01-14,MEL-CAN-LHR. Flight was delayed by a total of almost five hours due to a faulty emergency exit light - not what you need with an original departure time of 11.30pm. This information was only forthcoming when you actually asked the ground staff who seemed reluctant to publicise a technical fault. The airline asked for volunteers to fly a day later (with accommodation and meals provided) and boarding commenced very soon after they had found approximately 20. Apparently the light problem meant a reduced number of passengers could be carried. The volunteers were essentially tricked as at the time it was far from clear that boarding was imminent. We then sat on the plane for two hours whilst the volunteers' bags were unloaded and spent the flight to CAN wondering whether the LHR leg would be held for us. After landing we were quickly ushered through the CAN terminal handed a 100 Yuan note each as compensation for the delay and soon on board the Boeing 787 to LHR. The 787 passengers appeared to have been waiting on board for about two hours. Food beverages and seat comfort were reasonable and the aircraft near-new with slightly below-average IFE. The standard of staff English is much lower than comparable airlines but on the whole they do their best in terms of customer service. Overall not a terrible experience for the price (a quarter to a third lower than the competition) and we were probably unlucky with the technical fault.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,3,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

The B777 used on the CAN-TPE route is a pretty grubby plane.

Good points: 3 week old 737-800 with passably comfortable seats that reclined and had ample leg room. Food and drink provided for a flight just over an hour long although being a vegetarian the ham sandwich was not to my taste. Bags waiting on the carousel - beware the long walk that characterises modern Chinese airports. Bad points: Twice the price of the outbound flight though to be fair it was a peak time departure (1630). An hour late leaving with no explanation other than the incoming plane was delayed; probably weather related with the after effects of Typhoon Usagi creating havoc generally - the weather at Chengdu was particularly inclement - so why not say so? Failure to control carried-on luggage resulted in chaotic boarding the overhead lockers full with little more than half the passengers onboard - again beware if travelling in China pretty much anything and everything irrespective of size is brought into the cabin.

One must give themselves at least 2 hours between flights. Condor have limited gates and the size of FRA requires at least 2 hours for connection. On our return, I was injured a day prior to our flight and we contacted Condor to reschedule our flight and to request a wheel chair and was refused due to their rules for needing at least 7 days notice for any request changes. Flying business class and not having any customer service was astonishing. We had to contact the airport to arrange our own services. When we arrived at the gate in FRA, we were told business class was oversold and we were asked to fly another airline to get home. We asked if wee would be in business class and if we would have seats together and would our luggage be on the flight. The Condor representative assured us all would occur. When we arrived at the other airline, we did not have seats in business class, we did not have seats together, and our luggage was not in their system.

I was told that I couldn't sit in the emergency exit seats because I don't speak Mandarin but I did see plenty of what appeared to be native English speakers in the seats when the plane took off. I'm 6ft 3ins tall and on the Heathrow to Guangzhou leg my knees were up against the seat in front even before the person in front reclined his seat. Anyone over about 5ft 10 needs to ask for seats in rows 41-37 these seats have the same leg room as premium economy without the inflated price. Not much choice for English films and they didn't change on the way back despite the inflight magazine saying that they had. I agree with other people that the staff's level of English is poor this needs to be addressed if they are seeking to get a bigger share of the European market. That said I did have the lounge in China both ways which was great even though I was only flying economy.

After landing at Split and spending 1 hour on the ground we took off for what we thought was Dubrovnik. However after attempting to land the captain turned the flight around and proceeded to Zagreb (only one announcement and no information as to why). We landed at Zagreb at which point the captain and crew left the plane and the passengers with no information. We were given no food and only one glass of water during this entire ordeal. A new crew came on board about 30 min later and several passengers demanded to leave the flight. We finally took off for DBV and landed 7 hours behind schedule. I fully understand that weather issues/operational issues arise but to not give information to passengers and create a sense of panic with the passengers is completely unacceptable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,1,1,0,NA,NA,1,0

The seats on board had adequate legroom but a hard bar across the lower back made them rather uncomfortable. While the boarding passes had allocated seats in fact passengers could sit anywhere except in the front area which was for the international passengers (some young men not in uniform seemed to be security staff enforcing non-mixing of international and domestic passengers). For most of the flight the cabin lights were totally extinguished (it was an evening flight) and the personal reading lights didn't work. The cabin crew disappeared while the plane was in flight. No refreshments were served. On arrival the plane docked at the international terminal where as ensured by the security staff the passengers from Paris disembarked via an air bridge while we were bussed a long way to the domestic terminal and waited a long time for our luggage.

The women was very polite and understanding and booked me into a local hotel telling me that the next flight was at 12.35 the following afternoon. I arrived back at Schiphol the next day and whilst queuing to drop off my luggage I was informed that there was a 3 hour delay on this flight! I checked my luggage in and settled in for another 5 hours at the airport. At 12ish I happened to just check the departure board to see what the new expected departure time was only to see that the delayed 12.35 flight was no longer delayed and was boarding! There was no information stating this in-between. I then legged it to the departure gate and proceeded to stand on a shuttle bus for a further 20 mins whilst there was a delay in fuelling the plane.

Breakfast offered before arrival at PTY wasn't great. The seating for an international business class product is somewhat lacking more like US domestic first class seat pitch and width was good and certainly better than coach.

dragonair,/airline-reviews/dragonair,Dragonair customer review,M Walsh,United Kingdom,2014-11-20,9th Nov 2014 Flight KA692 Penang (0800 dep) to Hong Kong. Minus points: 1) In-flight entertainment appears to lack a bit in terms of content but I am comparing this to Malaysia Airlines' long-haul operations. Being a regional airline this may be perfectly acceptable. 2) Food unspectacular. Plus points: 1) Friendly and attentive crew. 2) In-flight entertainment user interface is excellent - touch-screen responsive and with a single-hole jack to use your own earphones. General notes: My first flight with this airline and a very last-minute booking. I wasn't sure what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised which I probably shouldn't have been given that this airline is 100% Cathay Pacific-owned and has been operating since 1985.

Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight â  wonderful.

Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation.

My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats.

The upgrade of the business cabin to business elite with lie flat beds was a great way to fully relax and get quality sleep.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,K Fraser,New Zealand,2014-08-03,LGW to INV. 1) 'Bag drop' and online check in a complete joke when you still have to join a mammoth snake like queue and basically 'check in' anyway! What's the point? 2) Those passengers who do pay extra to check in their hold baggage are only discriminated once on board. The new cabin baggage policy means most passengers take trolley bags on - fair enough. However those who don't and have a small bag or daypack are expected to forfeit their leg room so trolley bags go in the stowage bins. 3) Nice new clean aircraft attentive crew. Pity the magazines were stained torn pages missing and out of date. Basic service. If you can't be bothered replacing them please don't have them in the seat pocket. I gave up looking for the 'menu' because the magazines were filthy. 4) Sorry bring back full service airlines.

By booking early we got a very good deal for return flights to Corfu: in fact we would not have chosen Corfu but for the good flight prices. The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg.

The cabin crew were rude unapproachable non-existent and rude. They quietly moaned about the passengers within earshot and acted as if cabin baggage was an inconvenience (even for their frequent fliers - including us). As there was insufficient room in the overhead bins for others hand baggage they pushed them in front of the empty seats behind us; as this caused discomfort to myself I made the crew aware and they repositioned it.

Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on.

If it were not for easyJet we would not be able to afford so many foreign trips. Moreover we have always found easyJet staff efficient friendly and helpful. Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through ""manually"" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,J Wells,Ireland,2015-07-09,"Bangkok to Dubai, 4 July, EK373, A380 was as expected and as usual there was a good offering of inflight entertainment choices. The inflight service was some of the worst I have experienced and my expectations are pretty low! Nearly 2.5 hours until even a glass of water was offered. I would rather they ditched the hot towels and handed out a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight if they are incapable of providing a glass of water within a hour of take off. Crew were largely invisible and on the odd occasion one would scurry down the aisle avoiding all eye contact with passengers. The only visible crew member spent most the flight speaking to friends or family in row 45. All service requests in our section ignored and a number of other frustrated passengers mystified as to what was going on. Plane arrived on time but to a stand well away from the terminal.

egyptair,/airline-reviews/egyptair,Egyptair customer review,M Barker,Australia,2013-08-20,AMS-CAI-KUL. Departed on hour late but didn't mind as it cut the transit time down in CAI. 737-800 to CAI with older style seats. It is a dry airline so juice or water offered pre take off by crew who did not smile. They also give out hot towels which are so hot you can't actually touch them. No menus offered on either sector toilets not maintained on either sector. Food is well below the usual standard of most airlines but ok ex AMS only. On arrival in CAI a bus meets the aircraft and whisks Business Class away promptly and we were impressed. Once inside the terminal it was a mess. If in transit you must visit the transit check in desk which has long lines of people. We noticed there was a desk just for Business Class so went under the rope only to be yelled at by Egyptair staff. Security was a joke and did not put us at ease. Star Alliance lounge is tired and wifi not working at all. No alcohol in lounge. Toilets are disgusting. On the next sector service was just as poor with unhappy staff and no real flow to the service. Flight stops in BKK for an hour then goes on to KUL. Most people left Business in BKK but staff kept upgrading friends and family in flight which became distracting. Upgraded children running around the cabin and pushing past us. Manager was standing during take off and only just managed to strap himself in as we were climbing into the sky. The service and meals were of poor quality and reminded me of air travel 15+ years ago in Economy.

Check-in at CAI crowded but done professionally. On-time departure. Captain very good at communicating flight status and arrival information. Aircraft was quite new and well kept. Children's meals arrived before others and with suitable choices. Our meals ok but nothing special. Movie selection was a little disappointing compared to previous Emirates flights.

After waiting some time we along with two other people were told the lift had come and gone. The crew told us it had been recalled and would arrive shortly. It turned up about an hour later. It then went to another flight before depositing us at the terminal some Å¾ hours after arrival. At this point we should have been met by our tour representative who would have our visas. We found out the visas had been purchased for all our group of 39 but could not find the representative. After some time we purchased new visas and the wheelchair attendant set off at high speed for the plane which had been considerably delayed.

B747 seat pitch roomy enough for me but cabin and IFE looking tired but clean. Food passable edible with regular drink runs. My low sodium meals were served ahead. Inbound they had sandwiches and drinks at galley. ELAL flight crew a gem. Rest rooms were clean. It's passengers who were messing them up. I wish people would not grab seats in front when standing.

There were stains splattered across the seat next to me and trash piling up at the back of the plane in the attendantsâ area near the toilets. Clearly no-one cares about the aircraft cleanliness.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,G Burton,Australia,2015-05-25,EK435 Brisbane to Dubai A380. It was a full flight and I did not get the seat I requested however that is not unique to Emirates and the aisle seat I had 87H was ok its drawback was being knocked as people navigated the aisle. The noise from the flushing of the nearby toilets was annoying but after 14 hours and 20 minutes it takes very little to mildly annoy you. I received 3 adequate meals receiving a menu would have been nice and would have avoided much confusion and a protracted meal service as the dishes or lack of was explained to questioning passengers. Being seated at the back of the plane meant no choice of meal as they had run short of one of the options. The cabin crew from 19 countries speaking 17 different languages were young and seemed to lack any cohesion or team work. The meal services were seemingly the most unorganised I have seen but everybody ate in the end. The bar service was poor but that might be expected of this carrier but was available if you were prepared to go looking for it. The staff were not overly helpful and frequently served refreshment throughout the flight the cabin staff were commonly found in the galley areas chatting and seemed to lack some direction and co- ordination. The seat was adequate with better leg room than some carriers a foot rest would have been useful. The inseat TV screens and entertainment system were excellent. The onward flight was equally full - EK161 A330 with a similar review. This time a menu was provided and the bar did arrive in time with the meals. We were airborne without being offered any refreshment for almost 2 hours until the meal service commenced and again this was more disorganised and ad hoc than any other airline I have ever experience but again all were fed and watered. Towards the end of the 7 hour 40 minute flight the toilets were dirty the bins overflowing and toilet paper expended. These seats were less comfortable with less leg room and smaller TV screen. Overall and an average long haul experience slightly better than I expected. I would use again if the price point was enticing.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,5,NA,NA,3,1

I had forgotten how bad the Emirates 777 were the decision to have 4 across the middle makes the aircraft feel cramped and the one I used felt in need of a refit. The good selection of movies and TV can be let down with many faults only the left side audio worked in my seat after trying 3 different head sets I gave up and the seat next to me had to be rebooted several times before it would work. All other legs on A380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the IFE or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. I sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. Meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. As for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get I went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and I was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,3,NA,NA,4,0

One consideration which I was very pleased with is the fact that I am asthmatic and every time without exception I have ended up with a cold or infection. Not this time on all of the above flights.

I thought they had a reputation for excellent service but unfortunately in my experience this was not the case. A delayed departure and fog at Dubai meant a late arrival. The biz cabin was not very clean with a stained seat and debris in the drinks holders. The staff appeared disinterested and we were not offered a welcome drink. Thankfully the lie (almost) flat seat was comfortable and the cabin cool so got a decent sleep. The window blind wouldn't shut so woken by dawn over the desert not long before arrival although we were then stacked because of the fog. Huge comms failures at Dubai trying to get a rearranged flight to Colombo. The biz lounge staff couldn't help us so we joined a slow line at the help desk to be told to run to the gate as the new flight was boarding. When we got there the boarding flight was to China! We returned to the desk and also mentioned we had now economy tickets but had been booked in biz. They were unable to help although interestingly the 6 other members of our party had received new boarding passes issued in the biz lounge! Advised that we would get a downgrade voucher (not refund) at gate but the clerk could not do this and advised we would receive it in Colombo. I said this was not acceptable as we did not want to fly Emirates again. They could also not guarantee our re-entry into the biz lounge as the passes said economy! We just walked in anyway! The flight to Colombo was routed via Male lovely apart from the stop and 1.5hrs on the Tarmac meant I missed my pre-conference meeting. At least they left the IFE playing! My colleagues advised the biz cabin had lots of space from Male to Colombo but we were not offered to move. On arrival in Colombo there was no record of the downgrade voucher. On discussing this with the ground staff they said it would be available when I checked in for my return flight. Why do I not believe him? Why would I want a voucher when I will not fly with them again for this terrible service? Ironically my original connection was late leaving and as I only had hand baggage and can run I could easily have made it for that departure.

Fog at DXB extended delay to 3 hours including an abortive attempt at landing. Landed 03.15 exactly the time onward flight to SIN should have been taking off. That flight had closed so missed connection. Incredibly difficult to get rebooked. Long queues at transfer desk. Staff did not have ability to make re bookings directly but had to call their reservations department somewhere else in airport. Long long waits to get a response (half hour plus for each passenger) and no queuing system on their telephones. No offer to arrange hotels even though some passengers clearly becoming distressed at length of queuing time. To cap it all I later found that my connection was still on the ground when I arrived in DXB and did not leave for another 2 hours even though shown as flight closed i.e.they had allocated my paid for and checked in seat to someone else!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,1,0

The Manchester lounge was one of the best lounges I've ever used. The flight to DXB was the A380 - the business seats and service are very good. We never bothered with the bar at the back but it did look good. The business lounge at DXB was fairly gruesome to be honest. To crowded dirty and quite a let down after Manchester. The flight to CPT was a 777-300ER. The seats and facilities are not a patch on the A380 still much better than economy. The service was better probably due to the fewer business class passengers. The return flight was all 777-300ER on both legs. Again the seats weren't the best but the food and service on all the legs was generally very good. The chauffeur service was excellent.

Absolutely outstanding airline. The crew were immaculately turned out and very friendly. The plane was clean and the meals were delicious. The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface. One feature I liked was as your plane nears Dubai on the inflight entertainment screen you can see where your connecting flight gate/terminal is.

Three out of four sectors were fine: Excellent service and very clean and quiet aircraft. Big disappointment was in Business Class on the A380 due to one main factor: the fact that there is a fully serviced lounge bar area at the rear of Business Class. This sounds rather special until we realised that loud mouthed yobbos can stay in there for the entire journey (in this case Dubai to Hong Kong) and walking up and down the aisles with their drinks and abusing staff for not being fed lunch on time (even though they were all in the bar) and so on. I had to move further to the front of the aircraft to avoid the noise coming from this bar lounge area. This made for a very unpleasant experience and I could understand why some staff were very sad and quiet in going about their duties. Perhaps Emirates should seriously consider getting rid of this little so-called luxury as the concept seems to have backfired badly. The A380 flight was otherwise remarkably smooth partly due I suspect to the design of the aircraft but also the route take for this sector. Food and service on the remaining flights was superb but I could not recommend Business Class on the A380 for the problem of the bar-lounge section.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,B Walker,Singapore,2014-09-17,My wife and I live in Singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit family/friends. Emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. It is therefore with sadness that I have to complain about the in-flight service received on flight EK37 on 10th July which was the beginning of a tour of the UK. We have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. However on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chit-chat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. Throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an ever-growing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. Furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. During meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong âendâ. Consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other âendâ. This has somewhat clouded our view of Emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,1,2,2,NA,NA,2,0

It was my first time flying with Emirates so I was unsure what to expect. Everything was great! Great seats which recline enough to relax in economy. Enough TV shows and movies which kept me entertained and for my wife who prefers things in Arabic there was also subtitles on mostly everything for her. What we did do to make things a little easier was the first leg Paris to Dubai I purposely selected a flight with the 13 hour layover so we left France in the morning arrived Dubai around 8pm. Explored the shops visited the spa for a massage then stayed in the Airport Hotel over night for our connecting flight the next morning. It was the first time I had done it this way normally just allowing 2-3 hours wait between flights but then usually you are so tired on that second flight you sleep and in economy its not the most comfortable which ever airline you choose as you are not in a lie flat bed. So did that and left the follow morning for Dubai to Sydney. This was a long flight though entertainment system is fantastic. The food for me was nice though my wife did not like any of the hot food.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,2014-08-28,DXB-JFK on the A380. Boarding and departure was delayed by nearly an hour due to the late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seats were comfortable but worn out. No footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. Entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. The choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. However this was the only exceptional part of the flight. Flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. I've never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. I've had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the United States and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. Service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. It took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. Catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. Omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast? So basically it's a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. Also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. Only good part was the cool mood lighting. Overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but Emirates' customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,2,2,5,NA,NA,2,0

We still look forward to a decent experience on Emirates that I have read about here on airlinequality.com. Interestingly people I have recently spoken to have also shared negative experiences on Emirates - I guess we have just been unlucky. Inconsistency is clearly a problem. Some of our sectors were on Qantas and we found the service to be of a much higher standard on Qantas and they were also more family friendly than Emirates. Ultimately we don't have massive expectations in terms of service in economy on any airline but Emirates service was dismissive at times rude and you had to beg for basics like water. I travel on a variety of airlines for work and the Emirates service was similar to that of a very bad US airline. Anyway we arrived intact with all luggage accounted for so not all bad.

I was very impressed with the efficiency of meal service and taking up the trays when finished (some airlines leave you waiting for ages). On the other hand on the Sydney to Dubai leg the crew were very straight faced and wouldn't crack a smile. It was as if they had a timetable of stuff to do and any other communication was an inconvenience to them. A cabin crew member was very rude pushing by me as I was waiting for the bathroom and she did not excuse herself. I asked for a second wine when all meals and clean up etc. had eased off and was left 40 minutes waiting and had to search out the guy I asked. From Dubai to Dublin was the same experience minus the wine. Food was awful - stale rock hard croissant was included in the breakfast. On the way back I had trouble with my travel agent booking and the ground staff in Dublin were very kind and helpful. The Dublin to Dubai leg was very enjoyable - crew seemed happy and engaged with passengers and food was slightly better that my trip from Sydney to Dublin. I would recommend plunger coffee - Emirates serve instant. Each plane was very comfortable. I could stretch out - I am 5'7' and my partner is 6ft and a large build. We were very impressed with the comfort on both the a380 and the 777. Entertainment was my lifesaver.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,3,2,5,NA,NA,4,1
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-07-06,Flew on a round trip from Jakarta to Newcastle via Dubai. Once again I was not disappointed flying Emirates. The cabin crew are attentive and have an excellent attitude. The food and entertainment system are the best in the business. Previously queues at Dubai airport security checkpoint for transit passengers could be a nightmare but this has improved drastically with the introduction of a 'snake' queuing system. I was through security in less than 10 minutes while in transit. The only things that could be improved by Emirates are: 1) It could remove the 10-abreast seating arrangement in Economy class on its 777 fleet and switch to a standard 9-abreast arrangement as seats are currently too narrow. 2) A snackbox on the galley similar to that of the British Airways 'tuckbox' would be a useful addition.

When we arrived in Dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood queuing for about 6/7 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At around 12/12.30 so after nearly 6/7 hours (standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet) we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 (further 11 hours wait) we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside Dubai airport and although we waited so long Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. The food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunch/dinner we were told that they were all finish so We had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. Worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers. Definitely would not recommend also Airline refuses to compensate blaming natural causes when they had more than a day to prepare for all the delayed planes to arrive and the fog was only the day before for 2/3 hours.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,1,3,4,NA,NA,1,0

I have travelled to Dubai on many occasions (with BA KLM and Air France) and this was the best experience so far. The return (day time) flight was also excellent - again could not fault anything. Another fabulous FA - a young man this time - friendly and helpful. Ground staff in Dubai and Glasgow were courteous and helpful. One minor thing - if Emirates are serious about their commitment to Glasgow Airport they should establish their own lounge. This was the only downside of my experience - they do not have their own lounge in Glasgow - they have space in the ServisAir lounge which has to be one of the most soulless places I have encountered. Very limited choice of drinks no fresh foods at all (only packs of crisps!). Polar opposite is the lounge in Dubai - wonderful is the only word to describe it. It is large airy and offers free WiFi. Hot and cold meals and snacks available in abundance - and Moet and Chandon by the glass! Chauffeur driven cars were provided for both of us for the journeys to and from Glasgow airport (I was travelling from Edinburgh my daughter from Glasgow).

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,K Morris,New Zealand,2014-06-12,Flew Wellington - Sydney - Bangkok return. Having booked with Emirates legs were actually with Qantas (partner airline). This was made clear at booking. However Qantas schedule changed prior to flying which gave a very short connection in Sydney then the Wellington-Sydney plane was late but Qantas air hostess rang through and arranged for a buggy to meet me at the terminal and fast-track me to the gate for the Emirates flight. They closed the gate immediately after I arrived for my flight which I appreciated. However I was seated at the very back of my flight and knowing my predicament no effort was made to help me off the plane first to make my connection. I arrived in Bangkok to discover that though I had made the connection my bag had not and would not come for another 17 hours. The Emirates staff person at Bangkok informed me off this but gave no apology. They promised to deliver the bag to me but as I was two hours out of Bangkok and in a rural area my host had little confidence that a courier would actually make the delivery so we decided to come back to the airport ourselves to collect the bag. Effectively I lost a day and extra money for taxis etc and have still had no apology from the airline.

Flawless crew and aircraft all on a very well priced ticket. But the food standards have dropped dramatically or should I say the product has somewhat become much cheaper and basic. This is a pity.

I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,4,NA,NA,4,0

Until my most recent flights I also found their service and food to be among the best. However on my recent flights from HKG to DXB and DXB to Dublin I found both the food and service to be awful. Their switch to serving food in J class on open plates is a disaster. The food ends up lukewarm and dry. I much preferred the sealed container. The food was bland and tasteless. The cabin attendants on both sectors were pretty indifferent. On the second sector service was particularly clueless with wrong orders and lack of apology. I might just look for other options next time I fly. One thing also to bear in mind if you can avoid it - the HKG-DXB route flies over Bay of Bengal. Turbulence here as on my flight can be fairly rough during monsoon season. Also for some reason we had to be bussed to the gate when we reached DXB. The ground journey took 20 minutes. The place where we were dropped off happened to be the confluence between T1 and T3 and as a result a lot of transit passengers headed off in the wrong direction. A frustrating mistake to make at midnight when you are already tired.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,4,5,1,1,5,NA,NA,3,0

Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,J Wood,United Kingdom,2014-01-28,I have flown with Emirates on 8 occasions (Economy) and the flight from Dubai to Gatwick on December 29th 2013 will be the last I have given the airline the benefit of doubt for too long already. Their prices are sky high and the service on board is chaotic. The staff are friendly enough but uncoordinated. The last 3 times they ran out of the meal I would have preferred. Flying out to Dubai this Christmas it was 3.5 hours into the flight before we received a meal at all and it was cold. On yet another flight they forgot to serve regular meals (those not pre-booked) to the whole block of seats from the rearward bulkhead onward. On a new A380 a couple of years ago I flew to Dubai from Heathrow with part of the ceiling flapping about above my head. On 2 occasions the ICE entertainment system was faulty. My main complaint though is with the poor cabin service.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,4,NA,NA,2,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,J Springthorpe,United Kingdom,2014-01-23,BKK-DXB Jan 2014. Bangkok Emirates lounge ancient tiny and poorly laid out. Food and beverage choice was however very good. Boarding gate minutes+ from lounge. A380 upper deck boarding via air bridge. Very friendly and welcoming crew they seem to love the A380 and explaining its features to passengers actively inviting you to come for a drink in the lounge bar. Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar. Massive screen but I remain un-impressed with the range of films and TV programmes on offer. Red eye service cabin lights nice and dim throughout the flight. Full dining service offered despite the 1am departure time with a breakfast served before arrival. Skipped the meal had drinks and canapÃ©s at the bar. Nice feature of the Emirates A380 but bar seems to have little space for stock and they constantly run out of things and the poor crew are backwards and forwards from the galley constantly. Lie flat bed was extremely comfortable more so than the 777-300ER beds and combined with the seat liner and nice blankets it was brilliant. Best sleep ever on long haul. Breakfast prior to arrival was decisively average yet again tried the cold cuts and cheese as had enough of the hot offerings and the meat was off poor quality with tasteless cheese.

Dubai lounge again was very satisfactory stunning array of food and beverages on offer and very busy for all the early morning wave. Boarding on time and direct to aircraft from lounge via a lift. Upper deck boarding via air bridge. Crew friendly and welcoming on the whole some perhaps just business friendly. Menu for flight looks far more enticing than previous sectors. Extremely friendly and efficient steward from Dubai himself was looking after me. Very attentive throughout. Seat again is fantastic but this time a LH window seat with minibar to the window and seat more to the aisle - does not feel as private. Under window stowage is also hard to access. Variety of appetisers and sweets at the bar was great on this sector and the Manchester born girl manning the bar was chatty and genuine. Skipped breakfast and snacked at the bar on and off. Dinner service before arriving in Manchester was lovely Nice soup Beef Steak and a Cheese board to finish. Best meal in 4 flights so far and probably the nicest crew . Overall impression of Emirates after a 4 leg trip aircraft well kept A380 stands out 777-300 are getting overhauled crew attentive and professional and immaculately turned out.

Both times a salad with lettuce and tomato no dressing and fish in biz class was actually burnt so bad to was like plastic. I asked for an alternative and they had Biriyani.

There was a ground staff assigned to help us when we landed in Abu Dhabi from Kuala Lumpur.  He simply pushed my wheelchair bound family member as if it was a 100m sprint. Later we had to line up to cross security check, however he led us to cut the line which the security officer was not agreeable to and everything was such a mess and the experience was so unpleasant.

I had to ask for a drink of water once as they did not regularly come around and I felt like it was an imposition. Some of the crew seemed unfriendly and cold and it didn't make you want to use that airline again. We missed our connecting night flight due to a delay and the next day Etihad didn't put my name on the passenger list for the next leg home only my husband which wasn't ideal and took a long time to sort out leaving us to rush to get on the plane without breakfast or anything.

The food on the Etihad flights is ok but there never seems to be anything other than curry! Even for breakfast there was curried chicken and the sandwich snack was the same! I didn't bother to eat because of this. The choice of entertainment was also very poor.

Not really any in-flight entertainment. You can listen to music and watch a film from TV screens. Otherwise a good and comfortable flight. On the flight back were waiting to fly with the brand new B787 Dreamliner but to our disappointment it was a old B757-200. Luckily it was only half full and we could take a row of three seats to ourselves! Excellent and friendly service on board! After takeoff we were served a drink and a muffin and a couple of hours later a lunch. The staff kept serving drinks all through the flight! Nice day flight from Addis Ababa to Frankfurt.

Overall the Etihad experience was just OK. We found the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the 777-300ER to be cramped and not particularly comfortable especially if the person in front put his or her seat back. The AUH to SYD leg was on a A340 which didn't feel as cramped (2-4-2) although I found the seat to be harder. Meals were average and of standard fayre but my wife found all of her pre-ordered vegetarian options to be very poor. The IFE was acceptable. Cabin staff were OK but nothing special.

etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,F Weeren,Oman,2014-09-17,"Flew (August 24) MCT-AUH-GVA. A320 plane supplied for the MCT-AUH flight was tired filthy and should not be in service without a complete cabin redecoration. Seats were stained carpets filthy and the seat pitch was best designed for circus midgets. We were delayed 30 minutes at MCT with absolutely no explanation in English perhaps one was given in Arabic. In AUH I hurried to my next gate for the AUH-GVA leg of the journey I made the plane which pleased me. The A330 was noticeably cleaner although the seat pitch was still better designed for research monkeys than human beings. After being rushed on board we sat for quite a while until someone from the flight deck finally explained that there had been an oil spill on the airport and that we would be sitting another two hours at the gate until the runway was open again. Being a sound and reasonable man I understood why passengers could not be let off the aircraft again. Water and paper ""hot towels"" were their only attempt at service in 150 minutes? Their first step should have been prompt announcements in both Arabic and English explaining what was happening then informing us that we would be served beverages and that the inflight entertainment system would be turned on. Food served was a joke on this flight - first a snack (late night flight) consisting of awful sandwich rollups with the advice that we would have a ""full breakfast"" an hour before landing in GVA. The full breakfast was tired and ridiculous - nothing approaching a full breakfast anywhere. Upon arrival at GVA I was one of about a half dozen passengers whose baggage hadn't ""made the flight"" despite 150 minutes extra time at the gate. It took three days to get my bag to me. Now let's turn to the return trip flown two days ago from ZRH-AUH-MCT. In ZRH we were boarded promptly and the aircraft another A330 was cleaner than the A330 from AUH-GVA. That sort of tells me that you need to better supervise or replace your cleaning staff at AUH your home airport. The flight was not full so there was room to spread out which many passengers did immediately after ""boarding completed"" was announced. We pushed back with Swiss precision on the dot. Food served was delicious plentiful catered by Swissport/LSG. In AUH I made my way to my departure gate in another Terminal weaving through what have got to be some of the longest walks in any airport anywhere. Luckily here and there were moving sidewalks although these were usually clogged so I was actually worried I would miss my connection in the relatively short transfer time allotted by Etihad of only 70 minutes between flights. I needn't have been worried. After reaching the gate it was again a story of sit sit sit. No explanation. No communication from the airline. Suddenly almost an hour late we were rushed onto the bus to the aircraft. The air conditioning was not on. After 10 minutes of waiting there was a terrific lurch and air conditioning came on. On the (same) plane familiar conditions - filthy tired upholstery dirty carpets ridiculous seat pitch. And again we sat. This time however the captain communicated with us in excellent English. He didn't provide any explanation for the delay but at least gave us accurate estimates of when we would actually take off. And he apologized which surely must have been regarded as unusual by the crew as they seemed shocked when he did so. The only silver lining in this very cloudy tale? This time the delay must have been enough time for my luggage to make the flight.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,2,2,NA,NA,3,0

Check in at Manchester was seem less. Etihad lounge at Manchester is first class with very attentive staff. Etihad business class seat is a little bit narrow and anyone over 6 foot won't be able to lie flat. All seats have direct access to the aisles. If you want privacy I recommend the window seats. The paired seats are very intimate. Food and beverages very satisfactory as too was the service from the cabin crew. Very basic amenity kit was given. Changing terminals in Abu Dhabi was chaotic.

etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,M Horsfield,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,My wife and I flew in Business from LHR to BKK via AUH on EY18 and EY408 on 16th/17th October. Business Saver fare was an absolute bargain. We booked the limo service from Suffolk to LHR and this arrived on time and dropped us outside T4 for an additional charge of just Â£20 since our home was just outside the 100 mile trip limit. Quick check-in having pre-booked our seats and apart from the pretty useless Fastrack courtesy of Heathrow's disinterested staff we were in the lounge shortly thereafter. As lounges go it was fine - quiet comfortable and good service. Boarded 15 mins before departure with no delay and the gate was conveniently opposite the lounge. Jacket taken and champagne provided. Settled into comfortable seat in the Airbus 340 the excellent cabin staff explained the menu and took orders alongside after take-off drink requests. Flight took off on time and the rest of the inflight service was outstanding. The freshly made steak sandwich as a snack from the kitchen was as good a snack as I have had on any airline. Arrived into AUH on time but we had gated at the old terminal and had to transfer to the new one for our flight to Bangkok. Business lounge was very busy so we went in the First Class lounge and had a shower. Boarded EY408 on time and had a trouble free flight to BKK in a 777 this time but pretty similar set-up. Steak sandwiches just as good. Arrive BKK slightly ahead of schedule and given card to use its Premium lane so was cleared of immigration and collecting bags of carousel in quick time. Return leg was exactly the same with excellent service throughout and punctual arrival into LHR. My only gripe? The complimentary chauffeur. I initially booked one for arrival in BKK to our hotel but never got confirmation and when I tried to it seemed their was some confusion as to eligibility (2 journeys per adult passenger). Since it is hardly an expensive taxi from the airport to downtown Bangkok I cancelled it to make sure that we had the return from LHR to home but given the confusion wanted to make sure this was understood. I had to call Etihad in AUH in the end and it took ages and then started getting calls from the limo company in Bangkok advising what time they would be collecting us! When we arrived back at LHR they had organised a car for me and a car for my wife! We declined and continued our journey together. Seems like the system on these could be improved but it did not detract from the superb service.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Only 4 check in counter open for Etihad flights at AUH airport terminal 3. Boarding chaotic with no sequence. Plane well maintained and clean. EY's biggest problem is their poor seat pitch and hard seats. This was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have had in a long time. Lots of kids on board parents had to wait for a long time to get their bassinets set up bottles warmed up etc. Then some time ago with big fanfare announced ""dedicated inflight nanny"" could not be seen anywhere.

etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,Brian Fisher,United Kingdom,2014-01-03,All four legs were in business class taken during November 2013. The boarding process following a restful hour or so in the Airline's dedicated lounge at Heathrow was smooth efficient stress less and punctual. Aircraft (a Boeing 777-300) was as expected clean and in pristine condition. Although the seats in this cabin class were somewhat narrower than many other major carriers they were well appointed and functional as was the in-flight entertainment system. Food was of a high standard and served with a smile. My few requests (via the button) were answered promptly and I did not feel that they were in any way considered to be a nuisance. Arrival at Abu Dhabi and transfer to the next flight was seamless and I was soon on board. Cabin attendants were as professional as had been on the first leg as was the food. My in-built clock nudged me to operate buttons and turn my seat into a bed. It was time for some sleep. This was when the narrowness of the seat became more noticeable a pity really as a couple more inches would have given much more comfort. Following my tourâof Vietnamese culture and cuisine I returned to Bangkok - placed the top layer on and prepared for my return to London. This time after check-in I was directed to the airport's Apricot Lounge prior to boarding. Although quite a peaceful refuge its facilities fell far short of the Airline's own lounges. As expected the journey times against the prevailing jet streams were much longer but they were offset to some degree by the good service and ambience of the aircraft's business class cabin. Overall my experience of Etihad Airline certainly falls into the to the 'Very Good' category and if I had to give it marks out of ten it would score a solid nine.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,4,5,5,5,NA,NA,4,1

Etihad's economy product is inferior to that of Emirates. Seats small and uncomfortable. IFE not as good. Food however is excellent. Three choice of entrees and the option I chose was very well prepared though a little stingy in portions. FAs pour alcoholic beverages from large bottles in tiny amounts. Wine selection was poor even for economy and their wine bottles were empty by the time they came to me. On the whole however the FAs on the first sector were gems. They provided service from the heart with genuine smiles. But they were horribly inefficient. It took them 4 hours from take off to finish dinner service and turn the lights down. And this was on a 6 hours night flight. An hour before landing they served breakfast wraps (much appreciated) which Emirates does not on similar flights to Dubai. Economy FAs on the flight to Dhaka were functional. Migrant workers from Bangladesh needed to be transported and fed and that is all the FAs achieved. No smiley engagements as in the first segment.

Both planes were good and clean and with seats being fully flat beds were restful and spacious. The IFE was good on both planes and we were permitted to use the IFE until we had landed. The airport in Abu Dhabi was undergoing extension/renovation and a bus was used to transport passengers to the terminal. The lateness in arrival meant that the plane was about to board so it was not possible to eat in the lounge and then only sleep on the second flight.

The booking process is confusing and unclear there is a constant feeling you're trying to be tricked into paying for things you don't want. Online check in did not work and seems to be a common recurring problem going by other reviews here I fly with only hand baggage for these short hops so I can arrive later at the airport and walk through without having to queue at a desk - this defeats the point of this if I have to check-in the old-fashioned way. Of course I didn't get a window seat because they had been taken and I didn't want to pay the obscene charge to pre-select. They chose Stansted for this route - this airport is decrepit and dark security is overcrowded and a mess with poor management of queues. Moving on to boarding - the misinformation flyBe give which adds to passengers frustration - we were told we had to be at the gate 45 minutes before the flight this is excessive and pointless. Arriving at the gate the board said it was open - it wasn't with no one about. Then it said they were boarding again it wasn't. Then finally 15 minutes before the depart time said gate was closed - we haven't even boarded. We didn't board until the scheduled depart time. Boarding was on foot in the rain with no bus or sheltered path. Upon boarding it was clear the Dash 8 Q400 aircraft had seen better days cabin looked very tatty and tired and a lot of passengers didn't seem to be aware of the size limitations for cabin baggage boarding took significantly longer than it should have.

Cabin Service Manager was friendly but her colleague was surly and stroppy. FlyBe like to pretend they are above the low-cost carriers such as easyJet but they are anything but and this is very poor replacement for the easyJet's flight from/to Gatwick that were ended at the end of March - not only with the odd flight times and use of Stansted but also because of the poor quality of their short-haul product.

flybe,/airline-reviews/flybe,Flybe customer review,M Roberts,United Kingdom,2015-03-30,A few years ago I used to fly with FlyBe quite regularly on the Aberdeen - Birmingham route but changed carrier after prolonged delays became the standard practice. I have recently been forced to use them on a couple of routes where there was no reasonable alternative. However it appears that the standard practice of delays of several hours is still prevalent. I am a very regular airline passenger and have flown on various airlines around the world and have never experienced such consistently bad service from any competitor. Avoid using FlyBe at all costs. For journeys not requiring you to cross a body of water walking might actually be quicker. Terrible service.

Approached this flight with some trepidation after reading a lot of negative reviews on this product. Well it's definitely not Emirates but it also was not a bad experience for me. The connecting flight from Amsterdam was fine. A tiny curtained off Business section with economy seating with middle seats left vacant. A pleasant dinner good Champagne and on time. From Helsinki to Singapore was one of the old A340s (OH-LQA in this case). First impressions were favourable with the cabin being spacious and clean. We had pre flight drinks and a snack and left on time. Once seated I tried the seat out and it's more of a recliner but seemed ok. Menus drinks and dinner all happened smoothly and quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed my supper. It's a bit of a no frills offering but enjoyable and had nice wines also. IFE is poor. The screens are tiny and the offering is limited and old. Didn't really matter as I wanted to sleep as much as possible and despite the seat being at quite an angle I managed a few good hours. Breakfast was simple but tasty. So overall the experience was a good one - on time fed and slept well. If you want the deluxe business experience it's not this but as a lower priced business option that keeps me out of economy it does the job admirably.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,5,4,2,NA,NA,5,1

I was recommended the airline by an agent who described them as an 'up and coming' airline. Price was the attraction so I went with it. Having read the reviews I was somewhat apprehensive but in general it was okay. Let's take the positives - flight times suited us as we did not suffer jet lag on either journey even though sleep was difficult. Crew were efficient and flights were all on time or early. Total flight time is as good as it gets for this journey. Now the negatives - planes are old and tired the Airbus on the return flight even had ash trays. The breakfasts are inedible and the rest of the food is average to poor. Economy leg room is minimal for a 12 hour flight you certainly don't want to get next to anyone in the XL size range.

Finnair uses an old leased Air France Aircraft on these Routes and they have not been updated or refurbished for years. The seats are old and worn and certainly could use a bit of TLC. On the outward flight the inflight entertainment system in my seat was not working and the lights in Business Class could not be switched off during the night. Space is good but if in stretched out setting you tend to slide down the Seat. Cabin Service on all Flights was excellent but Cabin Crew were quite frustrated with the problems associated with those ageing aircraft's. The New Menu's advertised on Finnair websites was not offered on these Flights.

AY uses their A340-300 on the HKG route and was lucky to get OH-LQC (year 2007) on the HKG-HEL leg with their latest greyish interior and newest IFE. Some operational problems at HKG Airport: the plane was taken to gate at midnight just 20 mins before departure and finally took off 2 hours late due to heavy traffic but arrival at Helsinki Airport only 30 mins late. Was lucky to get two seats on the last row for myself on this full flight but the IFE didn't work on either seat so slept all the way. Two hot meals served on this 10 hr flight: two meal choices at night but only one option for breakfast - hot meals quite small but otherwise OK. Leg room and seat comfort was good enough for a 7-hour sleep. Cabin crew professional and friendly (a mix of Finnish and Asian cabin crew) and the flight pleasant in general but cost cutting is visible in many areas which quite frankly puts Finnair way behind MH or CX.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

Lounge at Helsinki was fairly quiet but this obviously depends on the time of day. On HEL-SIN sector we had seats 6 A and C bulkhead in the A340. We got some rest but the seat is not conducive to sleep. Why on earth any airline serves a meal at midnight defeats me so we declined and tried to get some sleep. On arrival at SIN we had use of Qantas lounge for our ongoing flight with BA codeshare. Overall the flight and lounges for the outgoing sector were fine. The return was awful: Finnair uses Plaza Premium lounge at HK which is poorly equipped uncomfortable old seating and it's a very long walk to the gates. No announcements were made (and we were told this) but the only flight screen info is one which scrolls through the next 24 hrs flights. With no help from the lounge staff we decided to make our way to the gate about 45 mins before departure: a good thing we did since the flight was not showing as boarding as we left the lounge but the extremely long walk to the gate meant that we were some of the last to board. Although the flight was scheduled to be on an A330 with flat bed seats it was an old 340 and sleep was difficult. Staff are pleasant but not particularly proactive.

On all but the last occasion the flight was fine on time and worked well albeit with one aborted approach and a pre advised divert risk. I am aware that FLR is a very marginal airfield due to its Omni directional runway and short length. Sadly most issues that surround flights to and from FLr are due to these issues and organisational challenges at the airport. However the options Flybe take/are given for diverts differ from other airlines drastically. Both BLQ and PSA are the primary divert fields and both are relatively ""open"" in terms of capacity to take the few flights that divert out of FLR. My last experience had me sat on a bus for 4.5 hrs transferring to Milan Malpensa 21/7. This is crazy today my wife and Children are faced with the same challenge. Very poor planning and to always blame the airfield when other carries can and do operate is very poor accept that the E190LR is at the extent of its performance limitations the E175 you have would provide a much greater approval rating as it would achieve its destination far more frequently that the 190 does in my opinion.

Haven't flown with them for 4 years because competitors have been cheaper on long haul. Flights packed to the last seat but both flights on time two hot meals served on this 11-12 hr flight pleasant and adequate service by a Finnish-Chinese-Malay cabin crew and the IFE worked well on both flights. However there is room for improvement on this 4-star airline: Meals from Helsinki Airport flight kitchen are bland and cheap quite the opposite on the SIN-HEL leg with tasty chicken or beef plus a proper hot breakfast IFE is too limited. A wider range of newer films are needed. No overnight pack (socks etc) which is a standard on many airlines. The price was right this time and we felt it was good value. Moreover their new uniforms are quite classy.

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,A Young,United States,2015-05-13,I took Frontier from LAX to DEN to DWT. In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels. Overall I had a good flight both ways and would recommend Frontier based on this experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,0,5,NA,NA,4,1

Nice and cool pale blue layout which was spotlessly clean. I found the seating very comfortable with ample leg room and didn't feel closed in when the pax in front reclined. Cabin crew were not overly chatty but professional and attentive constantly offering water and keeping the toilets clean. Entertainment worked well but found the choices a bit limited.

The food was basic nothing to look forward to very salty. I will take this flight again as the comfort Finnair provides over others is far better plus it's a daylight flight to Europe. Transit in Helsinki was 1 hr 55 and I was pushing to make my next flight. Helsinki-Berlin 737 aircraft looked a bit tired inside and seating was cramped.

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,D Petersen,United States,2015-02-24,This was my first trip with Frontier. We flew from Cleveland to Las Vegas return. I opted for the stretch seats. The flight was delayed slightly on the outbound leg but this was communicated to us before we arrived at the airport. It was really not a problem. The ground staff were friendly and efficient. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The stretch seats were worth every cent of the small supplement payable ($25 per person per leg of the flight). The aircraft was a modern Airbus A320 which was clean and comfortable. The return leg was exactly like the outbound. I will not be giving five stars however. Upon arrival at Cleveland 5.45 am we were directed to a piece of taxiway until a stand could be found for us. The delay amounted to 45 minutes. That is unacceptable at that time of the morning and Frontier and Hopkins need to address it.

garuda-indonesia,/airline-reviews/garuda-indonesia,Garuda Indonesia customer review,A Ahmed,United Kingdom,2015-05-10,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product.

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,R Carter,United States,2013-12-21,On October 24 2013 my sister and I began a long-awaited vacation with flights from SLC to Denver and one from Denver to Fort Lauderdale. SLC to Denver leg of the journey went without a hitch. We were not questioned about our carry-on bags or our purses. When we went to board our flight in Denver we were rudely told we could not take our carry-on bags because they were too large and would have to pay an exorbitant charge for it ($100). The Customer Service person told us to go to a kiosk several gates away and pay for our bag knowing full well that if we did so we would miss our flight. We were forced to pay the charge of $100 per bag. I observed at least 15 people on the flight that had bags two and three times larger than the size of my bag. We were then put into seats that had the least amount of leg room that I have come across. When we finally got to Fort Lauderdale out of curiosity I tried the pre-formed compartments that several airlines had in front of their check in gates. My bag fit easily into each of them with room to spare. At least we were finally able to go on our vacation no thanks to Frontier. On November 4 the trouble started again. When we checked in at Fort Lauderdale we were told that the flight was delayed by one hour because of mechanical problems. That delay would mean that we would miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. They said they would get us on a partner airline. A gate agent had put us on an American Airlines afternoon flight. When we tried to check in at American Airlines we were told that the gate agent had not called and confirmed us. Fortunately for us American was kind enough to work with us and find us a late flight to Dallas that then connected on to Salt Lake.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,C Thompson,United States,2013-10-20,The customer service on Frontier is lacking. On a recent trip from Chicago to Denver changing planes then Denver to SLC I was frustrated by the lack of compassion by the Frontier staff. My daughter has MS and uses forearm crutches. Because we booked on a third party site the attendant assigned us a seat on the back row of the plane. It was very difficult for my daughter to navigate her way to the back of the plane. From Denver to SLC I asked the gate attendant if my daughter could please get a seat with more leg room closer to the front of the plane. He said they had a seat with more leg room on row 2 however it would cost an additional $15 for each of the three seats we needed. I did not think someone who is disabled should have to pay to be accommodated. While we were waiting to board the plane he announced several times that there was seating with additional leg room available for $5 or $15 depending on your type of ticket. In the end the seats with additional legroom were empty and my daughter had to go to the back row of the plane. Another frustration was we had to pay $85 to check our baggage because our third party ticket did not allow for carry-on luggage. Then there was the tackiness of having to pay for a soft drink and snacks again because we purchased our ticket through a third party. If you're going to treat customers poorly because they booked their ticket through a third party then don't offer tickets through third parties like Jet Blue does. All of their nickel and dime policies make me want to spend my dollars traveling with another airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,1,2,2,NA,NA,4,0

There is no bag drop so even if you've checked in online you're still going have to join the regular queue. Having checked in on line and eventually dropped our bags my wife and I were sitting in our allocated seats onboard - 10E and F when another passenger appeared with a boarding pass for seat 10F. After a few minutes a stewardess arrived with a computer printout showing us in seats 15A and B. Since these weren't extra leg-room seats for which we'd paid we flatly refused to move. Eventually the stewardess backed down and the other passenger was seated elsewhere. The flight itself was fine and the 'Happy Picnic' was tasty and good value. Travelling on from CGN to MUC a few days later we checked in by machine at the airport and dropped our luggage at the fast bag drop which really was fast. The whole process lasted under 5 mins.

What's with the bland chicken and rice dishes on all lunch and dinner flights? The free F+B offering on SFO-HNL breakfast run consists of 4 grapes 4 slices of melon a piece of cheese and 2 packs of crackers? HA should charge a couple of bucks more and get serious with their offerings or drop the pretence of food completely and charge for a decent offering. The 'complimentary IFE' is a joke in content despite the new A330 planes even the pay per view movies (US$7.99 a pop) were exceedingly limited in choice. The HA terminal in HNL and terminal in LIH are in a time warp but suspect this to be the fault of the airport authorities (and TSA is certainly outside HA's control). Like I said all's not lost this airline certainly is no 4/5 star airline but it could be halfway decent with a few weeks. For the price paid not really good value.

While this was only a 2.5-hour flight full IFE was available when I flew with HKA on the even shorter route to and from Shanghai in 2012. Beverage selection was good but food consisted only of a bun wrapped around some meat on both flights. Perhaps HKA expected its passengers to have eaten right before boarding? What HKA could do right before boarding is to board passengers by row number so that they won't have to form a long queue well before boarding begins and get in each other's way inside the plane. For short flights (three hours or less) I'd recommend HKA but mainly because of price.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

Flight was packed and seats carpets and other parts of the overhead cabin were falling apart. BAH to LHR was on a similar aircraft but a shade better. Crew generally pleasant and made up for the shabby aircraft. Transit in BAH is tedious with the security checks even upon arrival before proceeding to transfer desk with no consideration to short transits. Return on LHR to BAH was stated A332 but my worst enemy appeared the A340 - same aircraft then took me to KUL eventually. Crew again very pleasant and friendly food alright but Gulf Air needs to really buck up on their aircraft renewal refurbishing or upgrading at least.

On the flight to BAH (daytime) I found that the hot meal was not good (tasteless) and IFE is really outdated with a very limited choice and no information regarding the hours when the film begins. Not confortable but what you expect from Economy. On the way back (at a terrible time 1.30 am) the weaknesses of the old planes are even more obvious. The economy seat seems to have no more foam left on the back mine could not recline the IFE of my colleague was broken (we were on a front seat so it was the folding type) and would not held in position. I was unable to sleep at all but those who were had the pleasure of being waken up by the crew 2.25 hours before landing to serve breakfast!

horizon-air,/airline-reviews/horizon-air,Horizon Air customer review,P Jenkins,United States,2010-05-25,I've flown with them 70 maybe 80 times in the last two years--mostly commute trips from Seattle to Spokane and occasionally over to Montana. A few things about the Q400: This is not an old or aged aircraft. They are extremely fuel efficient compared to jet aircraft. They can cover shorter legs in approximately the same time as regional or larger jets. They tend to be a bit noisy on the inside particularly between rows 6 and 10 which are nearest the engines. Most of the examples in Horizon's fleet are less than five years old. I like the fact the Q400 can be boarded and deplaned from both front and rear making both processes faster than larger aircraft. I agree that this is not an airplane that you would probably want to spend more than about 90 minutes on at a time. I greatly prefer the Q400 to the Bombardier regional jets also flown by Horizon. Horizon's flight attendants are the best. Boarding in Seattle Spokane and Portland is frequently a bit trying. Delays on Horizon are just like any other carrier.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

The maintenance is obviously poor as I was not the only one with this problem. IFE is not to today's standard (limited choice of films and language and you have to wait for the film to begin without knowing when it will).

Nothing was as atrocious as this recent Iberia flight. Checked in online my careful choice of seat was ignored at Guatemala City airport and I ended up exactly where I wished to avoid being - in the middle of a four seat row. On the short hop to San Salvador all the lights - secondary lighting exit signs included went out leaving the cabin in total darkness for two or three minutes which was a tad alarming. No apology or explanation given. No seat back screens only a large screen at the front of the cabin which was obscured by heads in the rows forward of me making both the security demonstration and any entertainment offered only partially visible. Overnight the cabin crew could not be found to bring water for the necessary taking of pills. To cap it all my bag did not make the transfer to my ongoing flight MAD-LHR.

I flew to Portland to visit friends with a 4 day stopover on the way back in Iceland which is included at no extra cost. I think I agree with the review by M Brown on the 20th March, people are being are rather unfair particularly with regards to the catering situation on Icelandair - they are very clear on what the product being offered here is and there is opportunity once booked to add food from the regular menu at a discount before flying and this is served to you before the main food service begins. I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained. Outbound from Gatwick the plane was a bit older and had no IFE, but this was ok for the short flight to ReykjavÃ­k and I was notified 24hrs prior to departure of this via text. On the long-haul sector from KeflavÃ­k to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so! Flying back to ReykjavÃ­k was pleasant with blankets and cushions provided for this overnight sector and IFE was newer and the the best of all the sectors with a clear picture. My return to London a few days later was also fine with everything on schedule and generally pleasant. One thing that didn't work on any sector was mobile boarding passes - this didn't work on a single sector for me, but I easily received a paper version in most cases.

My son and I had booked Icelandair Seattle-KEF-Munich and then return was Paris-KEF- SEA. (And my daughter was travelling on a slightly different itinerary out of Indiana through KEF). We got caught up in the strike in May so ended up on Lufthansa into Munich which was great. The rebooking was smooth as could be with my choice of Delta or Lufthansa arriving at about the same time as the Icelandair flight would have arrived. Weird that I was notified of the cancellation via email though. My daughter who was supposed to meet us at KEF (coming Delta from South Bend to Minneapolis then Icelandair) had no cancelled flights but still ended up coming into Munich several hours late due to airline delays. On the day of our return flights out of Charles De Gaulle we arrived at the airport at 10.45 for a 2.10pm flight. Imagine our surprise to see 100 people already in line ahead of us at the ticket counter! The ticket agents didn't show up until at least 11.30 and then spent another 15 minutes piddling around until they finally starting checking people in. We finally got our luggage checked and boarding passes at 1:00pm. Two hours standing in line just to check in! Since we had expected to have ample time to check in and then find somewhere to sit and eat at the airport we had arrived with empty stomachs were not happy at waiting so long in line especially knowing the food situation on the Icelandair flight itself. Boarding was basically Saga then Economy Comfort then free for all. At KEF they were boarding SEA right next to a Boston flight so the gate was very crowded with everyone standing in line. That said our actual flight was fine. We had pillows on the second leg of the trip and the flights attendants were very nice on both legs. Our KEF-SEA flight had many middle seats open and our in-flight entertainment systems worked fine although selections were somewhat limited. No problem for us as we had brought Kindles and iPads. By the way my daughter's flight out of KEF was delayed 30 minutes which meant she missed her Delta connection in Minneapolis to her final destination of South Bend Indiana and which forced her to wait for the next flight out at 1pm the next day.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Boarding procedure seemed a bit haphazard and gate area became crowded but eventually everyone boarded the plane. Gate staff friendly as were flight attendants. Premium meal offered both ways - this is a cashless airline so you need a credit card to pay for this. We were directed at SFO to use the self service check in but were advised not to do this or use online check in as we are international pax. As we are from the UK we did not have to pay any baggage fees to and from the Mainland (had to show check in staff our flight details from the UK). Hawaiian Airlines website unbelievably does not as yet have the ability to process applications from passengers in the UK so we used their UK based agent to book our flights.

Hawaiian advertises their outstanding service and free meals and beverages. They kept changing our flights and departure times I had to call them and rebook us on a flight that would not arrive 8 hours later than the flight I paid for. At the airport (SFO) there was no gate information we had to ask our way through to find out which the departure gate is. When we started boarding there was still no gate information. The staff seemed to be very unmotivated they had different groups for boarding but no one actually enforced that. By the time we got to our seats almost everyone in front of us was already there and all luggage bins were full. Hidden charges: You have to pay extra for each piece of luggage you want to check in. On the way to KOA no one cared about our carry-on luggage. BUT on the way back they were inspecting every single piece of luggage checking the measurements and the weight. If it was larger or heavier than the allowed size/weight for carry-on items you had to check it in (and pay of course). The meals nothing special I probably would have been better off with home made sandwiches. It was not worth the higher price we paid. On the plane the service was okay I wouldn't call it outstanding you get the same service as on almost any other airline. On the ground the service was very bad - staff very unhelpful and unfriendly.

Spanish cuisine is of the most delicious and interesting in the world and Iberia hired several Michelin-starred chefs to deal with their catering but this airline serve some awful stuff onboard. My started Salmorejo was very good even though it was served from a Tetra Pak container. Yet my main course tasted as though it was bought from KFC and then they poured some sort of gravy over it. It was dreadful. I did not mind the old business plus seats as the cabin was almost empty but I expected a good meal. I do not drink so cannot comment on their wines. Shame on IOberia you are not a good ambassador to Spain's wonderful cuisine. As for the second meal again dreadful: the usual dry and fatty ham bread. tomato sauce cheese etc. I have been using Iberia to travel to Latin America for many years and this second meal is the same. Time to change. Those expensive chefs are useless. Listen to your passengers not to them. I have a flight with them at the end of the month and will take my own food. The good thing apart from the seats is that the flight attendants are very charming they engage with passengers and are not grumpy as they used to be.

iberia,/airline-reviews/iberia,Iberia customer review,K Otto,United Kingdom,2014-05-10,Flew from Madrid (MAD) to Santiago de Chile (SCL) with this airline on May 19th 2014 and was highly disappointed by catering options and on-board entertainment and service. Aircraft: Iberia operates the A340-600 with the old color scheme for this route. Flight Duration: 14hr (due to strong headwinds). Return Flight: same aircraft. Class: Economy. Price: GBP 614 for a return flight from FRA with a 2hr stop in MAD. Inflight entertainment: The were no personal monitors. We were sitting quite far from the big screen at the front row. This made watching the 3 movies shown during the flight difficult. Besides there was a lot of image noise and the screen was flattering occasionally. You could really see a grey noise stripe moving from one end of the screen to another all the time. Food and Beverages: Since we left MAD past midnight Iberia thinks it can skip a meal as it expects the passengers to sleep (what else do you want to do on a 14hr flight without any kind of on-board entertainment). Dinner was served 1hr after departure. Whisky or any other liquor (except beer and wine) was not on the trolley. I was told to kindly wait but nothing happened. We were served breakfast consisting of a dry ham sandwich (white bun no lettuce and butter tasted horrible) ca. 1.5h before arrival in SCL. No meals were served in-between which means 10+ hours without food. We got served a small salami sandwich on the way back as a snack though. But in comparison to what I have experienced flying e.g. Asiana Qantas Lufthansa or even US Airways (not my first choice though) this is absolutely unacceptable. Staff service: You had to go to the kitchen to get a glass of water as no drinks were served in-between too. Not sure what the flights attendants were doing between meals but I haven's seen them offering any refreshments or taking care of the 350+ guests between the meals. Seat comfort: Seats were comfortable and I felt I had more legroom (I am 6.3 190cm) than e.g. on an intercontinental US Airways Delta or Qantas flight. Overall: (7/10). (-) Worst-in-class food poor service and no in-flight entertainment.

The leg room on the A321s was the most generous I've experienced in short haul economy class and the FAs were efficient - but certainly not as friendly as they perhaps could be.

It's been a few years since I've flown Indigo but for the most part their standards remain very good - easy check-in procedures helpful service with a smile both on the ground and in the air generally on-time clean planes and all for a good price. I decided to try the ""Fast Forward"" service which provides priority check-in and priority baggage delivery for 200 rupees per person. While the services were delivered as promised I found this to be an unnecessary expense as the regular check-in line was very short and baggage delivery in DEL is fast even without the priority tags. The seats however are rather hard and uncomfortable especially if you are trying to sleep. I don't think I'd want to sit in these for more than a couple of hours so consider this if you are considering trying their new international routes.

icelandair,/airline-reviews/icelandair,Icelandair customer review,D Jones,Canada,2010-09-18,Economy Comfort Class Toronto-Reykjavik-Helsinki return. A mixed experience flying Icelandair but generally great and decent value for money. Crew were professional and courteous on all flights aircraft clean and modern and flights on time. One of the perks of booking Economy Comfort Class is often the ability to reserve seats in the Saga Class cabin - ie business class seats for economy prices. I was sat in these seats on all 4 sectors which made for a relaxing and comfortable journey. Icelandair seems to oversell economy pushing these passengers into the Economy Comfort cabin and the Economy Comfort passengers moved to the rear of business class. Other benefits were priority check-in - a huge bonus in Reykjavik where as a previous report states early morning is total chaos in the check-in area. Saga lounge was good and a welcome place to spend transit time. One negative is the onboard service. They promise meal service on all flights but the reality is you get a free sandwich or snack from the buy onboard economy offering as they pass through to serve economy - not really as advertised. I found Keflavik airport to be excellent. Good shops and restaurants and a pleasant place to spend time in although seating is at a premium.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

It was like stepping back to the 1990s travelling on a flight with no seat back screens only 3 drop down TVs per cabin showing 3 films on the outbound journey and 2 on the return. Outbound films didn't even start until over 4 hours into the 10 hour+ flight. The only screen I could see on the return flight was not working meaning that not only could I not watch the film but it flashed on and off throughout the entire flight meaning I couldn't sleep either. The inflight meal was poor but the wine was ok (only one was offered). No water or snacks brought through the cabin between meals. Return flight was a shambles. It was delayed but no announcement made until after the time the flight should have departed. Then told we'd have an hour to wait due to a security issue so everybody left the queue.

In my experience I have never heard an airline flying to THR cheaper than Iran Air does and the pilots are obviously very skilled. But there are negative sides to flying Iran Air. First of all although their Aibus fleet is one of the safest in the world their other aircrafts (Boeing747(SP)727 and Russian aircraft) are one of the oldest and most dangerous - so my advice try to avoid these aircraft when flying Iran AIr. Luckily most European flights are with the Airbus fleet. I also know that the poor shape of their Boeing fleet is not caused by neglect but the fact that the Iranian government can't buy spare parts for these aircraft from the US (politics and stuff). Also inflght entertainment is almost non-existent (not even in their Business class) especially if you don't like Farsi spoken movies shown on a projector so bring a book/magazine/walkman or whatever. My advice is to fly Iran Aar if you are sure that they are using an Airbus aircraft and if you are more concerned about your budget then about stuff like inflight entertainment or alcoholic drinks.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

After not having flown with them for over 20 years I was full of expectation and it was slightly disappointing. In terms of service and courtesy they were spot on! The English proficiency level of the cabin crew was more than satisfactory contrary to other reviews claiming they were hard to be understood. The business class was disappointing due to three aspects uncomfortable out of date recliner seat with remote control on the arm rest which could easily be triggered wrongly. Average food (in portion and taste) and average AVOD. It was evident to see Japan airlines were trying to cut cost by not providing 3 course meal served separately all was served on one tray which was rather cramped. The toilet is basic with the absence of toiletries such as hand cream or cologne which is a norm for most business class. General temperature of the aircraft a bit on the warm side rather uncomfortable for the 4 hours duration. However on a positive note one could see cabin crew did their best with the limited resources they have been given. On the ground check in staffs both in HK and Japan were excellent lounge in HK was just a shared one and in Narita we used the Sakura lounge which is spacious and comfortable. All in all it was clear that Japan airlines had her golden days but is now struggling to survive so they concentrate on the longer routes and give only the very basic to short haul routes.

I generally like Japan Airlines especially the exceptionally high service standards and generally good food. However on recent Premium Economy travel through from Sydney to Frankfurt and return I found the shell seats almost impossible for sleeping (were these cast-offs from the similar old Cathay Pacific seats one wonders?) and due to a promotional fare offer the PE cabin was packed with noisy passengers and became claustrophobic which tends to negate the benefits of flying PE in the first place! Also this must be the only airline I can think of that allows passengers to keep their window shades closed during the take-off and landing phases of the flight - half the cabin was in darkness from before taxiing and then for the entire flight including the landings. Isn't this a safety hazard when passengers are unable to see out of the aircraft in case of emergency? On the other hand I like the JAL First lounges in Narita and use of the Qantas First lounge in Sydney - excellent.

With the possible exception of SYD-NRT high standard of food offered throughout. The bathrooms were kept spotlessly clean and looked brand new. Good quiet first class lounge at Narita although Japan Airlines uses the BA First Class Lounge at Terminal 3 at Heathrow and this was not so good.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,K Morris,New Zealand,2014-06-12,Six flights. Bangkok to Mumbai to Kolkata to Bagdogra returned two weeks later. I had first booked a direct flight from Bangkok to Kolkata but two weeks later Jet Airways made a schedule change and simply emailed me to tell me that the Bangkok - Kolkata flights were cancelled with no information about where I stand in regards refunds and rebooking. However I phoned a phone number here in New Zealand and the consultant worked hard to come up with a suitable alternative for me which meant longer flights and less sleep but ensured that I got to where I needed to be and charged me no extra. I got the feeling that running on time was very important to the airline one leg was 10 minutes late and it was made clear to us that it was due to a late inbound aircraft due to congested air traffic (ie: not Jet Airways' fault). They hurried us through boarding so that time could be made up. Food and staff were fine check-in staff very helpful and friendly. Ironically at the slightest bump in the sky seat-belt sign was on and we were told to remain in our seats yet prior to take-off staff didn't come and check seat-belts and also a passenger two seats over from me was busy talking on her phone during take-off and staff didn't address this even though the safety briefing had been very clear.

Excellent aspects were the meticulous cabin crew service good leg room seats which allowed sleep and quiet cabins. Not so good was the food in Premium Economy - minuscule tasteless portions of poor quality especially to and from Australia. I can recall wonderful Japanese food even in basic economy 10 years ago on JAL. An odd aspect is that JAL seemed not to be able to recognise my OneWorld Emerald details and status until I complained on check-in on each leg. Another odd aspect was the default position of having all window shades closed on boarding and even on take off and landing. Isn't this policy a safety hazard?

We (2) found the flights better than we expected them to be but there are opportunities for improvement. Our seats were reasonably comfortable all flights were on time long haul had VOD to keep us entertained but the film choice was a little restricted and old and there seemed to be no resume viewing option (i.e. continue from where you left off). Food was reasonable the cabin crew on our aisle on the way out were incompetent (those on the adjacent isle knew what they were doing). The meal on the night flight on the way out arrived 2 hours after we took off which was far too late. My major complaint would be that all the cabin crew (bar one) disappeared once the meal had been served and did not appear again until the next meal. No one came around offering water and the toilets were not serviced. Despite all of this of the cheap budget airlines flying to Delhi (and return) they are not the worst.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,2,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Sensible luggage policy (ie you can take 1 suitcase per couple if that's what you want - unlike Monarch where it's none or two per couple - how odd is that? And that is expensive of course) and very good hand baggage allowance (10 kilos each person). Pre - booked seats as well - these and hold baggage were extra of course but then what 'low cost' airline gives them away for free. Aircraft was a 737-800 - in such good condition it must have been virtually new and a surprisingly generous leg room allowance. Made even better for my wife and I when we had 3 seats for the two of us on the return. Flights on time and even landed 20 minutes early at East Midlands on the return.

We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company. We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015. It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight.

The rep came back after many more passengers had stopped her to find out what was going on she mentioned someone had got on a wrong flight and that was the hold up.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Mark Segal,Canada,2012-07-22,I have flown Jet Airways on six separate return trips within the past twelve months back and forth between Toronto-Brussels-Delhi-Kathmandu in Business Class except for 4 of the 24 legs involved. Every flight left on schedule and most of them landed ahead of scheduled time. This airline operates like clockwork. It is very reliable. Baggage handling has also been very reliable - even through Delhi because it is in the hands of the one airline and they apparently make sure bags are transferred when they should be. In flight service has been excellent - friendly attentive comfortable seating in the lie-flats and a totally adequate set of menu choices for meals.

I had the misfortune of sitting directly behind a couple who's two babies screamed incessantly for the vast majority of the flight. The cabin crew showed about as much interest in shutting them up as the parents did. As a result a long flight made seemingly longer due to the constant racket and lack of sleep. I flew business on the way out and the attitude of the cabin crew was pretty lax. Once they'd handed the food out they were not to be seen again until breakfast was served. The return leg in which I flew economy wasn't much better in terms of the attitude of the cabin crew. The only way I've been able to guarantee a non-veg meal is to request it when booking-in online.

I haven't flown Westjet in a number of years but I would say that their offering is comparable to Air Canada economy class. All three flights were more or less on time and trouble free. Seat pitch feels similar to Air Canada. I didn't purchase any food so can't offer an opinion on this. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is somewhat superior - they offer a wider variety of audio and video entertainment gratis while Westjet offers certain TV channels for free and premium programming (Movies and certain TV programs) at additional cost (there is a slot to swipe a credit card in the seatback to pay for this). I did find it annoying that the channel displaying the aircraft's position (a personal favorite) was 80% Westjet advertising and only 20% map. Overall I find the offerings of the two airlines to be quite similar and wouldn't hesitate to fly Westjet over Air Canada if they offered a lower fare or a more convenient itinerary.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Not a good first impression when Webjet had to transfer all passengers to Galeao Airport as their B733 couldn't land at Santos Dumont due to bad weather even though other airlines were operating. The genuine smiling crew made up for this though. All other flights left within a few minutes of scheduled time. Legroom a little tight but nothing too bad. Cabin crews invariably very friendly and welcoming. They appear to enjoy their jobs - I overheard one lady in particular discussing the company with an elderly passenger who hadn't flown with them before and she was very knowledgeable and was marketing the company well.

Food is a cold sandwich small but not microscopic and a small sweet - both very good. No alcohol but plenty of soft drinks fruit juices and mineral water. Punctuality was impressive - not a single flight delayed on the airport panels on both legs. The only real minus I saw was a very long time on the ground in stops (50-60 minutes) while one waits inside. My flights were nonstop but were it not so I'd be annoyed with that.

Everyone knows that Christmas week is very busy with long queues at the airport but Jetstar could make it much easier for passengers at Tullamarine by having a dedicated bag drop queue. Then there would be some point to checking in at home. The long queue that I had to join included both people who had already checked in and others who hadn't. After being called out of the queue to catch my plane there was a long wait in the airless dungeon that passes for Jetstar's terminal - then a late gate change which led us back into the Qantas terminal -- and then a long motionless queue with no information. Finally we were able to board around 30 minutes late. Once on the plane the journey was fine. The seat was comfortable and the service was friendly. There was a long wait at Hobart for luggage probably due to the arrival of another Jetstar aircraft minutes before ours. The return journey could not have been more different. Quick efficient check-in and boarding a comfortable seat (I was offered an exit row seat at check-in) and arrival in Melbourne 20 minutes early. However at baggage pick-up we followed the signs to carousel 1 where we waited for a long time before finding out that our luggage was spinning around carousel 4 (with no signs).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,4,0,0,NA,NA,4,1

The 777-300 ER from AMS to NBO had the 3-3-3 arrangement which meant a little more room than I usually get on other airlines. The food was decent enough the wine ok and plenty off it. The service although not perfect was fine. The IFE is not upto Emirates quality but since I don't sit for the entire flight the movie choice was ok. The flight from NBO to MBA was on a well equipped Embraer 190 which even had its own IFE quite a novelty on a short hop flight and something I've never seen in Europe. The only fly in the ointment was NBO but that is not the airlines fault that's KAA's issue. Its a bit of a nightmare for an international arrival with a domestic transfer.

As a normal Qantas traveller and having not travelled on Jetstar for 8 years I was pleasantly surprised of how good the service was. The flight itself was full and boarded late. Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas.

However the handling of this situation by the local staff was an absolute disaster. Initially the flight was delayed for three hours until they eventually made the decision to cancel it. We were put up in a below average hotel and left in the dark about further arrangements. The next day we called them every half hour but they themselves did not know what went on. Furthermore they told us that we could not easily get our luggage. In the end I had to get very angry. Only then did they become more co-operative.

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,G Cook,Australia,2014-10-12,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary. Next time we pay more and fly with anyone but Jetstar.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,5,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

Flight arrived about an hour early. FA's were friendly and had good English. Good selection of beverages (and generous amounts). Food was also good. Leg room and seat width was adequate. Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service.

It was a really pleasant flight. Boarding and check-in was easily done and the seat itself was comfortable although a bit hard for the back which made it a hard to sleep. The recline was really good and made the flight really comfortable and the legroom was great as I could stretch out fully (I'm 5""8). The meals were delicious a lot better than the meals served on other long haul flights. The entertainment was excellent and included a wide range of new movies and it had videos about KLM and what it does to help our world and it surely was impressive. The cabin crew were really friendly and had a smile on their faces which made the flight more pleasant.

We had booked the flight over a month before the flight departure date. Upon online check-in one of us was at the front of the plane and the other at the very rear. We had to ring up customer support as the online check in gave no other seating options and asked to change this so that we could sit together. We were told the only seats next to each other had the aisle in between. We were also told if we got to the airport early the check-in staff should change this so we could sit in the same row together. We arrived at airport check-in more than 3 hours early but we were told the airplane was full and there was no way to get around this. We were also told that we had to pay 30 Euro to check in our baggage since we had not done it online (but we couldn't do it online or else we wouldn't have been able to change our seats at the airport!). We discussed our experience with the lady at the check-in desk and she told us if we used one of the computers located on the other side of the airport we would be able to check our luggage in for free. So we went and found an internet kiosk checked in and still had to pay 15 Euro per suitcase. We then went back to the check in desk paid an extra 20 Euro each to sit in an 'Economy Comfort' seat because we were told there was simply nothing else that could be done. Long story short: this two hour flight cost us $900 AUD up front to be seated nowhere near each other. When we tried to alter this so we could sit next to each other it cost us an extra $120 AUD.

KLM is a really good reliable and above all friendly airline. A330-200 for AMS-HAV means much better seat-width than sister-airline Air France's 777-300 used on CDG-HAV a far more comfortable 2-4-2 seating than the 777`s 3-4-3 and of course only half the amount of passengers making arriving formalities in HAV much faster. Still the success-key is the cabin crew and the in-flight service standard. First pre lunch drinks with pringles then a hot towel followed by a good hot lunch (choice of main) and after collecting meal trays: coffee/tea with cognac/liqueur. Ice cream was offered with coffee (and/or drinks) mid-way + several offerings of water/coke/juice through flight and a hot towel again before a new hot snack/meal in good time before landing. All this offered by crew members who seem to enjoy their work. Who can ask for more in economy? (Have flown KLM several times on long hauls and this seems to be their standard service program in economy). Hopefully some day in the future KLM/AirFrance will lean totally on KLM`s service standards.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

The flight to AMS was operated by a Fokker. The middle seat was kept empty for business class. Crew were friendly and polite. The sandwiches and salad offered for this very short flight came in a very funky Dutch designed box. We had 90 min transit in AMS and paid a visit to their lounge. Very large with ample seating but very little choice of food. Flight to BKK was a B777-200 with the old business class seating. Unfortunately no flat beds on this route at the moment. I could not sleep the whole 10hr journey. That said the crew made up for the flaws. Customers were treated with respect. Although the crew were by age older than most flight attendants that you find on airlines these days their many years of experience showed. They obviously enjoyed doing their duties and did not disappear for the entire duration of the flight only to reappear 2 hrs prior to landing but paced up and down the aisles offering refreshments and snacks. Although the food is not elaborate it was simple and very tasty and was presented in fashionable Dutch designed dishes and cutlery.. I honestly enjoyed it more than some of the asian or middle east carriers food. Drinks were topped up constantly. They offered a good selection of films and music programmes.

Disappointed by the baggage allowance of 1 bag per pax (except to USA) additional bags $100. Flight attendants were direct and the food service was too long leaving finished meal trays on our laps for over 30 minutes.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,D Brown,United States,2014-05-23,SFO-ICN-PEK XIY-ICN-LAX. Due to the many changes in itinerary aircraft equipment and seat assignments made by the airline I had 45 mins minimum connection time in Seoul which did work barely as the flight was on time and the connecting passengers were escorted from the arrival to the departure gate. The return leg departure time for the flight from Xi'an to Seoul was brought forward without previous announcement (although this is part of their terms of service). I had previously been obliged to change my itinerary to return to LAX instead of SFO when this flight had originally been re-scheduled to depart later. Now I find with the revised earlier departure that I could have taken the SFO flight after all and made my connection back to SFO. I did get a free pass though for the Prestige Lounge for the 3.5 hour layover. The return flight to LAX was on a packed A380 and the cabin staff were completely disorganized rushing individual meals from one end of the main cabin to the other. The meals were okay but not served up to the standard of their competitor Asiana Airlines. The traditional decorum of the cabin staff wore thin dealing with a huge Chinese tour group who had probably never flown before. The leg room is restricted by almost 2 inches due to the thick airline sales catalogues that they cram into the seat pockets. I was further delayed at immigration since the airline somehow had omitted to tell the US authorities about the changes in flight numbers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,3,3,4,NA,NA,4,0

Check-in was quick and were able to get me an exit row aisle seat so I was happy. The flight was delayed leaving about an hour late without much interaction with the customers. Walking into the plane it looked like it was stuck in the 70's/80's. Thought it was retro but then the inflight entertainment was a disaster. They didn't offer earphones or blankets you had to ask for them which I thought was a bit weird. Food service was quick food not the best though! The best of it all though was the friendliness and the interaction with children on the plane. The air steward in front of me was playing games with the child across the aisle from me during landing whilst seated. Little things like that made it a bit more fun.

A lot of legroom and very large seats with a big screen with a large choice of movies from all continents and all new releases are available.

kuwait-airways,/airline-reviews/kuwait-airways,Kuwait Airways customer review,John Doe,United States,2014-08-06,I flew JFK to LHR return in July 2014. With transatlantic fares being extremely expensive these days I was left with Kuwait Airways being my only viable option without spending $1000+ per person. I considered flying this airline to be somewhat like flying Ryanair - expect nothing except basic transportation from point A to B and everything else is a bonus. The Boeing 777 used on this route is old and clearly in need of an upgrade. PTV entertainment screens worked for virtually no one. However in my opinion the dated interior can be somewhat of an advantage. I found the legroom and seat width to be quite generous compared to other airlines especially the newer 777s with a 3-4-3 layout in economy (Kuwait uses 3-3-3 in economy). The flight attendants were definitely not highly trained or overly polite but I also didn't find them to be rude and they served the meals efficiently. The food was surprisingly some of the best food I have had in economy class. Indian fare was served on all flights and was quite tasty. The JFK-LHR leg included a full hot breakfast I don't believe many other airlines still serve this much food in economy for a transatlantic flight. My outbound flight was just about on-time while my return flight to JFK was delayed by about 1 hour. If you take a look at Flightaware or other flight tracking software for the flight you will see that this flight is on average about 1 hour late so plan accordingly. However given the price paid and the fact that this is a direct flight to LHR I would fly Kuwait again if savings is substantial over other airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

They did one drink run (as stated in a previous review) but if you needed anything just ring the call button. They come immediately and happy to get you what you want. Dinner was excellent - delicious soup and cheeses entree of shrimp and veggies. Slept thru breakfast so can't comment. LAN Biz seats are the best - I always can sleep 5 hours easily on them. Quick 1 hour connection in SCL - security check took a minute if not less. Almost 3 hour flight to Sao Paulo - 1/2 filled cabin. Friendly service and they left you alone to sleep if needed. Tasty breakfast and good movies to watch. Had an aborted landing so landed a bit late - bag was last off the plane (even with priority tags) but was just glad to get it.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,S Gray,Australia,2014-01-23,"SYD-ICN-JFK-ICN-SYD. Economy class. Sydney to Seoul was a day flight on an ageing 747. Pet hate number one: all window shades had to be closed and lights turned off during the 10 hour day flight. Uncomfortable seat despite the generous 34"" pitch. Limited IFE choices. Bibimbap is the only meal worth considering. My seat mates' western choices looked very pedestrian. Cabin crew mostly young with very limited English and all service seemed very rushed and chaotic. They did spring immediately whenever people rang the call buttons. Drinks (soft and hard) were half pours in 200ml plastic cups. Overnight ICN to JFK on a much newer 777 was more comfortable. Same level of clumsy but well-intentioned service. Some mediocre entertainment choices but on a newer and more user-friendly system than the 747. Seatbelt sign was turned on at the slightest hint of light chop throughout the flight. Cabin crew stationed permanently at the lavs directing traffic and ensuring they're kept reasonably clean. JFK-ICN on A380. Seats as comfortable as they get for economy class and like the 777 great entertainment hardware but limited choice. More bibimbap. More sips of drinks from small cups. Another day flight with enforced darkness. Quick and simple transfer at ICN. Paid lounge access upstairs for USD22 is a good option and free showers available to all passengers adjacent to the lounge. ICN-SYD back to the old 747. Bibimbap for dinner on departure. Uncomfortable seat. Same service not unfriendly just impersonal and very ""green"". Another pet hate: breakfast was served a good three hours out of Sydney and cleared up with two hours left to go so lights turned off and blinds to remain closed. If I had to do the trip again in economy class I possibly would consider KE for the mere fact of 34"" seat pitch which really does make a difference and makes up for a significant number of soft product short comings.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

Later I asked if we could get a bottle of water I was told no. When I asked for ice during the drink service only 1 or 2 cubes were provided. A flight to JFK will include a certain number of Americans who don't prefer warm drinks. The cabin in row 14 was extremely warm i.e. uncomfortable. When using the restrooms I noticed the rear of the plane was quite comfortable. I went to ask flight attendants if something could be done of if they could look into the temperature. They acted like it was a crazy request. A few hours later after my hands and feet were uncomfortably swollen a flight attendant stopped by to see if anyone had answered the call button. This I'd pressed about an hour before. This is lousy service. This flight attendant was marvellous. This new attendant however said that the pilot controls the cabin temperature and in fact it was quite warm in our area. She said she'd discuss the issue with the pilot. Half an hour later the temperature was beginning to come down and there was some airflow in the cabin.

LAN provided a good on-time service complete with some basic but tasty meals and wine. Emerald status which meant straightforward access to their business lounges in both Santiago and Montevideo and use of wifi etc. My only complaint was that as I'm not much good with Spanish it was occasionally difficult to follow what the flight attendants were asking.

Overall very pleasant flights particularly due to the friendly efficiency of the crews. Good food and drink and efficient service. On the transpacific routes the A340 has two business class cabins. The rear one (rows 6 and 7) is very cold and apparently the temperature cannot be adjusted so avoid these rows if you can. They are obviously aware of this problem because on both journeys the crew moved all passengers (including us) out of rows 6 and 7 into the forward cabin (rows 1 to 5) where we were much more comfortable. However we were in rows 6 and 7 for the short legs from Sydney to Auckland and vice versa where we had to use blankets over our shoulders to keep warm. We greatly enjoyed our flight in the LAN Dreamliner from Buenos Aires to Santiago. It's a much more comfortable plane than the A340. The lounge in Santiago is quite basic.

LAN seem to have major operational issues with their A343 flights to and from Oceania. Being kind one could say they are erring on the side of caution but significant punctuality issues where flights are frequently either delayed or cancelled does not inspire confidence (retrospectively checked flightaware.com to verify my suspicions). LAN800 delayed ex Auckland by over 1 hour which proved QFs text message received the night before to be correct. Contacted QF on receipt regarding my 1h20 min connection as was travelling on to Europe from Rio same day. Told to contact LAN directly. Did so and LAN adamant that no problem with connecting as flight on time. Phooey! Encountered same circus at Santiago on arrival from Rio enroute home. Went to allocated gate to snare some snooze time for the 4 hours transit only to wake up to 2 gate changes (from gate 11 to 14 then finally 17B) one flight status of 'cancellado' and one of 'atrasado' (delayed). All for the same LAN801. Amazing. Flight eventually left some hours after scheduled 2320h take off as a replacement crew then needed to be called up. Insult to injury was the dinner served around 4-5am. Food masquerading as beef is not worth being kept awake for. Real shame as inflight the crew are pretty charming and attentive. I would expect these shenanigans from AR with whom I've previously travelled to Argentina. Had hoped LAN would be superior. On the positive side the flights between Santiago and Rio were pleasant.

The flight departed at midnight and arrived in Santiago at 6.30am next day so food option was a quiche for dinner and a muffin for breakfast. I personally expected something better and I did not eat anything in LAN's beautiful lounge at Bogota's airport before boarding. Most people went straight to bed after taking off. One would have to be extremely tired and sleepy to be able to sleep. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. They are very hard and narrow and there is not space to store anything apart from in the literature pocket in front.

LIM-MIA however was great. It left roughly on time which was good as we had a connection at MIA to LHR (our bags did make it the whole way).

LAN expect you to be at the airport 3 hours before departure for international flights. They are not joking. Passengers like me who had already checked-in and printed their boarding cards were made to wait outside the cordoned off check-in area. We were admitted after airport security complained about the queue getting in the way of other passengers. After 50 minutes waiting it was my turn but the agent just held his hand up and got out his mobile phone. He was still chatting after I had finished leaving my bags with another agent. Boarded in strict priority of cabin class frequent flyer status and row numbers - then all got on to the same bus! Cabin crew too busy having coffee to check the boarding cards. Crew surly with no smiles or good-byes. Usual economy class type snack. Arrived on time with fairly quick bag return.

We boarded the plane only half an hour late because of a âsecurityâ agent in dark glasses and an Armani- type suit (jacket draped over the shoulders) who laboriously checked documents of all passengers on the 40 degree tarmac. The interior of the plane was so hot probably 50 degrees) that the older passengers were dropping like flies which further delayed the departure by a couple of hours. Sitting beside me fanning himself at high speed (the interior was now like 120 large beserk butterflies) was a flight engineer for LN who explained that there were no spare parts for the Auxiliary Power Unit that provides the AC so thatâs why it was hot. I thought that this was not the moment to ask if there could be similar spares shortages for the main engines. People perked up above 10000 feet when they recovered and the cabin crew were not as aggressive as they were on the ground. Your heart goes out to these folks who are on these planes itâs both unpleasant and dangerous work.

Tried to do the online check in and it only worked for one of our tickets. When we got the the airport the lines for check in were long so we all went to the online check in counter and they allowed us to check in. Flight on time and boarding was quick. They serve a horrible roll after take off at 1am which was inedible. Seats quite uncomfortable. Headsets can hardly hear and this looked like a new aircraft. Crew was pleasant enough. Overall uneventful flight. Landed in MUC on time with a 40 minute connection and had to run for our next flight which we made with moments to spare. LH did nothing to make the connection easier which they so proudly advertise.

Had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. Got to our gate and sat down to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time I went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. LH then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers- nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros! Flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in Mumbai instead of 1am.

The food on the TXL-LUX-TXL segments was a choice of sandwiches (ham or cheee) which was enough for a leg shorter than one hour. The leather seats were very comfortable. The only downside is that LG uses three different check-in systems at all three airports which means that no boarding passes for the onward flights can be issued at either TXL nor SCN. The strangest thing however was that the LUXAIR check-in system would not assign to us seats in the emergency exit row from LUX to SCN.

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,L Jones,United States,2010-12-17,I would suggest spending the extra money even if it amounts to a few hundred dollars to fly an airline other than LAN to Argentina. After purchasing our tickets four months ago my wife and I have not only had our itineraries changed four times but we've been placed us on separate flights after we've repeatedly requested being on the same flight. Furthermore their justification for placing us on separate flights ended up being completely false and likely motivated by their overbooking our flight. Our flight leaving Buenos Aires had a layover in Santiago Chile. I was told that I had to have my flight changed because I would not make my connecting flight. My wife who also left on the same flight from Buenos Aires was given a non-changing flight that continued back to the US after the stop in Santiago. The fact that we both originated on the same flight but she was given a continuation and I was told I had to board another flight makes their reasoning behind placing me on another flight completely false. The only rational is that they overbooked the continuing flight and they were attempting to remove people from this flight to accommodate additional passengers in Chile. In trying to get them to rectify this error they simply removed both of us and placed us on earlier flights with an additional stop in another country after a six hour layover. They have no regard for their customers and do not try to honor their contracts. I understand a few changes in a flight but they have changed our flights multiple times with little or no regard to us as customers or the plans we've made.

The check-in staff were very unhelpful and told us to go to the ticket office in the centre of Puntas Arenas (a 20 minute taxi ride away). The staff there weren't much help either and couldn't find space on an alternative flight so we eventually went by bus (14 hours) the next day. We did get our money back though. Flights 2 and 3 were fine. The food was pretty dire - 3 biscuits one of which contained Ham. Puerto Iguazu to Buenos Aires landed at the wrong airport in BA (not the one that was scheduled.

Second leg on the A380 and sat on a small section of Economy class on the upper deck. There was a dedicated flight attendant for the mini cabin and service felt very personalized and private.

IFE had a good selection of movies TV shows and cool features like the tail camera and the screen was of decent quality and responsive.

Also the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV music and film and found little to entertain me.

The seat was OK but I didn't really find it particularly comfortable for sleeping even with the mattress topper. A bigger softer pillow would have been good. The crew was very proactive and efficient throughout the flight. The chef on call service worked fine and the food was pretty good with a decent snack bar set up at the front mid flight. The IFE was just ok - seemed to be a lot of the same selection as there was in December. KUL-CGK on 737-800 was fine - much more comfortable than European short haul in J class.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,A Bergmann,Austria,2014-10-12,Flight LH 409 Newark to Dusseldorf in September. Flight was operated by an older A340-300 which was in very good condition and had nice inflight entertainment on big personal screens (much better than on Lufthansa's A330s at the moment). IFE featured loads of movies and fancy stuff such as real time speed / altitude. Flight departed about 1 hour late. Nevertheless I could easily catch my connection to Vienna. Food was alright could have been a little more though. Drinks were always available. Cabin crew did a great job very friendly and professional. Seat comfort was good for Economy Class enough legroom and I like the 2-4-2 seating. Changing in Dusseldorf was very convenient (small distances and a nice airport).

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,LHR-KUL-AKL-KUL-LHR. A mixed bag. Positives: The A380s are superb esp in top deck economy and they have a very good IFE (if limited in choice compared with EK's). The service was fine and I got this at an excellent fare. Areas which need work: you can't choose your seating online as with EK and have to go through the airline instead; the online check in asks you to print your boarding passes but (at AKL anyway) these had to be reprinted - took extra time; the IFE on the B777 services (to/from AKL) is now next to obsolete and is very limited in its selection.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,V Ladhani,Germany,2014-10-05,TXL-FRA-RIX: Both the legs were operated by A321. Crew were pleasant on both the flights especially that onwards to RIX. They were lively willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds. I have travelled extensively on different airlines and wouldn't hesitate to suggest LH to up their game.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,2,2,NA,NA,3,1
malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,M Walsh,United Kingdom,2014-11-25,20th Nov 2014 MH002 Kuala Lumpur (dep 2355) to London Heathrow. Minus points: 1) Uncomfortable seat. I generally find seating less supportive and comfortable than those used on MH and SQ's 747-400 fleets of yesteryear and I have found the seating on SQs and MH's A380 and QR's A330 and A340 to be much of the same. This particular seat felt like it was worn down and it was the emergency exit row seat 42K which I had paid extra for so this was particularly annoying. 2) Cold cabin but nowhere near as cold as the outbound MH001 flight I took on 31st October which I also reviewed. 3) As mentioned in my aforementioned review of the 31st October MH001 flight the in-flight entertainment is lagging behind - slow poorly laid out and not intuitive. Plus points: 1) Attentive and friendly cabin crew as ever. 2) Informative and friendly Captain. 3) Good quality food. 4) The content of in-flight entertainment is sound. General thoughts: An enjoyable flight again but one in which I could not sleep well or get comfortable in. In-flight service is exemplary.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,1,5,4,2,NA,NA,2,1
malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,M Walsh,United Kingdom,2014-11-20,31st Oct 2014 Flight: MH001 London Heathrow (2200 dep) to Kuala Lumpur. Minus points: 1) This was nowhere near a full flight yet when serving dinner shortly after take-off they quickly ran out of one of the two standard options on offer. 2) The cabin was very cold. I was in the window seat 43K and had no one sat next to me so I turned off all 3 vents and used to blankets despite wearing 3 layers including my hoody with the hood up. Still cold. 3) The in-flight entertainment user interface sorely needs updating - it is slow cumbersome and far from intuitive and there really isn't a need for the old-style dual-hole headphone jacks to be retained. Refer to Dragonair as an example of a modern system. Plus points: 1) Cabin crew friendly as ever MH's true asset. 2) Nice in-flight meals although the dinner option that was left (tuna lasagne) might be considered an acquired taste. 3) Despite criticisms of in-flight entertainment there was ample content and of a wide range. General notes: Contrary to what my notes and scores might suggest I did enjoy this flight and very much looked forward to it - my first flight with MH in 7 years and my first on their A380. But flying with them certainly isn't the experience that it used to be. I had flown on 31 MH flights prior to this and can say that they deserved those Skytrax 5-Star Airline ratings but right now they're not quite there. A simple measure like not running out of certain food on a 2/3 full flight would help as something like that isn't acceptable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,5,4,3,NA,NA,3,1

meridiana,/airline-reviews/meridiana,Meridiana customer review,A Smith,United Kingdom,2012-09-03,Disgraceful to tell people with children and babies to check in two hours before a flight to keep them waiting one hour for staff to turn up which ultimately delayed the flight. Found Meridiana staff disinterested in passengers and more concerned with how they were looking in as much as they allowed the passenger sitting outside of me to keep two large bags at her feet which made it almost impossible for me to get out. This happened on our flight to Florence and back to Gatwick where this practise seemed the norm. Curtains used to divide classes were not drawn back before landing and the passenger in front of me was not reminded to bring his seat upright on landing.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,2014-10-31,KUL-ADL return out on 18 Oct and return on 25 Oct. Outbound flight was a red eye. On the outbound sector service was generally good albeit a little perfunctory by a male flight attendant who was occasionally a little rushed and gruff. Otherwise the rest of the staff were great. In contrast to previous journeys there was no rush to get the meal service over. There was a good choice of wine and spirits. Inflight entertainment was extensive but not to my liking but that's a personal choice. They supply you with a duvet pillows and a rather sad amenity bag which is embarrassingly cheap and tacky (apart from the creams and moisturizers). The seat is angled flat and is terrible for sleep. I am 183 cm tall and was constantly sliding down and ended up setting the chair at an armchair recline to try and get some sleep. The return flight was great just 6 people in business class so there was lots of attention and the attendants were truly warm and friendly . They got it right in that they were unobtrusive but yet managed to keep their eye on your glass and plate offering second helpings of food and topping up wine regularly. I used the book-the-cook service and my main meal of nasi lemak was just okay nothing special. Bear in mind that nasi lemak out of Adelaide is not to be recommended! Generally I was quite satisfied apart from the angled-flat seats. MAS do something about these seats in your A330's!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,2,5,3,3,NA,NA,5,1

The meal was down sized to a hot meal only. Return on a 737-800 again on time and easier to use entertainment. The first drink serviced arrived and we were offered either a chicken or egg sandwich.

Aircraft immaculate crew professional and friendly. Informative announcements from cabin and cockpit no endless sales announcements. Arrived early on both flights.

We have flown Malaysian several times both in economy and in business. Overall quite happy with the experience. The food is good although the gluten free options available to my partner are very limited and need improvement. The chef on call service available to business and first class passengers finally seems to be up and running. The service from cabin staff is excellent and very attentive. One negative is the delayed departures from Kl. This was the second flight we have taken from Kl where the flight was significantly delayed.. Malaysian airlines need to improve on this. Also the inflight entertainment choices are only average.

All flights on time. First leg acceptable although no IFE/moving map and food service was merely a tray of small but tasty canapes. On the flight to HKG must say that the new business class seats are very narrow and not particularly comfortable to sleep in. There's also no privacy screen between seats. Meals were acceptable although on both occasions my first choice was not available which I found strange being in the middle of a half-empty cabin. Service is functional/automated not very warm and cabin crew didn't appear happy to serve unlike SIA/Emirate/others. The IFE monitors were not sharp high resolution like onboard new Austrian business class. All in all would rate 6/10. Don't expect anything special it's not 4* service.

Outbound on a 737 - even though it's only a 3.5 hour flight it's unusual for major airlines not to have individual IFE (even Qantas has it on DRW-SYD!). Return on a 777 that was much more pleasant - in fact just having 9-across on a 777 is a reason to choose Malaysian (or Singapore) over someone like Emirates and their cattle trucks. Otherwise it's the Malaysian I remember from a few years ago - reasonable service facilities and organisation.

Previous experiences with airline had been mixed. Overall their Business product doesn't have the polish of Emirates or Singapore but is a satisfactory alternative given the price. 777 MEL-KUL A380 KUL-CDG-KUL and then A330 KUL-MEL. 777 is aged but found it very comfortable (more so than the much newer A330). A380 was spacious and seat was good. A330 seemed more cramped than either 777 or A380 and lacked privacy. All flights had good service. Food varied from good to excellent and there was always plenty of it. IFE was a weak spot with not much of any interest to me. Lounges too were mediocre even in KLIA which surprised me being home base.

I wasn't expecting luxury but when the lady in front of me reclined her seat immediately after take off my journey became very uncomfortable. This wasn't helped by the seat pitch being very small in the first place and the pocket on the seat being bent and broken and digging into my knees for the whole flight. This was a morning flight so there was no need to recline. I would suggest to Monarch if they insist on packing so many people in and having small seat pitches to follow in the steps of EasyJet and have seats that don't recline as unfortunately it seems that many people can't get to grips with good manners and common decency. Just think would you be happy if somebody did that to you! Easy really.

This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines. Arrival at DEL was a mess with business and first class bags off-loaded last which annoyed premium paying passengers. Only highlight really was LH Senator Lounge in FRA which was very nice.

This was not too much of an issue however. The crew were friendly and we landed on time in Heraklion.

On the return flight we noticed our Monarch A320 landing 25 mins early from Birmingham much to our surprise. We boarded and were in the air 20 mins early which was great and Landed at BHX a full 40 mins ahead of schedule! Unfortunately this was overshadowed by having to wait 25 mins for a bus to the terminal (which was not the fault of the airline I must stress) but nevertheless a pleasant flight. The only reason I haven't awarded higher is because the flights were a little over-priced.

SYD-KUL flight was on an aged B777-200 with small television screens and old broken seats. KUL-SYD flight was on a fairly new A330-300. The return flight landed 30 minutes late primarily due to the fact that it took the ground crew an hour to board the plane. On both flights the cabin crew were rude surly and inefficient. The food was generally appalling especially the sausage roll served two hours before landing and poorly planned with wine served mid morning and tea served in the afternoon. Drink runs were lacking on the both flights especially the return flight where I had to suggest that the cabin crew make one and even then they missed several rows of seats. The KUL-LGK-KUL flights were both serviced by extremely old B737-400. The fact that MAS still operates these planes is a disgrace. The interior was extremely dated the seats were broken and the air conditioner works poorly on the ground. The return flight landed 45 minutes late in KUL due to problems with the air conditioner.

Considering it is a reasonably new product I was very disappointed by the seat on the A330.

Return journey was made even worse by 2 hour delay at Sharm hence landing Gatwick 01h10 and then having to endure 2 hour wait for baggage.

Chose Ubon option with a handful of other passengers but Nok did the bear minimum of point to point transfer so people were being dropped off in Buriram airport with no public transport and 35km from town 3.5 hours later than due. We ended up taking another passenger to town in our car as a courtesy to him not the airline as he would have been stranded. Return flight learned lesson and checked email evening before. Flight brought forward 2 hours with no explanation. No contact on issues other than email so if not had checked would have missed flight. Catching a flight on Thai Air Asia (on time) from Don Meaung to Chiang Mai later that evening all 7 Nok Air flights departing i noticed had various delays from 20 minutes to 65 minutes.

Flight 1 - originally booked for 23/12 emailed 3 days before to say flight was cancelled due to weather forecast but managed to get rebooked on to next day flight instead. However flight was full and found last row of seats in saab plane has reduced legroom so not happy. 2/1 - Buriram to Bangkok. Flight due to take off at 3.30 took off 5pm. No information provided about delay to any passengers from Nok air staff about delay or when incoming aircraft likely to arrive - dependant on information on internet instead. Buriram - Bangkok 5/1 worst of the 3. No information about issues until arrive at airport. Told flight cancelled - after much arguing between all passengers and staff offered alternative of flight to Ubon and then minibus back to Buriram with cost of ticket refunded. Originally scheduled to arrive 3.10 arrived Buriram at 11pm instead. Very disappointed with Nok Air this trip not only with issues but with lack of honesty about cause and information on delays being provided in an accurate manner. The issues have arisen due to one of the leased aircraft developing a major fault causing numerous cancellations and knock-on delays but would like to have been told this.

Return was full and the usual mayhem for those boarding later who had nowhere to put hand luggage - it eventually being taken off to go in the hold (""the hat bins are now full"" as the flight attendant quaintly put it).

However, I must say that the flight far surpassed my expectations and I will be very likely to fly Norwegian again. I knew going into the flight that Norwegian does not offer complementary beverages or an in-flight meal without a hefty price, so I just made sure to grab a bite and bottle of water at JFK right before my flight and to pack my own little travel pillow (again, for $250 and a couple hours of layover saved by flying Norwegian, I can drop $10 on a sandwich before the flight and not starve, it is well worth it!). The flight was 20 minutes late boarding, though we actually arrived in Copenhagen on time. The flight itself was extremely comfortable. We boarded to music playing, they dimmed the lights quickly after take off, the cabin was pressurized at a lower altitude than most aircrafts are capable of which left me with very little jetlag, free and relatively fast wifi, and each seat was comfortable with it's own personal Android operating screen that contained several good movies & music albums to keep me entertained.

The Faro flight was very uncomfortable as it was so hot and stuffy - and you cant escape it but after talking to a helpful person in Norway I was assured the other 2 flights would be properly air conditioned which they were. Always prefer airlines where you can adjust seats and that was the case re Lanzarote. The short films would be better if we had headphones and could listen too (or simply listen to music). The free wifi just about allows for emails to be received or sent but you need a well charged device to take full advantage of wifi (or provide a charging point). Slightly confusing in regards to 'flight mode' regulations as clearly it only works if your device is not in flight mode! This is the one airline however where the food and drink options are too limited and lack 'healthy' choices or good veg options - (Easyjet are best for food/drink). Unlike any of the other airlines we have to remember to bring own snacks etc. Finally no hassle with hand baggage which used to be a pre-flight concern with extra stress when flying with Ryanair or Thomas Cook. Easyjet has the best and clearest policy here 'if it fits it is free'!.

It came with two hot sides and a dessert. One drink was included I chose wine and a glass of water. Just before landing we were offered a sandwich and one cold side with coffee tea or water. The movies were all included in the price of the ticket. Do your homework and find out which seats have extra legroom on a 10 hour flight this will make a difference! I was in a bulkhead aisle row 7 the only problem with this seat were careless passengers passing into the galley and stepping on my feet. The seat was comfortable enough definitely bring your own pillow and blanket or just purchase one from Norwegian for $20. I thought the price of drinks spirits beer and snacks was expensive but I did like the option of ordering through my TV screen and having it delivered. I also liked the inflight map showing our route. I would definitely fly with Norwegian again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

This is the first time I have used Oman I usually use Etihad or Emirates but I probably wont chose Oman again until they open the new airport in Muscat. The reason been there are no airbridges to get on and off the plane they use busses. This makes boarding a lot longer sat in a waiting area with no toilets or any facilities Also as the plane is at a remote stand there is no air conditioning until take off and with 300 passengers sat waiting at 45C it is unbearable making it very uncomfortable. 3 times I had to ask for a coffee the service was a hit and miss too.

The lounge at Dulles is very nice the plane was spacious food and wine were good. The return was fine as well. My next trip the first leg went very smoothly but now as I approach the final part I am terribly frustrated and disappointed with OpenSkies. Unfortunately I had to book my return flight for this summer in November when my schedule was still a bit up in the air. About 3 weeks ago however I finalized my schedule and saw to my dismay that I would need to change my ticket by about two months. I was bracing myself for a ticket change fee - but was shocked to find out that in order to change my ticket (giving them months notice) I will need to pay $450 in addition to about $150 extra for increased gas prices - that's $600 extra for a flight change with months notice! I emailed and called and spoke with many people - all said that same thing - that's policy no way around it. Now I don't expect a big cooperation to just change their policy for me but I do expect some sort of help or at least a little sympathy when I pay thousands of dollars for a ticket. The lack of care or sympathy from those I spoke and emailed with astonished me! Not only did they not give me a break at all but they didn't even put out the effort to seem sorry for my circumstances. Perhaps most people who use this airline are wealthy but I am not. I used them this year as a special treat and now I am absolutely paying for it. As of today I can buy a round trip ticket with British Airways from Paris to NY for less than $600. And unless a miracle happens soon I'll be paying $600 just to switch the day of my flight.

One appeared to be leased from PIA and was clearly older than me by quite some way. The biggest problem with the OX service was the toilets - it would appear that they clean them in BKK but not in HKG - perhaps the services are too expensive in HKG. So even when we got on to the plane the toilets were horrible. One steward took the student approach of holding his nose opening the door spraying in a load of deodorant and closing the door again. Nice. We have flown OX before but I don't think we would again. Before they were just endearingly rubbish but they really seem to have gone downhill. Part of the problem is the passengers: no-one seemed to have a clue that you're not supposed to stand up during final approach or that it's rude to recline your chair into someone's face as soon as you sit down or that you should fill in your immigration form before you get the immigration counter or that you should queue to get on and off the plane or that you shouldn't commute with people 10 rows behind you by shouting. As far as your fellow passengers are concerned it's the worst airline I've flown on. I do feel quite sorry for the cabin crew: they really have their work cut out. But that's no excuse for not bothering to clean the toilets and that was what would stop me flying on them again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I was woken up by one the stewardesses pushing her serving trolley and knocking into my shoulder. On her way back she did it again. However as I was awake this time I asked pointed it out that I had been barged into the stewardess just looked blankly at me in an intimidating manner. Then smiling sarcastically apologised.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,J Mitchell,United Kingdom,2014-09-10,Flew Gatwick - Arrecife - Gatwick. We flew with Norwegian as part of a package holiday booked through Monarch. At first we were surprised that we were flying with Norwegian instead of Monarch due to Monarchs flights being full. We were a bit concerned when we found out that the airline was a low cost airline but we were extremely impressed. Our outbound flight was on the 29/8/14. We used there self-service check in and it took no more than two minutes to print our boarding pass and drop our bags off and we were through security and airside within 5 minutes. The flight was 10 minutes delayed but the flight still managed to land so early that our coach wasn't even ready for us. Coming back on the 5/9/14 check-in was a nightmare we were in the middle of the queue for check in and still had to wait over 50 minutes it was only after about 30 minutes that they decided to open another check-in desk taking it up to two. The flight however still managed to board quickly and pushed back 10 minutes early. The aircraft we flew on was fairly new and had Boeings new cabin lighting which was really relaxing and changed colours. Cabin crew were smart professional and friendly and although you had to buy your own drinks and snack on the flight (very expensive but it's how they make their money) the service was very good. The plane had wifi and they use the wifi to display the flight details and flight map rather than on the overhead screens. Inflight entertainment was available on your phone/ipad/laptop for 7 euro but for a part of the flight they had short films playing on the screens such as Tom and Jerry. The only thing I can fault about the actual flight is that I found the seats fairly hard but at the end of the day the flight was less than 4 hours.

Of course I was only notified of the cancellation when I was in a taxi half way to the airport. I paid $1450 for my flight to Chicago due to booking only 5 days in advance. In addition Porter charged me $26 each way for the one bag I checked. On the return flight 0392 on Dec 10 2014 my bag was 1 kilo (2.2 lbs) over the limit. I was told I could remove weight or pay an additional $75 excess bag fee. At the same time the passenger at check in next to me was advised that he should carry on the bag he was going to check because it was below the carry on weight. I removed some items from my bag and went back to check in. The check-in agent advised me that my bag was now 1 kilo under and would I like to put anything back in my bag. What a joke. Absolutely no common sense with respect to the check-in agent. The flight was half empty so weight and balance was not an issue. Flight left about 10 minutes late and after 20 minutes in the air the captain came on the PA system to advise that a latch had come loose on the cargo door and we would be required to return to Chicago. Another 'mechanical' issue I suppose. Flight eventually left one hour later so that we arrived about 2 hours late. So Porter wasted 4 hours of my valuable time yet wanted to charge me $75 for having 1 kilo excess baggage. I think the service was really unacceptable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,4,0,NA,NA,1,0

I really wish I could give Porter Airlines a better rating. They have nice planes great staff the lounges are wonderful but their reliability makes me hesitant to use them again. More's the pity because it could be the best airline in North America. The flight from Newark to Toronto was on time and the service was faultless. On arrival in Toronto all looked okay for the next leg to Sudbury but then that flight was cancelled because of maintenance issues. I was shifted to a later flight scheduled to depart four hours later but was delayed by a further two hours. Many other flights were also delayed. Credit goes to the cabin crew on this flight for maintaining a positive demeanour despite being faced with a very grumpy passenger load. Based on comments I heard on the aircraft and have read on here cancellations and long delays have become commonplace at Porter. I think this airline is perhaps growing too fast and its aircraft inventory is too small to cope with anything but one of those extremely rare days when nothing goes wrong. It really needs to focus more on reliability.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,5,5,0,NA,NA,4,0

Was originally on the 4am flight but that got cancelled and passengers were moved to the next Davao flights luckily my friend and I were placed on the very next one (the 8.30 one). We were compensated with full meal breakfast while waiting for the flight. Our flight left on time and arrived in Davao according to schedule. The take-off and landing were superb and smooth. The flying experience is a great improvement the check-in counter and flight crew were professional. My only suggestion for PAL is to make seats more comfortable and to place personal built-in IFE on every seats at least on international flights if they want to compete with other international carriers. The iPad IFE doesn't look like a good idea especially at long haul ergonomically. Traditional seat-installed IFE is still the best way to go.

precision,/airline-reviews/precision,Precision Air customer review,Nick Francis,NA,2007-01-09,Precision is a subsidiary of Kenya Airways and operates flights out of Dar Es Salaam and Nairobi. Recently flew with them (as offered by our travel agent) connecting between Nairobi and Zanzibar. I was pleasantly surprised on both occasions having never heard of them before. Trip out of NBO left bang on time. Invited to identify our bag on the tarmac before boarding (it really is a massive weight off one's mind to see your bag being physically loaded onboard)! The crew while not the most friendly of ladies were nevertheless very efficient. Flew on an ATR-72 which was a little bit noisy and with leg-room at an abolsolute premium I wouldn't want to be stuck onboard for too long! However outbound was mid-morning and we were offered soft drinks and a very generous pack of cashews. The return was early morning so we had a really very passable continental breakfast box (croissant roll honey butter juice) and plenty of tea coffee and soft drinks. We were able to check our luggage right through to Heathrow in Zanzibar which was a real blessing. Do note though that if begining a long-haul journey out of a more rural African airport connecting in Nairobi it's almost ALWAYS necessary to collect a boarding pass at the transit desk at Jomo Kenyatta (NBO). Tip: if flying with Precision try and nab a seat as near to the rear as possible - you'll get off first and beat the masses to the desk!

Travelled on the London - Manila - London sectors several times from early December 2013 and was generally happy with the 777 comfort. However my recent journey from Manila to London was terrible. Evidently Philippine Airlines started using 15 year old A340 planes on the route in early August that appears to be part of the problem - slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality Middle Eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the in-seat media system - understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. Very basic food compared to alternative carriers. Philippine Airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for $500 which is then $500 less than a business ticket purchased online. Advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full - presumably passengers took the $500 check in upgrade. Philippine Airlines need to decide whether it wants to be a budget or premium player in the airline business.

Negatives were that both flights left around half an hour late with limited announcements and no obvious cause for delays other than the ""late arrival of the incoming flight"" mantra which airlines love bandying about these days. I'm not aware of being late to your last appointment being an acceptable excuse for being late to your next one in any other form of human activity. The other negative is the Qantas approach to pre-booked online seating. The tactic seems to be to open up very few seats in the hope that you will select an emergency exit at extra cost. I am happy so long as I have an aisle seat which took a bit of negotiation both flights and meant sitting next to the rear toilets. Incidentally I have never seen such long queues for toilets as I did on the return flight - two cubicles for 150 economy passengers is clearly inadequate on a four hour trip.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,4,3,NA,NA,3,1

Manual check-in only at Edinburgh as they do not offer online check-in however no queues. Older B737-300 and did not have wifi available. They did have the new slimline leather seats and seat pitch was more than adequate but for those taller than 5'6 it maybe more of an issue. Staff on board were friendly and onboard food available to buy was reasonably priced and looked of good quality. Landed in Stockholm early. Return flight similar to outgoing. Norwegian take part in Arlanda's common check-in kiosk system which allows you to check-in at Stockholm Central Railway Station before catching the Arlanda Express. Baggage allowance is generous and flexible. Landing at Arlanda is a big bonus as is allocation of seats before boarding and the overall service is worth the little bit extra over the competing service offered by Ryanair to Skavsta (which isn't even in Stockholm) - also without the general unpleasantness with that operator.

This is not such a direct criticism of them but seeing as there is no way to add feedback or complaints to their website I hope they read this and act on it. Check in at Dublin was very poor. Sky handling partners had only one person to check in a whole flight (for at least 30 mins until someone else came and helped). This was very frustrating as there is no online check in you have no option but to stand in line and painfully watch the families and groups of travelers slowly check in. Flight was at least an hour delayed. Scheduled departure time 1220 actual 1345. Why do they lie to you at the gate and say expected time 1300 - totally unrealistic. As for the actual flight no travel updates from pilots along the way and not much of an apology for the delayed flight from FA's. As I said though this is the 1st time I have had anything negative to say. As for the previous comment about bags. I actually like the lenient approach to cabin baggage.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,A Brown,Australia,2014-10-01,"I found four things seriously wrong with Qantas First Class. 1) The ""Chauffeur Drive"" service. Arriving in Sydney at 6.30am having booked a car I was surprised to be told (after finally locating the tiny unmarked desk) that there was a 15-20 minute wait until a car was available. Why? How? A car was booked. It should have been there end of story. Also in the car before my the previous flight (Sydney-London) I was delighted to receive an expletive-laden tirade across the driver's radio - apparently from one of his colleagues having a bad day. That is not ""first class"". 2) Baggage. Qantas advertises that First Class bags will be ""among the first"" to be delivered off the plane. On arrival in Sydney mine were among the last (both turning up on the carousel a full 50 minutes after landing; I do not remember the timing in London). 3) The breakfast. Scrambled eggs were dry. Avocado was unripe. Pancakes were also dry and overcooked. Coffee was weak and burnt. That is all. 4) The champagne. Qantas advertises three varieties. On every leg of the Sydney-London return trip the only one available was the Taittinger blanc de blancs.

Flight QR905, June 6th was delayed 45 mins. Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board,
something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min
delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we canât fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly.

However more recently I have twice flown with Regent on their new 737-400 aircraft fro Dhaka to Bangkok. However when they say new this actually means new for them as both aircraft are leased from other airlines and are actually starting to show signs of age. Only one of them has an onboard entertainment system which didn't work when I was on board and the other (seemingly older) aircraft actually still has ash trays in the arm rests which have been taped up to stop people from using them but on a lot of the seats the ash trays have been removed leaving a rather sharp and dangerous metal edge on the end of the arm rest. On my last trip from BK back to Dhaka the Pilot went AWOL and so were almost 2 hours late leaving BK. The meals on board are very typically Bangladesh and not good and of course you cannot get an alcoholic drink on board. The tea and coffee is also pretty bad.

Qantas phoned us on 8th just before we left for Barcelona airport to tell us that our seats were required for a bassinet booking from Dubai to Sydney. When we boarded our flight in Dubai on Friday 8 August there was neither a baby nor a bassinet to be seen. They had simply given our front row seats to two other passengers rather than letting us have our reserved seats back. If this is how the Qantas/Emirates codeshare works I want no part of it. The Purser on the flight was bemused as he told us that they were not expecting any baby or bassinet at 43B and C. Also our flight from Dubai to Sydney was going on to Auckland and the menu for breakfast arriving in Sydney was almost identical to that for the Sydney to Auckland sector just some subtle changes. I have no idea what the Trans-Tasman passengers were actually served as our flight was diverted to Brisbane for fuel when Sydney airport closed due to fog. Our flight arrived in Sydney about 11.00 instead of 06.00.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2015-05-11,A day before my return to LHR from BKK I received an email from Qatar offering me a good deal for an upgrade to Business Class which I took up. They were meant to start check-in process at BKK airport at 5 pm but did not do so till 5.20. Check in staff was excellent and efficient. I was offered a drink after boarding but not a hot or cold towel. The person next to me was offered both. I opted for a middle seat in order to have aisle access; configuration of 777 is 2-2-2. The seats are indeed very comfortable but there is not much privacy. I was rather disappointed again with the food. I was expecting a lot more. It was all nicely presented and the FAs do go out of their way to make one's journey enjoyable but I do not think the food was as good as people claim and I have had much better food on Cathay and BA in Business. The food from Doha to LHR was even less interesting. And on this leg on an A340-600 the seat was much smaller and with even less privacy. The person next to me almost damaged my glasses which I had put on the little shared area between the seats. The business lounge at Doha is superb but again the food was a let down. My option salmon was not available from the a la carte menu. I had a lamb which was hard and very salty. The buffet stuff looked like something from my local Waitrose and was simple. The snack area was far more interesting. They prepare whatever you want. Lovely. There are many areas in the lounge including a large business room next to which there is an area hardly anyone uses. The so-called 'quiet area' was anything but quiet: people snoring breaking winds pulling trolleys talking etc. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and in no way one can have a good nap there. I do not understand why they cannot put stuff like in the BA's cabanas at T5 with blankets.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2015-04-27,LHR-DOH-BKK in economy all the way on their brand new A380. Two great trips. Only problem is that the food is terrible and portions extremely small. Why do they bother? Best take your own. I had a rubbery chicken which tasted like something else. Space in economy seats on the A380 is extremely generous equivalent to BA WT+. Very impressive. Connection at Doha was very easy: off the plane and straight into departure area for connecting passengers no security check there. I am a BA Gold card EC so am allowed to use First check in First lounges and priority boarding. However Qatar is so fussy about its premium passengers I was not allowed to board via priority First class boarding even though I was in small economy cabin at the back of the upper deck where First and Business are located. I had to board and disembark via usual channels via lower cabin which means if you are in economy in the upper deck you will be last to disembark. Cosy small cabin though. Is this in breach of Oneworld rules regarding perks of being Emerald? The word that first came to my mind is segregation. They take incredible measures to protect their premium passengers from any contact with the rest of us ordinary mortals. I have never seen anything like this in my many years of continuos travelling in First Business and economy. Staff are professional. I had access to First class lounge at Doha which is gigantic nice but mayhem at peak hours. Amazing service though. The good thing about it is that there are several areas one could choose from. I went for the one adjacent to the business centre which was very quiet indeed. Both flight were not full. LHR to DOH was almost empty.

The small cabin was not an issue on 80min flights. Seats comfortable and adequate room. Only recommendation is to not take too much carry-on baggage as there is limited storage space. Both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy. Great addition to both flights were the FAs who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack - either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either tea/coffee/water. On the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems. The weather in Byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion. Staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon Virgin flight. I'd recommend REX over Virgin and Jetstar.

Unlike another airline that completely mishandled my bookings Qantas called me regularly rescheduled flights quickly and allowed free changes to connecting flights that I couldn't make because of a problem with a different airline. That's generally the biggest plus about Qantas - their customer service and ground organisation is efficient and problems are generally resolved quickly. Inflight the experience was good with nothing special. Medium-quality food. Service appears to improved drastically compared to a few years ago.

Qantas flight attendants are some of the most attentive and professional I have come across. The amenity kit was nice and included what one would expect. The printed menu was a bit too casual and three were left for me which was a bit confusing because they were all different. It took me a while to realise (small letters which I find hard to read) that two were from the previous Sydney to Santiago and Santiago to Rio legs (on 11 June the Rio service was a special for the World Cup). Qantas certainly are well above the average and are different in many ways from other airlines. They try to be so different that they do not have a sign for the Business or First classes check in areas in Australia but instead there is just one in black that says Service. This is annoying and idiotic.

Please either use newer planes with IFE flights 3+ hours or give out ipads Q streaming as is done on the 767.

Top professional service and a sense of a quality product on these 747 flights .I only wonder why Qantas doesn't offer Premium Economy Seating on its A330 flights into Asia as does Cathay Pacific. I'm sure it would be a winner.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1
royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,A Sargeant,Australia,2015-04-04,Melbourne-Bangkok-Melbourne. Royal Brunei continue to provide an excellent value for money going to Bangkok. It is a dry airline and no alcohol is served. The Cabin Crew are friendly and look to provide a good service. I have yet to meet an unhelpful flight attendant! The flight from Australia left on time and I easily made the short connection time for the flight to Bangkok. Food on all sectors is good and presented well. The Dreamliner (B787) is an excellent aircraft - it is spacious and the beds are lie flat and quite comfortable. The A320 from Brunei to Bangkok is the traditional seat up Business Class but reasonably comfortable for a short haul journey. The return journey was ultimately cancelled because of technical problems the first suggestion of delay came when the first boarding call was about to be made. There were a couple of further delays and notice given of them. It was five o'clock when the flight was to be cancelled. Business Class passengers were accommodated in a five star hotel with dinner and breakfast provided. No lunch had been provided but we did have access to the Business Lounge. Cancellation of my flight meant that I missed a connecting flight on a separate ticket to Canberra and Royal Brunei arranged for me to catch the same flight (at no extra cost) on the next day. An option was given to fly economy class on a different carrier and arriving on the same day as planned but I declines this. For the Business Class passengers I was satisfied with the treatment and the hotel that was utilized we were kept reasonably well informed as to what was happening and what the options were. I will continue to use Royal Brunei to/from Bangkok.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,J Keep,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,LHR â DOH â MAA return on 21st â 31st December â14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. Itâs fair to say that our impression of Qatarâs in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average â all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha â Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and weâd been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating itâs 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats.

Fast and efficient check in in Bangkok the Express Lane saved a lot of time getting through Immigration and Security. Everything went well and was on time. Cabin attendants were attentive and the food and presentation up to my expectations for Business Class. Good meal and friendly service between Bangkok and Brunei (Cabin was full). From Brunei it was the new Dreamliner with its comfortable and a flat bed. Dinner was good and the movie selection was OK but not outstanding. At around half the cost of Thai or Qantas Business Class it represents exceptional value. Royal Brunei does not serve alcohol on the flights so have a drink in Melbourne or Bangkok before the flight. The will allow you to take a small bottle on board and drink it on the first sector.

Qantas seems to me to have recently undergone a 'mood change' with a noticeable enhancement of service. Best aspects of this particular trip were the First Class Lounge at Sydney the American Airlines Admirals Club (which Qantas uses) at Santiago the excellent food and wines but above all the superb service despite a very full aircraft. If you get a good Qantas cabin crew you will get some of the world's best. Perhaps a word should also be said for the level of engineering and technology that we take for granted these days: it simply amazes me that an aircraft (747-400 in this case) can transport us accurately for 14 hours non-stop over the remote Antarctic Ocean in absolute comfort and safety and also arrive at destinations within one minute of scheduled times - incredible.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Considering the cost of our flights we were really impressed. The plane was clean the IFE worked and the touch screens were very responsive and I found the cabin a bit more spacious than other planes. The staff were very friendly. On both trips the plane was half empty so we were able to spread out and have a set of 3 seats to ourselves. The bathrooms remained fairly clean during the flight although I wouldn't recommend sitting too close to the front as the bathroom smell permeates towards the first few rows of economy. One family were sitting in the window seats and left their lights throughout the overnight flight to Melbourne which were quite bright and shone towards the middle seats where we were seated.

Upon boarding it was noticeable that the level of cleanliness was not up to scratch. Staff spoke broken English and were all rather rude. Half way through the flight I started to get a head-ache switched on the attendants light and sat there in excess of 20 minutes before a very kind fellow passenger actually went up to the business class section to speak to the crew manager.

CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER quite a new plane great IFE with very big screen on time departure and early arrival in Doha very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600 to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple) due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777 service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed.

On one flight I boarded with an upset stomach and the flight attendant brought me some quality white wine from business class which helped enormously. Generally very full flights but on-time departures. I especially appreciated the careful route track selection to avoid headwinds on the westbound flights and to take advantage of these strong westerly winds for the eastbound flights meaning all flights either arrived exactly on time or were early. The Perth Qantas Club lounge is huge but at peak hour is still somewhat difficult to find space to sit down. Qantas have very annoying and intrusive people mover buggies sounding their warning sirens while moving around their Brisbane terminal (also the same in Sydney and Melbourne) - and mostly just transporting crew and friends about - what's wrong with a bell or soft honking horn as is the case in terminals such as Hong Kong?

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2014-10-31,Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all honesty isn't the best Iâve been in but as it was almost empty its OK to while away an hour or so plus they come and tell you when your gate is open. Unfortunately the usual carryon once in the departure area of people standing directly in front of the doors despite being told to sit down and wait for the announcements a few passengers tried to follow the wheelchairs through the doors. Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around.

Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in.

From start to finish all members gave the impression they had a lot of hard work to do. Why is a smile something so difficult to provide? There was no pre-service of aperitifs (even though aperitifs were listed on the menus handed out at the start). The food was excellent: I really enjoyed the taste of all that was offered on both legs of my SYD-LHR trip. Wine appeared to be supplied grudgingly and there was no offer of ""seconds"" of coffee â routine on BA flights. Legroom on the A380 was adequate. The plane was clean. The seats were not comfortable â after a bit their hard pressure on the backs of the thighs became annoying. The ridiculously low maximum weight limit for Qantas cabin baggage is a major reason for avoiding this airline regardless of other considerations.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,1,5,5,NA,NA,2,0
qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Walker,Bangladesh,2014-01-29,Living in Asia there are not a lot of route choices with Qantas especially as they have recently withdrawn a lot of their Asian flights and/or downgraded from 747 and A380 to A330 aircraft. However as I am still a Qantas Gold member I decided to remain loyal and travel back to Brisbane (via Sydney) from Bangkok. This flight used to have Premium Economy but since the introduction of the 330 aircraft there is only Business or Economy and so because of the exorbitant price for Business Class ($3920) I chose to travel Economy. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable with a ridiculously small amount of leg room (I am only 178cm so I have no idea how a tall person would cope). The seat fabric and carpet was very worn and faded and stained and the entertainment system only worked for the first 2 hours of my return trip. The food was terrible but thankfully the wine was good. However by far the worst issue is the FA's most of them have obviously been in their jobs way too long and no longer seem to enjoy what they do and show it through their couldn't care less attitude and lack of attentiveness to their customers. I am now thinking about taking my loyalty to Malaysia Thai or Cathay Pacific all of which are far better and less expensive than Qantas.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

Boarding was organized with families with kids first and people with special needs. Then Business class and priority customers.

As is often noted in these columns if you get a good Qantas cabin crew they are the world's best. The FAs in business were superb and extremely professional. Lunch service and wines excellent. Only downside on this trip was that the business lounge in Brisbane (used for business class and platinum members) was closed so one had to endure a bunch of yobs and their beer and noise in the normal Qantas Lounge. Impossible to work in the normal Qantas Lounge that day so better to sit and work outside in the boarding area.

Overall experience in seating was not pleasant rather painful experience. 1) Leg room space appears to be one of the smallest of all the planes I have traveled with. This leg room issue is made worse by the passenger in front of you if (s)he pushes the recliner back. With the recliner pushed back there is little space to enjoy the food. No wonder the movie monitor has great viewing tilt angle (top-bottom) as the screen gets so close to your face. 2) There is a rectangular shape power box on the floor between the middle seat and the aisle seat which forces your leg to be tilted while resting. You will need to place your foot at an off angle. (4) Rest room was very small so small that I couldn't even bend over to wash my face. No more Qantas!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,2,1,3,NA,NA,1,0

Out of 10 trips in 10 weeks the plane has been delayed by more than 45 minutes twice causing me to miss my flight connections. Let's not even talk about smaller time delays. When I was flying business from BWN to BKI on 19 April 2012 the flight was delayed and I was not going to be able to make my connection. I asked the staff in the business lounge whether she could switch my flight to Singapore and she said she had to ask her manager to come to a decision whether they could switch my flight. The manager took more than 20 minutes to arrive and because of that they couldn't issue me a flight ticket due to the fact that we were too close to the boarding time for Singapore. The attitudes of attendants and the bureaucratic decision making hierarchy of Royal Brunei creates a highly antagonistic customer environment. In addition for the past 3 months that I have been flying Royal Brunei the online check in facility isn't available. Imagine that from a full-service airline!

Though I had pre-ordered the food online 72 hours before the plane departure from my frequent flier account the staff on the plane didn't have the update and hence my children were served the normal food. During the return leg I had chosen the seats at the front-end of the aircraft and yet they put me at the back-end of the aircraft which was a bit disappointing.

Service was very mixed - some flight attendants excellent some seem to have been in their roles for too many years and were keen to show it. Food and wine very good on Qantas PE possibly the best globally. The Big problem was the domestic connection on return in Sydney - what a shambles. The return flight from SCL was just 10 minutes late but already being aware from their schedules that I had about 70 minutes to make domestic connections I made special effort to ensure I only had carry-on luggage would utilise my APEC card to assist rapid immigration and have an Express Pass as well. Despite being a Platinum Frequent Flyer having my boarding pass properly checked at the International Terminal Transit Area as being valid for my next flight and then arriving at the new departure gate at least 35 minutes before the scheduled boarding time (an hour before scheduled departure time) when I was finally boarding I was then abruptly bumped off the flight 'as the Qantas computer advised it would normally be too late for someone to make my connection and so they had allocated my seat to another passenger'. By then I had been 27 hours without sleep and had to struggle to find a seat on that flight or next flight. It was an awful experience overall and one wonders how the IT programming and scheduling guys at Qantas develop such a program that causes such a problem. A final point is that maybe it is time globally for it to be acceptable to tip airline flight attendants for good service if they provide it. Although we are all aware flight attendants are primarily on-board for safety reasons surely it would be possible to tip the service component of their duties and perhaps make them happier.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,3,5,3,NA,NA,4,0

Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Steve Bennett,United Kingdom,2013-11-25,DXB to LHR on A380 Economy Class. I picked up an inexpensive Emirates flight to Hong Kong and one of my options for the DXB to LHR leg was to fly on a code share flight operated by Qantas. I have never flown on the A380 nor have I experienced Qantas before I decided to take this option rather than stick with Emirates for the whole return journey. Sadly I have to say that this was a mistake. Emirates outshines Qantas in just about every respect. The first problem was not of Qantas's making insofar as we were delayed by over 2 hours in Dubai because of the late arrival of flight QF1 from Sydney. Obviously this is beyond the control of the airline. Embarkation was pretty chaotic. There was no call for families with younger children to board first resulting in kids blocking the gangways and frustrated parents attempting to get them into their seats before other passengers came along. Seats in economy are a little wider but they also seem to be lower so I was constantly scraping my shines when trying to extend my legs under the seat in front. There really does not seem to be much room from the seated position to the back of the seat in front of you especially if the person in front decides to recline their seat so watching a movie is not very comfortable. The entertainment on offer is nowhere near that offered by Emirates and as for the food â the best way to describe it was inedible. For supper the offering was a chicken filled wrap and tea or coffee. I know that airline food in economy is hardly considered gourmet class but this offering was disgusting. In comparison the Emirates flight from HKG to DXB offered a fish dish on Thai noodles or a beef bourguignon together with dessert and cheese and a granary bread roll a lot better than a floury disgusting wrap. The inflight entertainment on Qantas can best be described as adequate. Emirates entertainment is far superior. Finally a word or two about the cabin crew. On Emirates the crew members seem to want to help you. On the flight I have just taken it seemed like an Imposition to ask for anything. The crew were all in the galley area and I wandered down to see if I could get a cup of coffee. The looks I got from one stewardess in particular seemed to scream that I was being a pain. I am sorry to be so scathing about Qantas. I was looking forward to the experience of flying with them. Sad to say the expectation greatly exceeded the reality and Emirates will get my custom for all the legs on my next trip to the Far East or beyond.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,1,3,NA,NA,3,0

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2013-10-29,SYD-HKG-SYD in Premium Economy - two of the most unusual flights I have ever had but which don't seem to fit the Travel Experience categories. Qantas has a great premium economy product: very good food and wines and generally excellent service in this part of the cabin. However on this set of flights I had unhappy experiences: for SYD- HKG I did not get my usual window seat preference even though I am a platinum frequent flyer. This is sort of ok but after take off I was asked to swap seats with someone who couldn't get his IFE to work which I was pleased to do but then found myself surrounded by a bunch of passengers who were it seems trying to drink as much alcohol as possible and who invited their mates up from the back of the plane to join in the party which generally took place in the isles or at the front of this cabin. This made for a terrible flight experience as one could neither work nor sleep due to the loud talking and calls for more drinks - which I was slightly surprised to see Qantas staff obligingly provided. On the return travel the staff at the boarding gate insisted on changing my boarding pass to give me one for someone of another name (it was a woman's name as well and I am not a woman) and then arguing with me that this other passenger was me! A bizarre and embarrassing experience to say the least especially as this also held up the boarding process for some time with other passengers glaring at me as if it was all my fault. My guess is that this boarding pass was for a woman who they had given my original seat to.

Check-in line looked horrendous at first but it moved well and we were on our way in about 30 minutes. I found it strange though that you first had to queue up for a baggage weight check then go to the counter and have your bags weighed again. IAH-DOH was in a B777-300ER. The 3-3-3 configuration that QR uses is far superior to the 3-4-3 setup that more and more airlines are using today as the extra inch or two of width provides a feeling of much more personal space. Seat pitch at 33 inches is also better than many long-haul carriers and as we had seats directly in front of a bulkhead had unlimited recline at our disposal which made for a more comfortable flight. I was able to get about 5 hours of sleep. Two meals are served with decent taste and quality and free wine beer and spirits available. I had heard horror stories about the transit procedure in DOH but found it quite painless and it took just 35 minutes to get from our plane through the bus ride and security and to our onward gate. Boarding process for our DOH-MAA leg was a bit chaotic. Boarding starts very early more than an hour before takeoff and you are initially herded into a holding area with far too few seats compared to the number of people. You are eventually boarded onto a bus followed by an extremely long ride to the plane at which point we were held for a further 5-10 minutes. Once on board everything was fine though I found the A330-200 considerably more cramped than the 777. The IFE box didn't help but the seats were also an inch narrower and with an inch less pitch. On both legs the IFE system is excellent with a wide variety of AVOD shows/movies and games along with a customizable flight map. Meal was the typical ""veg/non veg"" option you get headed to India and quality was not nearly as good as on the IAH-DOH leg.

I had issues with my TV. It kept cutting out the entire flight. The beds are rights next to one and other. I was lucky as I was traveling with my husband but if I was sleeping that close to a stranger I wouldn't have enjoyed it. With other airlines you can put up a screen which you can't do on this plane.

Check in at Manchester was fine due to my height 6ftâ6 I'd asked for a note to be posted on the system asking for a seat with extra legroom. Priority boarding for Privilege Club members took off a few minutes late flight seemed to be full. The cabin crew soon were coming around with drinks and menus entertainment system ready for use I checked what was on offer and was watching my first choice movie when the meal was served. I had a chicken noodle dish which was one the best meals I'd had in economy class. I rarely sleep on a flight but I may have dozed off for a few minutes before watching a few more movies. Arrived at Doha earlier than expected I had 1 hour 20 minutes transit so had booked the Al Maha Fast track service a very efficient young lady met me at the plane and travelled with me on the transfer bus escorted me direct to the onward check-in for the next flight and straight passed the queue to the departure bus. Bangkok flight was on 777 a vast improvement on the airbus comfort wise similar to previous flight movie and a little doze had a walk down to the galley for a drink and spent some time chatting to the cabin crew. A nice breakfast and arrived in Bangkok on time. Luggage already on the conveyor by the time I'd cleared customs. When I checked in for return flight I used my Qmiles to upgrade to business class from Doha - Manchester so checked in at the business counter and discovered I'd been upgraded to Silver level so I was given access to the priority customers clearance and a pass to the business lounge a nice surprise. Just after boarding the senior cabin attendant came to see me and explained she was aware that my next flight was in business and that prior to landing in Doha she would move me to a seat closer to the business cabin so I could go on the business class but direct to the premium terminal. I spent 8 hours in Doha that the reason for the upgrade to business had a nice dinner followed by breakfast before boarding the flight.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Pease,France,2015-07-20,"I'm starting to fly this route more regularly, and for the first time have to report what I consider to be a significant failing with the cabin crew. Our plane (FR7974) left late (after a late inbound arrival). I was sitting in Row 2. There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair.

Initially flight attendant didn't come with water or a hello but then the purser saw me (I was in the last row and she was up in the forward galley) and brought me water and a smile. She made this flight great along with another flight attendant. Smiles - constant refills on drinks. The food on RJ is awesome! Flavourful and quantifies are massive.

Flight back was very different - we left the gate on time but 40 mins late to depart. My partner and I had reserved seats together which was confirmed by Royal Jordanian in Amman but on check in we were given seats apart. No explanation was given by Royal Jordanian as to why the seats were changed (there was no aircraft change).

No choice but to fly with them due to virtual door-to-door nature of route for quick Maltese holiday with a bit of business thrown in. Was expecting the worst but pleasantly surprised by on-time flights for both sectors decent if unspectacular seating and lack of the patrolling of queue by staff looking for oversized baggage - it appears that they've chilled out a little. So nothing to complain about as such other than Â£4 for a 330ml can of Heineken which I obviously passed on.

scoot,/airline-reviews/scoot,Scoot customer review,Ian Loftus,Australia,2014-01-02,PER-SIN-PER just after Christmas as the fares were incredibly cheap (less than $850 for three people to SIN and back). Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot. I was actually surprised that something so bad could actually come from Singapore. Only recommended on the basis of price.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,3,1,0,NA,NA,5,1

Booked Economy class but added all extras as Scoot were offering a possibility of being upgraded. This did not happen but I was able to pay for an upgrade at the airport for a very reasonable price. Check in looked chaotic but I was checked in at the sales desk after I was upgraded. Flight itself was delayed slightly at Sydney (20 mins) but on-board the crew were very genuine and friendly and the seat was very comfortable although there were a few issues of lights going on and off. The way some people choose to sit seems to activate the lights which isn't really the passengers fault.

sas-scandinavian-airlines,/airline-reviews/sas-scandinavian-airlines,SAS Scandinavian customer review,A Mackenzie,Denmark,2013-12-16,SAS-CPH-LHR. SK503. Copenhagen airport was very quiet when I got there on Tuesday. SAS is constantly upgrading passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting through the airport to your gate. Their latest development is a self-service Bag Drop. Fairly simple to use. The bag is put on an unmanned luggage conveyer belt which the machine registers and weighs. The passenger then uses a bar reader gun to pick up the details from the luggage tag. The bag is then transported away. Any problems/machine errors are sorted out by a member staff on call. So now all normal pre-flight checks and documentation before security (including passport verification) can be done without staff contact and hopefully without queuing.

I pre-paid for meals but wouldn't do so again. In future I would bring my own food. I also pre-paid for ""Scoot-thru."" - the Scoot transfer facility in Singapore for Scoot-Scoot or Tiger passengers. The advantage of doing this is that it provides a similar connection facility to that of just about any legacy carrier. Not pre- paying this fee means that if I had missed the connecting flight I would have had to pay (according to Scoot terms and conditions) a re-booking fare and the fare differential for the next available flight even if the problem was with Scoot. Paying the ""Scoot-thru"" fee also meant that in Singapore I did not have to claim my bag clear customs and check in again for the connecting flight.

The lounge at CPH was better but not up to the standard of a major carrier's hub (at least not on the first level where Business class passengers are directed) - the only wine (2 choices - red or white) came from beer taps and the food selection was bare bones for an early evening transcontinental departure. Once on board things looked up - with 1 recurring annoying exception - both my seat mate and I both women never got an offer to hang up our jackets and finally wound up hanging them up ourselves - this happens to me a lot and always burns me.

scoot,/airline-reviews/scoot,Scoot customer review,Andrew Wright,Australia,2012-08-01,Very uncomfortable seats hard narrow and without proper neck support as you find on Jetstar. Though the pitch is okay the placement of the seat supports meant that I felt cramped at the window seat. I emerged off my flights feeling stiff and sore. I missed the moving map as there are no cabin screens. Issues with inadvertent pressing of call buttons mean that they are often ignored by staff even when required. Attendants seemed helpful but difficult to hear and understand over the cabin noise. No online check in and lack of early check at the desk is inconvenient when departing from Changi to Sydney at 2 am as you can't use all Changi's wonderful airside facilities.

singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,V Sitaraman,India,2015-01-14,I am a very satisfied frequent traveler on SQ and this review only covers the way they serve their special meals in general and the inconvenience this procedure causes on short flights. I noted down the exact service timings on a 75 minute flight (SQ959) between Jakarta and Singapore on 4 Dec 14. Flight take off 15.05 special meals service started 15.15 I was served at 15.50 and my tray was taken away at 16.03 when I had not quite finished the meal. If you order a special meal you will be embarrassed to receive it too early when your neighbors have even not received their drinks. The tray-by-tray special meal service takes so much time that those receiving a standard meal have very little time to eat it at least on short flights. In the glory days of Malaysian Airlines (which I almost exclusively flew between 1998 to 2009) somehow they would bring the special and regular meals together so that all passengers were served at the same time. Wonder if SQ could think of some way to reduce the time lag between special meal and regular meal service? This is not a complaint but a suggestion.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,4,1
ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,B Thompson,United Kingdom,2014-05-25,Use of Ryanair is generally a last resort. Flight last Friday from Treviso to Bristol was due to take off at 15:20 but about 30mins beforehand a small storm arrived with torrential rain and lightning meant there was likely to be some delay. However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known! Eventually arrived back in Bristol over four hours late. Needless to say will not be rushing to use Ryanair again anytime soon!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,0

The new seven day check-in rule is a bit of a pain because it applies for each leg of the trip separately. So (seven days in advance) we had to check in for the flight out on the 12th May and for the flight back on the 14th.

singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,J Stevens,Australia,2015-01-05,BKK-SIN-MEL. Of course the service could not be faulted. The main problem we had with our return trip is that we had medium haul 777 and on the way over the much more comfortable long haul product. The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed). It was a bit disappointing. As it was a midnight flight both ways the ides of offering meals just after take off or two hours before landing is a great one but the breakfasts on both trips were terrible on the way home inedible. I know the food in economy is much better.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,5,1,5,NA,NA,4,1

All four sectors were on the A380 and I had economy seating on the main deck for two trips and on the upper deck for the other two. Smoothest take-offs I have experienced and smooth quiet flights in general. Excellent service from flight attendants who treat you like they want you to fly with them again. They would come back and check on people who had questions or didn't understand how to operate the entertainment system. Adequate legroom and very good entertainment system to help you pass the hours. Most meals were excellent and flight attendants came through at non-serving times to offer snack items. Only minor issues: the entertainment system would lag a bit on playback of films and the tray table/seating areas could use a bit of a deep clean. Otherwise this was the first time I had flown Singapore Airlines in nearly five years and it remains as good as I remember - my favourite airline.

Cabin staff friendly and seemed interested in their work and passengers. Comfortable economy seats. Although I was amongst the first to arrive at the gate on departure at LHR we could board the aircraft straight away which was a very pleasant change and I wish more airlines would do this. Flight left 20 mins late due to the tug breaking down and having to be replaced and some turbulence en-route. I think the Captain said we were at 4100ft but would descend to a lower level to make the flight smoother. On the return leg I did have to sit by the gate but we all boarded a nearly full flight to leave on time and land back in London 15 mins ahead of schedule. I was in seat 4A which had a bit more leg room which was nice but must be near a heating vent so that at times I wondered if I was in a sauna.

SAS has a habit of blocking off a number of seats so the choice can be somewhat limited during internet check-in. I noted a number of unused seats on the plane in rows ahead of us which had not been available. After a 45 minute Bus and Metro journey we arrived at Copenhagen T3. A fairly new terminal used almost exclusively by SAS. We were obliged to register and print out our baggage labels from one of the kiosks before we dropped off our bags in less than two minutes (having noticed that although the L/H side of the terminal had horrendous queues the R/H side had only one or two passengers â SAS really should have staff to direct passengers with bags). Security was reasonably quiet. The A-321 was l full clean and bright and we were offered a free cup of tea or coffee everything else was paid for.

Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again.

The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work. The meal was good but drinks service was infrequent.

No information was volunteered the check in staff were not employees of the airline and couldn't explain the delay so i spent a thoroughly dull afternoon in one of the least interesting airports in Europe. Speaking to my Czech friend again she told me that because they are quite new and not part of the CSA (Czech Airlines) ""club"" Smart Wings is basically the first carrier to be bumped down the priority list when problems occur. I hope this will change because there is clearly a growing demand for cost effective travel to what is a delightful city but I am personally going to leave Smart Wings alone for the time being and pay the little bit extra with easyjet CSa or Lufthansa.

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,G Taylor,United States,2015-02-18,"Tampa FL to Phoenix AZ on 2/5. Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option.

On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages.

The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase.

Boarding process as someone here said is a cattle car thing they board by groups and family traveling together in different groups start scenes on the gate it delays everything.

I fly business to South Africa and SAA is the worst. The flight crew was horrible and on every leg you had to beg them for service. From JFK-JNB I sat next to a SAA rep who noticed my lack of attention from the flight crew. It gets worse. I tried to return early back to the USA and no one over the phone will help you in South Africa. I was told to go to the airport which I did for 8 hrs. I was finally put on a flight from JNB back to JFK about 30 mins before flight after waiting and being extorted to pay almost 700 in fees. Who can you complain to in JNB? No one was willing to help.

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,Lee Ho Seok,United States,2013-03-06,CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected. Definitely something WN may have to work on.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers.

Price of WiFi has recently been increased to $8 or $5 for streaming TV/movies only but you can access Southwest.com a shopping site and a flight tracker for free. Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point.

The pilot has announced that the FAA is completing the log book and the flight attendants should provide us complimentary snacks and drinks. Only one gate for this flight and no plan B is on of their continued problem and the lack of customer service is another major issues. Any consideration for sending a bus and have us deplane?

Srilankan airlines gives you 40kg luggage allowance and lounge access it doesn't get any better. Service is always attentive and smiles all the way food is very delicious and nicely presented which is one of their strong points. This route often use the flatbed which offers so much more luxury and comfort. Great leg room storage space large AVOD screen etc. Entertainment system is okay not the top of the top but passable. Duty free shopping is great often they have incredible promotions. Only one gripe is their chaotic boarding process in BKK business class passengers weren't given any priorities which to me was very disappointing.

Spirit came in at a reasonable $391 out of a tiny airport in PA - free parking - yes that small. The flight crew were fantastic I think they got their training from Southwest!

Main dissatisfaction was that after making very specific enquiries about weight and dimensions of cabin baggage we scrupulously limited ourselves to 7kg only to see people carrying large cumbersome and clearly heavy cases onto the aircraft. If they make rules they should enforce them and not rely on Brits to do all the compliance! On three out of four meal services the options shown on the menu card we had been ceremoniously presented with had run out. On one occasion a cabin stewardess made a special effort to try to provide something better than the default. Ordering a drink that came out of a can (eg beer) you did not get the can - just a glass! The safety demonstration was very poor. I was twenty rows back from the cabin crew and they simply seemed to wave their arms around to demonstrate the emergency exits. Terrible lack of rigour. Ironic that we had to make a safety stop at Frankfurt on return to London and the cabin crew we called upon to demonstrate emergency procedures again just before we landed. That said the flight was reasonably comfortable and passenger handling otherwise to an acceptable standard. My main yardstick is BA who would win hands down.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

Tried repeatedly to check in online but got an automated message that this was not possible. BA desk at Manchester confirmed they could not through check pax or luggage. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the baggage collection on arrival from Manchester transfer between terminals and so called âfast-trackâ security was a nightmare taking almost 3 hours. Lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used â spacious and relaxing environment. Boarding was a bit chaotic. Families with children called first no preference given to business class. Onboard service and environment was similar to typical business/club class with many other airlines with the exception of the entertainment system (very limited selection not easy to use poor quality sound). Crew very attentive drinks served frequently good choice of western and Sri Lankan meals for dinner and breakfast. Flat bed was very comfortable. Good Bulgari amenity kit. Returned in economy class (2-4-2 configuration). No queue for check in at Colombo and were allocated requested seats. Surprised that we were automatically through checked to Manchester even though we were overnighting at HRW. CMB airport was a reasonable size with a good selection of shops. Airport has a limited number of toilets and these can be very busy at certain times. Clear boarding announcements. Good welcome and attentiveness from crew. No amenity kit despite this being a 12 hour flight. Seat pitch and width is not significantly better or worse than many scheduled economy seats. There was no foot rest.

There is no IFE on this flight of 4 1/2 hours duration - not even a route map displayed on an overhead screen (although all seat armrests had IFE controls fitted). You cannot lift any armrests so even if you have three seats of a row to yourself there is no way you could lie down across all seats. Catering is basic. A carton of fruit juice or water from the trolley prior to the meal service.

But the system just decides to charge one person $100. Alright we'll just get it fixed with the desk lady. Nope not really! She ""can't help"". But she can inform us that our carry on bag costs $50 more too. They charge for every bag - carry on and checked plus surcharges for more than one bag.

The only hitch on this trip is that upon returning to DFW we could not get our checked luggage for over 1.5 hrs. It was very frustrating. But if you need a cheap seat and you can pack light and either pay the carry on charge for you luggage or just put everything in a small backpack then Spirit may work for you. We also had to wait once we landed for a gate to open up so we sat on the ground an extra 15 minutes before our plane could get into a gate. I also brought my own snacks so make sure you do that. I chose to purchase water after passing through security and getting inside the terminal. I took my bottled water in my small backpack along with my snacks onto the airplane and this was not a problem. Other than these problems it went relatively well. I checked in online and printed my boarding passes online from my home. The Spirit staff and the airport and on both flights were acceptable. Also Spirit was one of few airlines that offered DFW to PDX non-stop which for me is important because I don't like multiple flights. Bottom Line.

During check-in they informed us that the CMB-MLE leg of our trip had been cancelled and that we that it was rescheduled for next morning. At CMB we asked the information counter about the transit hotel assigned to us at BKK. They claimed to have never heard of it and were no help at all whatsoever. All this happened in the middle of the night so we were really frustrated. The woman at the transit counter was exceptionally rude. We were then put on a bus with some other passengers and were brought to a small and very dirty little inn quite a long way from the airport. On the way to BKK the MLE handling agents refused to check us in saying that our ticket (issued by SriLankan) was for 15 days while our visa covered only 14.

Despite other airlines left on time StarPeru gave the explanation that the weather permitted the plane from departing while everyone could see technical staff trying to fix an engine. In Spanish and English it was announced that ""news will appear in half an hour"". The ""half-an-hours"" became one-and-a-half during that afternoon until the flight to Lima finally was cancelled and was planned for next morning at 6AM. Thereafter everything was chaos. No money for taxis and hotels were offered only that we could get our luggage. So we went having to pay everything ourselves - a very bad experience. The plane was airborne 6.15am next morning landed in Cusco and were delayed here caused by technical problems meaning further delay. Nothing was explained.

Employees were friendly and the plane arrived on time. There was basically no leg room (I'm 6'0 185 lbs) but it's not like my knees were on the seat in front of me. I joined the $9 club and had everybody I booked tickets for split that cost; our trip there and back was a couple hundred less than any other airline I looked at. The complaints about the lack of free food/drinks and high baggage fees are ridiculous to me. There is a reason the base price is so low so understand what you're buying first because I had zero surprises when I showed up at the airport. I wouldn't want to be on a Spirit plane for any kind of international flight (unless I made the seat upgrade) but for a 2-3 hour trip the savings are worth it. This is especially true if you're traveling light. My only legitimate complaint was they lost my bag from Vegas back to Chicago but they shipped it to my house within a few days. I was the only one on the flight who lost his bags and I know losing bags is not an isolated occurrence for just Spirit.

Do your homework lower your expectations and enjoy your cheap airfare.

For 2 of us checking one bag and purchasing our seats was still $150 cheaper than 2 tickets on Delta.

Aircraft was filthy but on time. Was quite concerned when airline staff took our passports to be returned in Aleppo - to identify domestic passengers or give us an incentive not to stay onboard for the long flight to Sweden (and civilisation). Return was on decades-old Tupolev 134 although this aircraft was very clean. Day two was a round trip on the same aircraft to Deirezzor and back to fly on a Yak 40 (very unusual old Russian commuter jetliner gone from service everywhere else in the world). While the Yak was a novelty I am sure for a regular airline passenger it would be quite scary as the plane was in fairly poor condition. Our flight unlike the previous day's ALP/ARN service left from the domestic terminal a real third world mess with puddles of water and ash on the floor no signs or shops or anything. Smoking was encouraged though. On arrival at Deirezzor my travel partner and I were arrested because (we assume) it was unusual for pax to fly-and-return in the same morning. Released and allowed to rejoin the flight back to Damascus but on arrival back at DAM were arrested again and spent the entire day being interviewed by scary ""security"" officials who were not only sinister but also incompetent eg: photocopied our passports but inadvertently gave us the photocopy then searching their own paperwork for the photocopies etc. Perhaps our travel plans were out of the ordinary but if it was an itinerary unfavourable to Syrian security concerns why sell us the ticket in the first place? Eventually released shaken. Day three was a day trip to Latakia beach resort. Old Yak 40 again shabby service smoking cabin crew smoking refuellers etc. Waiting at small Latakia airport for return to DAM many plainclothes cops pacing like circling sharks due to a VIP passenger.

The worse thing about that return trip was they put the delay on the board and then increased the delay by 5-10 minutes each time. That is infuriating because as clients we feel taken for fools (as well as cattle) why couldn't they just set a time and stick with it instead of incrementing by 5 minutes each time?,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,1,2,NA,NA,2,0
swiss-international-air-lines,/airline-reviews/swiss-international-air-lines,Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,J Smith,Canada,2015-05-28,I flew to Zurich from Montreal last week. The food that I had was great (chicken and rice outbound chicken meatloaf on the return flight). Flight attendants were great as well. The only problem was the entertainment system. On the flight to Zurich everyone's systems worked except for my row and a few around. They tried individually resetting them but no success. After three and a half hours and a reboot of the entire flight's system it worked. On the way back to Montreal the entertainment worked for only about one hour and a half then three reboots had to be done (each lasting 30+ mins) before they worked again. Flight attendants worked hard in trying to get them to work and did apologize for all of the inconveniences. Movie TV shows and game selection was good. Overall good experience other than the slight problems with the entertainment.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

The return flight from Geneva to Zurich was delayed over an hour and I was treated rather patronisingly when I asked at the Business Lounge for help as I had important connections in both Zurich and more importantly out of Vienna that same evening. Luckily they then found me an alternate flight in order to make my connections otherwise I would have been in a real mess (and one of my rules of thumb is never to make flights with even remotely tight connections!).

On return it was the same delay scenario. One hour late with no mention of it no apology nothing. Like it never happened. Also ensure your bags are underweight or you will get charged for as little as 0.5kg over weight. They weigh every article you have including my small inflatable pillow. I would never fly Sunwing again. In my opinion it is worth whatever it costs to maximize the precious minutes of your already short vacation.

The arrangement of Airbus 330 had no standing areas to comfortably stretch your legs without constantly moving out of the way of the lavatory door ways. Also there was no path to cross over to the other aisle so that I could not easily visit my friend on the other side of the aircraft.

As usual a number of issues. Firstly it wouldn't let us check in online instead confirming that we were on stand-by. Naturally this caused us concerns so we enquired on arrival at Sao Paulo to be told that this was because when we flew out to Sao Paulo we paid extra for exit seats. So essentially they inconvenienced us just so they could try to upsell these exit seats again. Thank you TAM. The check-in clerk was very friendly anyway so that was good. Boarding was utter chaos. The time between boarding starting and the plane starting to taxi was two hours! I don't remember ever having had a flight like it. The seats were hideously uncomfortable as ever and the IFE extremely limited unless you wish to watch hundreds of episodes of Downton Abbey.

Crew were just about polite but nothing more and certainly no engagement. They spent the time during what I assume would have been the safety briefing chatting in the galley. I normally love airline food and am easily impressed typically devouring everything I am given but both my meals were disgraceful attempts at food and if it wasn't for the fact that we got such measly catering on a 12 hour flight I would've left most of it. The crew vanished after the meal service not even returning with more drinks or even water. IFE is about 20 years behind other major airlines so quite depressing on such a long flight. Having paid extra for exit seats there was then nowhere to stow books and magazines etc. The short haul flight was no better. A pre announced 40 minute delay turned into a 2 hour delay with no explanation and little updating along the way. In fact while we were waiting in the lounge our flight disappeared from the gate screen altogether again with no explanation. The 'meal' was a very unpleasant cheese and ham croissant.

Only gripe was the cramped leg space due to the metal IFE box below the seat in front. The SWISS.com website didn't reflect correctly which seats had those nasty metal boxes. The metal box occupies about half of your leg space. Food was not to my taste unfortunately. On both legs (SIN-ZRH-SIN) I couldn't use the AVOD screen properly. Once the person in front reclines fully the screen is very dim even at maximum brightness. No matter how I titled the screen I couldn't watch the movies properly. The IFE system hung 2x on me. Crew was attentive on the SIN-ZRH but not the other way round. Pressed the call-for- attendant button 3 times on 2 occasions and no flight attendant came by.

For the price they are charging for a business class ticket one would think they could provide some decent wines and video entertainment. Seats are not flatbed and were not long enough for my 180 cm frame. The business class lounge was very poor although not operated by Thai they should not be using 3rd party operators that provide poor food and drink selection and no in site rest rooms.

Used the Thai Royal Silk Lounge - good food but awful seats and so crowded. Tiny lounge for being the hub of the airline - and used by other Star Alliance passengers. My travel companion and I spend 15 minutes in there and preferred to sit in the terminal. TG642 to Narita was boarded by bus so again a long bus ride to the plane. Amazing new 787! Warm greeting upon entering and led to seats. Comfortable pods with a lot of room and amenities. Take off just after midnight for 6 hour flight - meal served quickly and very delicious. Service perfect - smiling attendants and they predicted your next request. Slept 3 hours comfortably and with individual air vents keeps your seat area cool. It's ridiculous that many new planes come without the air vents. Breakfast an hour out of Narita and once we landed short taxi to the gate. Really the best Thai flight out of the 3 I took on the round-the-world journey.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,4,1
swiss-international-air-lines,/airline-reviews/swiss-international-air-lines,Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,N Werner,Switzerland,2012-09-27,Flying with Swiss longhaul is always a gamble when it comes to service. The hard product is usually pretty ok but in general the service provided is usually not that overwhelming and does not live up to their slogans. On a recent flight ZRH-NYC-ZRH this was again visible. The service to NYC was quite good and especially one flight attendant was very friendly and polite. The return leg was overshadowed by one flight attendant who was very rude and unfriendly and barking at passengers in a very brusque way when it came to the drinks service. The younger attendants seem to be better and still have that customer focus but still there is a long way to go to be world class.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,3,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

On arriving at the airport we queued at the check-in as normal to be handed a letter that told us the flight was delay until the next day with no explanation as to why and no rep in sight. The letter explained we'd be taken to a hotel and provided with 1 meal and a drink. The next morning we were made to leave for the airport at 6.45am again not great with two small children! Finally got to the airport to again be greeted by another letter and no rep saying we are now flying with HiFly airline and again delayed by another hour. What an experience that was the plane was awful there was no inflight entertainment and the staff didn't speak English and constantly argued due to the amount of pressure they were under. Not a great experience and definitely not worth the money we paid. This flight was worse than a budget airline so why it was sent to collect us I will never know.

Took a shower as I had arrived from Chicago on UA and the facilities were excellent. Good food and plenty of seats in the lounge. Boarded upper deck of the A380 and warmly welcomed by the crew. Hot towels offered and a drink before take off. Was in the last seat of the Biz Class (27 K) and enjoyed it - the small economy section behind is nice as they don't allow children there so it is quiet. The food was average but had good flavor. AVOD Entertainment had plenty of movies and TV shows to watch on the 10 hour flight. The attendants were very friendly and accommodating but I was surprised that after dinner and before breakfast they never came through the cabin offering drinks and snacks. If you went to the galley they would happily deliver whatever you wanted to your seat but even on American and United they come thru every few hours with water (and that is in economy). Landed on time and bags out quickly. Overall a good flight and the A380 is so quiet.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

We had already booked our boarding passes online but discovered this facility was not in use and ended up queuing for about 45 minutes. There was four check ins and one was reserved for priority boarding and used for approximately 25 minutes. We had to wait another 30 minutes before it was used for other passengers. By the time we got through checking in it was about 4.30 pm. We checked the board to find the departure gate was No 2. There was a queue forming at the gate and we joined it thinking that we would be boarding in time for take off at 5.15 pm. No information was given regarding the flight being delayed. At 5.30 we were told that the flight was delayed and could not give us any more information she told us to take a seat and wait. There was very few seats available. It was 6.30 pm when it was finally announced that there was a computer fault. By this time we had been standing for over three hours. I understand there can be delays but what I don't understand is that there was no other Thomas Cook rep there to keep us informed as to what was happening. The flight finally left at 8.15 pm we arrived home at 2.00 am.

Thai is not the only airline to insist on sighting credit cards but I would prefer it if they had better fraud prevention methods than that. At check in I also asked for an exit row aisle seat and was given one - no problem and no request for extra money. Two meals were served on the first flight to Bangkok both offered choices for the main dish and my choices were both tasty. The staff did numerous water/juice runs throughout the night and the washrooms were kept spotless. The seats were quite hard but I did sleep some.

I have not traveled with Thai for over 5 years chose to fly with them due to the right pricing. The warm Thai hospitality remains but was let down by the food quality and quantity due to cost-cutting. Seats are comfortable enough especially on 747. On both legs the food served was small in quantity and the quality was below my expectation. Fried pork mince with sweet basil on rice looked like a 7-11 fast meal served on bone china dry and tasteless. Chicken red curry with rice tastes ok but quantity so small it's like children menu. Good if you are on diet but for any grown men that's way too small. I commented on that and FA was embarrassed but she agreed. The biz lounge and 30 min free massage was a saving grace.

Both directions were over 4 hours and overnight however the seats were the narrowest I have ever sat in and fixed in place. The seats were so small that it was not possible to hold a book normally but to have to hold it up much closer to your face and with so little space that they did not have space for a normal tray which meant when food came round there was not space to also have anything to drink. The food was awful and struggled to eat any of the hot meals which were of course an extra charge. There was no entertainment full stop. This was an awful experience but then every step of the way with Thomas Cook was an awful experience and would not recommend them to anyone.

Another problem was that every time we flew through any slightly unstable air the back of the plane yawed from side to side sufficiently to spill drinks.

The electrically tinting windows are an excellent idea rather than shutting of the light totally we had two windows in our seating position so we could dim the farthest window to watch a film whilst retaining some light.

Hard to find the lounge which is in a remote corner of Terminal 1 with very limited signage. Comfortable seating and good food but was rather dark. After boarding the plane was held for 25 mins for ATC reasons - no drink offered to Business passengers. After take-off service was pleasant and a good meal was offered.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,J Smith,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,Travelled to Cancun on the Thomson Dreamliner in January 2015 from Manchester. Unfortunately we didn't board on time and then it started to snow they boarded us an hour late and we sat on the tarmac for an additional four hours. I know this wasn't their fault but all they gave is in those four hours was half a cup of lukewarm water and a bite size picnic! The service in the air is good and the food not bad but although the drinks are complimentary they only offer you one drink apart from the drink of tea coffee or wine with the meal. That's not brilliant when you are on a plane for nearly 15 hours! We were impressed by the room though and the entertainment is good. Luckily the flight attendants on both journeys were lovely and I do believe that apart from the single drink and the snow I would have rated it 10.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,5,NA,NA,3,1
thai-airways,/airline-reviews/thai-airways,Thai Airways customer review,S Jackson,Australia,2014-01-25,All in all not a bad experience at all. The Business Class lounge at Suvarnabhumi Airport (Concourse E) was nice and clean couches were comfortable and there was a reasonable variety of food to eat. Only criticisms are that there should have been more types of fruit to choose from. Our Boeing 777-300 seats in business class had a very generous amount of leg room. The seats do not recline completely flat but I was comfortable enough to be able to get to sleep. Earplugs and blindfolds were also provided which gave me a more peaceful rest. Generally cabin crew were friendly especially when you talk to them personally. They could have smiled at bit more however in other situations such as when they are serving food and beverages. Special mention to the fresh fruits that I had for breakfast which had amazing presentation on the plate! Overall pretty positive experience just a few little things that TG should look at to enhance the experience for customers.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

It took over 3 hours for us to check our bags in and thus our flight was over an hour late departing. When we arrived at Zakynthos one of our bags was missing. We were told our luggage was still at Luton and would be flown out the next day. The Thomas Cook rep told me it had been sent to Amsterdam and would arrive later that day. After waiting for the luggage to arrive and it not being on the flight I again was abruptly told it had been flown to Athens.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,M Smith,United Kingdom,2014-11-03,Flew on Dreamliner or should that be nightmare liner from Birmingham to Cancun on 11 October. Flight slightly delayed due to all toilets being out of action took off with 1 toilet out of order coped with that but food on both inbound and outbound was disgusting crew indifferent. Delayed on return from Cancun on October 25th check in computers went 'down' with 75 of us still waiting to check in. We were left standing for 2 hrs while they tried to sort out problem despite asking for info numerous times we were treated with utter contempt telling me personally to get back in the queue when I asked why we couldn't be checked in manually? The staff offered no explanation as to when we could board the pilot knew of the problem because when he & the crew checked in we had already been waiting for an hour. The staff were a disgrace and Thomson should look into their customer service approach. Eventually we checked in with minutes to spare and straight onto the plane no duty free shopping for us unfortunate 75 customers. The flight home didn't have enough duty free purchases the food was awful as stated & the mood lighting? What mood lighting? No apology from the pilot just a cursory sorry for the delay due to technical problems! I wasn't aware I was a technical problem just another upset customer left in limbo for 2 hrs with rude staff. On arriving at Birmingham we couldn't lock up with the departure tunnel & it had to be relocated to another door more delays. On leaving aircraft my husband said to 1 of crew 'we had trouble getting on plane and trouble getting off' his reply was 'just one of those things liking having problems with a new car'! If I had a new car with that many problems I'd be furious and staff who don't give a monkeys only added to the problem on a lighter note the plane did have better leg room and more choice of movies but apart from that no better than any other Thomson flight and I've been on plenty.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,5,2,2,5,NA,NA,2,0

Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. They do squeeze a lot of passengers in to these aircraft with very little leg room. The 737-800 had no standard seat pocket - only a magazine/safety instruction pocket at the top of the seatback in front so nowhere to store a book or anything else which is a very poor design. No inflight entertainment even although the flight time was almost 5 hours. Food and drinks available were standard airline snacks. Flight on time outbound and about 35 mins late on the return.

I carefully booked in advance seats on all legs so I could choose seats with a lot of space (27J on the routes from Europe to Brazil and back). 27J has a lot of extra room for legs since it is near the emergency exit and is the first to be served. It is also close to toilets. The A340 is old with practically no IFE and food is very basic. However I found seats to be reasonably comfortable and could sleep in both flights. In the leg from Lisbon to Rio the flight was practically full; in the way back less than 50% of seats was occupied. European legs were also fine: food served is also very basic (including an uneatable sandwich) but at least there was some IFE with flight information. Overall all flights were not that exciting but always on time and transfer within Lisbon airport is pretty fast. Given the price paid (all other airlines were charging much more for the same route) I am satisfied.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,1,NA,NA,5,1

Travelling for the second successive year from CWL to PFO in high season their performance was flawless. On time both ways efficient and personable cabin crew who worked as team and OK seat comfort. I can be difficult to please but there was really nothing to fault - although the ticket cost could have been better. My son wanted a model plane which was in the inflight brochure and they cheerfully found it for him.

Both planes new. Negatives: Seating - cramped / uncomfortable. I'm 5ft 10 so not overly tall but 3.5/4 hours really is the limit. Food: You book a five star hotel but the experience on board is far from five star why on a 4 hour flight can we no longer order / pay for a proper meal? Being offered chips at 7am just doesn't work in my opinion / neither does a Kit Kat. East Midlands airport is an absolute joke and by the time you've 'dropped your bags off' and cleared security you have no time to buy something half decent to eat for the flight. Crew were OK. Miserable on the outward flight and to be honest they looked liked they'd had a rough night previous. Thomson flights aren't cheap but the level of service doesn't reflect this. I've booked this trip for my family independently for next year and booked TAP flights to Madeira. Just a note: why do people feel the need to say how bumpy their flight was?

Both outbound and return flights left on time. I pre-booked extra leg room seats and these were allocated on check in as per my booking. The 757-200 aircraft was slightly old inside but with leather seats. Crew were polite efficient and very friendly with passengers. I would imagine that had I not booked extra leg room seats it would be a less comfortable flight but really if you have that much of an issue with leg room simply pay Â£25 for a seat with extra room and enjoy the flight rather than moan about it. There was one bar service each way but the crew would also get drinks for passengers on request later in the flight so everyone was happy. We had meals included for free as part of our holiday package. Outbound was a choice of Tikka Masala or Beef Bourguignon and return was Tarragon Chicken or Roast Beef. They have been created by Chef James Martin and whilst they were OK I wouldn't be impressed if I had paid for these meals pretty basic. A small selection of TV programmes were show on overhead screens but I didn't watch these as the flight was only 3 hours. Overall excellent flights on Thomas Cook.

My main gripe is that since the A340-600 has been introduced the level of service has gone downhill in my opinion due to the increase in seat capacity but same level of staff. The importance seems to be on serving rolls steward comes round numerous times whereas the wine serving is sparse and never served with the meal which is a shame as it is very palatable especially the white.

However on 3 occasions when the flight was full passengers who had not paid the extra were given free access to to the front row making the paying passengers regret their decision. I have taken lot more flights in AirAsia also in the first row but I have not encountered this situation there. My second complaint is about the ""board me first"" privilege which is charged at $ 5.

The problem was not with the flight itself but the way Thomson uses Dalaman airport. They land about 9 aircraft within minutes of each other and they all (attempt!) to take off again within minutes of each other and the Airport simply cannot cope. The problem arises with the aircraft using remote parking spots on the airport apron. Passengers for these are shunted off into the suffocating basement of the terminal where there are about six gates with nowhere near enough room to accommodate passengers. So you get families with young children sitting on the floor and being treated like cattle. It's human nature - certainly amongst the British - to start forming queues which bear no relationship to the order in which the flights depart. One gate was being used for two different flights. There were no announcements from the departure gate staff even though some flights were delayed without any reference to it on the screens. Such confusion can lead to panic and stress situations - what a way to treat your customers! When we eventually got in a bus - the driver had no idea which aircraft he was supposed to decant us to - he had a choice of nine! When we eventually departed an hour late and after such a stressful boarding process there was not a hint of an apology from the Captain.

I flew from Athens (5.30am) to Kiev (laid over 2 hours) then on to JFK (arriving 2pm same day) for a total of 13 hours of time in the air. Flight Athens to Kiev was fine, flight attendants were nice and courteous. I slept most of the time and they did a brief juice/coffee service just before landing. Once in Kiev, be prepared for perhaps the rudest airport experience. Airport staff (from food service to duty-free to security staff) were miserable. Kiev airport has limited food options, so be prepared to settle on a mediocre sandwich. Flight from Kiev to JFK was hands down the worst flight I have been on. The seats are horrible. I am 5'10 and my knees rubbed the seat in front of me, the seats are narrow and are as big as you would expect from a tiny regional aircraft or island-hopper, not what you would expect for a long-haul flight. The seats themselves are extremely uncomfortable and are terrible in causing lower back pain, and recline only an inch or two. The cabin crew took the cold, aloof, and rudeness of the Kiev airport staff to an entirely new level and were openly hostile towards passengers. The food was laughably bad, but the worst part is that they offered maybe 500ml of beverage for the entire 10 hour flight. They did 3 separate drink services and each time you get about 150ml of beverage in a tiny solo cup, the size many people keep in their bathrooms. I've never been happier to land and be done with a flight, and would not wish flying UIA for long-haul flights on my worse enemy. I would describe the in-flight experience as a 1/10 and the only reason I am giving 5 stars is because the entire flight from Athens to JFK cost me $330 which is insanely cheap and was approximately half the price of the next cheapest flight from another airline. So if you're trying to backpack/budget fly and need a really inexpensive flight into/out of Europe or Asia, take UIA but seriously prepare yourself for a horrible flight and I'd recommend bringing a liter of your own water.",boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Economy,Athens to JFK via Kiev,5,1,1,1,3,1,1,5,0

Apparently no-one watched it according to the cabin staff however on both inbound and outbound I counted the 18 seats around me and only one person had anything to do. The past inflight meals were garbage but at least edible on occasions and were actually something you looked forward to but the simple thing is its paid for as part of your initial holiday cost - it just does not feel right paying cash at inflated prices for something that represents less value than the old style inflight meals.

At 1.95 m the seating plan made the trip absolute torture. My wife is 1.58m and had very little room to spare - when a seat reclined she had her first attack of claustrophobia on an airplane ever. Cabin crew expertise extend only as far as selling overpriced horrible food booze and cigarettes. Other airlines shift passengers around for the sake of comfort and safety when things are tight - quite infuriating when some passengers were allowed to sleep across 3 seats when others cant even sit with their legs pointing forward. Check in staff on the 12th at Gatwick were rude and dictatorial. Paid 24 pounds for being 2 kgs (combined between my wife and I) over what was a pathetic baggage allowance.

My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti, we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food, nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals.

The new lounge in IST is gorgeous! The LAX-IST legs were excellent: comfortable seats attentive staff good food. The IST-DAR legs were only fair: seat controls didn't work staff was less than attentive food was mediocre. But the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system. Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes.

Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline.

I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late).

The TPA-ORD leg was the usual 'bus' service you get used to for US domestic trips but the international leg was beyond terrible. The aircraft was old - decor of a bygone era. The TV screens were the sort I remember for a decade ago - tiny no personal controls. The food was stingy and poor quality (a slab of meat resembling a chicken breast at some time in the past). The cabin crew were surly and long past retirement age (who knows what would happen in an emergency). Surely they could stump up at least one complementary alcoholic beverage like other transatlantic carriers. Next time I'll pay more for a much superior service. This is the budget airline of the Atlantic.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,3,2,2,1,1,NA,NA,2,0
united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Murphy,United States,2014-08-15,"Gate agents are rude flights constantly delayed with no regard to connecting flights and mostly for ""crew availability."" Our most recent disaster was trying to get home to KC from San Antonio. First flight delayed putting us in Houston an hour after our connection was to leave. Had to call to find another flight since they offered no alternate options. Once in Houston the flight out was delayed twice due to ""awaiting aircraft"" a third delay due to ""crew availability"" and at 10pm was finally cancelled conveniently due to ""weather."" Which of course relieves United of any lodging responsibility even though the initial delay which caused this fiasco was fully their fault. Was traveling with my 11 year old son had no access to our luggage and ended up with a $361 airport hotel bill.

CVG-ORD flight was alright. Small aircraft not much of a problem as it was a short trip. It all started once we reached Chicago. After landing we waited in the aircraft for more than an hour. I reached my gate and asked the United staff about my plane. They clearly said that it was on time. So I go eat and come back and my flight is cancelled! I asked the same staff member again and she says I have to contact customer service. They tell me that there is another flight in 2 hours and they will transfer me. Told there are only middle seats in the middle row left! Th4 flight was delayed by an hour again and I was sure I would miss my connecting flight. Onboard the seat was very narrow no leg room and me being a vegetarian my special meal did not get transferred onto this flight. The staff were rude no smiles and hated being even asked for water. The entertainment was the worst I have seen! 4 channels 4 fixed movies one on each and they all start at the same time. Absolutely no value for money. As we finally after 8 hours land in London I had just 25 mins to go from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4 to catch my next flight so ran throughout no option and was one of the last people to catch the plane.

Flight to DCA on an E190 and it barely half full which provided a very comfortable flight and legroom and recline were good. No beverage runs this time due to heavy turbulence. Made it to my flight to SYR with a minute to spare this flight on a smaller E170. The flight attendant serving my row was an absolute delight.

Continental was a great airline that was merged with a terrible one and since the merger we have tried to avoid United wherever possible. Old United equipment substandard IFE overall bad attitudes no matter which cabin you find yourself in. Flying United is an endurance marathon.

After arriving 3 hours late into ORD on a flight from Munich because of an unscheduled stop in Boston to change pilots I arrived to find flight #518 from ORD to PDX delayed because of a maintenance issue. After three delays two gate changes and three hours the flight was cancelled. I was reassigned to Flight #627 scheduled to depart at 8.25pm. If my original flight had left on time I would have missed the weather delay that started at about 7pm and lasted for an hour or so. The weather delay did mess things up and flights were diverted to wait for the weather to pass. Our incoming plane was diverted to Rockford IL for a ground stop and then never made it to Chicago. We had 7 official delays several noted only after the original delay deadline had passed and then the delay was only another 30 to 45 minutes so not much time to go get food etc. We had 3 gate changes during the process the last of which brought us back to the gate where our plane for Flight #518 was still sitting still with its mechanical problems. Our inbound aircraft never made it no alternative aircraft could be brought to the gate even though there was an alternate aircraft available and the flight crew timed out at just before 2am when they cancelled the flight. They offered a hotel voucher but the closest hotel was 20 miles away. After 26 hours travelling the last nine being at ORD I left for a hotel I had to pay for an hour away in downtown Chicago.

Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful.

My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge.

I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me.

Check in was terribly slow, mainly due to the high percentage of passengers who had 3 or 4 large cartons as excess baggage. It all has to be weighed and labelled and that takes time. On boarding, the cabin crew pointed us unsmilingly towards our seats. The A330-200 looked in good condition with the cabin clean and tidy. We asked for extra seats at check-in so we could stretch out and had 4 seats to ourselves. In the rear cabin section there were only about 30 passengers. With the seat-belt sign illuminated the crew made no attempt to check the passengers or items on seats. While the A330 was waiting to enter the runway, the woman sitting in front of us stood up and walked to the rear toilet. The two cabin crew looking at her frowned but said and did nothing to stop her. During the flight, the seat belt sign was illuminated and passengers told to belt up as there was turbulence ahead. The flight smoothed out but the sign stayed on for over an hour but some passengers took no notice and moved around the cabin without challenge. The PTV selection is limited but passable, however my unit locked up and none of the controls would fix it. After a frustrating ten minutes I reported it to the cabin crew who advised me to change seats. Okay, but later my wifeâs PTV also locked, but later went into re-boot and after several minutes, the programs returned, but the screen was still locked. Food served during the flight was edible. The toilets used by us were in poor condition. Floors wet, dirty stains under the seats, damaged fascia around the mirror, toilet seat and cover broken away from its mountings and tissues on the floor. We didn't see cabin attendant refresh or tidy toilets. On the final approach to Saigon, with the seat belt sign illuminated, passengers still moved about the cabin uncontested by the crew.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Peter J Thackray,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,CXR-DAD Internal morning flight. Check-in good the usual 3 desks open processing passengers. Boarding on time and pushback about 10 minutes early arrival also 10 minutes early flight on a relatively new A321. Overall the attention to detail let down the flight and was indicative of some underlying attitudes. Cabin Crew did not appear to check everyone's seat belt was fastened prior to take-off nor stow hats and coats that emergency row passengers had placed on an empty seat. A passenger decided to get up to use the toilet just after take-off when the Fasten Seatbelt sign was still illuminated but no comments/instructions from the cabin staff to return to seat! The final point was that the seatback pockets were not cleared out after the fights or even overnight as both my travelling companion and I found old boarding passes and other rubbish stuffed in the pockets - clearly the attention to detail is missing and needs work if the airline is to be truly successful!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,2,1,0,NA,NA,0,0

My colleague wanted an aisle seat with extra legroom (due to a leg injury) so we sat in a two seat exit row at the back which gave me a window seat - with no window!

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2015-05-04,Flew Sydney-Brisbane on a busy Sunday. On my occasional previous flights with Virgin I'd noticed that they're inferior to Qantas in every way but not by much. Now that I've flown at a peak time I've seen what cost-cutting at check-in does. There was a queue for the small number of self-check-in kiosks (at least one was broken) then you can't drop your own bag like at Qantas so the queue for the measly 4-5 bag drop counters (they kept closing them due to baggage system problems) stretched to the terminal door. There were 5 proper check-in counters so some people took a punt on those being faster than kiosk + bag drop. 30 minutes to check-in should not be expected for a domestic flight (Qantas will take 5 minutes even at peak times). Given the price difference is usually small I'll avoid Virgin at peak times.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,2,2,2,NA,NA,3,0
virgin-america,/airline-reviews/virgin-america,Virgin America customer review,N Miller,United States,2014-02-28,Disappointed with a round-trip SFO-LAX-SFO in Main Cabin Select - food selection is pretty pathetic - the 'Hearty Meal' is a box containing a tiny bag of some kind of chips/crisps about 4 slices of salami and a little pot of something else. Service was generally very good on both flights - but again my unfortunate neighbor tried to order a snack on the menu that apparently was not available - the flight attendant said 'only what's on the menu on the screen' - his choice was included in the on-screen menu! It was a long day and so the lighting did nothing for me but the general atmosphere is much better than UA and I would probably choose them again.

Flew from Heathrow to Dubai overnight and returned on a day flight. Check in for both was swift and easy. Boarding on the way out was a bit of a shock as a stewardess just wandered out and said 'you can get on when you want' to everyone! Much better handled on the way back. The seat was pretty comfortable for the first time ever I actually got a decent amount of sleep on the way out and didn't have any problems with legroom or numb bum even when on the return day flight the people in front fully reclined their seats. Though to be fair I do not like the fixed armrest between seats it makes you feel more enclosed. Service on board was good staff kept busy were friendly and very well turned out a credit to their airline really. Food and drinks were served regularly. I do think the food has declined in quality for the main meals. They were a bit lacklustre and the desserts were just not nice I left mine on both legs. What happened to the Gu pots? They were always of a reliable quality why change a winning formula. Also noticed no daytime amenity pack but to be honest that is no great loss the night time one is still provided and that is the one I find useful. Both flights were more or less on time so really I was quite happy with the amount we paid for the service we got and will be flying Virgin again.

Adding to the delay was the fact some of the self check in terminals were out of order and there was a gap in staffing due to what appeared to be a shift rotation with ground staff who were running late. Plane was messy with biscuit crumbs greeting me on my entire row of seats. I had a window seat but it seemed very tight particularly where my leg was closest to the wall and likewise the seating pitch was a lot narrower than a smaller A320 from Jetstar.

The return from ATL to LHR with Virgin was much much less so. The new Upper Class seat is much narrower than the old one and it is therefore difficult to get a decent sleeping position other than on your side with your back to the curve of the seat. Main meal was mediocre and would only have merited 1* but the score was raised by the breakfast which was first class. Cabin crew were cheerful and attentive throughout the flight. Surprised though that the bar was closed all through the flight. Toilets on the A330 were few in number (one dedicated and two shared with Premium Economy) and because there is no centre luggage bin the scrabble for overhead bin space on this full flight was ridiculous.

The extra leg space was a God send / see previous review. Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat. Crews on both flights did not tidy up the restrooms which were always in great demand.

I arrived early at the airport plenty of staff on hand and baggage was accepted without a wait. Flight was packed without a single empty seat. Boarding is done by Cabin Special needs and zones and quickly turned into a scrum. The seats while stylish looking are very close together. They are much more narrow than they look. I'm a big guy at 6'2"" 235lbs and just getting into my seat I found it an impossibly small space. With a small personal item under the seat there is zero space. Thankfully during flight I could take it out from under the seat and it was not so bad. The crew for this flight mostly male with a single female serving were on top of their game. The Red inflight system for entertainment and ordering was brilliant. First service is rather awkward traditional front to back then it's all on demand. The food I purchased was a great Pastrami Sandwich. Nothing seemed too much trouble for this crew. They politely advised in advance when they would shut down the ordering service so people could get last requests in. Flight was only a few minutes delayed in departure and landing.

Seat onboard 737-800 was pretty good by the window with several inches legroom in front although the seat was still a bit too narrow. Virgins inflight entertainment app was not available for the flight so I was left to read the inflight magazine which was already worn out despite it only been used for 9 days. Cabin overall needed some cleaning - there were crumbs on my seat from previous flights that could have easily been removed prior to mine and there was a faint smell of vomit hanging in the air throughout the flight. One of the air con vents was missing. Cabin crew was friendly enough but definitely not as well- presented or delivered as an international flight. Complimentary snack was questionable being a tiny capsicum and cheese sandwich which looked to have been made with only 1 slice of bread.

As for the long haul service I struggle to understand how Virgin can put an ancient A340-300 on a 12 hour long haul route the entertainment was shocking the old Vera Reel system should of been replaced years ago. I could tell they had put there most battle hardened cabin crew on this route obviously to deal with this I have never seen a cabin manager talking to so many passengers mid flight though it must be said she did a great job. Luckily the return flight from Shanghai was on a newer A340-600 and the on demand entertainment was much better. The crew on this flight though were clearly struggling with the majority Chinese passengers and while there were Chinese crew to help there was no communication between the British and Chinese crew. I find the crew on Cathay Emirates Qatar and other long haul airlines to have a much more professional attitude.

I can only say excellent all round. Vietnam Airlines offer close to 5-Star Service in Business Class if my own previous experiences with other airlines are any guide. I found check-in on Vietnam Airlines can occasionally be rather chaotic mainly because so many apparent first time and naive flyers seem to crowd into the business class check-in or boarding areas with their relatives seeing them off and with no idea of accepted boarding processes. Nevertheless on-board food and wine first rate with an amazing 4-choice main menu on some flights which were all on-time unless airport control dictated otherwise. Superb service from extremely well groomed flight attendants. I would prefer more in-flight comment from the flight crew especially as the flight map on some flights was not working. The Business Lounge in Saigon is quite good and adequate with good views of the tarmac and shared lounges (VN Airlines use the Qantas lounge in Melbourne and China Airlines in Taipei) - quite good. My only gripe was that management of in-flight turbulence and warning seemed poor as was the management of some passengers who completely ignored safety instructions (the guy next to me on one sector put his seat into the fully flat bed position during taxiing for take off which would have meant I would not have been able to quickly leave the aircraft in an emergency). However to be fair to the cabin crew they could do little to solve this problem as they were required to be strapped into their crew seats at the same time of take-off anyway.

Flights were on time and inflight service was more than one could ask for a short-haul domestic flight with friendly and attentive staff.

The one Achilles heel is Heathrow I haven't used Heathrow in 16 years - and I have to say it didn't leave me want to back in a hurry unfriendly and poor management of queues for security - for Britain's premier air gateway it is shambolic particularly when you see the improvements that have been made at Gatwick.

I was looking forward to spending 2 full days with friends but a few days before departure Virgin informed me that instead of the evening flight I would need to take the lunchtime flight. OK these things happen but when I actually checked in the attendant told me the evening flight was operating and had plenty of spare seats! Apparently quite a few other pax were bumped that day too. When I lodged an inquiry with ""Customer Care"" I was told ""After further investigation I can confirm that your flight was revised due to operational requirements and we regrettably had no other option but to reschedule your service."" What a load. I couldn't complain about the actual flights the Fokker 50s are ageing but in good condition and flights were on time. Virgin's policy on in-flight refreshments is confusing to say the least - some routes get a free meal others not in Western Australia ""some flights"" get one but they don't say which. We got light refreshments but any extras had to be paid in cash (not credit card as stated in the menu). It's like they want to be seen as a full-service carrier but can't fully let go of the budget airline ethos - I just wish they'd get their story clear.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,4,4,1,NA,NA,3,0

Leg room was generous but the seats were a little thin cramped and short in the legs. The inflight entertainment system was good with a decent sized screen though many options were not available free of charge. Drinks are provides complimentary though no food was provided.

Plenty of legroom although the 2 heights that the footrest sits at doesn't make it overly comfortable the seat width difference is definitely noticeable vs domestic economy. Amenities bag comes with socks eye mask toothbrush/paste hand cream tissues and a pen (which is more than I can say for SQ business). Headphones provided are noise blocking - and they definitely work. Every meal had tomato and cheese in it which was not only a little disappointing but seriously lacking in originality the chicken was nice and tender though once I scraped the tomato off! Breakfast (scrambled eggs) was so/so the bacon the only redeeming factor in a pretty lacklustre meal. Inflight entertainment (RED) didn't have a massive choice. The best bit would have to be the service. From the FA's to the pilots keeping us up to date on delays could not have asked for better - the staff are definitely what make flying Virgin Australia a happy experience!

First time with Virgin and very impressed indeed. In almost every respect beats BA hands down. Check in and private security channel a breeze at T3. Heathrow Clubhouse every bit as good as the reviews say. Airbus aircraft on outbound with new style seating which is comfortable and easy to use. New style IFE is also good although not up to Emirates standard. Prior to return we received a text and email warning of severe delays to our flight (due to adverse weather at LHR on 21 October) and offering to move us onto another flight if we could get to JFK. We transferred from VS10 to VS46. VS46 uses a very very old 747-400 with the old style seating and IFE. The older seating is wider and a little more flexible but the old style IFE not as good as its younger version. Despite the age of the plane everything worked well.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,W Coulton,Australia,2014-04-21,PER-SYD-PER Easter long weekend. Both flights A330-200. A330 for the flight to Sydney had a broken APU so had no ground air conditioning until engines started. It was a sauna until 20 minutes into the flight. Obviously old video system individual screens but continuous loop (not AVOD) with poor vision and sound. Food OK and complimentary beer/wine. Return flight much newer A330 with good AVOD. Once again food fine and sufficient along with beer/wine. Significantly less legroom on this aircraft. Check-in for both flights was OK despite being busy days but check-in staff could show some enthusiasm for the job or find another one. The biggest disappointment was the lack of even a casual smile from any of the cabin crew except when first entering each aircraft. After that it was glum faces for the entire flight. The odd smile makes the journey go so much better for both passengers and crew. I normally fly QF but gave VA a go this time based not only on price/schedule but also looking for an alternative to QF for regular travel needs. VA did not stand out as any better than QF I'm afraid.

On all flights there were some good some bad flight attendants. Also on all flights the food was just ok. A Vietnamese friend of mine said I should bring some extra food of my own for this same reason. Check-in was a nightmare due to inability of people to queue up as well.

Announcements were very difficult to decipher whether it was the actual system or the persons making the announcements (whether from flight deck or cabin) were very quiet. Return flight was okay food was surprisingly good however breakfast was a lot to be desired - choice and quantity. Announcements were much clearer and better to understand. Was very annoyed at the cabin crew who decided to do the duty free run after the lights were out. Trying to sleep whilst all you can hear is the banter of someone buying perfume is not very good in my opinion. Some cabin crew didn't seem to be very alert to some important things such as reclined seats in the rows in front when preparing to depart. Had to discreetly point this out.

There is a level of courtesy and engagement with the customer among the cabin and ground staff that is not seen among the US legacy airlines. Cabin crew made sure we were comfortable.

Also happened on return. A message at the outset would have been much more helpful. Check in agent at terminal was very jovial and pleasant and seating as requested was honoured. Outbound flight delayed by an hour due to passengers disembarking an AirNas flight. It was not possible to board the Virgin flight as there was insufficient space in the walkways!

I did not expect not to be able to have my choice in Premium economy. Uneventful flight which made up some time across the ocean. Return flight departed on time and landed early at Gatwick. Dinner was a creole chicken dish which was actually quite tasty. Cabin was far too warm making for quite an uncomfortable flight and too hot to sleep.

Flights were cheap which is why we went via Guadalajara - which is a pleasant airport for a quick layover. Boarding system is among the strangest I've seen - each seat is assigned a group with which to board (1-4) but the group assignment seemed completely arbitrary and not related to place in the cabin as would be expected. Also they make you line up in your group rather than just call one group at a time felt like primary school. Legroom is absolutely horrendous. I'm 6'2 and my knees were banged up against the hard back of the seat in front even before it had reclined. Would have been somewhat forgivable had the seat back not been so hard. The seat itself is also quite uncomfortable. I'd actually say this is probably the worst airline seat I've sat in. Staff are expectedly inattentive for a low cost airline. They're also very inconsistent with their decision to translate from Spanish to English - some announcements are more important than others obviously? The lady next to me on one of the flights ordered the buy-on-board nachos which looked awful (canned cheese plus corn chips) so I didn't bother with any of that.

On the return leg the FAs were friendlier but it seemed quite slow getting drinks served and there was no welcome drink on boarding.

I've had better at motorway service stations! The decaf coffee was served in a mug (nice touch especially as the mug turned out to be made by someone I know) and was fantastic. Reasonable croissant but no hot towels offered. Cabin temperature was better this time. The planes seemed a little tired and the bathrooms were clean but nothing special.

On return from VGO the flight was delayed without sending notices via the Vueling mobile app. Arrived at the airport on time and proceeded to check-in and was stopped by Vueling agent to pay for carry on bag. Informed the Vueling agent that coming from BCN Vueling did not charge me for the carry-on agent could care less. Anyways paid with trusted credit card so I could call them once back home in the USA. Got to the gate and notice all the locals with the same size carry-on bags as mine were not made to check them in. Some had bigger carry-on bags that could be classified as checked in luggage. While at the gate no information that the only flight flown by Vueling on Saturday was delayed by two hours. As the night went on in VGO we went back to Iberia which was handling the Vueling flight as the Vueling ground crew left the airport. Told flight will come but if it gets cancelled you are on your own for hotel. Note Vigo is small town lacking hotels. Finally the plane arrived from Barcelona with a fresh crew and made a quick turn around. Since the flight was delayed 2+ hours by the time we left Vigo it was now 11pm. We arrived back at 1am having to wait for Vueling to located ground crew in Barcelona as most the Vueling planes had already returned for the night and the airport while it is open 24 hours keeps limited people on hand after 12am. The hold in Barcelona was not acceptable being that Barcelona is Vueling's hub. I would fly Vueling again but I will fly them with being sure to take morning flights in case of any delays also keep my trusted Credit Card on hand to dispute carry on charge for not being local.,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy,VGO to BCN,6,4,4,NA,NA,3,NA,5,1

Flew PVG-LHR on one of the A340-600 in 60K (G-VWEB). I'm 5"" 8' so not the largest person in the world and yet my knees were being poked the entire flight by the pocket from the seat in front of me. Padding on the seat was pretty much non-existent resulting in a rather numb behind after a short time into the flight. Also it's worth noting that it seems seats in A and K mostly have something under them for the in-flight entertainment system. This meant I had even less space to stretch if needed due to that being under the seat in front of me. The headrest was incapable of keeping the position of the wings that are on it collapsing the second you put your head against it. If the person in the seat in front puts their seat back it makes the experience even more claustrophobic - not to mention making it hard to use the screen for the in-flight entertainment. Not that that matters as the screen quality is so bad you won't want to use it anyway. Then there is the food - it's tasteless overcooked and there's not a lot of quantity to it. At least they came around at reasonable times with it and offered drinks fairly often during the flight. Also the lack of any form of power is annoying not even a USB port for plugging a phone/tablet into.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,2,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

Outgoing flight was operated by a reasonably new 737-800 and was less than half full. The seats were quite comfortable with adjustable headrests. Travelled on a flexi fare which meant that entertainment and food was included. The IFE was ok - the choice of movies was limited but what was available was pretty good (probably worth the $15 if you travel on saver). The food though on both routes was absolutely disgraceful. On the way over I was served with a Luke Mangan egg lettuce and mayonnaise wrap. It tasted disgusting and the label said that it was 5 days old. On the way back it was an egg lettuce and mayo sandwich which I refused to eat. The meal was finished with a cookie and a pack of M&M's. Do not purchase a Flexi Fare! Return flight was operated by an old 737-800 with old and uncomfortable seats. The crew on the flight back were pretty inefficient and rude. Some of them even had a nap in the back row - seemed a bit much for a four and a half hour flight. Virgin Australia is really just a low cost airline and I would only recommend it for one or two hour flights.

Short after take off she prepared her little trolley in front of the cabin and then started the ""food for purchase"" service as usual on WiderÃ¸e. Bought a reindeer (!) sandwich and a coke which was an adquate snack. 20 of the passengers left in VadsÃ¸ and we had a 30 min stop. Before we continued we were asked if we would like to see the security information once again. Nobody had a need for this and so we departed. The 15 min hop to VardÃ¸ was beautiful because we did fly just a some hundred foot above the ground and the sights were spectacular. The other three passengers left the aircraft in VardÃ¸ and another passenger joined us. So we were two for the hop to Kirkenes and we got a very personal security briefing which was different from the usual standard phrases.

Flights were 45 and 30 minutes late departing Melbourne and Hobart respectively and there weren't any updates - either to the departure gate display boards or by way of public announcements - to waiting passengers at either airport resulting in many people approaching the departure desks to query staff.

Apart from those aspects the flights were satisfactory; very clean aircraft comfortable seating and friendly and competent cabin staff.

I have seen a gradual disappearance to what made WJ unique and my choice. Have only flown with them regionally during the last 2 years. My biggest complaint is how often they are late or delayed. Passengers are not given the truth as to why planes are delayed. I would rather know that my plane is going to be 2 hours late rather than told several times that it will be 1/2 hour late. My second complaint is how uncomfortable the seats are now! I'm a 5'4"" woman who is not overweight and the seats are so narrow that I find it difficult to get comfortable at all. Sitting beside someone with any normal width to their shoulders has us touching each other and I feel I need to keep my arms as close in as possible - making for a very uncomfortable situation. The seat in front has been moved so that it's difficult to read a magazine at times because it presses up against the seat in front. Flying WJ is now like flying Air Transat or other charter company flights. I also find now with the odd exception the inflight crew to be disinterested and not very friendly.

Check-in was effective staff attentive and friendly I purchased extra legroom and there was enough space. I am based in Budapest and travel on business frequently. When flying within Europe I prefer to fly budget airlines - primarily Wizzair Ryanair to a lesser extent over legacy/full service carriers: 1) Wizzair flies early and late during the day allowing a full day of work at destination. Hate flying into destinations where budget airlines do not fly e.g. Zurich where the first flight from Budapest arrives after 11 am and the last one leaves at 5 pm. 2) Wizzair breaks down the difference between economy and business into specific services that you can purchase individually (priority boarding extra legroom lounge more luggage etc.). Thus you can travel effectively on business within Europe picking what you want for prices lower than economy ticket on legacy airlines. 3) They are cheap (for the most part). 4) They have some of latest bag drop-off times allowing one to start off for the airport later and time is money. Flying from smaller airports also means shorter check-in times (although sometimes offset by these airports being farther from cities). 5) Their policies actually make sense: I have no sympathy for those who wish to bring on board their wooden trunks and carpet bags on boards. They take up precious on space on board and slow down boarding. You should pay dearly for this or check them in!

The flight itself was unremarkable and only slightly late into Luton but the boarding process was a disgrace. Called forward to the gate we were loaded onto a large Cobus transport. There was no control as to the number allowed onto the vehicle and despite a second Cobus waiting more and more people climbed aboard the first bus until we were crammed in like sardines. We were then left standing there in considerable discomfort for twenty minutes before the Cobus left for the 'plane. The second Cobus with far fewer passengers followed us and at the aircraft those second vehicle passengers were allowed to board. We stood for a further five minutes before being allowed onto the 'plane by which time the second lot of passengers had had first choice of the seats on this free-seating flight.

As there are now only two carriers offering nonstop service on this route and BA is not my favourite I chose VS despite a poor experience a few years ago. I was pleasantly surprised to board a clean and fresh looking aircraft and be welcomed by friendly and helpful crew. I had paid for an extra legroom seat which gave the advantage of an empty seat next to me. The crew were pleasant and informative throughout the flight particularly when offering food. The toilets were clean and well stocked with necessary items. I didn't eat the cooked components of the dinner or breakfast so can't comment but it looked good and people around seem to have enjoyed it. I didn't use the IFE I never do but the offering looked somewhat limited.

When flying Wizz you are truly on a budget airline but it works and you get what you pay for. We carefully read the luggage rules in advance and avoided paying extra that some of our colleague pax had to do. Seats are OK but if you are XL (like me) you should consider buying a seat with extra leg room. One concern is safety: crew permitted passengers to leave their seats during taxi.

Online check-in worked perfect and the bag drop took a minute from when I got to the counter. Seats are tight - and I always have knee-room in coach. Luckily the flight was 40% full so had a full row of 3 seats to myself. If the flight was packed or was longer than 2 hours it ould be pretty bad. Flight Attendants were great - super friendly. Bought a sandwich and drink and was decent tasting and quantity. Arrived on time and bags were out fast.

The flight outwards (June) was a little delayed because the Captain was stuck on the M25 in a traffic jam but we arrived in LAX only a few minutes late. The flight back (September) left on time and arrived early. Both planes were reasonably new and the entertainment systems worked once they had been rebooted. Check-in staff were helpful and took our ""just over the weight limit bags"" without comment. Food on both legs was very poor and having suffered their dreadful versions of vegetarian food when we went to India I had taken the precaution of buying my own main course at M&S (LHR) or at a deli (LAX) - this proved to be a wise choice and I was the envy of my row. On the return flight pre-meal drinks arrived after we had eaten which seemed a bit strange. Breakfast offerings in economy were a complete joke and not worth accepting. The cabin crew worked reasonably hard but I did get a little tired of cabin announcements. They did give everyone the impression that the trip was a holiday for them and they were going to have a good time when they got to LAX (or LHR) and were very self congratulatory over the PA system on ""how hard they had worked to please us"". Maybe they think that if they say it often enough we will believe them. We had a choice of airlines when booking our flights and chose the cheapest but on reflection we will fly with BA next time because despite the complaints they get we think they are better than Virgin.

The flights where dirt cheap at Â£300 for 3 people with 1 bag and reserved seats. Flight WW206 16/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft:TF-WOW. Check in opened at 16.10 for the 19.40 flight. It was quick and there where 3 check in staff. The flight was nearly full today which shows they are doing well. We have reserved seats which we did get and they did acknowledge that when we booked we had the 12kg hand luggage allowance. Boarding opened at 18.40 for the 19.40 flight and we went immediately to the gate. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen causing delays. It was painful and needs to be improved lot be like the procedure at KEF. We pushed back at 20.00 (late) and we were off at 20.15. The flight was good with comfy seats with recline. The buy on board was cheap in comparison with Ryanair and the crew where professional but chatty (a good balance). We landed at 23.10 in a blizzard. KEF was unprepared and we had to wait for 2 0mins to attach the jetway. Baggage was also slow but this wasn't wow's fault. Good flight but poor ground services all in all. Flight WW201 20/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft TF-WOW. Check in opened at 04.45 for all the morning flights (06.50-07.00-07.15). (Ours was at 07.00). Check in was quick and there were 5 staff for 3 flights which was OK. Our flight was also again nearly full. KEF airport is a good airport in terms of departures. We went to the gate at 06.00 and the gate area opened at 06.20. Boarding began at 06.30 and they just let everyone one which was easier. This time the plane was bang on time for pushback at 07.00 and was up at 07.07. The flight was yet again good with a cheap buy on board and yet again a drinks round and a tea or coffee round which is good in comparison with easy jet. The plane landed at 09.40 (15mins early) and we were off at 09.50 baggage handling however needs to be faster. No entertainment was available. WOW air needs to add online check in and enhance the boarding experience at LGW before I can say it's a decent 3 star airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,4,3,1,NA,NA,4,1

From our first flight; I gather that Wow air is a semi decent low cost airline that requires improvement. Check in opened 3hours and 30 mins before and a new hand luggage allowance has been out in place meaning passengers where getting nervous if the there bags would be fine. Wow air fail to provide online check in making it less of an attractive option. On today's flight wow air where 20mins late arriving and boarding was chaotic. They boarded in rows but nobody listened. We took off 35 mins late and the inflight experience was the same as easyjet. We saw the northern lights which was a plus but doesn't affect the airline's performance. The flight landed 20mins late in a blizzard but the pilot did a good job and landed smoothly. The crew where chatty but professional. Once arriving in KEF the jetway failed to attach on several attempts and we waited for 30mins before we could get off. Even worse we had to wait for another 30mins for our luggage meaning we left KEF at 00.25 instead of 23.30 not good. WOW AIR need improvement to its ground services before I can recommend it. However our return expirence may be better if not in a blizzard. The inflight was average for low cost travel.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,3,3,3,NA,NA,3,0

The aircraft's are quite new and clean. If you're lucky you can get the plane with slim seats: it will entitle you to a decent legroom otherwise with the old ones is simply inhuman. In my opinion that's the only bad point of this airline. The rules about hand luggage are not easy but once familiar is possibly to cope with. The ground staff in this respect in MXP are very tolerant while in BUD are strict and rude. If booked in advance the fares are really good and the overall service is acceptable and better than Ryanair's.

There was no soap either. The 5 hour transit wait was unpleasant. Sanaa to Bangladesh flight was full. The aircraft was infested with flies and it was hard to eat. Food isn't great but its ok for the price. There are no snacks even if you ask. No extra milk for tea either except the powder sachet that you get once with your main meal. Reconfirming the flights in Bangladesh was erratic. Local agent asked I present my passport and ticket in person and present a copy of my visa (I was told by UK travel agents I only needed to phone in order to reconfirm)! In the end I argued with him and sent him a copy of my ticket and passport by fax. Return journey from Bangladesh to Sana'a was the same on Flight IY0873 and the first class seat I was in (seat 2E) was very shabby and only slightly larger than economy but did have good legroom. The footrests were broken and there were flies buzzing around. Trasit at Sanaa to London was done in the bus and boarding cards handed out while the bus was moving to the transit lounge where more people got on. The official took all our passports and disappeared for a while. He then left all our passports with a fellow passenger and jumped off the bus. We had to frantically grab our passports because of the risk of theft. Sanaa to London flight had same food and flies and the stewardess explained that the flies were around because of the dates in Yemen. We requested she spray insecticide and she said she would try but it never happened. 20 minutes before landing at Heathrow she sprayed insecticide but that was because of UK rules. Verdict - Flight schedule was super crew dont go the extra mile. I will travel with them again if the fare is cheap and I am the only traveller otherwise I will give them a miss. Not recommended for families because of the really poor transit lounge and toilets.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Onboard crew know nothing about ground services at all. Despite double checking with call centre on arrival from transit resulted in an additional visa on arrival USD 25.00. Bus to connecting flight pay yet more tax. Go through immigration and advised cannot take water into departure lounge. This only happens Jakarta to Singapore. Get hotel to print out boarding pass for departure to Australia get to the airport and told you need another boarding pass. Business class lounge very basic yes I know they are doing renovations but they are also doing the same renovations in Denpasar so again very basic and don't even think of asking for a drink. Transfer from Jakarta to Denpasar not my request but the only flight on this day. Dropped off at the Domestic Arrival and told to find own way to International approx 15 minutes walk. Off to immigration but told you must pay more tax so far the cost of the tickets has risen by over USD 100.00 just to transit. Not all problems are Garuda's taxes are government but passengers must be fully informed. Transit passengers should be assisted not abandoned.

There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine.

air-tahiti-nui,/airline-reviews/air-tahiti-nui,Air Tahiti Nui customer review,Ellen Paul,NA,2009-02-03,The flight attendants told passengers those in-transit to Auckland need not complete the Tahitian immigration forms and we should proceed to the transit lounge. This is what we had expected and made sense. Once off the aircraft though those of us who entered the lane marked transit lounge and walked the short distance to the transit lounge found it locked. No one could tell us why it was locked how to enter the lounge or what to do. We asked the cabin crew as they came off the aircraft and they shrugged their shoulders and walked on. Eventually we realized the only option was to complete Tahitian immigration forms and go into the baggage claim area as it appeared we might be able to enter the transit lounge from there. This however proved not to be true. Again no one seemed to know what we should do even though we kept asking how to enter the transit lounge. I speak passable French so this was not a language problem. Eventually we picked up our luggage and cleared Customs. When we entered the airport terminal I found an Air Tahiti Nui staff and she told us that the transit lounge was not open and we would have to go to a hotel for the night. She seemed unconcerned and disinterested. I then found the security office but they couldn't tell me anything. I returned to the Air Tahiti Nui staff who told me that everyone knows that Tahiti won't let passengers use the transit lounge and we should have known it. We weren't about to spend over $100 to stay in a hotel room for a few hours so along with two dozen other passengers we spent the time in the hot dirty smoky airport terminal. The ATN check-in desks finally opened at about 4-30 a.m. and we were able to get our boarding passes but as Security didn't open for another hour or so we were still forced to wait in the terminal. Once allowed into the departure lounge we found that it was shabby dirty and unpleasant. A small coffee bar sold food but didn't accept credit cards and we weren't about to go back out through Security to find an ATM to get cash in a currency we didn?t need just to buy a cup of coffee. You may wonder why we didn't just go directly to the departure lounge and wait there. Well the ATN staff in LAX refused to give us the boarding passes from Papeete to Auckland. They said that they issue boarding passes no more than three hours in advance. When we arrived in Papeete the check-in counters were closed. Thus we couldn't get boarding passes and couldn't get into the departure area. Three weeks later when departing Auckland I asked an ATN supervisor why they don't let transit passengers use the transit lounge. She said that in their view a layover of that length does not constitute in-transit and that they are unwilling to allow people to use the transit lounge. As ridiculous as this is the worst part is that they don't bother to warn you about it before you travel so you can take this into account when making your travel plans. Upon arrival back in Papeete with only an hour layover we again found the transit lounge locked even though flight attendants assured us we would be allowed to wait in the transit lounge. Instead they simply diverted transit passengers directly into the departure lounge even though most hadn't been issued a boarding pass in Auckland (we had one but only because I went back to the check-in counter and insisted upon it). Obviously they could have done exactly the same thing on the Papeete- Auckland overnight layover had they wanted to do so. I suspect the whole thing is a means of trying to force passengers to spend some money in Tahiti. Whatever the reason it is a shabby way to treat passengers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

She also told us to return to the airport at 1800 hours. We said to the very nice lady (who disappeared about five times as they were obviously being briefed on what to do) that we were going back into town for the day which we did. Due to the delay and a 3 hour drive on return we were looking at booking a hotel for the night at Gatwick but just to check whether we were being told the truth about the 19.15 departure time I decided to check when the rescheduled outward flight was going to leave LGW on the easyjet flight scanner - because it was actually in the air and on further inspection our flight had been rescheduled back to 1250pm - showing on both easyjet and airport websites. Jump into taxi and return to airport. Easyjet (and their agents) must have known at the time we were dropping our bags that the outward flight was actually happening as the plane must have been loaded and on the taxiway at LGW. Also easyjet made no attempt to communicate with us by email or mobile phone.

Flight to Moscow aborted at last minute routed to Warsaw where Singapore Airlines had no affiliation. Sat on plane for 2 hours after landing in Warsaw then escorted to airport. Once in the lounge and able to check flights we saw we had been booked on a flight to Paris and to Houston the next morning. Went to gate and told we had no ticket for this flight went back to where we originally left and there was a SA rep. After some time told we could not take this flight. Told to gather luggage and go to a hotel. Told we were being put on a plane to Copenhagen then to Chicago and then to Houston arriving 36 hours after planned arrival. Inquired why we could not take flight to Paris as previously scheduled connection time now too close and airline would not book. In summary I have been flying internationally my entire oil field career over 30 years I have experienced delays cancellations re-routes etc. I have never seen such a poor handling of a situation as this.

We booked our travel with Emirates, travelling Brisbane, Barcelona, Paris, London, Dubai and return. The preference for our seating was booked by our travel agent for the window seats in the left rear from rows 46-49. However, on every sector except from London to Dubai, the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle - four of us! I telephoned the booking offices at each location, who refused to help, then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. It was a long journey which we had to endure. I found almost all of their staff, be it Cabin Crew or Counter Staff to be very robotic in their attitude. No customer service at all. No friendly disposition, no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. The food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. However, this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again. I did the right thing, booked our trip with them months in advance of our travel, preference of seats and very disappointed at their lack of empathy that we were travelling long distances and no courtesy in endeavouring to help.

It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly. Boarding in Bogota is a mess (no priority lanes) and lounge is also mediocre without enough seats on peak periods.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Who knew! This is a brand new 737 with a 2-2 business class configuration. Not flat beds though just recliner business class seats. Which for such a long flight is a bit of an inconvenience especially given the tix price. Love having the cook on board. From Turkish delight which is served to you at the very beginning of the flight to your meals ending with strong Turkish coffee the culinary experience is outstanding. Service was a bit distracted. They forgot the menu. They forgot the toiletry bag. The lights were never really dimmed off on this overnight flight. But ok it happens some times. This is a great plane for continental flights but am not convinced it works for 6+ hour overnight flights.

Having flown out on Boeing 777 300 ER (see separate earlier report) with the compromised and uncomfortable new business class seat / bed I was surprised how much more comfortable the older seat / bed arrangement is on the A380.

First of all a flight 2 weeks in advance from the booking date for Â£9.99 one way can not be denied this is a brilliant price for an on-time flight on a virtually brand new 737-800. The one gripe I'd have is the allocated seating (something that most airlines use effectively). As a frequent FR traveller I pick the same seat every time unfortunately the common sense of booking and then finding your seat seems to have evaded some people as it turned into some chaos - so I'd advise to still get on the aircraft towards the front. Other than that I'm extremely happy to fly Ryanair again and again as the on-time no-frills cheap flights will always be too good to turn down!

Also the powerports at every seat really makes a difference. One small detail that is easily overlooked but which I greatly appreciate is the Google Maps feature that tracks where your plane is.

The two flights on the larger planes in and out of London were awful no leg room and as other people say when you recline your seat the base goes forward leaving you with no leg room. Even my 9 year old was not comfy the seats are hard and narrow. The flights from Abu Dhabi to Male were better more room bigger seats however toilets are at back next to galley so a nightmare squashing in and out. Food on all sectors was disappointing given a brown paper bag with a sandwich. Had run out of our choice on one leg. Found staff in general to be very abrupt. Also one drinks service coming into London. I also don't like that when I asked for a gin and tonic they mix it themselves instead of giving you the mini bottles so you have no idea how much they have put in. Thought the entertainment was okay but nothing amazing. Apart from the minimal leg room the worst part was being stuck for 3 hrs in Abu Dhabi airport. It is small with very limited eating areas Abu Dhabi to male we didn't even have seating at the gate everyone was on the floor then straight on. Queues for transit both ways were horrendous and badly organised we were in the end taken through the business express lane. If you are used to Dubai airport I don't recommend it.

Outbound flight had no IFE and was disappointed with no inflight magazine (but then they have taken out the seat pockets so there would be nowhere to put it anyway!). Return flight was on a brand new brilliant B737 with personal IFE and mood lighting. Excellent crew who handled a medical emergency well and all were very engaging with passengers - really good to see. Transfer to T3 to connect with Emirates was smooth although distances are long so it takes time.

We got over Orlando and we had to turn around and go back to the airport. Finally get to Knox then we have no gate for the plane to go into so we sat on the runway for about an hour.

Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful.

Check-in at Las Vegas was quick and easy. Staff were very professional and polite. Our aircraft was a Boeing 777 from Las Vegas and the flight was completely full. I was very disappointed in Korean's B777 33 in. pitch in economy seating. My knees were jammed into the seat in front of me the whole 12.5 hour flight making for a very uncomfortable trip. I am 6 ft. tall and 33 inch seat pitch is just not enough space for the 12 plus hour flight. It was also very difficult to eat from the tray table when it is jammed into your lap contributing to a very bad flight experience. Korean Air seems to be missing the point when they skimp on customer seat space to enhance their bottom line in profits. Seat space is my only main complaint about Korean Air's commitment to quality of service. I might add that KE657 was an older B747 and to my surprise offered more seat pitch in their economy seating in the 6 hour trip than on their B777's 12 hour trip. From now on my airline loyalty will not be based on price but on seating comfort. Maybe flying an airline with premium economy class may be my next choice.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,2,5,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

Food service was slow and FA didn't clear trays for ages. Second leg to Singapore on A380 was much anticipated but disappointing seat configuration thus narrow seats thus alot of discomfort. SIN-DXB was much better but had to keep asking for water/drinks. Don't know why they just don't offer bottles of water like in business class. Flying from Singapore to Perth on Qantas we were given bottles of water to rehydrate - great for a 5 hours flight and essential for a 10+ hour flight which Emirates should consider. Last flight was the worst - lots of turbulence so we didn't get any meals. Not Emirates fault but the crew were very unprofessional. Very thirsty flight again as not enough water/drinks provided. Granted we had to remain seated during the turbulence but one cup of water and 1 juice is not enough for a 5 hour flight. Cabin crew on all sectors were not very helpful and not very friendly. Same could be said of counter staff at the business class lounge. We've been flying Emirates for 10 years and except for the last couple of years due to a change in our country of abode and travel patterns have had to use other airlines so have slipped down to Skywards silver status. We were planning to use Emirates more for our 2014 flights but will now consider other airlines.

How about sending passengers without a printed boarding pass to one of the other counters to make it work?

We had buzzed several times to have my wife's dishes taken away finally she took them to the kitchen herself and the attendant was in there looking at his phone and talking to another attendant.

However the fight back to Melbourne was on Qantas QF 154 on 26th March 2015. It was like chalk and cheese. The aircraft was a Boeing 737. The flight was full and it was cramped. There were many people flying back to Melbourne from Auckland after the cricket - I couldn't understand why Qantas were not able to have a larger aircraft.

Both ways were trouble-free clean surroundings good food and friendly crews. Coming back took less time of course due to tailwind. Staff were attentive and alert but much better banter on return. The seats were slightly cramped for my liking and I would have traded my TV screen for a footrest in front to take pressure off the top of my legs as I'm 5.3 but there was still more room than some airlines I've been on. I enjoyed both flights no delays or problems going a slight delay on return by 15 minutes due to ill crew member but provisions speedily made and we made up the time getting home and landed practically on time in Manchester. Take off and landing were smooth and the plane had very little turbulence both ways. Baggage was handled speedily for us with no case problems. The flight entertainment was plentiful with music TV and films available to select. Food in Economy was as good as it can get on any flight that doesn't have a built-in restaurant. Drinks and trolley food a bit expensive but main meals and snacks that came round I found to be quite tasty and varied but I'm not hard to please with food. I've read several reviews here and it seems as if we hit a lucky window with the best journey and staff at the time! But it does happen obviously. I can honestly say everything was great.

The flights themselves were as good as any we have flown with other more expensive airlines (all economy) the inflight entertainment was very good the seats and legroom all as good as other airlines. The lack of English speaking flight attendants was not a problem they all understood basic requests and certainly spoke English better than I spoke Chinese. All planes were modern and the long journeys were on the new A380's. On our return journey we had a 16 hour stopover in Guangzhou. We were offered a complementary hotel room and were taken on a bus to a hotel in the city. The hotel was ok but the beds were rock solid. Admittedly we all slept after the 14.5 hr flight. The hotel was a nice diversion and a way to see a bit of the real China outside of the airport. Our only minor disappointment was the food on board all the flights. It was very much traditional Chinese cuisine not the westernised version we eat in Australia but this is to be expected I suppose as it is a Chinese airline. All in all the experience was good and for the price we paid as a group of 5 adults the savings we made using China Southern were better spent as spending money on our trip than in the profits of a more expensive airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,5,NA,NA,5,1

I bought a ticket for an employee before this policy took effect who was not able to make the trip. Since then SW started supposedly ""enforcing a policy that has been in place"" without any sort of notification. Now I'm out almost $500 because they won't refund the ticket or allow me to use the credit for another passenger - even if it's just transferred to my name. Their reason when I filed a complaint? ""a proactive step to align our business with the general practice of the airline industry"" So it seems SW is in fact purposefully intending to become just another airline. The really upsetting part is that only a week or two earlier another trip for an employee had to be cancelled and I was able to use the flight credit for someone else. Suddenly I can't. No notification at all. I get emails just about every other day from SW advertising their ""get- away"" deals; couldn't they have simply sent out an email letting us know their policy was going to go into effect?

The seat width and pitch was OK. The seat back entertainment was fairly limited. The food and beverage service was extremely slow. Bearing in mind that the flight departed at 20.40 the service did not begin for at least 2 hours after take off. Cabin crew was pleasant and helpful. My return flight was on the Dreamliner. The seat pitch and width were OK however the seat itself is very hard I had to use the small pillow they provide to sit on. I can't say that I noticed a huge difference between the Dreamliner and the 777 other that the size of the aircraft. If I was doing that route again I would consider flying with KQ.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,4,2,2,NA,NA,2,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,J Barrett,United Kingdom,2012-09-17,We flew from Bournemouth to Dublin. At check in we were told that our bags were too big to go on as hand luggage in spite of the fact that they are the same bags we have always used. We were charged Â£24 each. This was happening to everyone. Two passengers travelling separately both objected as they had travelled from Dublin to Bournemouth only a couple of days earlier with the same bags as hand luggage. It seems if we had made a scene we would not have been charged $8. Also another passenger on the same flight had a case that would fit under his seat and the steward had to remove it and put it at the back of the plane he was not charged for his bag either. On returning from Dublin to Bournemouth we checked in our bags thinking we had no option other than to pay (there are signs around saying pay up or leave your bags behind) and the check in girl said 'you do not need to check these in they are hand luggage.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,5,1,0,0,NA,NA,1,0

For all the hype about their premium products their Economy product is nothing short of dreadful. We chose to fly Etihad with our 2 young boys (3 and 1 years old) from Manchester to Sydney because of their so called ""Flying Nanny"" service. Unfortunately we felt let down by the lack of attention our children got from this apparent qualified nanny who seemed on most occasions to be missing in action and when this Nanny was about she seemed less than enthusiastic wanting to interact with the children. I thought nannies were supposed to actually like children. Now I know food on airplanes isn't supposed to be amazing especially in economy but the matter they classified as ""food"" was about as tasty as a smelly sock after football practise in fact a more accurate description of what they were serving up would be slop with a fancy name. I'm pretty sure the sautÃ©ed potatoes was cardboard and that kofta isn't a sausage that has had the life shrivelled out of it. The drink selection wasn't better with a smorgasbord of typical commercial larger which leave a disappointing metallic after-taste. In total we flew 4 legs with this lame imitation airline and on each occasion we were delayed by an hour. That's 4 hours in total that. Part of the reason is a lack of staff at the check in counters and the other being the shambolic nature of Abu Dhabi airport where planes are parked willy nilly along the tarmac waiting for a gate to load the latest bunch of impatient and weary travellers while arrivals are ushered into buses like cattle and given a tour of the entire airport before finally dropping arrivals at their intended destination. All in all if you are a parent travelling to the other side of the world with your 2 little bundles of joy only fly this cheap imitation of an airline if it's the cheapest ticket you can find by a long shot.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,2,1,1,2,NA,NA,3,0

Premium Economy on 777-300ER featured not only more legroom and more deeply reclining seats but a wider arm rest between seats resulting in a sense of not crowding the passenger next to me (or vice versa!). Odd that dinner would be served at approximately 2.00 am when all I wanted to do was sleep. All-in-all a pleasant if lengthy trip and because of a small subsection of the cabin reserved for this class it provided a feeling of relative seclusion. Very attentive staff.

I paid to put my luggage in the hold but people were trying it on at the gate to get away with it and Ryanair don't move at all on the rules. I also paid for priority boarding as they only sell this to half of the seats on the plane you are almost guaranteed to sit together peace of mind your boarding 1st to save the bun fight when you get to the gate.

While selling as a LAN business class package there are actually no business seats for flying within Argentina or Chile so business is only for the International component. Flight attendants generally did their job very well and were friendly. The pisco sours from Lan were the nicest I had and food was always of good quality. The problem and this is a big one is with the scheduling. LAN schedules daily flights Santiago to Auckland but seem to cancel them quite easily. Our flight on the 21st March was cancelled and I believe a second flight was also cancelled that week. Obviously this causes major inconvenience and although we had plenty of notice we still had nothing else to do but spend time in the Santiago Airport holiday Inn. Some of the Argentine regional airports could have used a third check-in counter going (El Calafate Ushuaia) as there were long queues.

There's nothing to complain about in terms of seat comfort - be it a small 737-600 or an A320 the comfort level is pretty much the same and quite decent at that.

The ride is definitely bumpier but even here the legroom is above standard. The most cramped aircraft by far is the CRJ900 though that's mainly due to the narrow cabin while the seat pitch remains comfortable. My only major issue was the somewhat misleading information by the crew suggesting that people claim their baggage in Stockholm for customs even though it is checked directly to the destination.

The movie selection was not great and their interface needs improvement Crew - Now there are a lot of small things that make an airline great and I do tend to see them from the captain speaking about the journey and enthusiasm of the crew with a big smile each time they serve.

The lounge in Singapore for Gold Star Alliance is very busy and a bit tired. Was sat at the back of the plane and the main complaint was that it was unbearably hot. Was told that it would cool down after takeoff it did but took a while and in any case the cabin was still uncomfortable warm for the entire flight. This seems to be a theme with all the Singapore Airlines night flights just too hot and uncomfortable in the cabins on overnight flights. The seats are not very comfortable either very hard after a while and the IFE screens were old and looked a bit fuzzy. Toilets were ok and the food was pretty average. The standout was the crew who were very good and provided an excellent service. They are let down by the physical product though and the warm cabins.

The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia.

We were immediately flown out to NYC on Virgin Upper Class from LHR after an M25 dash and transferred to Washington on the next day following a dreadful overnight stop near JFK. Our return flight from IAD was excellent in every respect.

We took this up in June for a California flydrive via LAS. Outward flight was again excellent in every respect and Stansted was a revelation - but Maxjet let themselves down with a 3 hour delay at LAS on the way back because of a glitch over catering equipment that left them with the need to wash and sterilise the set used on the outward flight.

Seat reservations is a bit of a task and resulted in us not getting any window seats but we know what to do now. The Dreamliner has some issues such as access for passengers sitting in the middle seats you have to put trays and TV screens away so they can get out and that was in Premium so assume it was worse for Economy. Plus the aisle arm rests are a bit dangerous and seem to work loose very easily which results in the table sometimes not reaching its rest on the opposite side as the armrest moves too much.

The Ryanair staff were walking down the line as we were waiting to board with a box the size of what suitcases were allowed a shand luggage but I never saw them check against anybody's luggage. Some of the so called hand luggage was almost as big as my hold suitcase.

Do Delta train staff to be so rude or is this a criterion for selection to Delta staff. We were offered no headphones. After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed! We were assured that cabin crew would pace the plane with offers of drinks all night. Not only was this absolutely not the case but again it was virtually possible to get their attention at any stage of the night. The supper was moderate. The ""breakfast"" was probably the worst meal I have had on a flight ever. It was accompanied by a literally frozen salad so one had to chomp the ice off.

Cabin crew on all flights were very friendly courteous and helpful without being robotic. Check-in at SYD very smooth and quick with a very friendly agent. Angled flat-bed seats on the A330-300 is behind industry standard but they were comfortable enough to allow sleep but storage space is severely limited. Flat-bed seats on the A380 are much more comfortable with a lot more storage space for personal items but still not an industry-leading product. Forward mini-cabin on A380 feels very private and quiet. On-board catering reasonably good on all flights with the satay being consistently top-notch. Check-in at LHR also quick with friendly agents.

There are no ""middle seats"" as the configuration is 2 and 2 and there are no carts - the flight attendants use baskets of chips and put the soft drinks in the pockets of their apron. I like that.

When we landed at PTY we could not find anyone to help us with information on our connecting flight. The business class seat on the second flight - PTY to JFK had no leg rest and barely reclined. Then they lost our luggage on the connecting flight from PTY to JFK. No Copa employee could be found in the JFK baggage arrivals area.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,NA,2,1,3,2,NA,NA,1,0

But for the Italian flights they treated us very badly pretending not to understand us even though an Italian passenger translated for us. As we found out later they breached regulations by not providing accommodation or a phone call even though at the time we did ask the supervisor. We were left stranded in Olbia at 2 am and ended up being ripped off by a taxi driver to the tune of â¬200. Between the two flights we lost two days of hotel bookings one day's car rental ran up a large mobile phone bill trying to sort it out with Meridiana etc. As an earlier poster described their offices are incredibly inefficient when you have a complaint.

Meanwhile nobody else could get past to get to their seats. Service on board was extremely slow we had the wrong menu card. Even though the Cabin Crew were wearing 'Happy new year' hats when we boarded there was only a passing reference to it being 2014 as we passed over Romania. Abu Dhabi airport experience was an awful chaotic shambles. Multiple flights arrived simultaneously and they clearly could not cope with the thousands of passengers in transit. Nobody knew what they were queuing for or even if they were in the right terminal. Airport staff were taking no notice of those who were trying to tell them they would miss their connection if they stayed in the queue luckily we had a 3 hour wait so we were not worried just bemused at the chaos. Security control was a joke only 6 manned and shouting to us to 'leave everything in your bags'. Not looking forward to going back through on the way home.

All I had was a small carry on and personal bag. They ran out of over head room and I had to check my suitcase in. I figured I would get it back once I reached Philly for my layover. They actually checked it in. Did not bother to tell anyone this. To make matters worse my connecting flight was delayed. Overall flight going was bearable despite the inconveniences. Returning however a whole other story. I arrived at the tiny airport an hour before the security check point was open. After getting through security with the 30 other passengers we waited about 20 minutes extra. We all board in an efficient manner. About 1/2 of us had to check in our small pieces of luggage because the plane was too small for it to be true carry on. So we board and are ready to take off. The pilot arrived we waited 15 minutes before taking off. I have 64 minutes of a layover. We get near philly and have to circle around then land. After landing we sit on the tarmac for 5 minutes in 2 different spots. I have less than 15 minutes to get to my gate. We deplane and wait for the ground crew to unload the ""carry on"" luggage. They move with no purpose. Most of the fight has less than 20 minutes to catch their next flight. I get my bag. No fault to the airline but my connecting flight is out of a different gate and I have to take a shuttle there. This trip takes about 7 minutes. I see my plane at the gate. By the time I got to the gate the plane was pulling away. After all of this the next day my flight took off about 45 minutes behind schedule.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,Paul Samiec,United Kingdom,2013-10-02,LGW-GCN (Gatwick to Gran Canaria). Unfortunately low cost airline means in this case a lot. The price was ok but it's really showing what are you paying for. The seats are the most uncomfortable I have seen. If passenger next to you is a little bit bigger than the size of the seat then you are just stuck and pushed. Free wi-fi is a good advertising option but works very slowly. It takes several attempts to make anything work on Wi-Fi. Another rip off is the bar on board. They don't accept payments in Euros! Only credit cards and UK Pounds. The worst part of flying with Norwegian is the rude staff. It happened both ways: from London and back from Gran Canaria. There is a lot they can learn from EasyJet. If you a looking for a very basic flight without being fussy about service on board quality of seats and rudeness of staff then Norwegian is for you. Otherwise I will suggest trying some other airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,Andrew Inman,Australia,2014-09-01,In July 2014 I flew Norwegian from Bangkok to Oslo Oslo to Bergen and Bergen to Paris (Orly) with my wife and young daughter. The price (and the chance to fly a 787 Dreamliner) was what attracted us but we were very happy with the whole experience. All flights were pretty much on time (give or take 10 mins). The Dreamliner was great. The seat space was equivalent to the Qantas A330 we flew Sydney to Bangkok. The pre-ordered (Thai) meal was good and the inflight snack purchase system was fun (swipe your credit card in the entertainment system and order from there). The inflight entertainment was also great both the selection and the system. The Norway / Paris flights were straightforward but good. Leg room was reasonable (I'm 6' 4) especially compared to other LCCs. And the in flight magazine was well worth reading. Hopefully the teething problems that people reported with the Bangkok - Oslo flights have been worked through because I really buy into the ethos of Norwegian. Flying Norwegian saved us well over A$2000 and financially it turned our vacation from an eye-wateringly expensive burden to something that was doable and enjoyable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Awful from booking to completion of the flight. As a BA. Gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new A380 only to be told by BA in May 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of a special Far East holiday I had high expectations of BA First which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Todd Triebler,Australia,2015-05-20,I chose this airline to travel to Europe and back from Australia as it had reasonably priced business-class fares. I had read mixed reviews but decided to give it a go. First leg Sydney to Ho Chi Minh city was in an A330 6 years old. The plane was clean and comfortable and in quite good condition. The service was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. The meals were very good and the wine list excellent mainly French. Not full lie-flat seats but close to it - enough to get a good rest. The Ho Chi Minh lounge is OK not great. Comfortable and with good stocks of beverages but the Western Food selection is minimal. Also no showers which would be a welcome addition. By contrast the Hanoi lounge is excellent with slightly better Western food selection and shower facilities. Decent standard and roomy. The flights to and from Europe are on older 777's. These do not have lie flat seats but rather the older wide seats that recline significantly. Again not bad for a rest and short sleep but not a longer deep sleep that you might get with full lie-flats. The entertainment system does not work so you are provided with ipads instead which is more than satisfactory. The selection is not as great as on Emirates Qantas or Singapore but enough to keep you occupied for the duration of the flight with not too much trouble. The 777's are about to be replaced with new 787's and A350's so this will refresh the hard offering from Vietnam to Europe and offer the latest comforts of air travel. I am inclined to book more travel with this airline to Europe once the new planes are in service. Overall I found the experience satisfying and good value for money.

We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters.

Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles.

I was from BUD without demands upgraded from the cheapest possible economy ticket to business class to DOH. The cabin was almost full (10 seats of 12 taken) but service was top-notch despite I was initially not expected to be in the business class. Champagne has changed from Jackquart to Lanson. Food very good. Seats not lie flat but no much need to lie down on a day flight? Doha Hamad Airport is still in its infantry but service desks are all over the place to make up for faults. Arrived to be taken to the gates by the busses which was a first disappointment. The lounges are not fully operating: very few and crowded and short of meat-dishes showers and sparkling wine. WiFi is operating. DOH-SGN: Boarding directly from gate to aircraft ! A huge improvement from the old airport. Upgraded at gate despite aircraft was only 30% full.

At the ticket counter I was lucky to find a seat on the next flight departing the next day. The company offered to cover my accommodation expenses for the night but that was a basic hotel room to share with two other passengers. I refused their offer which I found disgusting and insulting. On the way back to Frankfurt I had to change flight twice. At every time I had to pass the immigration check to collect my luggage and check in again. Luckily I had enough time to do that. Hongzouh to Beijing was canceled. The company announced the flight was canceled two hours before the departure. Until then the flight was scheduled as normal. The reason for canceling the flight was the disruption of the air signalling system caused by the launch of a space ship. The launch was scheduled to take place at 6.30 pm. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 8.00 pm. Eventually two other passengers and I managed to get the last three seats on to another flight to Beijing.

Some folks were not pleased with having to have their stuff ""sized up"" prior to boarding. The new policy of charging for all drinks was not too popular as well.

I did see quite a number of people complaining and carrying on about being charged for their bags at both FLL and ACY. Its not that hard to avert these situations at the airport. The trick is to just be extra vigilant with things like baggage weight and all the conditions of your ticket with Spirit before you get to the airport. It is a budget carrier so it seems ridiculous to pay bottom dollar and then expect Emirates style service. On board as everyone knows their legroom is notoriously minimal and probably not going to kill you on a short 2-3 hour flight. A longer trans-continental though might just begin to. There's only buy on board snacks so bring your own. That's pretty much par for the course even if you fly with one of the bigger legacy carriers. BYO Entertainment too. For this short trip Spirit made sense and delivered. United and AA were both about $200 more for a comparable route and while they might offer frequent flyer mileage possibly entertainment there was little else that would have been dramatically different sad to say.,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,2,3,1,1,NA,NA,4,1

AB ground staff are rude and unhelpful. Ticketing/check-in/boarding area for Tegel is one of the most inefficiently planned and run CFs that I have ever had the displeasure to experience.

The flight between HYD-DXB on B777-200LR was good older IFEs even with 3-4-3 seat configuration it was comfortable [I am 5'5] but the food was simply excellent! I love the fact that EK gives a hot towel lime water [on flights between DXB and India] a menu card and stainless cutlery for Economy.

The first flight was delayed by over 3 hours due to technical issues with the plane which was falling apart and must have been at least 20 years old. There was no apology from the surly crew who wanted to do absolutely anything but their jobs. After finally taking off we were served some stringy stew which left much to be desired (although beers/wines were provided free of charge). Seats were horribly uncomfortable and the leg room unacceptable for a 5 hour flight. During the hours spent on the tarmac at Luton the crew were completely unwilling to help us in our attempts to contact Atlasjet reservations - we'd realised by this point that we'd be missing our connection and needed to re-book. Upon landing in Istanbul 3 hours behind schedule we found we'd missed our connecting flight - we had already accepted this would be the case and so were unsurprised but when we went to Atlasjet's ticketing desk to ask to be moved to the next flight we were told it wasn't their problem and as per their terms and conditions we would have to pay for a new flight. We couldn't believe that despite our delay being entirely their fault they were unwilling to move us to the next flight. We ended up forking out over Â£100 per person to continue on to Izmir with another airline.

Air Canada's flight arrival and departure times to Lima have always been inconvenient-arriving in Lima well after midnight, if the flight is on time, and departures for the return flight to Toronto leaving Lima at around 2 am. I returned to Canada from Lima on Air Canada in April. For my June flights regular Air Canada economy service is no longer available, only Rouge. Rouge is simply awful, unacceptable. The seats in Air Canada Rouge economy are the worst I have experienced in more than 40 years of international flying. They are narrow, with limited leg room and thin padding. The flight to Lima was bearable as I didn't try to sleep. The flight back was intolerable. Falling asleep in the seat resulted in back problems. I will not take Air Canada Rouge in the future if I can possible avoid it. There is no regular inflight entertainment system, the food was awful, although not necessarily worse than normal economy, and drinks cost extra.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Rowan Robertson,Malaysia,2015-01-14,KUL to LGW (via SGN). First time I've used Vietnam Airlines and overall I was fairly impressed. On the short KUL to SGN leg we got a pretty substantial meal of decent quality - certainly much more than many other airlines seem to offer for a sub 2 hour flight or in some cases for longer journeys than that. The A321 aircraft for this leg was also clean comfortable and fairly new looking. For the longer SGN to LGW part it was a 777 and the state of its cabin was the one negative aspect of our Vietnam Airlines experience. It looked pretty worn and it was actually less comfortable in regards leg room and seat comfort than the A321. Personally I don't really care about how good or bad the IFE is but I could see what this 777 had probably wouldn't impress passengers who do care about the IFE. In spite of those negatives I thought the service provided was really good. Again good quality meals and I found the cabin crew to be pleasant and helpful. I would not agree with other reviewers criticisms of English abilities. Granted none I came across could pass themselves off as native English speakers but they were perfectly good enough to do the job. I with zero Vietnamese ability had no problems communicating with any of them at all. So a little unfortunate I thought that their staff's good work was somewhat undermined by the less impressive state of the cabin they were working in. I should mention another positive was the transfer at SGN. I'd been warned by a friend who used to live in Ho Chi Minh City that it was a terrible airport. Indeed it was rather dated if glitzy shopping mall but it ticked the boxes that matter for me. Toilets were plentiful and all were spotlessly clean. Transit process was fast and efficient and simple food and drinks seemed much less of a rip off than many other international airports I've transferred via. Overall the pluses outweighed the minuses and I'd fly Vietnam again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,5,2,NA,NA,4,1

The only way I can describe an airline that insists on having 10 abreast seating on a 777 aircraft is pure greed honestly it just does not work you are so tightly packed and penned in it is just not funny. No matter how many pillows you tuck under and around yourself you just can't get into a comfortable position. As for trying to watch the inflight entertainment my only bit of advise is watch as much of it as you can before the meal service has ended because as soon as that seat reclines in front the screen will be a couple of inches away from your face. On a positive note no real queues for the toilet because so many people are trapped in their seat. I did find the staff excellent especially towards the kids and the food was really quite yummy and enough to keep you full for such a long flight. Do not have too many expectations on the inflight snack service all that was on offer was a packet of chips or a cookie.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2014-10-28,Have travelled several times with easyJet and continue to be very satisfied with the service provided. Crews work hard are helpful and informative and we never feel hassled. Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche. We would find it much more convenient if the whole of the Spring and Summer flights were published at the same time and easyJet would be less likely to lose our custom.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,1

At Dubai airport the business class in T1 is the one of British Airways which I repute average. All four routes were served by an A330. I have flown business class with the new herringbone seating configuration. Excellent comfort and good privacy maybe not as good for keeping an eye on the window for those seating next to it but those saying you can't I must disagree I was still able to get a nice view. During the night flights I skipped the meals but must say even on a day flight as short as two hours the meal was good standard. Inflight system is very good and the screen is really wide with a nice selection of movies. The cabin crew was simply magnificent. Another very positive remark is the cabin temperature. Most airlines keep the inflight climate freezing cold while in all flights with CX the cabin temperature was simply perfect. In conclusion I booked this flight attracted by a low fare but the value for money is outstanding to say the least. Look forward to travel again hopefully soon with Cathay.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

Saturday's flights were nearly empty but the flights Sunday were packed so it seems that if there is a rush the airline has no idea how to handle it. There were no weather issues or anything to cause multiple delays on Sunday and I really was never given a clear answer as to why all of my flights were delayed. It was a mix of ""technical issues"" and ""delays at other airports"". I was leaving Montreal for Toronto then had a connecting flight to Chicago. When booking my tickets all I was offered was a 30 minute change over between flights for the flight home. Porter in Toronto has a small terminal so on a normal day this should be no problem. In the end I missed my connection in Toronto to Chicago because of the original delay of 45 minutes in Montreal and my new second flight (an hour and half after my original flight) was also delayed by an hour and a half.

Lounge in Singapore not good. On a long haul flight such as this there are no showering amenities.

PEK to FNJ was on a newish and very clean two class TU-204 with decent seat pitch in economy drop down inflight entertainment and efficient service (economy bulkhead is row 4 first exit row with extra legroom is row 7). Catering consisted of the infamous Air Koryo 'hamburger' containing some kind of mystery meat and a choice of alcoholic or soft drink. Inflight entertainment consisted of clips from classical music performances and the obligatory state propaganda about the DPRK. Although there are headphone sockets none are given out (music plays throughout the cabin). Smooth landing but long taxiing time in Pyongyang. FNJ to PEK was on an older one class TU-204 with slightly less legroom but the service was the same - short propaganda piece inflight music and catering with the dreaded Air Koryo 'hamburger'. FAs are reasonably efficient if a bit robotic with adequate English skills (better than China Eastern for example). Quick check-in procedures in both Beijing and Pyongyang. Requested (and given) a window seat on both flights. No issues with luggage although baggage delivery in Pyongyang is painfully slow (allow 45 minutes or so waiting time). Overall a decent effort. The 1 star classification is unjustified - based on my experiences Air Koryo is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars overall.

I have flown this route a number of time with British Airways and it was with some reluctance I booked my most recent trip with Korean Air based on the schedule they offer on the service. Well I have to say that I was extremely impressed with the service. Less seats in the Business Sections mean the cabin feels more spacious and the seat itself was bigger and more comfortable. The service from the cabin crew was excellent very attentive and keen to ensure I was looked after. Plenty of choice on the in-flight entertainment and the food was definitely better than what I have experienced with other airlines. The only negative would be the lounges both at Heathrow and Incheon - they are not quite up to the standard in terms of food being offered.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

In 13 hours the beverage cart came by twice and only to serve meals. The crew at the gate were so rude and disorganized. By the end of the flight there was trash everywhere.

My partner is a very nervous flyer and on every leg we flew with them the cabin crew kept checking in on him to make sure he was okay. On our way home flying into Auckland we were told there was bad weather and one lovely cabin crew member even offered to sit by him as we landed. The food was nice and not too heavy and on the long haul sectors cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisle with drinks. The inflight entertainment system was fantastic and I would put it on par with Emirates ICE system! Any negatives?

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,P Duende,Canada,2014-09-28,We went on a one-week vacation to beautiful Samana. Upon arrival to the Ottawa Airport we couldn't check in using my husbands passport due to WestJet making a mistake on his name. A very nice representative helped us at Ottawa airport to check in using my passport. On the flight from Toronto to Samana I ended up in the middle seat besides a drunken passenger who just shut the window blind down and spent the entire trip sleeping and invading my personal space. Those planes are small so having to fight off your little space with another passenger is draining. My husband sitting on the alley chair had half his elbow bumped several times by one of the flight attendants. The plane was smelly but at least it wasn't visibly dirty this time. In-flight food: Their free offerings were the poorest I've had the displeasure of experiencing: tiny glasses of water/soft drink/coffee and just two 14 grams bags of cookies or sesame sticks for a 4 hours flight. I understand this was supposed to be a value flight but it wasn't the least expensive in the bunch when compared with Air Canada offerings. All the above mentioned would have been forgiven and forgotten had it not been for the nightmarish experience we had on our flight back. As stated we were among the first to arrive at Samana airport once there we were given two seats together (window and middle): all nice until we got on the flight. The seats were not reclining and we had not been informed. Once the people in front of us reclined we realized that it was impossible for us to do the same. My husband called the flight attendant thinking there was a way of reclining but she just said it was not possible in a rushed manner as if we were a nuisance. For four hours we had to sit uncomfortably with our knees being constantly banged by the hyper kids sitting in front of us and without any possibility of rest. I do believe that if the airline is going to take away a passengers right to a reclining chair/cabin space they should at least offer some kind of compensation be it in the way of a pillow for their sore-necks or a food voucher. To make things worse the cabin on the flight back to Toronto was extremely dirty. The smell could be catalogued more as a stench. The cherry on top was that our connection to Ottawa was delayed for 30 minutes or more due to WestJet having a flight from Cancun being delayed also so we ended up missing our bus connection at the airport.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Passengers not informed of what was happening and many missing connecting flights. Arrived at Air Asia terminal over 3 hours late. The Air Asia staff were if not rude then uncaring. About 20 people eventually marched through immigration and customs to a grotty corner of the airport - the desk for wheelchair service. Over 2 hours to rebook everyone using one computer terminal and entering computer codes manually. No food offered and no information given. Eventually ended up in a backpacker standard hotel - no towels in room no drinking water. To bed at 2am no food.

Did the pilot really think he could land in Salzburg despite severe weather warnings? About twenty minutes into the very uncomfortable flight the pilot told the passengers that there was a lightning strike in Salzburg that we could not land and he would let us know next steps. After thirty minutes into the forty-minute flight he announced that the problem in Salzburg was solved and that he was going to try to land even though he admitted that there were very high winds and heavy rain (and of course lightning). After the wheels went down and we headed to the airport he realized that trying to landing was futile. Minutes before we touched down he aborted the landing and flew back up into the storm. After letting us know that he could not land in Salzburg which was obvious he later told us that we were landing in Linz and that a bus would take us to Salzburg. While I realize the goal of the airline is to deliver passengers to their destination from my perspective the stress to the passengers on this flight could have avoided. We had no service because the attendant was securely fastened in her seat for almost all of this harrowing flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,3,0,0,NA,NA,2,0

The outdated entertainment system worked but the screen and controller were in very poor condition.

Due to budget cuts flights are often cancelled at the last minute and passengers are rerouted from direct flights to itineraries that consist of up to 3 extra flights. The airline will list several flights available but then combine all the passengers for that day on one flight. This makes travel with RAM impossible if you have a connection with a different airline. While travelling to Paris my husband and I had made separate reservations. For some reason he was told on a Monday that his Saturday flight had been cancelled. I was not alerted until Thursday that the same flight had been cancelled. My mother recently flew from JFK to Casablanca. It took her friend 2 hours after landing to receive her baggage. My mother's baggage was left behind in NY. We were told to call back the next day when the suitcase should have arrived on a flight coming in at 8am. The next day I called three times hours after the flight had arrived and was told that they could not confirm that the suitcase had come in. One customer service woman refused to let me speak to her supervisor and hung up on me! We ended up paying a 50$ taxi fare to go to the airport and were told to look for the suitcase ourselves by two employees who were sitting and gossiping and playing with their cell phones. Finally we found an employee in a back office who was willing to do his job. He went to another part of the airport and returned with the suitcase.

I decided to call back with the dates but also noticed a further EUR80 charge. Called a second time queried this with operator and was told 'take it or leave it'. I informed the operator this was unacceptable language and was cut off! Called a third time asked for the manager put on hold then spoke with the manager. Was told the charge applied to call centre fees and did not apply to online changes. As I could not get online I asked the manger to make the changes without the charge which they did. I asked for the second call to be investigated which they have not done.

Seats extremely close together. No leg room. Seat ahead of me was able to be reclined far back so the rude passenger in front of me had her head in my lap for the entire daytime return trip to Toronto. Flight attendants took the position that if the seat reclined that far she had every right to sit in it that way. Seats were broken down and upholstery very worn out so that the seat was uncomfortable in the extreme and caused back ache. There was a big mix up with my luggage during flight change in Lisbon. They claimed that my luggage was not indicated as being on the plane. I spent the 3 hours in Lisbon airport trying to solve this problem with no solution available.

china-eastern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-eastern-airlines,China Eastern Airlines customer review,H Baker,United Kingdom,2014-02-12,We flew LHR-Shanghai-Melbourne return having chosen the airline due to a good price and a desire to stopover in Shanghai. We were a little apprehensive having read some negative reviews but found our experience with them quite satisfying. The cabin crew were very obliging and helpful and there was surprisingly good leg room. We were able to get an emergency exit aisle seat on two of the sectors without having to pay extra - this was a nice bonus! The seats were adequately comfortable. As for the inflight entertainment there is not as much variety as you may get from more well known airlines but there was enough variety to keep your interest. On the way back we had a 7 hour delay due to an issue with the plane. Although this was annoying we were given meal vouchers to use at Melbourne Airport - the value of these was more then enough for two of us to have two really nice meals! Also when we arrived in Shanghai we were given compensation there as well. Having been delayed before on other airlines it was refreshing to receive adequate compensation as this has not always been offered in the past so it was very pleasing to see how well they dealt with the situation. All in all China Eastern offer good value for money and are worth trying out. The important thing is not to expect an Emirates or Singapore Airlines experience - you are paying about half the price so it won't be to that level. However what you get for the price is very good.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

The aircraft although old was clean - peanuts and soft drink served by young enthusiastic staff flight about 85% full. Information given out by very young looking English captain was good and informative no complaints whatsoever. The return on the 19th was just as good push back 17 minutes late it appears that one aircraft is used on this route only so may have knock on delays plane 100% full. I created a problem by being booked on a later flight that day but check in staff just amended and issued a boarding pass. CNX to BKK in 56 mins. I would recommend anyone to travel with them the price although a promotion was under half that of Thai/Bangkok Airways new routes open next year in Thailand.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,U Kelly,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,Ryanair is fine to fly most of the time to get from A to B and if you can go hand luggage only. But that isn't always possible and today at Alicante the Bag Drop was pretty shambolic and stressful having to queue for more than an hour to drop off a case with people getting more and more frantic as the clock ticked by. It might have been because they had about 6 full flights scheduled one after another in a 2 hour period and only 3 desks for bag drop off. Plus they were charging everyone who was even just slightly over the weight which led to queues being at a stand still as people tried to rearrange their luggage or go and sort out the extra payments. If this is a frequent occurrence (will be watching as am a frequent flier) I will definitely avoid Ryanair as much as possible in the future. I will and have paid the premium for the extra business fare but the huge omission is that there is no priority drop off. Unlike Easyjet who give priority at bag drop if you have speedy boarding/easyjet plus. Makes the business fare bundle all a bit pointless since you have allocated seats anyway. If Ryanair introduced a priority drop-off as an optional extra I would happily pay it rather than stand in a queue for an hour.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,0
porter-airlines,/airline-reviews/porter-airlines,Porter Airlines customer review,L Cross,Canada,2014-07-08,On June 12 2014 Porter delayed my return flight 269 from Toronto to Ottawa for 45 minutes. No explanation from Porter staff in the Billy Bishop Airport lounge. Finally once on board the captain said the delay was because of refuelling problems in Montreal. While I was waiting for my delayed Ottawa flight Porter announced the cancellation of their flight from Washington. No explanation for that either. On June 24 2014 Porter delayed my return flight 267 from Toronto to Ottawa for 45 minutes. No explanation. Porter also announced their Toronto-Windsor flight was delayed. No explanation. Porter delayed my flight again for 45 minutes. No explanation. Then the plane arrived late and sat on the tarmac waiting for thunderstorms to clear. Thunderstorms cleared. There were no weather issues. Plane was not boarded. Then an announcement that because of a crew medical emergency flight 267 was cancelled. Porter has no crew backup no employees on standby even though Toronto is their headquarters their hub. Nor does Porter have any backup aircraft. When one is delayed or grounded their whole system collapses. Porter has expanded too quickly and are overextended on their routes.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,Richard Moller,Canada,2014-09-24,Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked âPriorityâ were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,4,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

The supervisor I spoke with explained that our flight was not delayed but cancelled, due to unforeseen weather. I immediately jumped on DFW airport website to see if other flights were being delayed or cancelled as it was partly cloudy in DFW. The supervisor then tells me that the next available flight he can move us to is on Friday the 19th and all Spirit can do is offer us a refund or move our flight to Friday, with no solution for the condo's we have paid for starting the 16th.

On the Friday we found that Air Malawi had cancelled the flight (without thinking to tell us). When I contacted them they said there was a flight on the Monday but it was full so they rebooked her for the Wednesday flight.

Air Malawi have two scheduled flights a week from Nairobi to Lilongwe. Monday and Friday. But they book people for all seven days of the week. If enough people book they fly if they don't they cancel the flight. The thing that really annoyed me was that I chose to use Air Malawi because they told me they fly every day.

The second thing that annoyed me was that there was not even a hint of an apology from them for cancelling the flight. If you are trying to go to Malawi my advice is to use Kenya Airways.

On the route from Moscow to Palma-de-Mallorca via Barcelona: the planes were new the crew were great the seats comfortable and the timetable convenient. The problems began on my way back. The plane from Palma to Barcelona was delayed for an hour so at the time of landing in Barcelona my connecting flight to Moscow was supposed to depart. Instead of delaying the flight to Moscow for 30 min which would have been sufficient for us to board Vueling opted to send a plane to DME without us. What was even more infuriating is that Vueling representatives assured me that the flight was waiting for us at D10 gate. The transit desk managers could offer nothing better than the next flight at the same time tomorrow! Such situation was unacceptable for me so they gave me a boarding pass to Paris-Orly flight in the early morning. The flight to Orly was not good - the plane was extremely old and dirty. What I can say is that Vueling is not so cheap but has very convenient schedules from Moscow to Barcelona and back.

This used to be an enjoyable flight until it was converted to Rouge. When we booked we did not know that this would be a Rouge flight for which we were charged for seat selection even though we selected within the 24 hour window of the flight. I am 6 feet and the seating/leg room was really cramped and not pleasant. Thankfully the person in front of me did not recline their seat. One of the washrooms was out of order which created long lines and difficult passage through the aisle and no doubt inconvenience and annoyance for those seated in last several rows. The crew made only one pass with the beverage cart. While I bring my own iPad for entertainment others were left wondering where the inflight TVs went. The crew were very young-and likely inexperienced-their dress was unprofessional and I have doubts that they would have performed to the same level in an emergency as a more experienced crew. Good luck getting everyone out of the plane in an emergency especially through the over the wing exits with less space to manoeuvre in. While we arrived safely I am left wondering why Air Canada worked so hard to make air travel less enjoyable. I will not be flying Rouge again regardless of price.

The lounge was comfortable boarding straightforward and we found our seats.

The IFE was better than the listings for classical the music indicated but the audio books appeared to be very limited. dinner drink was offered to one of us but not the other.

This seemed a bit extreme as bottles of water given to us on the previous flight were taken away from us. This caused quite a bottleneck behind us as most passengers aboard were in transit.

We then spent 2 hours on hold to finally be told that there were no flights available until a minimum of 4 days later. When I asked why other passengers who had booked on later flights were taking priority over us the customer service rep just kept reading the script 'Sorry we are fully booked'. Even after I explained that we had to make a connecting flight or we would miss our non-refundable trip in India that we had been saving for 6 months for there was no attempt to help and a refusal to upgrade us even though there were seats available on business class.

JAX to DFW to connect with a BA flight back to LHR (comment later). Aircraft MD83. I took this flight with very low expectations following past experience and general comments. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. Check-in at JAX was swift friendly and cruised past security in no time; was offered Fast Track and then again JAX is not the busiest of airports in the US. Unfortunately there are no lounges for premium passengers unless you are flying DL or their Skyteam partners. Boarding was relatively ordered. Was greeted with a smile (first impression counts) and shown to my seat by the friendly stewardess. Unlike many European carriers on their shorthaul aircraft's the premium cabins in this case do have distinct seating in their different classes. For the type of aircraft and duration of flight I would say it was quite appropriate - no use expecting a flatbed or deluxe booth for a two hour + flight. Once boarding was complete announcements were made hot towels offered followed by a choice of bubbly juice or water. Lift off was on time and flight pretty smooth most of the time. A few bumps here and there but that's part of flying. Service was above my expectations the stewardess was extremely friendly helpful and fully justified the premium escence of the cabin. Main and only disappointment was the food. Not bad but certainly not a First Class offering. On shorter Asian and European journeys the offering is far superior in a comparable cabin. On the other hand being a nut-allergy sufferer the pre-lunch aperitif of warm nuts was a no-go for me however this charming lady went out of her way to get me an appropriate (and definitely yummier) substitute - corn chips with a houmous dip. Landing was a bit later than scheduled but beforehand I was explained the best way of getting to my connecting flight.

Excellent check-in experience in HKG. HKG has a well earned reputation as one of the best airports in the world. I love the fact that you can do web check-in with Cebu. It helps when you get to the airport and puts them above some other low cost airlines. Busy flight to MNL but flight on time and in-flight staff are excellent as I've experienced in the past with Cebu. Quick baggage delivery in MNL and terminal 3 is by far the best in MNL. Love the all over free wifi as in HKG. However the experience there during the return to HKG was not quite the same. Cebu staff managed to give us the wrong boarding card which we discovered after going through security (and the associated payment of airport fees). It got fixed but it was the first time I've ever experienced this sort of thing. Made for a stressful departure out of MNL. Better look closely at your boarding pass when flying Cebu. Inflight to HKG was exactly the same as before. Again a very busy flight but friendly in-flight staff and plenty of smiles.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Martina O'Shea,Ireland,2014-10-05,I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received on the evening of 26th Sep in Wroclaw airport related to a Ryanair flight. I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in. The door should be manned to ensure that priority passengers are treated fairly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,0

Flight attendants were courteous efficient and professional coming through the cabin frequently with hot towels as well as water/juices to keep passengers hydrated during the 10+ hour flights. They also knew when to leave passengers undisturbed something you don't really see with many carriers. The seating despite being economy class was pretty roomy both flights weren't entirely full so I got some room to stretch out and sleep for a few hours. The only real fly in the ointment was on SQ12 where the aft toilets weren't working. That wasn't too big an issue as the flight wasn't full but I can definitely see where it would be if the plane was chock-a-block packed. All things considered though I really enjoyed the experience on SQ which proves why international carriers especially Asian ones are miles ahead of any U.S. carriers (with the exception of VX and B6).

I forget exactly what the name is but I paid$ 31 for this in order to board the airplane 'early' but was told by the attendant that it didn't mean anything just go by the zone number. 2) The food ran out and I was told I could pre-order but when I tried to do this for my return flight I couldn't as the website only listed the food but there wasn't a way to actually order and pay for it. 3) This has already been said but the seats are extremely uncomfortable. I purchased seats by the window so I could lean against them to sleep as I had to travel from the UK to AZ. In total I paid an additional $267 for these seats but I shouldn't have bothered as the space between the seat and the window was so far that I couldn't lean against it at all. 4) The return plane 'broke down' and so we had to wait approximately 4 extra hours this was at night and the airline graciously gave us a $10 voucher for a meal while we waited but the voucher was only good for shops in the airport but it was so expensive all I was able to buy was a bottle of water and a bag of chips. 4) Because of the plane braking down I was going to miss the coach (bus) in London that would take me home and I had already paid for it.

Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely.

The aircraft that I fly on from London to Mexico city are 747-400 these aircraft have obviously travelled many hundreds of thousands of air miles the seats are mostly very worn and hard a 12 to 13 hour flight leaves one with a very numb part of the anatomy toilets seats are more often than not insecure or broken. Food offered is now without a menu you get what you are given or go without from two choices the famous BA breakfast is now no more just a sandwich or a frozen roll. The inflight entertainment is often non functional and regular resetting of the system is quite normal sound quality is always very bad. My comments are not directed at just one flight or one aircraft only I have seen this deterioration over quite a few years whilst I fully appreciate economy and money saving is today's norm major airlines to my mind should think customer satisfaction at all levels not just the First class and Business class customers. I have seen other airlines achieve and maintain very high standards in today's economic world of airline travel but sadly BA seem to be trailing to an embarrassing extent.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0
cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2010-06-17,BKK-MNL-BKK. Flights a little quieter in recent weeks due to the problems in Thailand. Quite large variations in price depending on precisely which days you travel. Cebu Pacific used to have very good last minute prices - not any more and the cost to change a travel date was about the same price as the original ticket. They're also cracking down hard on excess baggage - 15kg for checked in bags and 7kg hand carry. Don't expect to haggle an extra few kilos for free - and they're checking (weighing) bags again at the gate. I'll continue to use them in favour of PAL or Thai since their prices are still very competitive their reliability in my experience has been very good and NAIA-3 is by far the best MNL Terminal - just don't carry too much luggage.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

They were really friendly - not hurried in what they were doing and seemed genuine. The product on this older 747 wasn't great. It was nice having the extra room and smaller cabin in Premium Economy - but the TV screen was tiny and you could tell it was just an out of date aircraft and needed updating!

arkefly,/airline-reviews/arkefly,Arkefly customer review,S Rossi,Netherlands,2014-09-17,I flew from Schiphol to Jamaica with ArkeFly. The aircraft was old dirty and noisy. There was minimal legroom which can make a long haul flight very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the flight attendants never have I ever met so many rude flight attendants during one flight. As a passenger you are expected to feel very sorry that you came to disturb the flight attendants during their flight. If you ask for pillow or blanket all you get back is very rude words and eye-rolling you don't feel like a paying customer at all. Also the flight attendants didn't speak English even when I told them that I don't understand Dutch. Unfortunately I cannot recommend ArkeFly to anyone.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

As you can see I travel a lot on Saudia and know this airline well. The thing I really like about SV is that it's such a punctual airline. Flights are almost never late. Saudi domestic flights are not that expensive and are fully changeable fares with no penalties. If you are traveling domestic travel light and carry it all on. Security at domestic airports in the kingdom is not that strict so you can get a bottle of water and toothpaste through security. Does not charge extra for exit row seating. They also allow a free checked bag on domestic flights. Food service and inflight entertainment on international flights are pretty good actually. But 10 across on Saudi's 777's make it for a very tight flight. I certainly recommend taking SV to the USA during the low season! My flights to JFK were empty. We're talking 75 people on a 777. The amount of personal space on an empty widebody is amazing! I am very disappointed that Saudi has decided to cut costs and downgrade domestic food service. They used to offer hot chicken and rice the local dish on domestic flights. It was always delicious. Now they offer cold snacks only: a muffin cheese sandwich or a tuna or chicken sandwich. I used to get the sandwich but not any more. It is truly a mystery meat sandwich with very little taste. Flying during Ramadan is always a treat. They pass out the snack boxes and tell the passengers when they can begin to eat even if it's 10 minutes before landing they will land with the trays down with the catering items still on them! The cabin crews are friendly all the time. Saudia gets you from A to B without all the fuss of American carriers that's for sure. I recommend Saudi if the price is right you can't go wrong with them.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

In fact Speedy Boarding now seems pointless since you need to get to the gate amongst the earliest passengers or so they told me at the gate last night.

Furthermore the planes are smaller always packed. After flying 2.5 million miles with Delta it clearly has gone downhill. Loyalty means nothing. If you fly from Florida to California often and need to try and do some work on the trip avoid Delta. Their upgrade policy is a classic bait and switch.

I begin by comparing the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 to the Rouge Boeing 767. You will note from the seating chart that the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 has 39 rows with eight passengers per row. The Rouge aircraft has 49 rows. The additional ten rows undoubtedly speaks volumes to the uncomfortable seating mentioned by many. Like many of the previous commentators I have been a member of the Air Canada Altitude 50K group for years. In good faith I booked with Air Canada to discover my flight to be with Rouge. The Rouge seats are extremely uncomfortable and offer an average sized passenger little if any leg room. Your knees are crushed when the passenger in front moves their seat back. Comparatively the seats are similar to sitting on a wooden church pew for the duration of the flight. I will never again fly Rouge. From Edmonton there are a number of other options available.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Absolutely no Qantas desks open to talk to a human being. Ended in up the Qantas lounge with our disgruntled passengers. Flight finally took off 7 hours later at 1.30 in the morning (due to radar part being flown in for our plane) hence we missed our two international connections. They tried to correct but we had to drive to our final destination in the end as we had missed our last flight and Qantas say they probably won't pay for the car rental.

Flight operated by Air Nostrum in a small CRJ90 and was 1 hour late due to poor weather in Madrid. Cabin crew do not speak French and their English was very hard to understand but they were polite and friendly. I was the only passenger and two Iberia pilots in the cabin.

On the return from Barajas I tried to use their Auto check in but the boarding card was stuck in the machine and thus had to queue up for almost half an hour to get it done manually. There were plenty of passengers but Iberia kept only 2 counters open once it was my turn the agent at the check in desk was apologetic for their machines and the wait. She was very friendly and smiley.

Drinks offered and delivered promptly food order taken. Downhill from there.

Gave up when we realised staff had disappeared and cabin was asleep for the night. (Yes could have followed up but we were dead on our feet and preferred to sleep). The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes. No pillow only blow up neck rest in comfort packs. Entertainment system (screen in armrest) and headphones ok but choices limited compared to other airlines.

Most recently was kept waiting in terminal at Kabul for 9.5 hours to finally leave for Istanbul only to then make a stop in Tehran that was unexpected even for the Iranian officials that boarded the plane on the tarmac asking the flight crew why they had stopped there. The flight attendants give very little customer service particularly to those in business class (unless you are paying for just the extra space dont bother wasting the money) and usually spend most of their time applying makeup or talking to one another while they make each other drinks (but neglect their customers who are watching). Have had office staff give incorrect flight schedules to me resulting in extra days of layovers in various locations and when I complained about this to management we were openly laughed at by counter representative. It is this type of poor customer service that I had grown accustomed to from Ariana (and never cared for) but had hoped for much more from a non-government owned airline but I have been disappointed time and time again with Kam Air's lack of regard for its customers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

All have different rules. We have flown to Gdansk Warsaw Wroclaw and Poznan all without much fuss. N.B. the ground staff at Luton are not employed directly by Wizz so they are not bothered fail to make announcements at the gate so there is often a 'bun fight' to get in the right queue for speedy boarding etc. We have paid for the speedy boarding and large cabin bag as we fly often to Poland and this will last for up to 18 months so well worth it for us. We do find on Wizz that some people don't know how to behave on flights yanking on your seat back knees in back etc... so we always sit in the last row!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,1

The Lounge in MEL is one of the best lounges in Melbourne. The flight to Manila was excellent on all counts. No problem getting out of the airport. We found meter taxis are the best value and convenient. We stayed at the New World in Makati which we can recommend. The flight to England was the same experience and we were saying at that stage that PAL was really good value. Then it all went downhill on our return flights in September. PAL uses Malaysia Airlines Lounge in London and it was just okay. On the flight (late) my seat was broken and would not recline I was moved to another seat but the media unit didn't work so they gave me a Ipad. The seat headrest abutted the toilet and the constant flushing made sleep almost impossible. We were very glad to get to our hotel in Manila and get some sleep.

Food was the most terrible I ever had on a flight. The refreshment was tiny and extremely spicy and was served as good as cold. Breakfast even was worse with a few slices of tasteless unripe fruit smashed on a plate followed by a cold omelette and 2 hard cold greasy discs that were expected to be hash brown potatoes!

Online booking:âEasyjet have a very user friendly website and their email communication was superb. Baggage charge: I found the Â£18 charge for a small bag to be outrageous. Bag Drop: the bag drop was straightforward and the staff member efficient but unsmiling and not at all friendly. Boarding: orderly enough but the announcements were not very clear and I saw 2 elderly people struggle unaided. The cabin crew were not at all friendly and seemed disorganised too. One member of the cabin crew was particularly unfriendly and gruff in the way in which he interacted with a young mum and a baby. Later in the flight I bought a coffee and the same man who was rude to the lady with the baby handed me my change with a phoney smile and the money with a strange expression. I checked the change and saw that rather than a Â£2 coin he had handed me an Arabic coin. I immediately saw this and asked for the correct coinage. It took the efforts of two of his colleagues for me to receive the correct change and no apology. Announcements: there were very few announcements during this journey and no route map at all. The lady captain made one announcement at the end of the flight. Comfort: The seat was rather thin but comfortable enough for the distance flown. Value: the price I paid was quite reasonable.

We did not have the ability during our trip to remote Spain to pre-print the boarding passes thought this would not be a problem as we had flown with a world class budget airline Air Asia earlier in the year and they provide machines at the airports to check in or you could use you smart phone to display the barcode. Ryanair charged us 140 Euros for two boarding passes which took the girl at check-in 30 seconds to do. This was as much as the return fares from Stansted to Seville.

These areas of discomfort would have been on the verge of acceptable if the cost of our flights really were less expensive than the other air lines. In the end the cost of the bags (with a weight of 40 pounds max) the cost of a carry on and the fact that we had to pay to select our seat increased the cost of the flight to be equal of other carriers. The level of delays not just for our flight but for every flight that day (and not related to weather) was unbelievable. The saving quality of Spirit was the staff.

Service was much improved from a previous flight on Air France. Flew economy on the way home and actually found it more comfortable as we had a row of three seats to ourselves. Seat arms could be raised. That being said, the seats were narrow and very hard. Clearly an extra row as added to up the body count. Service was very good.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,A Kobayashi,Canada,2014-09-18,"We were excited to hear that Air Canada was adding routes to Europe way back when we started booking a big family vacation this allowed us to fly into Venice and out of Rome on AC flights both ways. At the time Rouge had just started its international service so we didn't know what to expect but it's Air Canada right? It has to be at least decent. I have to say at this point thank goodness we changed our return flight date which meant we went from a Rouge flight to a regular AC flight. Travelling over 8 hours to Italy in those cramped circa 1970s metal framed seats was not fun and I had the luxury of a 4 year old next to me so I could use some of her space. I am not a tall person and I felt like my knees were in my armpits the entire time because of the ridiculously small seat pitch you can't actually recline your seat more than an inch maybe two inches. Fantastic for an overnight flight. At least they gave us pillows and blankets. Hardly any of us slept and it was a long boring flight since we don't all have ipads and theirs were booked. I'm curious to know how there is still no Android app for their stupid in-flight entertainment system but I digress. People also need to know that the reviews here are accurate regarding the overhead bins they are not regular carry-on size each bin could fit maybe 1 item - for 4 seats! I would also like to point out that flying Rouge is definitely a buyer beware activity. I'm not sure if there are any cases of the prices reflecting the ""bargain airline"" thing they are trying to be but I think it is all kinds of insanity to charge the same for this service as for regular Air Canada flights. I know this is true because AC had a schedule change that meant we went from a regular flight to a Rouge flight and the gentleman at the call centre warned me that we would be getting less service for the same money. In fact he was required to explain that to me and I had to agree and it was made clear that this would be recorded so that there would be no ""misunderstandings."" As a result I got so nervous I changed that flight to a different day to avoid having to fly Rouge home and thank goodness for that. Two of our party were in business class on Rouge that meant Premium Rouge or some such silliness and they had slightly bigger seat space and a curtain to divide them from the steerage behind on Air Canada they had pods with lie flat beds for the same price. I'm sad to say that this is no exaggeration. Now if I pay a little bit of money for a discount flight on a bargain airline okay I expect to get what I paid for - not much. But when you are paying full Air Canada fare and get bargain airline seats and service I'm not okay with it.

I am not too heavy the stewardess had called the incorrect name. The other person in the exit row was not much heavier than myself though. The stewardess was followed by the co- pilot who said that we all had to be very quick because KLM was loosing a lot of money waiting. They should not have asked us to leave our seats and they also should not have waited for just before takeoff to do so. I am 6 ft 190lbs. I do not like their seats on their long haul planes.

Two hours into the flight we're hoping to eat but by row 15 they ran out of meals.

Excellent unobtrusive service from cabin crew. The best thing about Monarch now is the new slimline seating. They are comfortable enough for a 4 hour flight and would be OK for longer flights. The fixed angle of seat back is good (a compromise between fully upright and reclined) so there are no hassles with the passenger in front depriving you of your legroom. I am 6ft 3ins and there were a full 2 inches spare in front of my knees so I could sit comfortably and there is space for your tablet in the seat back in front.

No wonder the bags fly free Southwest has no intention of taking reasonable care with them. Now we have discovered that they make you sign a waiver saying that they aren't responsible if your golf clubs don't arrive at your destination or if they are damaged in transit. Also on our last two flights the attendants made the safety briefing into a real joke and didn't even complete it properly. It is nice to try to make flying fun but I think that they are crossing the line. Not all customers are frequent flyers who are familiar with the safety aspects of a plane.

thomas-cook-airlines,/airline-reviews/thomas-cook-airlines,Thomas Cook Airlines customer review,Chris Johnson,United Kingdom,2014-10-05,We booked a two week package in Turkey through an agent with Thomas Cook (TC). Although the flights were managed by TC they contracted them out to Pegasus Airlines a Turkish low cost airline. Having read a variety of reviews about Pegasus we didn't know what to expect. You don't get the same pre-flight facilities as with TC such as online check-in extra payment for extra legroom seats or an early bag drop the evening before. These facilities are available with direct bookings with Pegasus. Some reviewers have commented on the poor condition of aircraft but we flew B737-800 in good condition each way. We found the staff to be friendly and courteous but we had few dealings with them as everything onboard even water has to be paid for. There is no entertainment only drop down screens showing flight progress and data. The outbound flight was OK but the return form Bodrum was a nightmare. Having been collected from our hotel at 0145 the first of five stops we went to check in. Only one desk was open then more staff arrived at 0400. At the scheduled departure time of 0600 we were told of a 30m delay due to a technical fault on the aircraft then 1h 30m at 0630. At 0730 the delay became 6h later extended to 10h. The situation then descended into chaos. Our only source of information was the airport departures board until a TC airport rep. appeared. He announced (to those that could hear him) that we would go through immigration to have our passport exit stamps cancelled collect our luggage then be coached to a local hotel. More queuing and waiting and we eventually got to the hotel. Before we had time to eat an update said that we would return to the airport at 1230 for a 1500 departure. That was changed to a 1200 collection for a 1530 flight. Back at the airport we had more queues for the first security check before check in then passports and another security check. We finally left ten hours late on a replacement aircraft. That was better than what we were told at one time that we might not leave until the next day. Whilst the TC airport rep. tried his best the situation was chaotic. A Turkish TC guide helped to translate and transmit messages but not everyone could hear what was being said so they had to ask others what was happening. There was no offer of refreshments at the airport and most people had already spent their Euros or Turkish Lire. Once airborne the flight was a copy of the outbound. A free meal or snack onboard would haven an appropriate gesture but was not provided. We had not eaten a meal since dinner the evening before. We will never book a TC package again that uses Pegasus and will certainly think carefully before booking a TC package at all. They don't deserve repeat custom.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,2,0,1,NA,NA,1,0

Beijing (PEK) to Ashgabat (ASB) and back a one-way flight from Mary (MYP) to Ashgabat and a round-trip between Ashgabat and the northern town of Dashoguz (TAZ). All flights were on Boeings with 757s on the international legs and 717s domestically. The pilots were allegedly Western-trained and looked Russian but none said a word during my five flights. The planes weren't bad. The seats were maintained and the cabins were clean. There were other signs that this wasn't the Delta Shuttle. The bulkhead wall at the front of each cabin bore a framed photograph of the President For Life. Many passengers paid no heed to any rules about seatbelts or cabin movement. Boarding the plane was all pushing and shoving and the old ladies had the best moves. Aside from a flight map on the 757s there was no in-flight entertainment. The food was standard airline grub and flight attendants were reasonably diligent if unenthusiastic about serving drinks and responding to the call button which the passengers pushed without hesitation. There was no in-flight magazine. Luggage limits were nonexistent but in a country where almost everything has to be imported I was sympathetic. The space on my flight was so oversubscribed that three trucks of baggage were left behind. The stranded bags were to arrive on the next flight with room. Turkmenistan Airlines has no web site. It has no frequent flyer program that I could discern and is not part of any alliance. It serves the major cities in Turkmenistan in the sense that it connects them to Ashgabat.

You pay for your ticket your seats (yes even seats) your drinks and your baggage and yet the whole experience turned out to be better than many other airlines. For one this airline made it possible for me to take my whole family along because of the low rates. Secondly the staff was super nice. There is only one class in their aircraft's and everyone gets the same service. Bucket leather seats are pretty comfortable even though they don't recline. There is no inflight entertainment but then again with all the carry-on gadgets today who needs another console in your face?

csa-czech-airlines,/airline-reviews/csa-czech-airlines,CSA Czech Airlines customer review,Graham Fairclough,Netherlands,2009-12-19,Bucharest to Amsterdam via Prague. Booked in economy; frequent flyer upgrade to business class on PRG - AMS leg. Czech Airlines are OK though not as good as they were a few years ago. Their model is a hybrid of full service airline and low cost. The pressure on their prices if obvious with only charter airline quality food and drinks available free in economy class. The main problem I encountered was changing planes in Prague. Prague airport has simply not worked out how to be an efficient hub. Connections between Schengen and non-Schengen zones in particular are a pain as the airport is rather sprawling. As there was a 50 minute delay to the OTP-PRG leg I had 15 minutes connection which I only made by a lot of running and some fairly shameless pushing in front of queues. Only 2 passport booths were open and these were monopolised by a group of Russian school children. CSA are fine but beware tight connections in Prague. If your incoming flight is late neither CSA nor Prague airport will help you expedite the process; you're on your own and don't get priority in any queues. The result is extremely stressful. CSA are as good as any other airline for point-to-point travel at reasonable costs and onboard service can be very good but beware connections.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
germanwings,/airline-reviews/germanwings,Germanwings customer review,Johannes Meunier,Germany,2014-11-06,Flight Stuttgart-Hamburg. Was regular user of LH flights since they put GW in place I do everything I can to avoid this airline. No value for money and cost are usually higher than alternative carriers. Other carriers offer way better service and value for money. I specifically dislike the fact that on the majority of the flights I have been using seats were broken (once you lean back they recline) and airplane interior was poor condition / not cleaned. On my last trip I advised the steward on board on a chewing gum sticking to the emergency exit seat and asked him to ensure it is being removed on the next cleaning cycle. The answer was that he was not cleaning the airplane. Think that shows the service mindset. Not up to what I was used to from LH I also experienced a large share of delayed flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,2,2,0,NA,NA,1,0

A big plus was noise canceling headsets on the TPE-LAX segment.

When I asked if I could use the toilet in the Premium section I was told I had to wait until the beverage service was complete in my section. When the attendant was not looking I used the Premium toilets. The fact that you must use your own devices to watch movies is the biggest money extraction ploy.

The food was plentiful and very nice quality: a salad starter with fresh bread and NZ olive oil a warm meal; dessert cheese and biscuits and good NZ wines. Breakfast and afternoon tea were also excellent with e.g. warm scones clotted cream and jam. The food was better than BA's Club World. The seat provides lots of space and the entertainment system is stocked with films I missed at the cinema so enjoyed catching up with on the plane. The seat doesn't recline that much but there's a bean bag a big pillow and a nice thoughtful amenity kit. There were other fun touches too like a photo of shelves of books with jokey titles on the walls in the toilet. On the way out the luggage belts at Heathrow were broken so most bags did not make it to the plane.

Crew walked through quickly without paying attention to passengers as they did the service had to stop them to get coffee as they just chatted away in their own world while supposedly doing a coffee/tea service. Crew generally okay some better friendlier but there was a senior attendant who seemed unhappy to be on the flight - showing her displeasure with attitude like throwing things around on the trolley and not looking at passengers when serving.

But you must check in at least 1/2 hr before - no exceptions - or then you lose your ticket. This means check-in counter staff are idle until each flight opens - then bombarded - by the people who are all waiting just outside the check in queue anyway. They usually don't use air- bridges so you have to walk in the weather across the tarmac. You kind of expect that on a little Dash-8 at a regional airport - but not on a big jet in a capital city. As per Jetstar website seat pitch on the A320 is 28"" - not 30"". All other Aussie airlines have 30-33"". That makes a big difference on a 5.2hr flight BNE-PER. Seats only recline about 4 degrees back as a result. You can't even get a drink of water for less than $3.50. No room in overhead lockers because they're full of carry-on luggage from those who won't pay $18 for checked luggage - but will happily pay for numerous $7 bourbons en-route. You can't move to spare seats because they are sold to someone. The worst aspect: You can't check your bags through on multiple domestic flights (only on some international). You have to get your bags after each flight and then re-check for the next flight and re-clear security. A pain when there's 5 hrs between flights (remember - can't check in until 2hrs before) but worse if your flights are close & first flight is late.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,D Cook,United Kingdom,2014-12-01,"Flew LHR-KUL-PER on MH3 and MH125 with my wife and 2 year old son. Contrary to what I read about MAS' policy on seating children on top deck in economy I was happy that we had been seated there in the middle row of 4 seats. I was even happier when before take off the stewardess moved the gentleman sat next to us to an exit seat so that we all had more room he was also very pleased. The cabin decor I must say is fantastic compared to the SQ route we took last year it is far ahead. Both planes were also in very good condition compared to other airlines on similar routes e.g. EK and SQ. The seats were well designed but as Mr Walsh has pointed out previously they are not as good as the old 747 seats on older MAS flights. I am also 6""3' and we are talking about economy after all so it can only be bearable. The food on the flight was pretty good for economy there were plenty of beverages served throughout the flight and my wife's veg and sons child's meal were always served first and his tray was always cleared before the remainder of the cabin. The only thing that's worth pointing out is that on EK and SQ for such a long flight there is usually a selection of sandwiches to snack on however we were only given chocolate bars and crips which I thought was a bit cheap. Appreciate the airline is struggling financially but I fail to see how depriving passengers on which is already a long and tiring flight a decent snack. The cabin crew were polite but lacked the Malaysian hospitality that I have come to expect from MAS. Having flown with them regularly since 2004 they were not quite up to the previous standard. They were not rude or anything like that just that they were going through their motions as quickly as possible. Considering the cost of the tickets were several hundred pounds less than SQ or EK I would definitely recommend MH.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

monarch-airlines,/airline-reviews/monarch-airlines,Monarch Airlines customer review,Beryl Hatton,United Kingdom,2013-12-29,I flew on a Monarch plane chartered by Saga in January from Los Angeles to London Gatwick and endured a long delay at LA with no help from anyone regarding food or reasons for delay. Eventually sweltering customers were boarded on just one set of steps for the whole jumbo planeload. The seats were very cramped and the aisles very narrow. I am 5ft 2ins and very slim but had to walk sideways breathing in to pass down the aisles towards the rear of the plane. I could see well built passengers overflowing into the aisles from their seats and also on to the unfortunate person sitting next to them. This is not the service or comfort that Monarch offered a few years ago. The food was sparse and awful but the crew blamed it on Saga. Worse still we had to make an emergency landing at Santiago due to a sick passenger and when airborne again an announcement was made that there would be no hot drinks served as they had run out of hot water. Never heard such an excuse and all we could have were cold drinks. Completely unacceptable and never explained to us. Now worried that Fred Olsen are using Monarch to connect us to a cruise starting from Tenerife on 17th January 2014.

Decent meals (with freshly warmed bread rolls served from a separate basket - a nice touch) and plenty of drinks available throughout the flight.

The first two legs leg ADL-KUL was somewhat OK mainly because of the facilities as the ADL airport. The return trip was very unpleasant. All around the cabin crew were friendly and helpful but did not serve enough drinks even when the flight was delayed. We were deprived of basic needs-water while in transit in Male (before boarding). KUL AirAsia terminal is worst than a bus terminal. Filthy hot dirty cafes generally not suitable for any type of modern day air travel especially when passengers have to take long haul flights. Narrow seating and lack of leg space made it one of my worst air travel. Gone too far to reduce the cost by maximizing seat capacity which make long haul flights (ADL/CMB vv -7 hrs) very uncomfortable.

Flight left about 30 mins late don't think that was Norwegians fault. The Dreamliner was clean and comfortable. Flight attendants a bit moody looked like they didn't want to be there. Got water and pre paid meal choice of chicken or beef with a choice of tea or coffee and a small dessert. Inflight entertainment was good with new movies and good selection of tv shows. Liked the touch screen controls and 3D flight tracker. Windows larger and control dimmer was great also liked the changing mood lighting in the cabin. Didn't sleep will be attempting that on my journey home. Later had a small food box which contained cheese sandwich small chocolate muffin and a carton of apple juice (included for pre-paid price). I recommend you buy your own blanket and pillow pre flight (fleece with blow up pillow in a zip up travel bag) as I did as the plane is kept at a cold temperature. Fort Lauderdale airport is the worst I've ever been to. Had to wait 20 mins for the bus then kept on the bus for 30 mins before being allowed inside the terminal building. We then queued in one line for I don't know how long only for the badly organised staff started bringing people from the back of the line to the front for no apparent reason shifting barriers from side to side - many people not liking this getting irate and could have caused a riot. Getting past this hall only to wait in line in another hall luggage was waiting (had been taken off carousel). Then to wait in line again for customs. 4hrs after landing I left the airport from hell!

All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the A330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the A380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. MAS now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their A330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for MAS would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money.

eva-air,/airline-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,Michael Carter,Canada,2014-02-20,"NRT-TPE-HKG in Business class. Both these flight were ""Hello Kitty"" flights. The flight from NRT to TPE had a last minute substitution to a 777 instead of A330 which meant business class was now Royal Laurel as opposed to the standard Premium Laurel. As a result I got to try out the herringbone life flat pods which are an excellent product. TPE-HKG (which is the shorter of the 2 flights) was the regular Premium Laurel. For Business class you can pre-order your meals in advance on the EVA website and both meals were of a high standard. Cabin service also was professional polite as is typical on most Asian airlines in a premium cabin. The Hello Kitty service (and on the 2nd flight the dedicated Hello Kitty plane) is a great marketing idea and makes the flight a little different and more fun.

Staff nicely dressed in fresh youth style with black T-shirts (with discrete logo) and trousers. They were fast alert smiling and very friendly despite the flight was full to the very last seat. This is a LCC without free onboard service - but prices are low e.g. a hot meal (4 options) is 3 dollars inc. soft drink.

We found the website excellent to use (although had problems with payment) and it was great to be able to reserve seats at the time of booking. Check-in was perfectly adequate too. Sadly Cathay's planes are looking a bit ropey: the ones we had must have had an average age of about 17 years so the in-flight entertainment was poor (about six looping channels) and the whole cabin seemed tired. The cabin crew were very professional but some of the food was iffy. We found it poor that Cathay did not use a jetway to board passengers on the HKG - PVG flight. 300 people on shuttle buses is ridiculous.

The seats are comfortable enough but leg- room is still somewhat restricted. The cabin crew were attentive there were drinks brought around every hour during the flight. The food was standard airline fare but coming out of KL there was little choice it was 'spicy' or nothing - so I had nothing. Having said that most other passengers seemed to find something to eat. The upper deck is a pleasant experience it feels more spacious in economy because of the fewer number of seats.

spicejet,/airline-reviews/spicejet,SpiceJet customer review,Arti Gupta,United Arab Emirates,2015-07-02,"My experience on SpiceJet was the worst I have ever had. It started off right from Dubai airport at check-in. My flight was meant to depart at 23:10hrs. The display said 23:10 when we entered the queue and within minutes the display for Delhi departure turned to 02:20hrs. A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given. So my son and I left the queue and sat down in the waiting area. After about 45 minutes we asked another member of staff and we were told the check-in had re-opened - no announcement had been made though. After check-in I contemplated returning home and coming back 2.5 hours later - when I asked how I can get accurate flight status I was told it is best to hang around at the airport. Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said ""sorry madam, it is finished. This flight was diverted to Mumbai and the aircraft was not serviced in Dubai so we have run out of supplies"". I returned to my seat and tried to get some sleep. The rest of the flight was uneventful but devoid of service of any kind. There was no drinks and snacks, even though it is meant to be a paid service. Not even water was offered to the passengers - only those who asked got it. At one point I woke up and went to the galley to ask for water and the air hostesses were asleep! Unacceptable standards of service. Agreed SpiceJet is a budget airline but even so there is something called professionalism which was totally lacking here.

Had a close call during the stopover in Brunei but we made it in scheduled time to our destination LHR. The planes are old. My estimation around 15 year old planes. Entertainment unit was a gamble. The row I was on did not have a working entertainment unit from Brunei to Dubai. Several restarts did not help which to me was just a delay tactic by the cabin crew. As we boarded the plane in Dubai the new cabin crew was informed and we were moved to different seats with working units. Cabin crew overall was average as we weren't attended to a couple of times probably due to the small indicator LEDs. Food was good on the 1st flight from MEL-BRU but went downhill after that. Brunei airport is depressing. No delays on the return flight. Will I fly with them again? Only if the price difference with other airlines are considerable.

Does the company not realise that not allocating seats will cause this? It flares up tempers and causes the whole plane load of passengers to be angry from the start. I stored my hand luggage in the overhead compartment and when I eventually got (semi) comfortable in my tiny seat I was asked by the cabin crew to move my bag from the overhead compartment to under my seat. I am 6.5ft tall and I explained this to the cabin crew that I would not have any room for my legs if I did this. Both the outgoing and return journeys were the same with absolutely no comfort whatsoever and incessant adverts being played to us offering to sell e-cigs or take part in exciting competitions. Any food on offer was overpriced. The return flight from Venice (the out of town airport) was akin to my Army days in Northern Ireland. Normally reasonable people cooped up like battery hens in a hot and stuffy room forced to stand for 2 hours waiting for Ryanair to sort their act out. After 2 hours the queue system we have ourselves put in place started to crumble and people began to flare up. Once the doors opened it was literally a stampede.

I wasn't really prepared for the lack of food and drink and on board entertainment as had assumed wrongly a near 6hr flight would warrant at least some entertainment and some water. Seats were very cramped and the cabin crew did their best with what they had. On the way back seats were slightly better as they'd moved the seat back pockets to the headrest which was a way to create an inch extra leg room. However the flight left Egypt 20mins late at nearly 10pm and the cabin crew decided to try and sell us duty free at 1am in the morning loudly proclaiming we should all purchase stuff. They didn't turn the lights off until after 2am. On arrival back to Glasgow at 2.30am GMT we then proceeded to stand around for 75 mins until our bags came out 1 by 1. I guess having one or two baggage handlers seemed fine on paper. I have also since found out that I could have flown Egypt Air from London to Cairo and got an internal flight to Sharm for at least Â£100 less than this flight and would have got entertainment and food/drink.

We waited at the airport all day and then decided to go check to see if there were any new changes with the plane around 3.30 pm.

Took every precaution and planned ahead (pre-paid carry on printed tickets at home brought my own snacks etc). Didn't pay extra for assigned seating and still ended up sitting next to my travel partner. Had 2 layovers - one in Dallas and one in Ft. Lauderdale neither one was delayed nor got cancelled. Maybe I just got beginner's luck and had no issues with my flights and didn't have to deal with their customer service? Seat comfort (or lack of) will be my biggest complaint - domestic flights are extra firm and do not recline but the international flight to Peru and back was like any other economy seating you'd find on regular planes that have more cushion and do recline. After my flight experience to Peru I opted to pay for a window seat on the return flight so I can be slightly more ""comfy"". I do recommend this airline for short trips - I probably won't make another 10+ hour trip because seats are just too uncomfortable. Do your research and read the small print on the Spirit website. The website clearly states exactly what you will need to purchase ahead of time and what you will get charged if you don't.

Have used British Airways in the past but because Icelandair's price came in at less than half what BA want for Business Class I chose to go with Icelandair. It must be said it is not as comfortable as BA's Club World not by a longshot. But for the price it's not too bad either. Positives include: smaller plane smaller airport (KEF) making it easier to get around; Friendly efficient cabin crew. Really tasty food. Saga Class bulkhead seat has a cutout so you can put a bag at your feet rather than in overhead locker which is convenient. Negatives (or at least not as positive) are: seat isn't as comfortable and doesn't fully recline. And when the person in front of you reclines you get a little locked in (which one hopes to avoid in business class usually) Overall though I'd say it's good value for the money and connecting through KEF is much more convenient than most of Europe's other larger airports.

Flight up was delayed however made up time in the air. Food service and beverage service was up to par. Flew older 737 800. Outbound crew couldn't do enough. On the return - access to Premier Lounge this is barely adequate with minimal food and beverages very basic and shared by a combination of carriers. I also believe that the outside world can pay for access. To top it off they call us out of the lounge and to the holding area 1 hour before the plane had even arrived at DPS. So we sat in the holding area for nearly 2 hours before boarding. They knew where we were why make us leave the lounge and sit for 2 hours in a holding area. Business Class should be the last to be sent to the gate for immediate boarding first not really up to Business Class standards. The meal and beverage service on the return was adequate but sparse. There were only 8 people in business class on a 737 so if someone wants the cheese plate its not a good look to forget to bring it out. Disappointing compared to the outbound and against recent trips with Garuda Business Class on the same route. Upgrade the plane with a better IFE system  the Ipads are inadequate and the selection is very limited. When there are only 8 people to look after don't forget the cheese plate.

Flight eventually left Tenerife at 11pm - 7.5 hours late. Fortunately for us we were home in bed by then as on learning of the delay we immediately rebooked 2 standby seats on a Thomas cook flight to Stansted.

You would think that they might offer us a complimentary glass of water for that hassle but they did not. Nothing at all! I was lucky but some other passengers had no rental car when we got to the airport because of our late arrival! The saga continues for my return flight. We were sitting on the plane for a half hour before we took off due to ""high traffic"" in LaGuardia airport. What is that about? Then we arrive in NY and the pilot tells us ""when it rains it pours"" and informs us that there is a gate door malfunction and we must wait for a power source.

The loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks.

The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight.

The only problem was that the headphones they supplied wouldn't go into the plugs in the armrest but I used my own with no problems. The flight was great one of the best I have been on. Entertainment is a little limited if you compare it to someone like Emirates but it is a cheaper airline. Provided good movie choices some TV and music and some games.

Blankets weren't provided but handed out when people asked. They were also around quite frequently with drinks and I had no complaints on the food either. I am vegetarian and am a little hard to please but I was quite pleased. No problems with the toilets on board. Clean whenever I went and I couldn't smell them at any time.

After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either.

The flight crews were good my main complaint is with the airline flight operations and reservations. We were told after we had booked our flight down to Cuba (Nov 22 from YOW) that it will be a would be a combined flight (MBJ and VRA) and that on the return trip to Canada the plane would be stopping in MBJ before picking us up at VRA. A couple of days before the flight the return leg was changed and that it would be VRA THEN MBJ giving us 2 seven hour flights. When the flights were combined we called the airline and got nothing but the usual run around and hiding behind their rules even when it was supposedly escalated 4 levels. But the topper was that on the return flight the MBJ passengers had to deplane and become transit passengers and VRA doesn't have a transit lounge. The MBJ were left to their own devices in the terminal causing the MBJ leg of the trip to be delayed by 30 minutes. On the flight down to MBJ from YOW we were delayed at the gate for paperwork which seemed to be a running thing with this particular captain. At MBJ they had to off load some of the VRA luggage to move it to another cargo hold. The captain said it was for weight and balance but a B737 isn't a Cessna 174. Lastly this is one of the TUI Travel PLC's Euro fleet and the in flight entertainment system didn't work properly. ON the YOW to MBJ portion a large number of the screens didn't drop down until the flight attendant crew trainer from the Euro division rebooted the entire system but then we were on the MBJ to VRA leg.

This should have been closed for health & safety reasons. I mentioned it to the Spanish steward but he didn't think too much about it.

icelandair,/airline-reviews/icelandair,Icelandair customer review,I Gankin-Segal,United States,2013-08-06,I fly internationally about 4-6 times a year on various airlines and my recent Icelandair flights from Boston to Saint Petersburg was one of the best. The plane was new comfortable and very clean. The blankets they offered were plush and cozy. The airline doesn't offered free meals for economy class but the options offered for purchase are restaurant grade at a negligible cost (the most expensive dish was about 10 euros). I tried oatmeal salad and mini hamburgers all of which were delicious. All of these made the flight experience more pleasant than having free airline food like other airlines. I also appreciated the on time departures which insured that I did not worry about missing my tight connections. The staff was extremely friendly and gracious and even covered me with a blanket when I fell asleep on a flight from Saint Petersburg to Keflavik. I highly recommend using this wonderful airline where small details make a big difference.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,0,NA,NA,4,1
asiana-airlines,/airline-reviews/asiana-airlines,Asiana Airlines customer review,M Base,United Kingdom,2012-11-15,ICN-LHR. Good flight excellent legroom charming and attentive if slightly robotic cabin-crew. IFE system between Seoul and London so outdated as to be non-functional (bring an iPad) and lacks 'western' content. The demanding of blinds-down during day-flights is becoming a big issue in these reviews and one that should really be addressed. No-one on the flight wanted to sleep following an early afternoon take-off. Many wanted to see the Mongolian landscape which is why they had asked for a window seat in the first place. This is especially true as one lands at LHR 6pm and therefore will go home or to a hotel have dinner and then try to 'sleep' again. Communication from the flight deck could also be better as the aeroplane just starts moving (on time) and the captain will say thank-you at the end of the flight. 50/50 then although in economy that seat-pitch is worth a lot.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,5,3,5,1,NA,NA,4,1

Usual chronic Heathrow delays meant serious chance of missing connection but OS pulled stops out met us and guided us to the gate - shortest transfer I've ever done on the ground for just 15 minutes.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Nigel Reid,Singapore,2013-01-02,We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,3,2,1,NA,NA,1,0

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,K Cornelius,Netherlands,2014-11-06,Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late. In similar situations at Changi/Singapore SQ staff is there to either get you to your plane in time or if it too late altogether make immediate arrangements to get you to your destination as soon as possible.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

We took this flight as it was supposed to arrive at 19h25 on the Monday. We both had work 05h30 the next day and we also wanted to arrive early enough to catch a train home rather than pay for a taxi.

Brussels flight late connecting time tight for LHR (scheduled for 70 minutes more like 25 with the late flight and you have to go through security to get to US). Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service). As usual the flight attendants on UA were generally friendly and polite but are not formal like the European or Asian airlines which is fine with me.

On the first flight by the time the food cart reached Aisle 40 there was little left and on the second there was no food cart period. People boarded with more than one carry on bag limiting the overhead space available for everyone - the crew worked very hard to find space for everyone anywhere onboard and should be commended for their hard work and cheerfulness - and the in-flight entertainment selection was dismal.

Onboard: The crew served snacks and water but I needed more water I was searching for crew but couldn't find them. The crew returned after some time and served more food and drinks. On a 14 hours non-stop flight this should be their practice. Food was good - in taste and quantity. Entertainment was okay. Seat was comfortable with enough legroom a very important thing for 14hr non stop flight. What didn't work: 1 or 2 restrooms ran out of tissues towards the end of the journey.

qantaslink,/airline-reviews/qantaslink,QantasLink customer review,T Maddern,Australia,2014-05-13,Yesterday I flew Qantaslink from Sydney to Dubbo. I was impressed with a staff member taking me aside as I immediately entered the check in area and checking me in putting in my frequent flyer number and arranging me to have the seat I requested. Check in was completed within 2 minutes as I was not checking luggage. The lounge / waiting area where gates 18 / 19 was not in the best condition many seats threadbare and torn but that area offered a great viewing area to watch aircraft taking off better than the Virgin lounge. The aircraft was a Bombardier Q400 beautiful looking aircraft clean and tidy inside seats were very small however but this was to be expected with a turbo prop aircraft and I was comfortable enough. Crew were friendly and professional the flight was only 50 minutes and it was great to be in the taxi within 5 minutes of the aircraft arriving at Dubbo.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,4,2,1,NA,NA,5,1
spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,R Whitney,United States,2014-07-20,In my opinion it is better to fly with an airline that charges you more upfront. At least you know what you are getting up front. The flight was ok but by after paying for luggage I could have flown with another airline. I've never flown with an airline that nickle and dimes you at every turn charging for non-alcoholic beverages really? They do not offer any conveniences that one is accustomed to with other airlines. To add insult to injury when my bags that I paid $40.00/bag to check got relocated the agents in the Ft. Lauderdale baggage claim airport office offered little to no help.

We could already see the problem the company had with delays. I have nothing to say about the service onboard the food or the entertainment. Everything was nice. The problem is the administration and the schedules they have. On our way back from Rio we got the bad news that our flight to Portugal was delayed 8 hrs. Instead of flying that night at 22.30 we were supposed to fly the day after at 6.30 am. We got just vouchers for dinner. No hotel so we spent the night at the airport. No explanation about the delay.

The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,W Blades,Australia,2015-07-10,"This was without question the worst Business Class flight I've ever undertaken in my life. Flight was QF8765 a code-shared flight operated by Emirates on 28 June 2015. Flying with Emirates can be a hit or miss affair based on our experiences, with the inflight service either being excellent or completely sub-standard. In this case it was the worst flight ever in terms of customer service, meals availability, and in-flight entertainment not functioning. Our flight attendant was just outrightly rude and lazy, with almost every request being met with an exasperated expression and blunt responses. It honestly felt like we were an inconvenience just being on her plane. This terrible service being followed by incomplete catering. We were offered only one meal from the menu, and there was no desserts, coffee or chocolates. The catering was terrible on this flight, however no apologies from our awful flight attendant. I had to argue with the flight attendant when she attempted to serve my teenage son with a children's meal (despite him being adult sized and holding a full adult Business class ticket). Inflight entertainment was not functioning correctly with mine and several other screens not working. We reported it to our disinterested flight attendant who said they would reset the system, however this never occurred. Upon leaving the aircraft at Sydney I reported the incidents to an Emirates ground staff CSO who was on the aero bridge. We never heard from him or had any follow-up from Emirates at Sydney.

My entertainment system froze halfway through the film I was watching so I ended up watching the screen on the next (empty) seat. Shiny screens so your reflection dominates a lot of what you watch. Food reasonable service seemed a little slow but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER almost full seats nowhere near as comfortable far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus matt screen so no reflection problems. Food probably slightly better but again seems to be a slow process. Overall however I arrived in Melbourne feeling fit and refreshed and would definitely take the same route again.

I've have been traveling VA when I go to PNG because I have no other choice. My experiences with them say they are always looking for ways to improve. The food choice is not as good bland sandwiches however the pies are only served on certain flights. AUD and NZD currency are both used and credit/visa card facilities are available. Beverages such as tea coffee and water are free. I'd recommend paying for food in advance as they have choices for you and they would serve you first before others who would purchase their food onboard. I don't find the food expensive but that's my opinion others opinions may differ. Entertainment is always good during my flights. Their movies and shows etc are always updated however no entertainment between BNE-POM. I find boarding flights in NZ takes so long however boarding flights from BNE-POM are always quicker and vice versa. I once cause the flight from POM-BNE to delay 20mins and as a result my connecting flight was delayed as well. I was then escorted to my next gate by ground staff. VA has lovely friendly and attentive staff. I find the planes between NZ- AUST are older and planes between AUST-PNG are nicer and newer. You can pretty much change seats during flights if you want to. The airline is very informative and take-off and landing have always been excellent!

Although flight experience was OK from JFK to AUH but upon arrival at AUH they informed that flight from AUH to LHE is at least 12 hours delayed because of heavy fog at destination. It was quite surprising when they refused to provide any hotel room and asked us to spend the whole night in the airport.

tigerair,/airline-reviews/tigerair,Tigerair customer review,K Wadling,Australia,2012-09-17,This airline is only for if you are determined to put up with delays virtually no leg room counter and gate staff that do nothing at all to assist with any problem but just stick to company policy excuses and you have a short flight to put up with it all. Its a cheap recreational airline and that's it. Look out if you are on holidays on the Gold Coast and do a bit of shopping. I didn't realise I had to buy extra baggage 4 hours beforehand online like any other airline thought I could fix this up at the counter. If I had realised you had to buy it online it would have cost me $17.95 for up to 20 kilos. Since I didn't realise that and wanted to pay at the airport the counter staff charged me $90 (more than the cost of my ticket for the flight!) to check in 14 kilos (carry on you can only have 10 kilos). The counter staff couldn't seem to understand why this incredibly unreasonable charge made me upset to have to pay it. Then when we got to Sydney there was no indication of what carousel the luggage was on the flight wasn't listed on the carousel boards and I had to ask the airport concierge where Tiger luggage usually comes out - Carousel 6 if you get into this situation.

The BA flight BA0209 was an old plane - the staff were great and food alright but the inflight entertainment was poor. Your own screen but no control over the films which all ran at different times. Having only flown Virgin and Singapore long haul BA rated way behind in all aspects. But that was nothing compared to the 737-300 we flew on with American Airlines from Dallas to London (BA 1531). I understand they are upgrading their fleet and I can see why having flown on the old plane we were unfortunate enough to fly on. The first 20 mins the plane stank like a toilet to the extent that the level of complaints and people standing in protest delayed take off. The inflight entertainment was a joke - a poor quality shared screen with 30 others two films and no choice. The crew were the unfriendliest I have ever encountered - no meet and greet or goodbyes. I thought booking through BA would ensure some level of quality and that they would demand a certain level of quality from their partners but unfortunately not.

We were told we'd be boarding at 3.30 pm. And some of us - perhaps 10 - did board, only to be told to disembark. The pilot had ""timed out"" after waiting around all day like the rest of us. A few minutes before 4 pm, another pilot showed up and boarded the plane, but he strode off after a few minutes. The flight was then canceled altogether. I managed to secure a seat on a 6.17 pm flight to LAX via Chicago. In the meantime, I complained to a gate agent about the inadequate service and ""surly, ill-mannered, uncommunicative"" agents.

At 1200 I had a call to say my flight was indeed cancelled as was my return. Could I make Stansted by 1200 next day (originally Gatwick). Coming from the Isle of Wight the answer had to be no. Okay I could have a full refund if I supplied IBAN numbers (not credit card refund you would expect) this would be in my bank within 8 days.

Our flight on AC Rouge to Athens was comfortable and we found the staff to be friendly and competent. As others have commented the seats are close together but my husband and I were comfortable (I'm 5âft 4â he is 5 ft 11â). The food and beverages were fine (meals included spicy pasta with a small salad or chicken breast with vegetables light snack included warmed wraps). We were regularly offered water during the 10 hour flight. With the Rouge app downloaded in advance the entertainment is fine. We had no trouble connecting to in-flight entertainment during our flight. Our son has an allergy to peanuts and having read the reviews on this site we were concerned for the cleanliness of the seats (potential cross contamination causing an allergic reaction) and the competence of the staff. Anyone with serious allergies will understand the level of worry that comes without access to medical assistance for a long period. On both our outgoing and return flights the flight attendants were very attentive and in both cases asked passengers sitting close to us to refrain from eating nuts which we greatly appreciated. We didn't use the blankets and pillow provided (brought our own) and brought allergy free food for my son so we didn't require any special or additional attention from AC.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

I am currently writing this from Venice where we were meant to spend 4 days including lunch on Thursday in Venice. Unfortunately once again the flight was delayed - by 4 hours. In the end we didn't take of until 5pm which meant we lost a day in Venice because of Smartwings. Our compensation: 110Kc for food at the airport. This was of course better than Paris last year which was supposed to depart at 8pm on Sunday. In the end it didn't depart until 2am!!

Departure from Melbourne was also delayed relevant announcements were clear accurate and informative. Flight to Perth in older B737 no seatback screens and the seatback/headrest adjustment was not working properly (essential for taller passengers) which made for uncomfortable flight (not my usual experience BTW).

Sometimes these things happen. However I was sitting in seat 41c. From the start the air conditioning was frightful. A freezing cold breeze blew around all of the passengers near the back of the cabin while the passengers towards the front complained that it was too hot. Also the stench from the toilets was unbearable and seemed to be wafted out of the toilets at regular intervals during the trip. I did not experience this on any of the aircraft's I flew with both to Amsterdam six weeks previously or on the flight home from Singapore to New Zealand. Although spoken to the staff were unwilling to acknowledge that there was something wrong. On the Singapore to NZ part of the trip I also tried to charge my Air iPad but it would not charge on any of the seats near where I was sitting.

The two hour delay on the way out was nothing compared to the nearly 10 hour delay on the way back. A brief apology was made when we were finally on board but no explanation offered other than that ""they'd had a really bad week"". What made the experience even worse was the misleading or complete lack of information about what was happening and no obvious presence of staff from the airline at the airport to keep us updated. We were initially informed of a six hour delay by our tour operator (Just Sunshine) on the way to the airport and were transferred to a nearby hotel to wait. We were provided with lunch (though the quality of food was poor). Our tour rep seemed unable to keep us informed of reason for the delay or keep us updated - some passengers resorted to the internet or relatives in the UK for information. When we were taken to the airport after six hours we were informed we would be taking off around 7/7.30. However at 7.30 we were still waiting at the departure gate (although the information boards were flashing 'last call'). The departure time shown on the boards then changed to 8.30 then 9.30. Just after we received a free soft drink for our troubles the boarding announcement finally came and we took off nearly 10 hours late.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,J Cowburn,Thailand,2013-11-22,The flight itself was just the same as any other airline no problem. But what really annoyed me was the treatment I received at check in. We flew from Blenheim to Auckland. A family group of 4 of us checked in. Maybe one case out of the 4 was overweight but they took into account that in total others were lighter and we did not exceed the overall allowance for 4 persons. All good so far. They insisted on weighing my hand luggage which had been stripped down to a few light items but the main content was my CPAP medical machine that deals with my sleep apnea condition a camera tablet and lap top. Overall weight was about 9kgs about 2kgs over the limit of 7kgs. The check in man told me that I was over the limit and would have to remove some items. I pointed out that I had a laptop hoping he would then just let it be. On the flight to Christchurch the Air New Zealand check in told me 9kgs including a laptop was OK and let the bag go. This time the man told me to remove the laptop so he could weigh the bag again. It is an ultra book so extremely light which still made my bag 8kgs. He still wasn't happy and insisted that I remove more items. This was extremely embarrassing for the sake of 1kg but in the end we placed some items in a plastic shopping bag which my wife was allowed to carry on because she only had a handbag. This reduced the weight down to 7kgs which made the check in man happy and I could then put my very light laptop back inside. Rules are rules fair enough but for goodness sake. My wife had next to no hand luggage why couldn't they just aggregate the weight for our group or at least for the 2 of us? In the end I put the items back in my bag anyway but the irony was that it was a small plane and the overhead lockers were too small to even take the regulation hand luggage bag I was using so it had to stay on the floor under the seat in front. So it wasn't as if the bag would have been too heavy for the overhead bin anyway. I expect this kind of treatment from a LCC but not from a full fare carrier like Air New Zealand. It was very embarrassed and it just left a bitter taste for the whole flight. I won't be rushing back to Air NZ I can assure you.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,4,4,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

Middle Eastern passengers tend to want to sit wherever they want so it is possible that someone will be sitting in your seat and the flight attendants will have to shuffle folks around so you can sit where you were supposed to. Middle Eastern male passengers tended to treat the female flight attendants with disdain and it took the male attendants to get everyone organised.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,A Cristaudo,United States,2015-03-09,I flew with Spirit for the first time round trip from Las Vegas to Dallas with my 8 year old little girl. We were worried that our night flight would be canceled due to the weather in Dallas therefore we arrived at the airport early in the morning to fly on standby for an 11am flight. We were able to fly on the 11am flight with no cost increase and we were even given the more spacious seats. We carried two backpacks on the plane (1 per each) with all of our stuff therefore we had no luggage fees. Coming home we printed our boarding passes out at the rental car facility and there was no charge. To be honest I read all the rules called Spirit to double check everything and wound up saving a lot of money. Total cost was $180 round trip for both of us. I will definitely be using them again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,3,5,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

To top it all off this flight was originally booked with Air Canada (with advance seat selection included). Our flights were switched by AC to Rouge and they would not honour our original seat reservations. As we were traveling with a disabled adult and wanted to sit together we had to pay AC another $208 (4 seats - 2 flights) to get confirmed seats. On the return flight (LAX to Calgary) our Rouge flight (along with another Rouge flight) was cancelled due to ""engine problems"". Imagine that two flights within hours of each other both with engine problems! AC did give us breakfast vouchers but also promised lunch vouchers once we were through security. Unfortunately after that point no body at AC knew anything about lunch vouchers. The only good thing about this whole sorry episode was the replacement plane was not a ""Rouge"" plane. It had decent leg room and in flight entertainment. AC also mysteriously credited back $104 to my mastercard.

Many of us would miss connecting flights I was told that I would be informed about my new connection in Kuala Lumpur. We arrived just after 9pm we handed our boarding passes and were told to wait. After an hour we were given boarding passes for our next flights and were told we had to collect our baggage to go to a hotel. We waited for an hour with our luggage then went through immigration and customs and left the airport to wait for a bus to our hotel. After midnight some of us started to realise that the promised hotel rooms were non-existent and went inside to be in the air conditioning. (We hadn't had food or water served for about five hours by this time.) One staff member yelled at people who were reluctant to leave again to wait for the hotel bus and security were called when one passenger started to complain loudly. A group of passengers were taken to a hotel and returned to our group outside the airport after an hour because they couldn't get them rooms. AirAsia staff then left us. I for example waited 12 hours outside the airport with all my luggage; I had no Malaysian currency to buy food because I was only in transit. No one offered me a food or drink voucher and not one AirAsia staff member apologised. Apparently this level of service is acceptable.

Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered. They snapped at myself and other passengers I observed on more than one occasion. They seemed to always be in a rush and as I was sitting in an aisle seat I was rudely bumped into by one of them as they flew by. No apologies were made. Oh and the service was usually late and the food was of questionable quality as well. In short it was such a miserable experience it almost made my trip to Germany not worth it.

Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them.

Both flights had broken down planes. My flight out of Milwaukee had a flat tyre. There was only 1 maintenance person on duty. They had to call another in to help fix the tyre. Our flight to Denver was delayed 2.5 hours. Of course our connecting flight was gone once we landed in Denver and there were no other flights available. Frontier shuttled everyone to a hotel for the night. On the way back home my flight from Denver to Milwaukee also had a broken plane.

On the return leg DOH-IST I managed some sleep but was woken by the inflight chef snoring in the seat next to me. IST-DUB I slept through the meal service when I woke I tried to get some water but no one came from the bell I went to the galley which was deserted.

Staff very friendly plane in a reasonably good condition schedule was great. Arriving in Addis the Airport is just outdated but once can mange this. Going to the next flight to Dubai and it happened. Boarded the plane waiting for 2 hours and then change of Aircraft due to engine issues. Consequently we arrive 3 hours late in Dubai and I missed my connection.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,D Cronin,United Kingdom,2014-07-17,I would first mention that I have been a fairly frequent customer of Jet Airways over the last 7 years and generally find the company to be welcoming and efficient. This morning I flew JetKonnect 9W 2348 from LEH to Delhi. JetKonnect appears to be a low-cost arm of Jet Airways though in my opinion it does not seem to be very clearly differentiated from the main company in its marketing. I paid a very high fare for a one-hour flight sector in India. Despite having checked-in on-line the previous day and arriving at the airport 2 hours before the scheduled departure time with a printed boarding pass I had to queue for more than 45 minutes in a poorly managed utterly chaotic check-in area. There was no separate bag drop for already checked-in passengers. On eventually reaching the check-in desk I was told that I was 7 kilos over the 15kg checked-baggage allowance and had to pay an additional INR2000 in excess baggage charges. However I was 1kg under the 7kg cabin baggage allowance. I was invited to transfer 1kg of items from my checked luggage to my cabin baggage in order to save myself 1kg (INR300) excess baggage charge! This was hardly appropriate in the hectic environment and it seemed a nonsense not to combine the checked-baggage and cabin-baggage weight allowance. After all what difference does it make whether the total baggage allowance is carried as cabin or hold baggage? Given the very high fare charged by JetKonnect the hold-baggage allowance of 15kg seemed unreasonably low compared to industry standard of 20kg or 23kg. I was transiting to an international flight on another airline at Delhi airport and my hold-baggage was under-allowance for that flight. In order to complete the excess baggage payment I had to negotiate my way back through the security check-point to the terminal entrance where the Jet Airways ticket desk was located and then repeat the lengthy entry security check to return to the check-in desk. After dropping my checked baggage I proceeded to a long queue at the boarding gate. On eventually reaching the boarding point I was told to go back to a hold-baggage sorting area to identify my bag before it was loaded onto the aircraft. This unusual procedure had not been advised by the check-in agent and I saw numerous other passengers being turned back like myself to complete this task which had not been explained to them. It was therefore no surprise that the departure of the flight was delayed because of hopelessly inefficient ground handling. The flight itself was entirely uneventful but the experience at LEH airport was truly dreadful and judging by the comments of other customers my experience was not isolated.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,2,0,0,NA,NA,1,0

Then Etihad on 10/23 flight EY150 Chicago to Abu Dhabi. After seeing the pictures online and flying on what seemed like a lawn dart with AA I was so excited to fly on the Etihad Airways. However that quickly ended as soon as we landed in Chicago and had to get in another line to check in. A man met you before you even went through the line and placed your bag in the carry on stand to check if it fit. After seeing him give one lady a hard time with hers since the handle grazed the side I knew we were done. Sure enough all 4 carry ons we got on fine with AA were ""overweight"" and exceeded everything else they could possibly find wrong. So $700 later we had to pay for all 4. Absolutely no care about it and the guy needed a manager to override it. She even shook her head at the ridiculous fees but still did nothing. Although they present this put together and professional staff the unfriendly crew poor meals and lack of overhead complements as we saw a few quarrels over space it was anything but.

Pleasantly surprised to find the new premium lounge was opened in Abu Dhabi on the return leg. Staff very welcoming and lounge at least 3 times the size of the old one.

The Virgin experience was very disappointing by comparison. The plane was old and shabby (I saw one passenger trying to mend the tray compartment cover on his seat it having fallen off) and the toilet in Premium Economy was out of order. The seat was cramped especially when the seat in front was reclined making it no easier to get out of the seat than if it were in Economy class even though I am a small person. The flight attendants especially one were flustered unfriendly surly and unhelpful - when I pointed out that my headphones were not working I was made to feel as if I were being a nuisance by requesting a working set and there was certainly no apology.

To tell the truth I was sceptical on how the long four sectors would go but overall they were great. Booked in business but upgraded to first I think due to my status on another alliance and possibly that I travel quite a bit. Flights were on time in fact boarded quite early in every instance which I like as I'd rather be in a peaceful plane that noisy busy terminal most often. Crew friendly and welcoming and while English is limited I had absolutely no problem getting what I wanted fast and efficiently on all sectors. Food was absolutely fine and up to a standard I was happy with both presentation and size and quality of range. They definitely know they must do this to reach the high yield European long haul market and they seem to do it well. Guangzhou premium lounge is only ok certainly not up to other airlines with limited range of food but there are good showers and wifi. Get a wifi code from the ground floor reception before you head to the top floor. CZ website and apps are rubbish so take care with these any use a travel agent unless you are Chinese and can make your way around the problems. Seating was good but not at the standard of Singapore or Etihad but not that far off. First class seat sent dead flat and they provide a nice bed cover and duvet. I don't sleep well on planes and I got several solid hours on multiple sectors on CZ both 787 and A330-200.

On the way back to KC we did miss our connecting flight by about 5 minutes. They hadn't taken off yet but they wouldn't let us on because they were to leave the dock in just a few minutes.

Of course we didn't have to pay anything extra for the next connecting flight.

All their efforts are spent on their first or business clients so if you are going economy you can only expect the bare minimum of customer care and comfort. The entertainment system is very good but lost baggage seat comfort pre-assigning seats and being able to easily contact a helpful customer service when things do not go to plan are also part of the service I consider myself to be paying for and Etihad do not deliver on these points.

He overflowed his seat enough that every time he moved we were shuffled together from butt to knee. I put up with it for half an hour and then excused myself to the aisle. I paced in the back of the plane for an hour. The attendants were serving whatever they serve and saw that I was near hysteria at the thought of returning to what awaited me in my assigned seat. They did find a solution eventually. A United employee was flying coach and they switched me out with him. But the new seat was only 3 rows in front of the gentleman who had been next to me and he had to watch this seat change knowing his size overlapping mine was the cause. These conditions are set up by United in planning an aircraft with seats that are way smaller than the human population of these times. They know this and leave it to their flight attendants to deal.

The aircraft had the newest special dark green paint scheme celebrating Hong Kong. Check-in was good but boarding delayed and not well organized due to late arrival of the aircraft. The much-advertised refurbished First Class cabin is a huge disappointment. The reflection of Chinese heritage through dark stained wood veneer finishes and rich silk-like fabrics have been replaced with very cheap and common-looking grey plastic and light stained wood veneer finishes and ordinary grey fabrics. Perhaps this was a hastily assembled early product for this signature paint scheme aircraft as the fit and finish of most components were very poor and the new seat padding a disappointment on a 15 -hour journey. Cabin service was top-notch from sincerely caring staff. However they could improve in the area of anticipating customers' needs. The meals were well-prepared but the menu offered very few choices and didn't offer more upscale entrees. The beverage selection was excellent with some very good wines on offer.

We asked for our check in bag back and since we still had 7 lbs allowed in that bag before they added another $75 we started to unpack bags and re-pack so as not to give them one dime more.

Not actually totally lie flat and lots of sharp edges. I wished I had elbow pads. On the regional sector BKK-ICN blankets are thin as tissue paper and the pillows are tiny - not too comforting for an overnight flight. Website said dinner was served BKK-ICN but it is actually a breakfast service before landing (which left me hungry for the whole flight). Drinks are served in glasses slightly bigger than sewing thimbles (TG does the same). I'm surprised cabin crew do not all go on strike for having to run back and forth to refill minuscule little glasses. Ridiculous. IFE not much to write home about. TV comedy channel limited to four meagre offerings and very little programming for children. I was quickly regretting not having a fully-loaded tablet for the three year old I was travelling with. The crew quite obliging and responsive to requests. Cabin was clean. Lavatories were regularly tied up by the cabin crew. Check-in agent in Bangkok barked ""passports"" to request our travel documents. I reminded him that he might want to start with greeting his business class passengers with a smile and a ""hello"". He apologized nd after that couldn't have been more helpful. KE uses the AF lounge in BKK. It is well stocked with drinks and snacks and very close to the gate. On the other hand the Prestige Lounge at ICN their flagship lounge left me with flashbacks of a college cafeteria. Noisy. Constant clanking of metal carts of staff picking up used plates glasses and cutlery. Food offerings very meagre and what there was in terms of food looked just foul - overcooked not much left in the trays and generally unappetizing. Seating was tatty.

After further delays she eventually left Thunder Bay on Porter flight 638 at 21.29 and was diverted to Hamilton during the last stages of landing just minutes before 23.00. The diversion is due to a curfew on landing and taking off from Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport. Our issue is that Porter Airline did not communicate to passengers that the flight would be diverted. Porter did not inform those waiting to pick up passengers at Billy Bishop Airport. Airport was closed at 23.00 and no staff were present. The family member sent to Billy Bishop Airport was left searching for our daughter. We eventually found that the flight was diverted to Hamilton and that our daughter took a shuttle bus to Union Station in downtown Toronto. Sometime after 02.00 am a local hotel was arranged where she stayed for a few short hours before making her way to the Billy Bishop Airport for her connecting flight.

Lastly was the seat was not cleaned at all: there was trash in my front pocket and some trash under the seat also the two rows near me was full of trash the crew apologized and cleaned while before departure.

At the gate the flight kept being delayed initially by 15 30 40 minutes and then 1 hour for a total of over 2.5 hrs. Ground staff disappeared no drinks no information. Eventually the flight was ready for boarding from an adjacent gate. The onboard experience was uneventful with charter-like service in a cramped cabin. The flight arrived at MLA 2.5 hrs late at almost 1 am. For the return leg online check-in worked well and so I went straight to the baggage-drop counter. Onboard the cabin was very cramped. The cabin crew seemed disinterested (no smiles whatsoever).

The staff were very friendly and efficient on both flights but their emphasis is on handling lots of people efficiently and less with catering to individual desires.

Also drinks trolley for pay came round twice. Pilot announcement almost inaudible couldn't actually hear clear works just a muffle. No apology for 1 hour delay outbound. On time inbound.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Clifford,United States,2015-01-28,MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,5,5,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,John Fairclough,France,2014-12-22,BCN to STN return. I used to dread flying on Ryanair though in practice I had very little choice. The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back. As others have said if you stay within their rules flying Ryanair can be reasonably pleasant these days. May it long continue.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,5,1

The middle seat in a row fields down into a table but the seats don't recline any further than in Economy. I assume that UIA can't now fly over Russia - hence the flight was quite long to Kiev - south over Usbekistan and Turkmenistan then over Azerbaijan and Georgia turning north after the Crimea (I could see from Google maps on my phone - there is no in-flight entertainment of any sort). Fairly chaotic at Kiev - it was necessary to go through security again. Boarding was by bus - there was no special arrangement for Business Class. Food was OK but not exciting.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,John Gray,United Kingdom,2015-06-26,"It appears BA continues to adopt a âdo as little as possibleâ for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Vegâ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,M Howell,United States,2014-03-05,Flew to Vegas with my family (10 of us) it was my first time flying with Spirit I was always used to a 50 lb limit on our checked bag but with Spirit it was 40 so that was $50 bucks each way not including the $30 each way for the checked bag to begin with. $10 for each reserved seat so I could sit with my husband which I had to upgrade coming home to $18 a seat because on the way there we were so cramped our knees were literally touching the seat in front on us for 5.5 hours. I have never been so uncomfortable on a plane. Then when I asked for a water the flight attendant told me it was $3 and they do not accept cash. My tickets were roughly $650 after all the up charges it came to about $866. I will never fly this airline again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,2,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Arriving at the airport we were faced with huge lines to get in as all baagage had to be x-rayed prior to check in. No agent present at the business class check in counter so my wife and I proceeded to the economy check in. Only one person in front. The agent was friendly and soon gave us our boarding passes with the Economy Class name crossed out and Business Class written by hand - nice. Flight was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft - not an unusual occurrence with Royal Nepal - most people are just thankful the flight's not cancelled. Flight departed an hour and a half late though we arrived just 20 minutes past our scheduled arrival time. On board there were 2 FA for the 9 people sitting up front (including 2 relief pilots). Meals were fine and service was friendly. No inflight entertainment - only international news magazines and newspapers were available. FAs came around frequently to check if everything was ok. Overall an ok experience - the staff usually try their best but are let down by shoddy management ageing planes and poor infrastructure at the airport.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Very surprised to find that on the return flight there was no entertainment for the same 5hr flight?

I have received an e- mail today to say that both flights are cancelled no apology and no advice on alternative travel options. I quickly looked for alternative flights that meet our requirements ( work in HK and domestic flights in Vietnam into consideration) and found one Dragon Air flight and one Cathay flight that suited. I called the Customer ""help"" line suggested they transfer us to these flights to be told that HK Airlines do not have an agreement with Dragon Air or Cathay.

I had a harder time in business class being 6'5"" - I was able to stretch out straight but my feet were at a 90 degree angle b/c of seat in front - since I laid on my side most of the time it really wasn't an issue except for when I wanted to stretch out. This wasn't an issue in first on way back. Our boys were in economy and I took water bottle back to them - that was a different world back there but they appreciated the water. (A lot of the windows were ""open"" and it was quite a bit noisier in economy - not surprising but it was a bit of a shock going from the dark quiet of biz class to economy). We did read one review that mentioned how hot the plane was in Houston b/f takeoff. We experienced the same thing. I don't think they lease the A/C equipment at the airport or something like that - b/c we didn't have that problem in Hong Kong or Beijing - and both of those planes were on the tarmac during the heat of the day (Houston flight was at 1am).

The service is more or less ok quite a lot of smiles although crew disappeared right after the meal for 8 hours. They answered the calls quickly so not really a problem.

IFE screen was malfunctioning on both flights although after they restarted it it worked flawlessly. The system is pretty slow but I liked the movie selection. Aeroflot misinformed us twice on the gate we were arriving to which made it hard to greet us at the right terminal. They also decided that the bus is good enough to deliver the huge crowd of 300+ passengers to the terminal. Overall the experience was poor especially because of the seat pitch problem and broken seats.

FA's are average or above depends on the crew you got on your specific flight. Food in Business Class is below average but you can eat it. Drink service is way below average only soft drinks and water offered in Business Class. On return flight MIA-BLA they give you Whisky no wine no sparkling water nothing. Check-in in PMV takes an hour or so since they fill out the passenger list for MIA manually. Transit in BLA is quite easy no long walking distances BUT broken escalators for over a year now disgusting. On your return flight you have to claim your luggage in BLA what is kind of funny since there is no luggage belt. Suitcases are thrown through a hole in the wall into bag claim hall.

Safety briefing in both Spanish and English. Because fares are much lower than on AA or Delta it s my first choice to the US.

Welcomed aboard by friendly and helpful cabin crew. Flight attendants looked professional and lovely. Nice uniforms. Excellent professional conduct by cabin crew. Aircraft was clean. We had seat 17E & 17D seats were comfortable. Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags. I have not come across this on a Jetstar flight in the past. Overall a very good flight and this is a very good low cost carrier. Would recommend to others but will warn them of these new changes.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1
china-eastern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-eastern-airlines,China Eastern Airlines customer review,N F Wallace,Australia,2015-01-21,"Had to fly Sydney to Beijing. Qantas sells a codeshare with China Eastern so decided it seemed most efficient flight. What they don't tell you is that you have to get off at Nanjing and clear customs. That is the passenger has to not the baggage. The flight then becomes a domestic flight so service basically stops. When you arrive in Beijing you have to do a baggage clearance through customs. Was very confused about the seat belt sign. Although the pre-flight safety video said ""when the seat belt sign is illuminated return to your seat and fasten your seat belt"" the sign was never not illuminated. When I asked how we knew it was okay to move around the cabin there was no response. When asked how did I know when I had to return to my seat I was told there would be two ""dings"" from above. Unless you ask you have to assume it's safety by telepathy because nobody tells you anything. In business class was offered the hand written menu. Yep hand written on a piece of scrap paper. How very rustic. The choice of drinks was limited and once you chose one that was what you drank the entire flight. Well the entire flight until after Nanjing when there was no gin and tonic served because it was now a domestic flight albeit the same now tired looking tech crew and aircraft. The seats were comfortable enough but the aircraft was tired and in need of fixing things such as rips and tears on seats and around the cabin. Not sure the nose tissues really worked as hand towels in the toilets as they tended to break up a bit too quickly for one to dry one's hands. Why bother? The headset for the IFE was a DYI: you are given a headset and the batteries to install into it. That's a first. The IFE offered bore no relation to what was indicated in the one and only inflight magazine (no entertainment guide) between two seats. It was torn and weather beaten on 3rd January. Qantas should be ashamed and embarrassed selling this as a business class codeshare. Next time it's Hong Kong and Cathay.

condor-airlines,/airline-reviews/condor-airlines,Condor Airlines customer review,L Leung,Canada,2014-09-06,Having mostly dealt with North American airlines previously I feel that Condor has excellent customer service. We made a mistake when booking our flight and when we called their customer service number the call was picked up very quickly and the agent who picked up was able to help us fix the problem right away-no waiting no transfers which is practically unheard of nowadays. We also ended up corresponding with their Goodwill Department and they were very kind to us. Their in-flight entertainment system is a very nice touch screen monitor that allows you to charge your electronic devices via a standard USB cable and there is a nice selection of music for free although there is only one movie and one TV show free for viewing. Their in-flight meals are terrible to be honest but I'm happy to be fed at all considering I've been in 6-hour flights with other airlines that barely give you a snack. I would highly recommend Condor simply because they have always been very helpful and it has always been a pleasure dealing with them.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,2,4,NA,NA,4,1

In total I paid U$256 dollars for the premium seats which where everything but vpremium just because the system is set up so you only have the option of paying if you want to seat in any isle location. And this is after paying U$1330 for the round trip (Bogota-San Diego-Bogota). I believe this is an abuse against customers as we can't preview the real seat assignment for a flight on Internet just what Continental wants us to see. On top of all system was down in the segment San Diego-Houston and we were obliged to take whatever seat we could find.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Williams Mark,United Kingdom,2014-06-20,MIA-LHR 16 June 777-200. Used miles to upgrade from economy. Call centre staff very helpful with this. Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight.

It is one of what I call the ""back-of-the-bus"" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth leg space and comfort. If you are 5' 10"" or less in height or a somewhat taller person with short legs you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words you don't have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or are frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately for me the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). The staff appeared competent and the service itself was decent. The plane appeared relatively clean and well- maintained. Lamentably there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever which seems to be the trend on the smaller Airbus and Boeing aircraft operated by United. To reiterate my earlier comment this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,4,3,1,NA,NA,4,1

I liked very much Blue islands the time keeping and friendly approach of the pilotâs and lounge staff at Jersey. The service certainly has a unique brand feel and a unique business model flying small planes with no hostess at flexible business type fares offering complimentary lounges in the channes islands However the shortcomings are that the J31 is not a particularly comfortable for Journeys of over an hour and while I welcome the lounges at JER and GCI there is no lounge access anywhere else. (Incidentally JEA used to have a hostess on their twin otters whan flying STN- GCI)). Suggested improvements would be offering a carry on refreshment bag or even the co pilot organising drinks from a thermos!

Outbound the 12.40 am departure time became 4.30 am due to a crew issue. The plane was an older 737. The EmPower jacks at our seats were dead and there was grime on the hard part of the seat. There was no special meal service for business class - everybody got a small ham and cheese sandwich. The front toilet quickly got foul but that didn't stop a steady stream of coach passengers coming up front for it. The FA's were nowhere to be seen. AM has no connections/transfers desks for international arriving passengers at MEX. We instead had to go out to the airport lobby and stand in line for an hour at the ticket counter for a rebooking of our missed connection to OAX. Staff working in the ticketing lobby were rude. On the return flight to SFO it was the same older plane and yes the same type of ham sandwich for dinner.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Aliza Panjwani,United States,2015-01-19,On our way back from Cancun we had a stopover in Houston. The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures.

Nonetheless after hearing about SWA's Business Select Class I decided to give them a try. For about $60 more than the walk-up fare Business Select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the A1-A15 group thus being among the first to board. I was thrilled when I checked in online and received boarding pass A-1. The gate room seemed fairly empty and Southwest agents were hawking upgrades for $40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line. Upon boarding the aircraft I discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane. Little overhead space available and mostly middle seats.

Great comfort storage and privacy also great to have two biz cabins one with only 2 rows in (always get that one if you can). However the service on the ground and in the air still seems just 'OK' and leaves me pondering on how they maintain their 5* rating.

In many ways it felt like a more modern and upgraded version of Swiss. There was only one aspect about the flight that I didn't like and that was cabin temperature. It was far too warm for comfort. When I waited for the (single) lavatory to become available the control screen showed that the temperature was set at 25 degrees.

The allegiant to go app. failed to work for me. The reason for the delay was because the flight crew had reach their maximum flight hours and had to rest for twelve hours. The flight itself was very loud. They don't tell you that Sanford Airport is a 45 minute drive to Orlando and the cheapest transport there is a minimum of 90 dollars. On the night before our trip back we received the alert to check in and once again the app. would not work. This time I couldn't access their website either. After several attempts that took about 2 hours I was able to check and get screen shots for the boarding passes but could not print them. Finally was able to email screen shots and print from my email. The return flight was on time and landed without incident. Basically, this airline is a good way to get to your destination if you are flexible (don't mind long delays) have a lot of time on your hands to jump through the hoops to get your boarding passes and don't mind the stress of trying to get your luggage fit with in the size and weight guidelines.",NA,FamilyLeisure,Economy,Knoxville TN to Orlando Florida,2,1,1,NA,NA,1,NA,2,0

Ground experience/check-in were nightmares with rude and inexperienced staff. 25 minutes to print a boarding pass? Don't call them out on poor service or you may not fly as they reminded me repeatedly. Nothing like a threat to start your flight. Flight crews were dynamite! Flights were nice a little dirty. They didn't transfer my luggage to my other airline for my last 2 legs of flight. The airline's baggage tag clearly stated that it should be transferred to Houston. Luckily I passed baggage claim on my quest for a cigarette or I would not have seen my bag sitting alone in the empty baggage claim area. Recognized my bag and 2 nice TSA agents ran me to re-check my bag. Both I and my bag made it on only because of the TSA agent's insistence and the frantic efforts of the US Airways crew.

Well I and my luggage arrived on time so that's a good thing. However this Airline has the worst inflight entertainment options I have ever come across. Choice of about five movies 2 or 3 of which were new. Made for a very dull return leg as none of these had been changed by the time I flew back two weeks later. Business class seat was very uncomfortable and beaten up and the airline was facing a catering strike so the food was simply appalling and not up to standard which I would have found acceptable if they let me know at check-in so I could have stocked up before the flight. Overall I felt as though the airline has done nothing since that aircraft went into service in 1990. No upgrades no replacement of broken parts no moving with technology no development of service.

After never hearing of the company I reviewed it online and the reviews I read were terrible. Our trip was delayed but only because of the fog at the airport on the morning of departure. The Captain kept us up to date with what was happening and apologised repeatedly for the delay. The staff on board (crew) were very helpful and again kept us up to date with events. We eventually took off and the crew started their drinks service. It did take a while for them to get round to everybody but they were polite friendly and efficient given there was approx. 156 passengers on board. On our return journey we were met by the same 3 cabin crew. Once again their service was second to none taking time to chat to passengers and generally making everyone comfortable.

My flight was on SQ 298 from Christchurch to Singapore in general for the price of the ticket I expected much better. Food was very poor. For someone with high tolerance in salty food the Chinese dinner meal (rice with pork in gravy) was very salty. Lamb stew served for lunch was undercooked. Choice of meals ran out for both lunch and dinner and entertainment systems were surprisingly outdated (compared to other airlines with touch screen and consoles SIA only had old fashioned consoles). Air stewardesses were decent but not the most helpful or courteous. Having flown SIA and other airlines like Emirates and even budget carriers in recent years I find that the standard of SIA has been poorly maintained and sad to say even though I am a Singaporean who would want to support the main airline of our small country the substandard flight service and appalling customer service I experienced this flight definitely does not live up to the price of its reputation and premium airline tickets.

Bad from the start flight was shown as Gate Closed 10 minutes earlier than first advised I had issues at security and when I finally got to the gate way after it was supposed to have closed it was actually still open and no-one had been boarded at all. On the outbound trip we had good customer service with a friendly cabin crew. I found the seats a bit hard and also basic inclusions with other (airlines) economy cabins missing (but noticed you get them in premium economy for some more cash) - eg folding foot rest and movable headrests (it moved horizontally but the wings didn't adjust vertically). I always eat vegetarian on long haul usually you're served first. VA offered me a standard meal didn't seem to realised I'd book vegetarian. I had the misfortune to point it out to them and then was served with the most abysmal substitute for a meal with strong flavours of olives and capers that not everyone vegetarian or not is going to like. Thankfully I'm not veg so I asked for a standard meal staff were very good in trying to located something but only came up the veg option on the regular menu which was of equally abysmal quality and taste. What was worse 10 days later I got the exact same meal on the flight home. When I asked for something else this time the staff were disinterested and bordered on rude. Worst food I've had when flying. Wine was quite nice though. Inflight entertainment same standard but the touch screen takes some mastering (its not sensitive unless done in a certain way) and it's not a good idea to have to thump your screen when someone else's head is behind it most likely trying to sleep. Rack for brochures and personal items was either broken or just didn't close at the sides so any small items put in it just fell out not very secure. Flights themselves were smooth so hats off to the pilots they kept us informed through a long period of turbulence. Check in fine at both ends. Got a comfort pack for the night flight socks we're the thinnest I've ever been given. Because of when I booked didn't have to pay to choose my seats but would put me off (besides the experience) using them next time why should I pay on top of the huge fare for me seat too this should be standard with major airline long haul flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,1,4,NA,NA,2,0

It is very difficult for me to express my disappointment in the way the situation was handled. The only apologies we received were from the airport security officers who showed up at gate 29. There were no announcements stating that they (the ticket agents) were going to help us with connecting flights there were no apologies for the inconvenience of having to sleep in the airport no announcement that first class passengers and those with small children would be found hotel rooms and others would be left to their own devices to sleep at the gate. Some water and sodas were provided but not enough for everyone. The ticket agents seemed to be ""put out"" in trying to help us. Isn't that their job? I believe that customer service is a huge part of any business and if you don't have good customer service you have nothing. No food vouchers were offered unless asked for this I found out by asking a fellow passenger where he had received his vouchers.It should have been announced that everyone would receive these after a long night sleeping at the gate. The lack of communication was shameless and again unprofessional! I believe there needs to be some training with the staff at United Airlines Maui to help in dealing with situations such as cancelled flights and exhausted guests.

CDG-PEK on 777-300ER business class a prized flatbed which is great for a 10 hours flight. My welcome drink was snatched away before I could finish it. Food was plentiful but taste awful. IFE froze and was rebooted 3 times. Crew was robotic. PEK-PVG on A340 in economy. Uncomfortable seat no personal IFE. Crew good for economy class standard. They did 2 rounds of drinks and each PAX was given a tasteless muffin with a fried egg inside. PVG-CDG on 340 Business class old style business class seat and I found myself sliding down the seat the whole night. It was supposed to be angled flat but I would call it flat with bumps. The crew asked me if I would like a welcome drink and handed me a food and drink menu. I ordered red wine and was told that red wine bottle would be opened only after takeoff. Crew service was a little impersonal but did perform their work professionally. Ground service efficient - quick check-in meet and greetings hostess efficient to/from airport-hotel limousine transfers offered.

I had a hand in a splint and the check-in staff were lovely even though we where late checking in making sure I had a seat where I wouldn't get bumped into.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,G Thompson,South Africa,2014-07-15,Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

Started okay and managed to watch one movie (flight almost full) then after the meal was served the seat belt sign went on and remained on for the duration of the 16 hours flight. When I tried to get up to stretch I was told to sit down as the seat belt sign was on. When I tried to go to the washroom I was told to return to my seat. Most of the flight attendants (except 2) changed into slumber gear and disappeared until about 3 hours before landing. One of the remaining FA's slept on the back row middle seats and the only time I saw the other one was when he hurried through the cabin once offering water. My entertainment console packed it in and when I asked about it (before they all retired for the night) the staff member said she would call up front to have it reset.

Return journey on A330 with new Club class was even more comfortable the new seats and PTV are a useful upgrade. Cabin service was again great with very attentive flight attendants.

We booked our tickets well in advance and paid $1000 each for the roundtrip flight. Check in at Dulles fine. They give you a ticket to go through the priority security screening which is nice. Maxjet uses the Northwest Lounge along with a couple other airlines so the lounge can get crowded. The lounge had the typical selection of drinks and snacks available. On entering the plane I thought the interior had seen better days. The flight was about half full so everyone was able to spread out. The seat was comfortable and a lot of space. I wish they had given a short brief on how to use the seat because I didn't know the leg rest could extend back and forth to fit the legs until the return flight (it's the big black lever in the armrest). My nine year old daughter was able to figure it out and she slept the entire flight. They handed out the digi players shortly after takeoff and started a meal service. I can't comment too much on the outbound service because I tried to sleep. The return leg from Stansted is where Maxjet shines. The check in was quick and fast track through security is great. We made it through security in about three minutes. Maxjet lounge in Stansted outstanding - wide selection of snacks/food as well as drinks. The service on the return flight was fine but it didn't seem as friendly as the first flight. The food was good but it was definitely airline food I think Maxjet is a little liberal using gourmet to describe the food selection. Maxjet is a great value for the money. The seats space lounge and priority security are well worth the price. It looks like they are upgrading the lavs. The interior of the planes are nice with new carpet and the seats are good condition.

Not a big fan of their food and beverage selections.

One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer). So this aspect was about the only thing that I give a thumbs down to. Another thing I like about some other airlines you have your own IFE system display.

The seat in front was reclined as soon as the fasten seat belts sign had been switched off. Usual problem of hitting my knees. Tried to recline my seat but the passenger behind objected. Left with a small space for the 4-hour flight. This is bad enough but at no time during pre-landing checks was the passenger asked to move his seat forward. There were four passes of cabin staff that failed to spot this. Also the arm rest was broken on the outside seat so it would have been almost impossible to make a quick exit. At no time was anything other than the statement ""fasten seatbelts"" made before landing. No mention of electronic devices seat position etc. I accept this is a charter airline but safety should not be compromised.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

In addition they are no longer catered by Chef Gannon and for the first time in years I was served bad food on Hawaiian Airlines.

PaidÂ£Â£25 each way for extra legroom in the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had the displeasure to travel in. Due to the trays in the armrests it made the seats excruciatingly narrow and painful to sit in. Had an empty seat next to me so swapped with my wife who was 12 rows back with my son. Son initially sat with her but was told by the cabin crew to move as my son had not paid for the extra legroom. When my wife sat there upset at having to sit on her own the cabin crew made half hearted attempts to strike up a conversation with her. For the flight back I decided to tough it out but ended up twisted in the seat for most of the journey and perched on the front edge of the seat with my knees and head resting on the wall in front of me for the rest. Narrowness of seats not made known at time of booking or I would not have bothered with paying the extra.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Simon Brown,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,I have flown LHR-BKK many times with EVA Emirates Oman and Qatar. Unfortunately this time I chose my National carrier. Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating arrangement is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok there was a selection on the menu. However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful.

Boarding the flight for Dublin at London Gatwick I was struck by the friendly Irish humour when asked by the flight attendant whether the wrapped Christmas present in my open carry-on bag was for her! That set the tone for the flight and indeed the Christmas season! It just shows how much a friendly crew can add or detract from the flight experience. Aer Lingus offered a professional and friendly service throughout with surprisingly comfortable seats. Did not purchase any inflight catering or make any other purchases given the very short duration of the journey.

The flights never left on-time and on-average left an hour and a half after the scheduled departure time. Due to connecting flights there was about a 15 minute grace period getting off one flight and going through customs immigration and then through security again to get to the next gate (flight crew did not provide instruction whether there was a way to skip all of these steps ahead of time).

Finally received my luggage and called to claim my $65 compensation. I couldn't get this either and was told conflicting advice about having to fax someone or having to wait until I got back to Auckland. I was also told that my 2 hour layover was not enough time for the airport in Tahiti to transfer bags to a new plane. Since I had the same layover on the way back I called reservations to see what could be done so I didn't have the same problem on the way back to Auckland - flight change pay for an upgrade mark my bags as priority (I would have been happy with any advice they could give). During this conversation I was talked at instead of listened to treated rudely and the end result was that I was told there was nothing they could do and I shouldn't be so negative.

I asked if they had any children activities and was told they didn't do it anymore. The quality of the food is poor for the price I paid I don't think a cold chicken curry sandwich is acceptable. You can of course get nicer food but you have to pay for it. Inflight service on the Helsinki legs was inadequate. I needed to get some water for my boys and my call light was ignored when I finally asked I was told to wait until the trolley came through. The plane only had 2 toilets and when my oldest boy needed the toilet there was a long queue my wife asked to use the business class toilet and after several curt refusals he allowed to use the toilet. There was a general feeling of a lack of care from the IFA's on the flights as if we were annoying them by being on the plane. Service on the Helsinki - Ekaterinburg legs was better but no more than adequate and nowhere near the high standards I was expecting.

Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

I was nervous that we would be split up but each time we were placed together. The flight attendant coming back seemed confused about what gate and plane we were actually going to board at first but she figured it out. The plane looked new and spacious.

What they don't tell you is seat 33a is next to an emergency exit it has a big box attached to the door which means who ever is in that seat can't sit straight they have to sit on an angle. The hostess was nice and arranged a swap to seats 1E and 1F these seats were good with plenty of legroom. We had booked the opposite seats on the way back 33D and 33E again paying for extra legroom when we were leaving the aircraft on the outbound flight I spoke to the head air stewardess about the arrangements for the way back and could she arrange that the seats could be swapped to the same ones we went out on. On arrival a week later the lady came back saying nothing had been changed and there was already somebody in those seats. I decided to leave it to the flight crew to sort out as I had had enough at this point. Without telling anyone until we had boarded it was an airline called prestige with a completely different seating plan. There was no extra legroom.

Pre-departure services efficient but I have seen better and far more impressive. IFE needs to be updated and offer more alternatives. Too much Bollywood and Arabic stuff needs more options.

Given its always significantly higher priced compared to competitors I found it a little disappointing. As always no complaint on the service or IFE (except once as below) but was very disappointed with the food served on SIN-DEL leg both times (bland and just not tasty). One of the DEL-SIN flights on an A380 was a little worse than others with the IFE system not functioning properly for a large part of the flight. It had to be reset several times before it worked. Moreover the aircraft seemed a little worse for wear compared to the usual SQ equipment with some seat covers coming off and the toilet barely clean. All in all the problems were not significant but could be a sign of SQ becoming complacent on a route on which it has little to no competition.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,3,5,NA,NA,3,1

Transit in Guangzhou is also significantly improved you don't have to go through security or immigration for international transfer at CAN.

After reading how the 747's are really starting to show their age I opted to fly this return route on board the new 787 that BA has to offer. The outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats I think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. I arrived at Pearson Airport Terminal 3 booked to return to London in World Traveller Plus. Visited the Premium Plaza Lounge nice and comfy but nothing special. Boarding was really rather chaotic but I was delighted to be upgraded to Business Class at the gate! Seat 3F was a good aisle seat very comfortable spacious plenty of storage space and close to the toilets which I find more useful than bothersome there was never any queue to use them that could've disturbed me. Cabin crew were superb and attentive always addressing by name and happy to help with any queries and requests. The drinks service and the quality of the food was excellent beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented. Whilst I generally struggle to sleep on flights I found the flat bed very comfortable indeed especially with the mood lighting on this night flight. Breakfast a fruit salad and selection of pastries was again very pleasant to start the morning. On time departure and arrival from Gate C66 at T5 through border control and luggage collected took just 25 minutes.

On time but map display only shown on outbound (same as last year do they not work the other way?). My grudge though is you are sold a dream holiday with Thomson (differentiated product) for which you pay a fortune but in turn you get to fly with an airline that just isn't very special. Britannia and Air 2000 which were the best holiday airlines made you feel like you were going on holiday but have been transformed into a poor version of a low cost airline. If I wanted to fly on easyjet I would and I'd know what to expect.

Last flew on ANA in 2011 post-Fukushima on the same route using the 767 and overall it was great. This time round they were still quite good. Staff service is always excellent. I was excited to fly the new 787 plane and it was quite exciting to see the tinted windows and the window in the toilet. And I could feel the difference in the air on-board the 787: skin felt less dry I felt less tired. In-flight entertainment was good. The seat unfortunately remained the fixed-shell kind that does not recline. For someone tall like me it was absolutely uncomfortable as my legs were squeezed against the seat in front. Thankfully I did not intend to sleep that flight sleep would have been impossible. The food surprisingly disappointed me a little: it looked good but did not taste up to my (heightened) expectations. Outside the flight I like how ANA website does automatic online check-in 24 hours before the flight. Overall ANA has been a good experience certainly befitting their Skytrax 5-star rating.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R Hall,United States,2014-10-31,"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward. In summary in the future I will make a sincere effort to travel with an airline other than United.",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,1,1,1,2,4,NA,NA,1,0

I arrived at the airport and discovered my selected seats were not available and I was assigned a seat beside the washroom and behind infant row.

Most airlines allow you to have your bags up to 50 pounds but Spirit only allows 40 pounds. Along with that their prices for luggage (including overweight fees) are ridiculously expensive and you have to pay for your carry-on as well.

On trying to book in there was a long queue which did not move. No announcements were made and eventually another passenger told us the computer system was down. The ground crew were exceptionally rude and our party was split despite having reserved seats before we left the UK. The cabin crew were almost invisible. They disappeared to their rest area shortly after serving the meal. Call bells were ignored. When they did appear they were disinterested and barely polite. The meal was unappetising.

Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior.

No apology given and no explanation only found out later that they did not have a pilot to fly the plane back to Islamabad! Even though Airblue has acquired bigger plane for this non-stop route the seat width and comfort is still same as before put simply its uncomfortable for such long haul flight. There is no inflight entertainment as they have taken the Seat-back TV screens off every seat so 9 hour long flight is pretty boring unless you take your iPad or a book with you. Got served two meals firstly a very minimalist dinner with rice chicken and some salad. About 2 hours before landing they served second so- called meal which was just a chicken role and a drink. Staff seemed clueless and not very helpful. Return flight on 20th October from Islamabad was again delayed by 3 hours. Airblue staff checking-in the passengers on their laptops so it seems that they are not allowed to use proper airport facilities either or could it be a cost- cutting measure. After the announcement for boarding all the passengers were filled into mini buses to be taken to the plane. When reached near the plane the buses took U-turn and came back to terminal without any explanation. Staff then told that due to catering service delay captain has asked them not to start the boarding process yet! They lack service commitment care and are a very poor value for money.

You are positively discriminated for taking a bag that is smaller that the new guaranteed size.

IFE was switched off for the whole duration and we were served only 2 cookies and a bottle of water. As usual there was a duplication of seats allocated for some passengers which led to some chaos. The only reason I travel AI is because of its ample legroom for a person of 180 cm like me.

On our return trip back home to Michigan we had to go round about through Toronto switching airlines to Air Canada for our half hour last leg home. We arrived at Toronto to find that We had less than an hour to connect flights and our baggage wouldn't be checked through to our final destination so after waiting 25 minutes for our luggage and a long trek through a huge unfamiliar airport we missed our flight. But instead of putting us on the next available flight the attendant at check-in directed us to call ticket information. After about 20 minutes of being on hold we ended up at an information desk and they sent us back to the check-in counter where we encountered a gentleman who proceeded to blame us for the mix up arguing and threatening to charge us $250US to rebook.

philippine-airlines,/airline-reviews/philippine-airlines,Philippine Airlines customer review,C J Toledo,Australia,2014-01-03,Business Class from Manila to Tokyo and the only issue I had was their inflight meal portion size. There were two options of either Chicken or Fish I decided to have the fish and the portion size was ridiculous for a business class meal. I am no way a big eater but for a business class flight this should be looked at. The 2 pieces of fish were smaller than a matchbox with only 2 string beans and 2 roast potato balls. I have flown with Singapore Airlines and their business class meal portion size is worthwhile. The solution was - I had mentioned this to the inflight crew and they had offered me another meal which was nice of them to do so and they said they would report this to the catering department. Bottom Line: The overall service for PHP Airlines business class is good and staff are friendly. I enjoyed the experience and would fly with them again but I strongly suggest that the portion size for the business class meals are looked at and adjusted to a suitable size that's worth the fare paid.

Listened for announcements regarding our flight - nothing. Finally I pushed my way to the front of the line in order to flag a passing Virgin staff member who was milling around. She ushered my husband and I to a counter had a quick check on her screen and said 'Nope you've missed that flight you should have checked in by now'! She tried to tell us that there were numerous announcements for passengers flying to Townsville to approach one of the end counters.

Don't just stand in line assuming that Virgin will let you know what is going on.

etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,E Smith,Australia,2014-08-11,We upgraded to Business Class from Manchester to Abu Dhabi and were underwhelmed. Both flights were late (although not significantly) with no explanation. The seats are quite comfortable although a bit narrow and clearly it is better than flying economy. But the service was very below par. On the first leg the crew were pleasant and attentive but got several things wrong (eg bringing the wrong meals). On the second leg though (a long one) the crew were awful. In my view we didn't even get economy class service. Nobody introduced him or herself they staff were off-hand to the point of rudeness the meals took forever to come and the staff didn't respond to any minor requests. For example I wanted a little sugar to sprinkle on my breakfast cereal-I was told that only sugar lumps were available and it wasn't until I suggested that I could go myself and collect some from economy that some appeared! This is just one example of the inadequate and even offensive service. My main course at dinner was almost stone cold and because I had waited so long for it I didn't send it back but it was really horrible. This has never happened to me in scores of long-haul economy flights. Also our trays did not have the correct cutlery on them so we had to keep asking for appropriate utensils. Again this doesn't happen in economy! Another issue was that when one pushed the button for service nothing happened. On two occasions we waited for over ten minutes and nobody appeared. Altogether - very poor we would never fly Etihad again. I have no idea where they get the good ratings that they boast about. The only good thing about the airline is that the call centre staff are very pleasant and helpful.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,3,1,1,2,NA,NA,2,0

aeroflot-russian-airlines,/airline-reviews/aeroflot-russian-airlines,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Andy Williams,Spain,2011-07-31,Aeroflot are not a bad airline though I do feel that for the most part it's fleet and it's service offerings are several years behind those of the competition. I flew Barcelona - Moscow and was swayed by the price. The first leg was in a fairly new airbus A319 with comfortable seats and a clean interior. The only thing of note was the general demeanour of the crew who did nothing to make me feel welcome and were almost hostile in their dealing with the passengers. The pre-flight safety demonstration was multi-language and clear and I found most of the crew spoke English with no problem. In flight refreshments offered were a variety of fruit juices only. Alcoholic drinks are not available though after almost pleading I did get a diet coke. The meal was among the worst I have tasted in my many years of flying. The second leg Moscow-Shanghai was a real eye opener. The Aeroflot website shows that this flight is operated using one of its newer A330 aircraft with in seat entertainment but checking the entertainment listings I found that they been updated for 4 months. Not important of course but an indication of the haphazard approach to service. When I actually boarded I found that the flight is actually operated by (and has always been) by one of the airlines older Boeing 767 aircraft. Aeroflot Boeing 767's are much older than the rest of their fleet and come with little in the way of comfort or amenities. None of our seats or others around us would recline more than 2 or 3 cms. Walking up and down it was clear that no seats offered any noticeable ability to recline. They also had no adjustable headrests. All in all it was a very uncomfortable 11 hour flight. Added to the discomfort was the fact that there was no personal entertainment offered. The aircraft used the old system of large screens placed above the seats around every 10 rows. There were movies played - in Russian often with English subtitles however the quality of the screens and the placement made it an unpleasant experience. Once again the refreshments and food were very disappointing. The omelette breakfast was the only edible thing I had all other food was very poor. The staff on this second flight were more attentive than those previously. My return journey was merely a reverse of the outbound - equally as uncomfortable and equally poor food. The only significant difference was that I had coffee poured over me by one of the cabin crew who gave me a towel to dry my now soaking trousers but still failed to apologize or help in any other way and finally they lost my luggage and once located failed to get it to me for almost a week.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0

My flight from KTM to ABU got delayed. They were kind enough to fit me onto a flight to Los Angeles the next morning and provided me with a voucher to spend a night at the airport hotel. I upgraded my ticket to Business class from SFO to KTM. Compared to other international airlines their service is poor in business class standard. It took 1.5 hrs to get my drink after the plane took off in Business class - KTM to AUH. On the way back I decided to try Economy class from Abu Dhabi to USA and found out it was the most horrible flight experience I had in the past 26 years flying back and forth from USA to other countries. Let me make it clear it was all about flight attendants. Sixteen hours of journey itself is not that easy. One needs to be hydrated constantly to keep with the long journey. However attendants treated passengers like they are looking for free food and handouts. It was the most pathetic scene. If they can not provide ""free"" food or drinks how about selling?

Left us waiting for 12 hours with no explanation at Paris CDG airport. When we asked what was happening at the departure lounge counter the excuses changed by the hour. First it was the fog then 5 hours later it was that the flight crew couldn't work past the original shift time then the plane had to be cleaned then hours and hours later when we were sitting on the plane ready for take off we were told we were waiting on documents. We got to CDG at 8am ready for our midday flight and didn't lift off till after 11pm. Not one announcement to us as to what was happening. We could have has a day in Paris instead of being held hostage in the most remote airport lounge starved of information. Meal voucher received one. The most appalling treatment at Guangzhou stop over - told we were on another delayed flight. Only because I made a fuss and refused to have my flight changed did we get on the connecting flight that had. Already been delayed not to mention the original connecting flight that as missed.

Food was fine. Arrived Dubai 00.50 am (24/06) and we had 70 minutes to transfer to our connecting flight. When I requested a priority transfer whilst checking in at Barcelona the staff member was disinterested and unhelpful. It took a lot of fast walking and anxiety but we made our 02.05 am connection DXB- ADL. The Boeing 777 made me realise what cattle class is. Cramped and the seats are appallingly uncomfortable. For the 12hr journey we were served breakfast and lunch hot pizza snacks were handed out only to awake passengers. Chocolate bars and fruit were readily available. Very pleasant staff. The toilets were kept pristine on both legs - very impressed. Aisles in the Boeing are very narrow so that when one is walking for exercise or to the toilet one is constantly bumping other passengers. In our hurry to get our connecting DXB-ADL flight my husband left our camera in the seat pocket of the A38! We spoke to the site manager on our arrival in Adelaide (24/06) and gave him the necessary details. The next day (25/06) I received a call from the Emirates office in Adelaide Airport to say that the camera had been located and that it would arrive on the DXB-ADL flight on Thursday night.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Constance Marshall,United States,2014-09-10,After flying from Sacramento to Dulles airport in Washington and then on to Frankfurt it was apparent why United ranks at or near the bottom in the airline ratings. The Airbus 320 to Washington a 5+ Hour flight was brutal. There is no leg room at all the seats are flimsy and uncomfortable and it's impossible to recline your seat because of cramped space. It should be unlawful to pack that many people into limited space. The flight attendants were tired surly and unfriendly. We were in Economy but a row of seats right in front of us were Economy Plus they were empty on our flight. My husband needed to use the bathroom so I sat down in one of the Economy Plus seats until he finished so I could stretch my legs. An FA quickly came over and informed me I couldn't sit there. I told her I was waiting for my husband etc. She said rudely that I needed to return to my assigned seat. There were many empty seats on this flight but when people tried to spread out to get more room they were told no. One man asked if he could sit in one of those seats and was told no because they were Economy Plus. I don't get this attitude. The food was horrendous! There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight. Aegean Air from Istanbul to Frankfurt a 55 minute flight served a hot meal - at midnight! There's something wrong with this picture. On the Washington to Frankfurt flight we were served something called a crostini. It had processed lunch meat and processed cheese. It was so horrible I couldn't eat it.

We live in London very near to Stansted and were excited about travelling from there rather than Gatwick. Our plans involved Washington DC. We booked our seats early May. I specifically asked about the Washington flight and I have an e-mail guarantee this would not be suspended again. Lies. Suddenly by e-mail not even personally addressed to me I receive notification that our flights home have been cancelled. Offered the alternative of JFK. However we had plans to fly on from Vegas which was our first stop over to Florida and then fly up to Washington for a weekend visit. Our internal flight and hotel was booked on a non-refund basis. So we have lost money big time because of Maxjet Airways. I asked Maxjet for compensation regarding this but all they would offer was $100 per person and then we needed to get to JFK instead. Result = cancellation of flight from Florida to IAD lost Â£550 ($1000+) - cancellation of Washington weekend hotel & trips Â£600 ($1200+). We would then need to book a Jet Blue flight from Florida into JFK currently costing $319 per person (total Â£850 or $1941). Sadly we could not afford all this with just $600 compensation from Maxjet - so our plans are over finished. Maxjet took ages to refund our original ticket price. Reliability and honesty is the key for success. Judgement is out on Maxjet as far as I am concerned. Back to Virgin Atlantic from now on.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

But the return was less good. Especially the final leg Doha to Bangkok. We left Doha around 1am and it would have been nice to get a good meal to settle us down for the 6 hour flight but they just brought us a miserable sandwich. 2 hours before arriving into Bangkok - around 10 am - I expected a nice breakfast - nothing too heavy - but the food options were dinner-based - so beef or chicken with veg etc. I think we just wanted eggs or croissants with coffee. I've flown with Qatar many times and I find the service quite variable. The stop-over in Doha bus connections is now a drag.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,0

On the outward flight we were seated in cattle class at the back with legroom fit for a dwarf like Mr Moss the cabin crew came round with hot drinks etc without being informed there was a hot meal being provided later luckily we had a hot drink/snack because I could not fold my tray down because of the lack of room. Coming home we booked seats at the front with extra legroom. On arrival at Hurghada airport we were all given a letter telling us we were being diverted to Rome as the plane would encounter very strong headwinds and was incapable of holding enough fuel to get us back to the UK. Had a good flight up to Rome just over 4 hrs with a nice meal on a tray that we were able to fold down with comfort - paying Â£40 a couple for the extra legroom. Then informed by the captain that once we landed in Rome there was a standby crew that had been flown from Gatwick waiting for us - Monarch must have known well in advance this was going to happen. Less than 30 mins later we all got back on - the new captain then informed us we would have to get off again because there had been a mess up with the amount of fuel.

To top it all of I later found out from my husband sitting 3 seats away from me with our 2 children between us that they had tried to put the mistake down to me because I had asked for a Asian vegetarian meal myself when in fact I had specifically asked for a normal one of pasta as per menu after the first mistake.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,1,1,3,NA,NA,1,0

volaris,/airline-reviews/volaris,Volaris customer review,G Newhouse,United States,2013-02-05,I don't know what has happened to Volaris. Over the last 3 years they have gone from good to horrible. I started to fly LAX to UPN flights recently. The web-site is maddening when booking an international fight. Sometimes it works sometimes it won't or asks you to call customer service. Warning - weigh your bags before you check-in. If you're one pound over you get charged $50USD. The seat pitch is 28 inches or less. Even a 2 hour flight is uncomfortable because the seats recline too far. Each time I flew UPN they gave me the wrong customs forms. Everyone on all flights had to redo their customs documents!

Recent trip to LAS we booked Southwest for the non-stops on this round trip. Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin.

Also heard they have very cramped seating in economy - and also found that to be true. But on the positive note - there were plenty of extra seats available so people could move around and switch places. As for the famously bad food - I opted for veggie option out of fear and wasn't disappointed. The only thing was the small portions - everything was tiny. The entertainment system was all right but mostly commercial Hollywood films on rotation. As to the famously unsmiling stewardess - some of them did smile making up for those who did not.

Food edible - but you do not need 2 meals on an overnight 6 hour flight! Real problem are seats - the plane is a very tired leased 767 with seats that do not recline much and a poor foot-rest.

However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary.

lot-polish-airlines,/airline-reviews/lot-polish-airlines,LOT Polish Airlines customer review,L Passlow,United Kingdom,2010-08-16,"As a weekly Business traveler from LHR to Warsaw LOT has been my choice for nearly 2 years mainly because of the convenient scheduling even though on average a business return costs approximately Â£100 more than with BA. Until recently all was going well with the occasional delayed flight which is normal. In the last few months all this has changed. LOT now have a policy of cramming their flights to capacity - as most passengers fly economy the result has been the compacting of business class to 2 or 3 rows with all seats occupied 6 across. The last 3 weeks I have been sandwiched into already small seats with no space to work or even sit comfortably. On one occasion upon entering the plane I was confronted by a 140kg woman in the middle seat with a crying baby on her lap. Her body occupied fully a third of my seat & I didn't fancy 2.5 hours under her bulges & a crying baby for company. When I pointed this out to the stewardess I was met with a shrug and told ""flight is full"". I asked how was I supposed to even sit here discretely so as not to offend the passenger concerned & was met with total indifference. Last night was the last straw same situation yet again with same uncaring attitude of the flight crew. I took my bag and left the plane. I went to the customer service desk where there were 5 staff 1 of which was working with a queue of customers 1 on the land line phone presumably to a customer 2 women on mobiles who I can only assume were on private calls due to their demeanor - the 5th woman resting with her head in her hands & elbows on the counter all with closed signs. I asked for the station chief and was directed upstairs to his office . On complaining of the situation again I was met with total indifference. No apology or attempt to placate me was made shrugs and said flight was full. Apart from the fact that a business ticket is purchased for just that reason to work the absolute apathy & uncaring attitude of the staff mean that I will never use this airline again & bodes very badly for their future as a competitive service provider to business users. I wonder if enough business fliers like me who spend in excess of 120000zl a year were to leave them would they even notice or care. I don't think so.

On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee.

Cathay experience was very good indeed. On the leg Melbourne to Hong Kong was in Premium Economy and this was well worth the extra cost. The leg room was very good as was the food and the cabin staff. From Hong Kong to London Heathrow was upgraded to Business Class and all I can say is wow. The level of comfort and food was excellent the cabin crew could not do more for you. I know who I will be booking again when I need to make the journey - well done and thank you Cathay Pacific.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1
etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,Tamara Shiyab,United Arab Emirates,2014-01-03,"Chicago to Abu Dhabi on New Year's Eve. Departure board said ""on time"". Flight scheduled to leave at 8pm. Boarding started promptly at 7pm. Told we could get in line and board the plane first as we had child with us. This did not happen. As it got closer to 8pm passengers were being rushed to sit down and stewardesses were hurrying around trying to find places for excess carry-on bags. 8.30 pm - still on the ground waiting for plane to be de-iced. 9pm - plane still on ground. 9.30 pm - announcement there is medical condition on board. Have to pull back up to gate to unload passengers and offload their luggage. 10pm - still on ground waiting to be de- iced. 10.30 pm - still waiting. Midnight: Happy New Year! Still in Chicago and plane still at the gate. 12.30 am - have to be de iced again and announcement made that we were waiting for runway to be cleared. 1.30 am - we finally take off.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,E Couture-Doherty,Canada,2014-03-17,After reviewing the webpage for Rouge I charged up my laptop and tablets to make use of the entertainment system on board that streams content to your device. For the flight to the destination the onboard system malfunctioned flight attendants were unable to make it work for any passengers. For the flight back home it was working however after trying to stream the content for 30 minutes on each of my devices I asked the flight attendants why it was not working and they replied that the service is for Apple customers only. Air Canada Rouge should specify that only Apple products will work with their systems. Seat pitch was uncomfortable in the A319. On the way to my destination attendants came only once with food and beverage service for a 4.5 hour flight. Also I was under the impression that Air Canada had to hire bilingual staff members where the only French that the flight attendants were able to speak was when they were reading the safety demonstration card and the landing card. They were not even able to provide accurate translations of the Captains announcements. Not impressed.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0
