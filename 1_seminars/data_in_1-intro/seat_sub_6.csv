air-france,/seat-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,L Cohen,United States,2015-05-10,This was great! I flew LAX-CDG and back and liked it a lot. I mean the legroom is absolutely dazzling and the seat recline was great (well I'm short) and the shell seat is great because you don't have to have the seat in front of you in your face. If you feel like you're not lucky to be in this small cabin (the upper deck one is the only one on the plane) look at the economy passengers behind you! I felt like how low the seats were made it so that it was a bit difficult to view the screen. But this was hardly noticeable. Again I'm short!,AIRBUS A380,2x3x2,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,1
air-india,/seat-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,A Sharma,Germany,2013-04-25,It was a bulkhead seat (17H on 777-300ER) right behind the business class cabin. Seat recline is ok and legroom is good. The seat width however was horrible. First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat. Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side. Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet. It was quite hard to move it into position (joints were hard) and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth! At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell (swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen) and hit my shin quite hard. For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin (and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen). I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function. Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue. Thankfully the touchscreen menu on the personal screen was working which enabled me to watch a movie (not much more as the system response was very sluggish and music browse menu quite user unfriendly to use satisfactorily).,BOEING 777-300,3x3x3,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,0

Economy class on the day to HKG from CDG was full. Very cramped cabin with 3x4x3 configuration. The seat on the aircraft was like wooden bench. I felt that the seat on B777-200 on the way back to CDG was a bit better. Has AF improved the seat? Either way their economy seat is far from satisfactory. Also on the way back to CDG they ran out of food available between first and second meal. If you take a long haul flight with AF make sure that you take some food with you just like the time you take a budget airline.,B777-300 / B777-200,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,2,2,3,2,NA,NA,0

Having sat in the seat for some 24 hours it was getting uncomfortable towards the end of the journey but at least you are invited to stretch your legs by walking around the cabin. Seat recline is good and your leg space is not seriously compromised when the seat in front is reclined fully back.

The 777s as noted before suffer from having the same layout as economy but the seats are better. The airline I gather is going to re-configure these aircraft during 2009 - not before time. The service and food made for a very good flight and the seat was comfortable enough for the flight from Tokyo.

Seats were thin and as hard, legroom was tight but the worst part was that when you reclined, the seat base slid forward, causing less legroom. The plane was amazing, though, and it was quite an experience to try out the new Dreamliner. The windows dimmed by pressing a button, cabin pressure and humidity was higher and you could feel the difference after a long flight.

We were in 31/B on the way to London and in 30J/K on the way back to Chicago. 31 A/B were better because there was no one behind us. The seats were fairly comfortable, but not comfortable enough for us to really sleep. The arms were really hard and could not be raised because they contained the trays. If the center one could have been raised to make more room it would have helped a lot. I could not really stretch out because of a metal box under the seat in front of me. From reviews I have read of other airlines' premium economy seats, these were good. A pillow, blanket, and eye mask were provided. I am a vegetarian and had a special meal which was all right as was my husband's meal. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful.

emirates,/seat-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,P Smith,Australia,2014-01-29,Auckland to Brisbane. We had chosen seats 52J and 52K bulkhead seats in the first row of the second economy class cabin which did offer more leg room. They are located next to the galley so you get a lot of noise from that area. This did not bother me at all but on a much longer flight if you wanted to sleep may have been a bad choice. The hot towels were very welcome and also the drink service was efficient. When the evening meal was served we seemed to wait ages for the cart to appear at our row. We were offered the choice offered on the menu of Beef or Salmon and then immediately told the Salmon had run out some time ago. Then why offer it? Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service. Just prior to landing the female flight attendant decided to tidy her hair and apply make-up in the galley mirror which took some time she should have done this out of sight of passengers.

After flying with them I can honestly say the negative are correct and I'm somewhat dubious if the positive are real. No leg room unless you pay extra for leg room cost me $134 Australian dollars. Narrowest seats in the market and their entertainment system had to be rebooted 3 times. The staff were the only positive attribute.

eva-air,/seat-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,B Johnson,United States,2014-01-13,Spent the extra money on Elite Class and was quite excited until I sat down and saw the oversized entertainment box right directly where my legs should have gone. This is for window seats row A. All the window seats (and in K too) seemed to have this same problem. As a result you either have to sit diagonally with both legs on the left side or do the splits with a leg on each side but the problem with this is that the left leg's calf muscle will have the corner of the foot rest jar up into the muscle causing pain after some time. Also when fully reclined it is difficult to get your feet under the seat in front of you. The concept is good but the execution is utterly terrible and I was very disappointed not to sleep for the 10-hour flight because of constantly trying to juggle one of the above two positions neither of which worked.

So I changed from 14A to 22G. This was a major mistake as 22G has a large metal box directly adjacent to the anchor stays of the seat in front so it means that leg space for 22G is reduced by about half. Of course this does not appear on the seating chart at check-in but had I known this I would have stayed in 14A. That said I watched a film directly after the meal service (the second Narnia film) and then woke up just before breakfast. So I must have slept for about eight hours.

singapore-airlines,/seat-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,R Woodward,Australia,2013-04-20,First of all if you are planning on flying the A380 with SQ I would suggest you get in early and book an upper deck seat. The cabin is much quieter than the main deck making it easier to sleep etc on long trips. The aircraft appeared to be new and was very clean and tidy inside. As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777-200 that flies from Singapore to Manila. The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights. Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class. In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil).

We were seated in 21A and 21C, therefore we had a good view of the TV's. A flaw with United is the movies they show everyone on the overhead TV screens.

There were toddlers on the flight, and lots of children/teenagers that mostly were on a school trip.

In a world where the power of a 1980's IBM 360 can practically be delivered in a smartphone it is ""inelegant"" at best and embarrassing at worst that these huge clunky boxes are the ""solution"" for the new seats.

The seats were well designed and ergonomic however the seat cushion was extremely hard probably the worst I have experienced on a longhaul flight. After two hours I was in pain and had to stand up. The seats have foot rests but these are almost useless for a tall person and when those in front are fully reclined it it almost impossible to get out without the people beside you getting up.

The seats were terrible so uncomfortable and you were shoe horned into a tiny space for 11 hours. The food was awful borderline inedible and the staff were ok. Just ok not fantastic service but not awful. TV offerings were not great pretty disappointing especially their offerings for children. The children's food was again inedible meaning my 7 and 4 year old had nothing to eat the entire journey as they didn't even have child snacks for kids like crisps or popcorn. With all the schedule changes (our flight was changed by 3 hours) they did nothing to accommodate us when we complained. In fact their customer service agents at their call centre were down right rude and had no clue.

cathay-pacific-airways,/seat-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,E McEwan,Australia,2014-11-19,From Sydney via Hong Kong to Paris. First 10 hours to HK were okay pretty on par with other major airlines and no complaints about the A300 seat comfort access or configuration. However the A340 shell seats are hard uncomfortable and the worst I've sat on. The fact that the seat doesn't recline from your hips and merely slumps you downwards putting an immense amount of pressure on your lower back and bottom is terrible for getting any kind of sleep rest or even just general comfort. I'm average height and small build but I can only imagine with horror what this might feel like for taller or bigger built people. When slumped in the seat there then appears a large gap between the paper thin seat padding and the headrest causing further spinal issues with no support for your head neck and shoulders. As a final insult the seat belts have an airbag in them which makes one side of the belt extremely bulky quite weighty and cumbersome so that even just sitting upright never mind trying to sleep is uncomfortably restricted by this bulging leather strap. There's also limited leg room under the seat in front not sure why but it's probably the fault of the shell seat design being so low to the floor and there's also very limited space in the seat pocket annoying when you can't fit much under the seat either. The only saving grace this aircraft design has is the configuration. I was travelling with just one other person and it was nice to just sit in a twosome without fear of the dreaded middle seat or clambering over a stranger while they sleep to go to the restroom.,AIRBUS A340,2x4x2,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,0

air-canada,/seat-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,W Atkinson,Canada,2014-11-19,My spouse and I were flying to/from LHR via YUL; our outbound trip was at the end of July and home trip in early September. These seats are located immediately behind a service bulkhead and afford a lot of legroom. The IFES and table tray are located in the armrests as is the remote control for the IFES and overhead lights etc. We found the trays easy to deploy but it took both arms and a lot of effort to get the IFES unit out of the armrest. When deployed it was difficult to view as it was somewhat offset by the armrest or the tray (if deployed). The remote control is on wired tether which often tangled with other items and accidentally turned lights on or off or called cabin crew unnecessarily - annoying. The seats are leather-faced and comfortable. An amenities kit is provided with pillow and blanket. The seats are close to washrooms. When cabin crew were accessing the bulkhead storage there was a tendency to hit my feet with the door. Also this is a service area for c rew so it can be noisy as can be the sounds of passengers walking to and from the washrooms. Overhead storage is plentiful. Meals were excellent as was the crew service. For overseas flights it is worthwhile paying extra for the comfort. If we had to do this again we would probably choose seats farther back in this 24-seat cabin to avoid the bulkhead closet crew activity and washroom sounds.,BOEING 777-300,2x4x2,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,4,4,5,2,NA,NA,1

I agree that the cost for PE has increased over the years, but if you keep your eye out for flight deals from Qantas and their partners, then the higher price compared to normal economy is not double.

qantas-airways,/seat-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Charles Hartwell,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,We travelled in the 'green' section and in seats 38 DEF which were at the back of the section with a wall behind us. My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable. On a 13+ hour flight! there were no goodie / activity bags given out to our 5 year old and the choice of children's movies was quite limited. On our first leg a Emirates flight my daughter thought Santa was on the plane due to the huge amount of stuff she was given. We had a lot of turbulence and no warnings etc from the captain. On the Emirates leg the captain warned us in advance and then after some heavy bumps came on and reassured everyone that all was well. If I had the choice I would chose the Emirates A380 over Quantas' A380 on a long flight purely due to the much more comfortable seat better IFE and great goodies for kiddies. Thus outweighs (for us) our experience that Qantas have more friendly and attentive cabin crew. If we were to fly on the Qantas A380 it would be in the same seats or upstairs (review of our return trip to come).,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,4,4,4,3,NA,NA,1

Similar experience to the old Qantas business ""Dreamtime"" seats just not as wide around the shoulders. Seats recline enough for comfortable sleep and are wide enough not to be troubled by your neighbour. Large size screens that are all armrest stored. Meal service is exceptional and better than many airlines business class. Pre take-off drinks linen tablecloths steel cutlery glass wine glasses china crockery fine wines even plunger coffee.

Like others have mentioned the new seats are awful very hard and uncomfortable on any flight over an hour. Leg room was great but after almost 4 hours in this seat it got painful. We all want cheap flights but someone must be able to design a less painful cheap seat.

The airline batted 100 percent in three categories: None of the flights were on time. All of the food was pretty bad (even for airplane food standards) and all the in-flight entertainment was outdated or physically unviewable. We did have one recent American film shown and it was great-- but it was a 1.5 hour flight so they cut it off before the ending. They are quick to warn you regarding turbulence and the flight attendants are plentiful and responsive. Best meal was the Chinese breakfast of yogurt fruit and pork and chicken dumplings. Drinks are frequently served  but beer/wine if at all available runs out quickly (but it is free in economy). No hard alcohol in economy.,AIRBUS A340,2x4x2,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,3,2,1,NA,NA,0
air-new-zealand,/seat-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,G Graham,United States,2008-08-20,We were in seats 22 A and B (upper deck) but were fortunate enough not to have a third passenger in seat C giving us more room to spread out although I believe we would have been comfortable even with a third person. These seats are in the exit row so leg room is not an issue nor is the narrowness of the seats. I've heard complaints about the temperature but that wasn't a problem with the blankets provided. There really isn't much of a window for this row. The side storage bin is a little awkward to reach and can disturb the passenger behind you when accessing. Our return flight LHR to LAX – 747-400 – we had seats H and K in row 25. We found these seats to be extremely comfortable especially with no one behind us.

The only issue is no where to put the ipads due to no front seat pockets. We were not on a night flight so the talking from the staff was not a issue but I could see that it can be as they sit in the area in front of you and you can hear them clearly. The head sets didn’t seem to work for a lot of people but they have plenty of back ups.

cathay-pacific-airways,/seat-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Ron Ng,Hong Kong,2015-05-29,Boeing 777-300 with hard shell seats. Hard shells wasn't that bad after all on a short haul 4 hour flight. Although seats don't recline and the person at the front won't lean back and occupy your limited space hard shells are not comfortable when compared to other ordinary seats and I don't feel relaxed at all. These seats should not appear on an aircraft of a 5-star airline. If Cathay wants seats that do not recline so much and occupy one's place at the back maybe they could choose ordinary seats that could recline but with a max angle fixed so as to reduce effects on the person at the back.. On the other hand seat legroom was just acceptable not satisfactory enough and seat width was good just like other Cathay aircraft. Conclusion: Fixed shell seats not preferred.,BOEING 777-300,3x3x3,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,2,4,3,3,NA,NA,0
lufthansa,/seat-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,Marcelo Freitas,Brazil,2015-06-14,"I've just had the worst flight experience over the last 20 years. GRU-MUN flight of June 5 on Lufthansa's A340-600 was ok. My friend and I managed to get joint seats on one side of the plane. Legroom was fine though the seats were kind of narrow and thinly padded. Our flight back on a Boeing 747-8, however, was a nightmare all thanks to the seats being even narrower, the legroom non-existent, no to mention these metal boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you, which reduced your legroom even more. Initially I got bulkhead seat (18F) in the 4-seat row. If you think the regular seats are narrow, wait until you see the bulkhead ones. Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed. I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off. But that didn't do it either. I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros. So my colleague, who had an aisle seat on the same row, was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room. But sleeping is out of question on such seats. I practically got no sleep at all, just like some passengers who'd rather stand up during the whole flight than being squeezed on a seat. Food was nice and so was the crew, but I vow never to flight coach on Lufhansa again.",Boeing 747-8,3x4x3,14-06-2015,Economy,Business,2,1,1,1,1,3,NA,4,0

finnair,/seat-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,H Adams,Australia,2015-03-01,We flew fro Singapore to Helsinki in and had the least comfortable long haul flight I've ever taken. The chairs were insufficiently upholstered narrow and the arms rests too were insufficiently upholstered and narrow. I was on an aisle seat and my elbow was repeatedly jogged by folks walking down the aisle. I got pins and needles fro being so cramped and I'm only 163cm. My daughter joked that the pillows were just Marimekko pillow slips they were flat and did little to offer any support If you choose Finnair be sure to take a travel pillow and ask for several pillows and blankets to try and prop your arms and provide lumbar support. I'm a pretty fit person and got up several times to stretch but I did myself nerve damage from being so cramped I worry how it would affect less robust people. I asked for a glass of water twice from stewards and was ignored my daughter asked not to be woken for meals after the first time she was woken for a meal and the stewards awoke her again.
