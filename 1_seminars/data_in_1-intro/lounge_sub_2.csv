aer-lingus,/lounge-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus Gold Circle Business Class Lounge - London Heathrow Airport,J Russell,NA,2010-05-01,I'm sitting in the lounge a bit incredulous that I paid for access to this. I paid for it because I had a lot of time to kill and it seemed a good way to pass the day. What a gloomy awful lounge. I found this page because I was looking to see if maybe I'd missed something because it seems there is no free WiFi. Completely insane. I thought this was for business travellers? The girl at the desk looked me up and down when I walked in too so apparently despite having a lounge that looks like a 3rd grade classroom without the fun stuff on the walls (or windows) they have a problem with how people dress? I'm neatly attired but I'm flying today so I am absolutely not wearing a suit. Anyway the long and short of it is that the lounge is unfriendly no amenities no toilets no natural light can't really see myself bothering with it again.,AER LINGUS GOLD CIRCLE BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,London Heathrow Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,1,1,3,2,2,0,0,2,0

This has got to be the pokiest grubbiest lounge I have ever seen or used. The food was soggy and not fresh and the decor is not very good. Gives a feeling of boredom and gloom.

It is a large and very open space. Enough different seating arrangements. A separate space for computers. And a food and drinks counter. Due to the open space one can hear almost every conversation. To make things worse they play loud music. Food is ok. Enough choice but not much of a display. Drinks are also ok. Enough choice. Alcohol you have to ask (except beer). WiFi speed is great and free. Shower room is a strange affair. You get a 'space towel' and some slippers. If you don't bring your own shampoo and/or soap, you are left with only water to wash yourself. The towel is a big paper cloth you can dispose of after the shower. Slippers have the same design. You don't enter this space for a spa treatment, but it does refresh.

Door understaffed & young man at desk very obviously nicer to male clients than myself as a solo middle aged woman. Lounge is poorly set up rather like a bus station where toomany travellers require seats for their bags & coats. Food selection is the worst I've seen in a lounge. Drinks selection is better but they sure do not hurry to put out the bubbly. The latest empty has been sitting on a counter for a half hour now.

This lounge is definitely not to be recommended for a long transit. Having recently been condemned to staying in the lounge for 12 hours I cannot recommend this lounge. The food was practically non existent. Just one badly bruised banana and a single rotting orange and a few snacks. There was butter and jam but no bread until morning. When I asked for the use of the shower I was made to feel it was putting the staff out. Staff were few and far between and totally disinterested in customer service. The decor is outdated and dirty.

Staff in lounge very friendly food was sandwiches and nuts. Food well presented bar staffed at all times this I thought was not good as I like to get my own drinks. Showers great and very refreshing water hot and shower room was well cleaned. If I had one complaint I would say the seating looks like old school chairs.

Good points - this new lounge is huge has a varied selection of seats including recliners shower facilities are good OKAY selection of reading material and half a dozen internet terminals for free internet access. The bad points are that whilst Air India's website shows alcohol is available to international travellers none is available or on show. In fact there's one small fridge with water pepsi 7 up fanta or fruit juice - that's it. The food selection is similarly limited and the hot selection was particularly unsatisfactory (2 veg 1 meat - however there appeared to be no chicken in this!).

Bad points - except for the shami kebabs the food selection was poor and in the case of the sheesh kebabs revolting. Had the crackers and crisps instead once the shami had run out. The staff were overstretched (there appeared to be only 2 of them) and as a result items were not cleared or refreshed.

The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (7:30 a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons. Since it was so early we weren't interested in cocktails but the 'bar"" consisted of bottles of mostly empty liquor save for the almost full bottle of sweet vermouth.

Nevertheless the WiFi should be improved or the instructions to be made clearer on how to connect. In the central area of the lounge there is a TV showing CNN.

avianca,/lounge-reviews/avianca,Avianca (swiss) Business Class Lounge Customer - New York JFK Airport,D Ruckel,United States,2014-11-19,I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swissair logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swissair evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swissair lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic. Since this is supposed to be about the lounge I have seen one or two glorious lounges and this pales in comparison.,AVIANCA (SWISS) BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,New York JFK Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,0

Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new. Once I found a seat I was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where I eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses. There was food on offer as well but I gave it a miss as I did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned. To be fair to BA though the lounge appears to be shared by many airlines so they probably don't have much influence over how its run.

Visited twice in the last 2 weeks and I'd say that this lounge is below average. No outside view of any kind. Boarding notifications shouted by staff. Stir fries and rice offered during meal time but not delicious and attractive at all. Some salad sandwiches dessert and other snacks available. Soft drinks plenty with some beer and wine. Used plates collected from time to time. Washrooms were clean. Biggest complaint is the wifi - uses public wifi which is extremely slow.

Warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge. The main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables. Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language.

Lounge is small and cramped - staff poorly trained and clearly have no natural customer service flair. Restaurant booths were full when we were there - staff were unhelpful and no booking system meaning you need to go back over and again to find space (in the end we went to the Gordon Ramsey opposite the lounge). Orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the 'terrace'. Carpets stained and the whole room looking tired. Elmis spa has no dedicated area for First in fact we couldn't get in - as priority is 'first come' rather than First then Business.

Around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to Heathrow T5 where there are no announcements. I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often.

These are hotel-style rooms with day bed TV and music and a private bath. Had champagne and lunch delivered to the room so very nice. Then I discovered that the room only had one temperature - freezing cold Also the rooms back up to what may be a kitchen with constant banging of doors and other loud noises. Not very much chance of getting a rest here. Finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times. Restaurant food choices are rather uninspired and presentation not of the highest standard. Service can be inconsistent.

emirates,/lounge-reviews/emirates,Emirates A380 First Class Lounge - Dubai Airport,H Dalem,Netherlands,2014-02-20,Looks like a very posh lounge at the beginning. Almost deserted. Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet.

From there you can deposit heavy bags in the cloak room use (rather dated) computers in the business centre go to the game room or go to the First or Business Class lounge. The business class lounge has a large dining area with actual table service. Food selection was excellent for a lounge - with actual main dishes and an endless variety of premium drinks. Past the dining area are huge sitting areas for more passengers who just want to relax. All seats are singles though so don't expect to be able to lie down anywhere. There are showers in the restrooms but there are no toilets and sinks in the private shower rooms. This means that one must groom and finish up in the public area of the restroom which is a bit odd.

The variation of both food and drinks is very limited. The lounge is frequently visited by Swedish politicians and civil servants from the Swedish public administration representing the Swedish Government. This may be one of the reasons for the poor and very restricted offering since Swedish government employees is normally not allowed to drink or eat during business trips if not on their own expenses.

Aside from fewer people and prettier light fittings almost everything else is the same. The so-called Neil Perry signature food selection amounts to little more than a plate full of fancy party pies. The obligatorily QF Club carrot and celery sticks also adorned the Business class lounge buffet too. I visited the lounge mid-morning and it certainly could have done with a good vacuum clean. Also noted that the tiles in the male toilets had been stripped off revealing the besa-brick construction (very attractive!).,QANTAS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,Sydney Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,2,2,1,3,1,2,0

The meal service is very limited and is normally made up of some variant of salmon with cheese creme. The breakfast has never changed during the last 5-10 years but is better than the food served during the rest of the day. Some more ideas would be mostly welcomed.

The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find.

swiss-international-air-lines,/lounge-reviews/swiss-international-air-lines,Swiss Int'l Air Lines Business Class Lounge - New York JFK Airport,D Ruckel,United States,2014-11-19,I used the lounge as an Avianca customer. I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swiss logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swiss evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swiss lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic. Since this is supposed to be about the lounge I have seen one or two glorious lounges and this pales in comparison.,SWISS INT'L AIR LINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,New York JFK Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,0

Entrance staffing is odd. Non-LH entrance check leaves the two LH lounge dragons free to communicate nonstop. Which they do. Not by way of greeting guests more like ""nonstop them"". Weird choices of hot food: Both dishes were made of pork on both visits highly Muslim-friendly. The longest mobile-phone conversation clearly audible was when a Sky Chefs employee answered her phone to discuss her Sunday lunch. At least it sounded more interesting than what Sky Chefs offered in the lounge. Empty trays used to be refilled at faster speeds so your selection may be drastically reduced during a short visit. Empty dishes are removed from tables at infrequent intervals. Sky Chefs and LH offer a consistent experience: They present themselves as self-serving organisations which will accommodate customers albeit grudgingly and only once done with themselves.",LUFTHANSA SENATOR BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,NA,Business Class,NA,NA,3,4,3,4,1,4,5,1,0

Packaged crackers and cheese carrot sticks and that's really it.

Probably the worst lounge I've been in that has been in its home country. Certainly the noisiest I've ever been in anywhere at all. Virtually nothing to eat here apart from 4 slices of cheese on 3 plates and some actually decent looking bread rolls with nothing to go in them. There are little verrines of synthetic looking desserts but not what you'd expect in Morocco at all - nothing vaguely traditional. I headed for the one stainless steel covered container to find what looked like two snails inside. I like snails but these looked as if they had suffered some nuclear mutation so I decided to give them a miss and settled for a glass of red wine and nothing to eat. Tried to find somewhere to charge my laptop with a UK plug and the lady at the desk asked her (male) colleague who refused even to look at me and shrugged in the direction of a wall. Nothing to be seen when I looked. I went back and showed them the plug and she tittered as if I'd shown her a rubber duck or something. A management type came to the desk ands she asked him. He too refused to look at me and just shrugged. I don't mind - although I think it's a bit odd - that they don't have a socket I can use - I usually have an adaptor with me - but the entire concept of customer services seems to have passed them by. Surprised that Emirates want to use this lounge! I work in Saudi Arabia and even there the male staff at the airport are happy to look at women and smile - and help!

Upon reaching the bottom of the escalator to the reception desk you could find a rather cold grey holding room with straight back chairs (none in leather) and utilitarian lighting. It looked like cheap IKEA furniture and fixtures filled the room. The most depressing lounge I have ever entered in the world and it just goes to show United never cared about it's elite customers and destroyed Continental's customer perks and more comfortable lounges. It was obvious to me every last penny was pinched at the frequent flier's expense. I left after a while to try the other lounge at B8 area and it was the same depressing room I experienced at the other end. Both expresso/cappuccino machines were broken and the bartenders had to be called from behind the wall to get a drink.

TG462 departs at 0030 and it is sad to relate that this excellent lounge has very little to offer the business class traveler at the end of the day. Eats such as they were consisted of a very tired salad bowl a few biscuits and a bowl of fruit salad. In the drinks department there was no chardonnay only Marlborough Sav/blanc in the white range and one brand of red (cab/sav). I have used this lounge on several occasions earlier in the day when it is sparkling clean with plenty of food and drinks choices. I got the impression that the staff just wanted the Thai travelers out of the lounge ASAP in order to close the facility for the day. In fact the whole of Tullamarine Airport at that late hour is a shambles.

This lounge is very comfortable as you have the choice of sitting in darker areas or in the light of the panoramic two story window looking at the Tarmac. There is also a large and separate quiet room for relaxing. Drink options are great as there are self serve options as well as a separate bar room. That being said food options aren't the best as there are just apples and chips most of the day. I do give this category 3 stars however as I have heard that in the evenings when the long haul departures are they offer more food that could be a full meal. The staff are very kind and courteous and do a good job cleaning the whole complex. The Internet works very well also.

As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours.

Answer: We can't do that you have to go to the gate to find out. Food: in the mornings bagels muffins yogurt like a typical middle class hotel buffet. Decent bar with a lackluster bartender (see above about avoiding work). Pretty small place so it can get crowded. WiFi is the free wifi available all over the airport. And remember even if you fly first class as I do you have to be a club member or pay $ 29/50 for a day pass unless you fly intercontinental.

There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down.

The purpose of relaxing at lounge and boarding when boarding starts will not stand true in this case. Odd and strange it is but this is Air India you can expect anything. The reason I can think of is if you visit their lounge you would notice that it is generally occupied by Airline staff itself and after a minute or two someone will be visiting from Airline to have a snack so it is a free restaurant for them. Last month I sent them a mail that their lounge plugs are not working from months.,AIR INDIA EXECUTIVE LOUNGE REVIEW,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,2,2,4,3,5,1

I was disappointed and its very average. I understand the new interior is sleek and modern but when you look beyond that there's not much below the service. No snacks unless you go into the Haven for some crusty buffet food and waited several minutes for a shower attendant to appear and when she did she screeched something at me in Cantonese from the end of a hallway gesturing to a refurbished (though standard) shower you would find in any lounge. Aside from the furnishings I would suggest the Business Lounge next door offers more and certainly the QF First Lounge in Sydney or the BA First Lounge at LHR T5 are far superior.

Limited plugs. They could do a much better job ensuring that each seating cluster has plug in or access to one. One of the benefits of airline clubs is the convenience of not having to fight for outlets and this particular airline club has the same issue - something that surprised me for United's hub. Other airline clubs are much better on this front. Clean up service of old plates/glasses. Service to clean up old plates and other glassware is sporadic at best.

First impressions were that this is a high- quality lounge spacious and a lot more capacity than the existing lounge. Food and beverages on a par with existing buffet-style business lounges which are very good. Good business area and nice childrens area. Where this lounge really fails is the SiX Senses Spa which is shambolic. I have just queued for 65 minutes for a shower. They had no waitlist so you had to just grab a seat and wait (could not nip out to get food). They had a booking system for spa treatments but the earliest slot was over two hours later so most people could not avail of this. I use their First lounge normally as Gold Elite so the experience going through Abu Dhabi today is significantly worse than before. Lot of unhappy people here. I believe that when they renovate the old lounge area near the shops it will be a dedicated First lounge which will hopefully take the pressure off in this lounge.

They are separated by a barricade nthat was easily crossed. There is no wait staff even for first class passengers. When one flies Emirates or Lufthansa in first class the respective lounges provide an opportunity for a high quality sit down meal from an a la carte menu. In the AI lounge food left a lot to be desired. The bathroom was in shambles and there was no lotion. Magazine choice was non existent. Wifi was spotty and complicated. why can't they provide free wifi without the need for passwords cell phones etc ? Very absurd. And the bar service was pitiful and most of the time non existent. Again no waiters even in first class section. In summary the premium lounge in the airport shared by many airlines is similar but at least predictable in service (albeit poor). The AI lounge is awful and takes away from first class experience. The managers don't care and are never around to receive feedback leave alone make changes.

I asked for a toothbrush in the morning; after bring ignored by the lounge manager and then again by the uniformed lady I got it through the attendant but the kit seems to have been ""borrowed"" from Hotel Centaur (whose name was written on the pack). The breakfast was pathetic - very little options and the one I had Poha was cold dry and just a step above eating sand. The ketchup that was served looked like it was diluted 10 times over. The coffee and tea served were tasteless cold and unappetizing. I had to go out and eat breakfast in a restaurant outside. There is no WiFi in the lounge and they give you some sort of cards that have a validity of 45 minutes. On the day I visited even that was not available. Since I was coming from an international leg I thought of taking a shower before taking the domestic leg. When I asked the lounge manager for a towel I was flatly told that they had ""run out of towels"" - when I asked how long it will be before they can get fresh ones I was told that it will come the next day only! Since the lounge was quite empty I asked the manager how many towels he keeps a day and he said that they have a limit of 6 towels a day. I asked how they expected other guests to shower and he gave me a look that conveyed that I had exhausted my limit on the questions I can ask him. The lounge manager was very quick to refuse every request for service. He also has a bright future in the Indian Administrative system because he never forgets to treat you with disdain and demonstrate to you that he is under no obligation to provide you any service whatsoever. I am have flown Air India internationally for almost 18 years and they have managed to completely escape the service revolution that has happened everywhere in the world. The quality of service is as poor as it was 18 years back and though the faces of service staff is younger they have managed to encapsulate the same sense of apathy and disdain for passengers that existed earlier.",AIR INDIA BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Delhi Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,0
asiana-airlines,/lounge-reviews/asiana-airlines,Asiana Airlines Business Class Lounge - Incheon Airport,A Abbott,United Arab Emirates,2014-08-05,Arrived around 9.30pm for midnight Emirates flight so was looking forward to eating a light dinner. Food and drink selection was extremely mediocre. There was a selection of overcooked tomato pasta a huge bread mountain with toaster which nobody touched. The salad bar and grilled vegetables were depleted and obviously the most popular. No dessert except some cut pineapple and sliced oranges. Pot noodles was obvious choice for Asian travellers. Compared to the business lounges in HK London and Dubai the Asiana lounge really needs to step up. At that time in evening the last thing we want is a carb overload. Suggest you cut out all the pasta and serve cold cuts salads and a decent cheese board some chocolates or dessert of some sort and not the plastic Kraft cheese on display. If we are playing business class fares then I expect half way decent food in the lounge. If I knew it was going to be this bad I would elected to eat in one of the restaurants in the airport but unfortunately everything closes at 10pm in Incheon Airport. On the positive side lounge was spacious wifi works and nice to have massage chairs.

There are no showers which is quite a disappointment after a long flight. Bathrooms could be cleaner. There is a business center with free internet access and there are of course muslim prayer rooms.

The men's bathroom has been out of order for 2 of my last four visits; the attendant instructed me to use the TAM lounge which required another check-in. The Internet is open without pesky log-in requirements but it is very very slow. The lounge is very busy from 8-10 so maybe the space simply cannot accommodate the traffic. I noted another comment that the lounge does not have adequate staffing so the tables when I get there are covered with empty glasses/dishes.

The Business Class lounge here is dreadful: shabby overcrowded and noisy. Going the other way you leave from Terminal 3 a new purpose-built A380 terminal. The lounge is almost as long as the terminal - departure gates for Business Class passengers are in the lounge. Not having to trek through the main concourse is a pretty good convenience. I arrived at the busy time just after midnight and left after a long layover at the next busy time just before 10am. In between the lounge was quiet spacious and very comfortable - especially the quiet area with loungers at the far end. (There were no PA announcements to disturb me for six hours as there were no flights). Even at the busy times the lounge wasn't crowded. There are two food service areas a lounge- like space on the left and a restaurant area hidden on the right with proper tables. Food and drink was okay in both areas if not inspiring.

united-airlines,/lounge-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines Red Carpet Club Business Class Lounge - Washington Dulles Airport,R Joost,NA,2009-12-09,What a disgrace. I am going to have to spend six hours in this lounge to catch a connecting flight to South Africa -the plug points don't work even bottled water costs money as does the wireless and staff is rude and uninformed. I am a regular user of Star Alliance lounges and while the quality varies from airport to airport this is by far the most appalling one I have ever seen. An insult to gold members.,UNITED AIRLINES RED CARPET CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Washington Dulles Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
malaysia-airlines,/lounge-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines Business Class Golden Lounge - London Heathrow Airport,Tiong WeiLiem,Malaysia,2015-03-01,Even though it was a small lounge it was very cosy. There are good views of the tarmac as well. The staff were very polite. The whole lounge was very clean including the toilets. Maybe if there was one small thing I would pick on is to have more varieties of food. Other than that the lounge is wonderful and I would recommend it.,MALAYSIA AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS GOLDEN LOUNGE REVIEW,London Heathrow Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,1
