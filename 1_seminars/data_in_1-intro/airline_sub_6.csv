adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,L Stefan,Canada,2013-08-19,VIE-LJU LJU-MUC Aug 4-15th CRJ200. Both flights very good. Clean cabin comfortable seats (always cramped in CRJ) efficient and attractive cabin crew announcements made in Slovenian and pretty good English and German. Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly. In LJU nicely stocked Priority Pass lounge and is a nice small airport MUC is an awesome airport to connect through. Would highly recommend this little regional airline and Slovenia is beautiful.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,0,NA,NA,4,1

adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,G Evans,NA,2005-10-01,Flew to Ljubljana from Gatwick. Plane was a new Canadair Regional Jet small (40 seats) but good leg room and comfortable. Both cabin crew were friendly. Food was just a cheese or ham roll but fine for a 1 hr 40 minute flight. And Adria were one of the only airlines leaving Gatwick that evening not to be delayed. Return flight was an A320 full comfortable and good service once again. Would recommend Adria again and worth paying the extra 20quid over Easyjet for flying from Gatwick and not having to pay for food or drink.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Service pretty friendly planes clean & well-maintained flights on time. Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey.

adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,G Chew,NA,2002-12-06,I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,J Fox,Ireland,2015-07-27,"Arrived somewhat early for the flight and had to wait an hour for check-in to open as the queue continued to grow. However, check-in staff were friendly and quickly got through the line. A full flight so boarding was a tad chaotic moreso due to passengers not obeying the gate announcements. The flight closed up 25 mins after scheduled takeoff time (8.35pm) and consequently the pilot informed us we missed our slot and could not be airborne until 9.50pm Luckily, the situation improved and we took off at 9.30pm arriving in Dublin only 15 mins behind schedule.

Plane took off on time and arrived a few minutes early on the other side, so no complaints there.

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,Michael Shoesmith,United Kingdom,2014-10-12,Kos-Athens-LHR on October 1st at 19.10hrs. Very professional service. The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth £70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,0,NA,NA,5,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,Ian Gallagher,Ireland,2015-01-26,SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2014-10-05,Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,4,0,NA,NA,4,1
aerolineas-argentinas,/airline-reviews/aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,B Aldridge,United States,2014-08-26,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,2,0
aerolineas-argentinas,/airline-reviews/aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,B Aldridge,United States,2014-04-14,MIA-EZE and return Dec. 24 2013 - Jan. 3 2014. A below-average airline. Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,2,0
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-08-28,NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,0,NA,NA,4,1

The flight we were booked on was cancelled two days in advance and we were switched to a later flight. This flight was then delayed by over an hour and there was no information given as to how long the delay would be - the aircraft just didn't turn up. Once finally on board no acknowledgement of the delay but otherwise ok - a small sandwich and drink were served which was fine for such a short flight.

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,Dmitry Kuzin,Russian Federation,2013-06-09,Aegean started regular non-stop flights between IEV and ATH in Spring 2013. The A320 was 6 years old the cabin was quite ok inside. Seems like the company's making effort to keep their planes clean. Flight attendants were just doing their job without being extra attentive. Catering included Greek cuisine and was good but not substantial - no meat was offered in the meals fine for vegetarians. Inflight entertainment meant magazines and music no TVs or anything else on that particular aircraft. The flight was on time no issues with the baggage.

aerosur,/airline-reviews/aerosur,Aerosur customer review,K Beard,NA,2009-08-23,Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled. The airline is fine if you are not in a hurry and don't mind delayed flights changed schedules and don't mind having confirmed tickets ignored.,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Both times there were new A320s with comfortable seats and adequate entertainment - magazines music overhead TV screens. First flight departed with a slight delay - 10 mins but arrived on time. On this 45 mins flight the cabin crew served a cookie and all kinds of napkins (dry and refreshing) but surprisingly didn't offer any drink at all. The next flight was also on time. The catering was tasty with meat little salad and baklava. Drinks of various kinds were offered. Both times the cabin crew was smiley but didn't show much care. Baggage arrived quickly.

aeromexico,/airline-reviews/aeromexico,Aeromexico customer review,C Calvert,United States,2014-10-28,I read all the bad reviews and decided to take a chance anyway. I had three tickets to Mexico from two different places. On all three tickets and on two separate occasions they changed the flights and added a ten hour layover. They said that they would fix it by asking me to leave a day later. I booked through Expedia and they would not help. I was on the phone with Expedia and Aeromexico for at least two hours. They did offer a refund but by this time all the fares were at least $250 more. I had to cancel all three tickets and rebuy on other airlines at an extra cost of $750!

The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work.

Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great.

Not very punctual - departed and arrived 20 minutes late. Terminal F at SVO is crowded and inconvenient. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Food was served twice good choice tasty meals. Entertainment system is very good. Blankets and earphones were given to all the passengers. Seat comfort was very poor to me. Seats are narrow with surprisingly little legroom.

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,2012-09-26,Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight.

Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

Hong Kong to Moscow and return was in business class with Aeroflot. Very impressed. Seats on flight to Moscow were of an older type of business class seat but did everything I needed and all ancillary services (entertainment etc.) available.

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,P McCarthy,United Kingdom,2012-06-11,LHR-ATH return. Found Aegean to be very average. Flight out delayed by 2 hours due to high winds with gate attendants 'managing expectations' stringing the delay out by 10 minutes every 15 that went by; however the return was on time. A321's seats are closely bunched for leg room and lack any head rests making sleep tricky on the longish flight. Cabin service was just slow meals of dismal quality in both directions though wine pleasant. A film was shown in both directions which worked OK. Some crew were friendly others were not focused. Online check-in works well but won't from their own iphone app. Experience at both airports fine.

As this was known well beforehand we could have remained in our hotels instead of being jammed into the airport at 1 in the morning then finally boarding the aircraft at 04:30 and sitting on the Tarmac for an hour before takeoff.

On entering the plane we were offered a choice of water or orange juice; on asking for a glass of champagne was told very curtly by the steward that they had not chilled any so could not offer it! No personal IFE in seat only offer of ipad type product with limited selection. Meal very mediocre - choice of wines ok. Service from cabin crew very unfriendly and desultory - they seemed to have little interest in providing much service. Seat was acceptable. But this old 767 really needs an upgrade and the cabin crew need some serious customer service training.

aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,J Fox,Ireland,2013-11-04,JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop.

Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there's plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered. IFE system with proper wide screens offers sufficient amount of entertainment apart from the choice in music. All in all a very positive experience with Aeroflot.

Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter. However correct check in though a bit stressful as the airport and particularly the flight to Moscow was crowded. Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board.

The inflight service was just as good though the aircraft was older. However the check-in in Damascus was terrible with all the line for the three desks merging into one big mass of people pushing to get served. I was waiting for over an hour before I got to the counter. I asked for a window and got a middle seat (they said they had no more windows). I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know. Back in Sharjah the immigration area is confusingly laid out and getting a queue that moves is pot luck. here again everyone is pushing to get served.

All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard. All in all I would very highly recommend Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel to anyone.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapés salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage.

The ground staff in Munich were completely unhelpful and only the staff in Dusseldorf did an excellent job and were very helpful. I will certainly not fly AirBerlin again.

Much less positive than previous times. It started with a very grumpy attendant at luggage drop off. No welcome no eye contact just orders. Man must hate his job. Same attitude at gate while boarding. On board less legspace food bad and no pre- ordered vegetarian meal. Flight attendants robotic but that's AB. Movie choice limited. On the positive side: very punctual performance. But on long haul AB is not on par with other carriers like Lufthansa. Chose AB because of direct flight and departure time but will probably shift to another carrier next time. Lots of choice to the UAE.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,1,3,3,NA,NA,4,0

I tried Aeroflot again and my decision was made on the basis of the facts that they use new A330 on their longhaul which is a big step forward compared to their Il96 Russian aircraft and Aerflot flights and Skyteam partners moved to the newly opened Terminal E and D in Sheremetyovo which is supposed to shelter the passengers from the horrors of what is now called Terminal F. The flight from BKK was okay check in was problem free the boarding process was chaotic as usual and staff completely uninterested to help. To my horror we parked at the older terminal and it was the same story all over again. Horrible terminal with sad staff barking at passengers overcrowded old terminal with people sitting on the ground. I consider it as false advertising and clearly the airline lied as my reservations stated all flights were to fly to/from the new terminal. The A330 new and still clean onboard entertainment limited but okay a small number of films and a very limited music choice. The food was good and portions sufficient only one drink then totally zero cabin presence. After the meal the crew hid for at least 8 hours at the back of the plane and ignored many calls for service. They shamelessly kept hauling business class food for what it seems as their own private party at the back galley. Toilets filthy as no one checks on them. The same thing at the return flight. Beware that Aeroflot Bangkok flights are predominantly family oriented so there will be a large % of infants on board which can get very tricky with a plethora of babies yelling all through the red eye flight in unison. Aeroflot's greatest weakness is in its crew - sad robotic and no eye contact whatsoever.

We had no delays to any of our flights no flight schedule changes no issues whatsoever. All of the staff including ground staff and flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and we had no negative interactions. Staff were lenient on a couple of occasions without baggage allowance and we never waited long at the check in counters. Long haul flights no matter which airline are generally arduous and uncomfortable but Air Canada was certainly not the worst airline we have ever flown. The food was a little hit and miss but then it is extraordinarily difficult to cater meals for everyone also we tended to always eat a proper sit down meal at the airport before boarding a long flight so we often just skipped the first meal anyhow.

The boarding process was disorganized (no zone calls big queues) and as a result of the chaotic boarding we lost our departure slot and had to wait about 40 minutes for a new one. The inside of the plane was a little old the seats were moderately comfy but quite narrow. Air Berlin offers hot meals for a surcharge. The crew did take orders but forgot all passengers in my section. Since they were also not reacting to call buttons I got my meal about two hours into the flight and it had to be removed quite soon since the flight is only about 2.5 hrs long. Arrival delay was 40 minutes. Baggage delivery in Hamburg took over one hour.

Fortunately I looked closer and found that not only was there a time change but they were now flying me to Faro not Lisbon (no mention of this in the email). I then had to ring a premium number to query this. The person I spoke to did not seem to find it strange that people book a flight to Lisbon because that is where they want to go and that Faro some 300 miles away is no substitute.

TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment.

Cold drinks were offered but we had to work hard to get anything other than orange juice or apple juice. There was very limited wine and my requests for tea or coffee were met from the trolley but not graciously. All of the above were not deal breakers but the following are - the old London-Beijing planes were very uncomfortable. The seats were old and tatty and the entertainment system was atrocious. If it worked it was extremely complicated and mine didn't work at all on the outbound leg. To add insult to injury a black box linked to the entertainment system was placed under the seat in front of you and this severely limited leg room and forced anybody with normal length legs to sit on a twist. The Singapore plane was more comfortable so would be put to far better use on the longer flight to London as ten hours is far to long to sit in a crooked seat on a tatty old plane.

I know flights are going to be delayed especially into and out of Beijing but the airlines need to be straight with us about what was happening. We boarded 3 hours late pushed back and were then told we'd have to wait another 15 minutes - it turned out to be 45 minutes - before we could take off.

Discovered that ""Rouge"" was the carrier from Toronto onwards. Plane small hot crowded all the usual complaints flyers have these days. Not even a bag of peanuts offered on a 4.5 hour flight free water offered hourly however. I have no objection personally to flying 'cattle class' when I have paid accordingly. This is outright highway robbery at over $300. one way on what I thought was a 'legacy' carrier. The cabin was overheated with no apparent way to improve the temperature or comfort level. Two lavs at rear of cabin appeared insufficient given the projected passenger load. The staff appeared eager but inept in so many ways. I felt as though I was being attended to by the local fast food restaurant hostess: eager chirpy but ill equipped for a real job. As is the current custom constant nickel and diming along the way adds to flyer frustration fortunately I can forgo the proffered toys at $10. a pop but I do object to paying premium price on a cheap-0 carrier.

Sat for 2 hours in the boarding lounge then 3 hours inside the plane in HK to finally hear that our flight was cancelled. Spent one night in HK and when back at the airport early morning we got a new route: Beijing - Frankfurt - Munich. Arrived in Beijing flight to Frankfurt was fully booked and there were no more flights available that day. Queued at the ticketing counter for 2 hours and had a new route: Beijing - London - Munich having the last part of the journey by Lufthansa. After issuing hand written paper tickets we spent another 2 hours waiting for baggage and shuttle bus to hotel. Spent one night in Beijing and the next day we finally took off to London. Long distance flight was ok: flight attendants don't really know the meaning of customer service and the food was reflecting Chinese cuisine very poorly. In London we were not booked onto the flight to Munich! The lady at the ticketing counter in London was very understanding (Lufthansa) and she put us on to the next flight to Munich. Arrived in Munich 2 nights and 3 days later than initially planned and our last surprise one piece of checked in luggage went missing.

CA178 was my first long-haul with CA. Mostly it was a pleasant trip with good service. A330 was in good condition. A few scuff marks at feet level. Bathrooms were clean throughout. Captain spoke excellent English and FA announcements were clear English. Requests to FAs were mostly understood. Service when the call button was pressed was very prompt. Meals were fine. Presentation was a bit naff but food OK. The seat was good the design made me think of J in Lufthansa. I worked the whole trip so didn't try it as a bed. Access to the power point and headphone socket was fiddly under an armrest. The overhead light was not accurately aimed at the table. Amenity pack was OK. Mostly working so not much time for AVOD. Video feed quality was excellent. Headphones not noise cancelling but adequate. LHR-PEK - Departed on time. Good quality pyjamas provided and the bed comfortable. Blanket a bit on the small size. Meal service was fine. Choice of movies was OK. Headphones were very good with noise cancellation. PEK-MEL - First time trying PEK as a transit. Not good. Arrived in T3. After walking about a kilometre reached the transit desk. Half an hour later I was through. Had to take the train then finally get to the domestic lounge. Was called to the gate but stood for 45 minutes waiting for the bus to the plane. Plane to Melbourne was via Pudong. Lunch was OK then arrived at PVG. A man with a flag rounded up all the MEL pax and herded us to the baggage claim area then to immigration. Bit of a queue there. So after about a 750m walk arrived back at the same gate same plane. All in all I came away with perception of 4 star service for the air portion. 2 stars for the transit service at PEK maybe 2.5 stars for transit at PVG.

On this A319 flight I used Altitude upgrades to Premium Rouge which is 6 across with middle seats blocked. Unfortunately I was assigned 1A which has 2 problems: (1) It is a bulkhead seat with less than 20 inches of room between the seat legs and the bulkhead and (2) front row means tray tables stowed in the armrest so even though the middle seat was blocked I was confined tightly into the seat. Onboard service was pleasant with the new crews and the meal that was offered with a menu and choice of entrees was good standard Air Canada domestic J quality. Unfortunately due to the reduced personal space and legroom I will continue to make a point of avoiding Rouge where I am able to select another carrier.

Flew New York Newark to Vancouver and then later on to Los Angeles. Payment for checked in luggage on an international flight is unacceptable. Offering no food (only for purchase) for a 6+ flight is unacceptable. Ground male staff in Vancouver (flight to LAX) was extremely rude and arrogant to most passengers including an elderly gentleman who was confused about payment for luggage.

Was interested to see how this new airline looks up close and was surprised at how awful the FA uniforms look in person. The colours are not flattering to any skin or hair colour the bowler hats are ridiculous and they just look downright cheap. The skinny hairbands don't help either. The FA's are very young and void of personality they have no senior co-workers to emulate and it shows. They look lost. They hardly spoke to the passengers and I heard one passenger comment as we left the aircraft that was the quietest flight crew they ever experienced. The aircraft is bare bones the bulkhead doesn't even go up to the ceiling so you are constantly looking into the galley. The seating is so tight a 29 inch pitch it should be illegal in the name of safety. Got off the flight and on to an Air Canada mainline flight to Vancouver. What a difference! The FA's may be older but they look experienced professional and confident and seem to be enjoying their jobs. I guess it's true you get what you pay for and Rouge is paying peanuts to these kids.

Air Canada's inflight entertainment is the best I have encountered. The service staff were young and correct. The only part of this AC experience that was poor as it has been on other trips is the check-in procedure.

I am 5'10"" tall and 170 lbs and the height that aircraft seats were originally made for. It was impossible to reach down and get things from the floor without getting up and bending over. The price of this flight was not cheaper than others and Air Canada did a bait and switch changing the configuration after I purchased the ticket. The cabin crew did their best . The galley for the 400 seats in economy was very small. The food was almost non-existent. Air Canada has the worst food for an international flight I have had. The second meal was a heated wrap essentially a ""hot pocket"". Inflight entertainment was new system on this plane and was quite good but the second flight had a slow outdated system. Overall service good and AVOD good everything else terrible. Flight 787 was an Airbus A320. Bad AVOD only two bathrooms for economy. Turbulent flight so when not turbulent long lines for lavs. Service Satisfactory everything else not. Hopefully Air Canada will get new 737 MAX equipment with 3 lavs in the rear for these medium haul flights. The Pearson Airport transition with US customs is terrible.

Chose them because they had a good name did not realise it was not Air Canada and secondly price. Really good price for this time of year. The cabin crew were young I like their trendy uniform. I think the return journey crew were better than the outbound only because going they were asked questions about travel connections and should the passenger pick up their luggage or would it be transferred they did not know the answer. Also I think the return journey at night is easier for the crew because people sleep. I found the crew very attentive and very friendly they did not forgot requests from passengers. The downside of the flight - no duty free I did not realise this on my outward journey. The inflight entertainment I had read you could purchase a tablet for $10 which I did on my outward journey - the tablet kept freezing whilst I watched a film. I think it took me 3 hrs to watch the film. Other passengers also had problems. I did not purchase the tablet on the return journey but the same thing happened but they made an announcement that they rebuffed the machine and I think that did work but they didn't do this on the outward journey. The food was ok although I am not a fan of airline food and would of preferred a salad or a sandwich. These days it is hard for crew with food requirements there were a lot of different diets and it was not made easy when the passengers moved seats but they handled it very well. I would definitely travel with this airline again. My seats were fine I had leg room. Yes it is no frills but not everyone can afford luxury travel and also don't always rely on bad reviews.

Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline. Check-in was quick but with no smiles. Even one of the staff at the gate was almost rude about the darkened spectacles I have to wear. On board one of the cabin attendants shrugged her shoulders when I asked for a blanket their was only a pillow on my seat and she was chewing gum whilst handing out breakfast. At least I did get a blanket after asking one of the other crew members. No hot or cold towels only one drink at a time show how this airline skimps on the things others provide as a norm. The food is poor as well. My special meal was provided but it was tasteless.

No real place to put it with the exception that it came with a cover and you could sort of hang it from the seat back in front of you where in other airlines the entertainment was supposed to go. Two problems with this. 1) the earphone cable has to stretch over the tray and if you're using that for a drink or food the risk of knocking something off of that with the earphone cable rises sharply and of more concern 2) if the plane hits some unexpected turbulence all of a sudden you've got iPads flying everywhere - at least far more than you would on an AC flt.

I fly Business Class to have a very large seat and a lot more leg room. It gives me a lot more room to work. This particular trip I flew AC using Aeroplan Airmiles. Get on the plane boarded to find out I am on an Air Canada Rouge Flight- in a class called Premium Class same size seat as an Economy Class seat. They block the middle seat with pillows belted in. The flight attendant assured me that even though the seat was a normal size seat that their service would be the same as Business Class. When I returned to Toronto I posted on Air Canada Rouge's Face Book page my disappointment. The replies for AC Rouge FB staff made all kinds of excuses. The end result after 10 messages back and forth they tell you send a letter to AC's Customer Relations. Customer after customer make the same negative comments. AC Rouge remove negative comment for the FB page and then block you from posting any more. Air Canada 'Rouge tells the customers to message Air Canada. Air Canada tell customers to contact Aeroplan. Aeroplan tells to it not their problem. Its on made vicious circle tying to get your problem solved.

air-europa,/airline-reviews/air-europa,Air Europa customer review,A Ross,United Kingdom,2015-02-11,LGW-MAD-GRU - Having done this journey direct from the UK I was dubious about the change in Madrid and sceptical about the £2k less difference in the BA price. Check was a bit gruff at Gatwick with the handling agents doing their best to ignore customers while discussing their weekend plans and gossiping about a poor member of staff who had just gone of shift . However the Lounges at Gatwick and Madrid were not as good as the Heathrow Terraces but much better than the rude and over booked facilities of the JFK Terraces. I felt the weak link here was the lounge in Sao Paulo on the way back which reminded me of a provincial airport with basic service and low quality decor. Air Europa may wish to consider changing this. The first thing that strikes you about this airline is the service and the pristine staff who respond to you every need as if their life depended on it  nothing was too much trouble. Dinner service was on a par with old BA first class with leather menus and five courses although the food was on a par with lesser Club World. The seat - was not a lie flat bed but very similar to Club World London City although the Air Europa Corporate colours are a bit garish for my taste. There were plenty of films to watch and an I pad if you ran out the regular on demand service. There was a the obligatory amenity kit comforter blanket and pillows at bed time. I cannot understand why the cabin was half empty!

The food was good enough even though a bit spicy but better than what was on American Airlines. The crew were also polite. Overall experience was pretty good.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,J Miles,United States,2014-12-22,LAX-CDG. After reading so many bad reviews for the AF Premium Economy product I was eager to try it out for myself. If you are like me the thing you hate most about economy is having the person in front of you recline all the way in your lap for the duration of an 11 hour flight. So with that said having shell style seats is very exciting even if they don't recline in the traditional sense. Upon entering the A380 PE economy cabin I could tell right away I would enjoy the experience. The dedicated cabin is small and cozy and the seat itself has tons of room compared to any economy seat. Do not listen to the reviews on here that say the seats are cramped because it's just not true. I have long gangley legs and I could stretch them all the way out to the foot rest under the seat in front of me. It's basically a mini business class seat and compared to other premium economy products out there that cost twice as much (Virgin Atlantic) it is well worth the price of admission. I feel like a lot of the negativity comes from people who expect business class for the extra money they are paying even though it's a quarter of the price. The food is nothing special and I agree that the bottom portion of the seat could use some extra padding. Service was great and the stewards came immediately after pushing the call button. As for the non traditional recline of the seat I found it more comfortable then the normal seat back legs sitting position of economy. The trick is to make sure you extend the calf rest and foot rest so your body is being supported in the diagonal position. Again I feel like other fliers are either use to their economy habitat and or expect lay flat seats that they didn't pay for. As I said before not having the person in front of you laying in your lap the entire flight is heaven on earth which is still a problem on many PE products. Please take it from me a rational realistic aviation aficionado. I speak the truth in all my reviews and would not hesitate to let you know my dissatisfaction if there were any.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,4,5,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

Short hop from Newcastle on time - nice breakfast served and CityJet crew couldn't have been nicer. We'd been warned about transit at CDG with most saying that 90 mins 'wasn't nearly enough' to make the connection. Arrived and left out of 2E which is clean and modern with easy signage. The flight connections centre has lots of screens detailing the departure gate of your next flight. With Sky Priority everything we were through security in 3 minutes and in the lounge at 2E within 20 mins of landing (you don't need to clear passport control as UK is outside Shengen anyway). Lounge at CDG nice although slight absence of food but we weren't hungry as had just been fed. Boarding onto Airbus A340 with Sky Priority was pain free. Welcomed on board by charming and good- humoured crew. Despite the age of these aircraft the cabin looked and felt new. The seats were very comfortable and nearly full flat - just off 180 degrees horizontal. I'm 6ft and had no issues getting a great 4 hours sleep. Food-wise we were welcomed with champagne and juice. Shortly after our on-time take off menus were brought round. The amuse-bouche followed (more champagne) cold salmon starter choice for 4 mains cheese desserts and digestifs. A buffet was set up at the rear of the cabin and crew were on hand if you needed anything. There was an Express option of meals if you wanted it. The only minor gripe I had was that there are only 2 toilets in business class cabin. In Bogota bags off in 10 minutes. Return trip much the same - Air France uses the LAN lounge which was excellent. Crew couldn't have been better and inflight services were all excellent. The IFE doesn't have the range of Emirates but had enough recent films/TV to keep me going. I prefer the personalised service at AF over robotic EK crew. While I can get by in basic French (which was appreciated by staff) my travel partner was English speaking and was treated equally well. I'd recommend AF business to anyone for a long haul trip and CDG was a dream to transit through (although may be a different story in economy).,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Same crew were excellent on both legs and The UK Station Manager rang us on arrival at Heathrow to let us know one of our daughters had left their watch on the plane which was quickly retrieved and returned to us. Baggage arrival at LHR was surprisingly fast too. The Etihad lounge at LHR T4 remains Air Malta's trump card out of UK and on both legs we were not asked to weigh our hand luggage (as per last trip). A cynic might argue that having the Air Malta CEO onboard on the return flight may have helped matters but none the less the crew was attentive and the food more than bearable.

air-malta,/airline-reviews/air-malta,Air Malta customer review,Richard Brown,Malta,2013-12-16,"Malta - LHR- Malta. Having had some very good trips with Air Malta recently this last trip showed a marked fall in standards. On outbound flight from Malta hand luggage was weighed (first time this has happened in business class) apparently due to ""a change in procedures"". My ten year old daughters were asked their age in the La Vallette lounge despite having business class tickets and there was little room for luggage by the time we boarded the plane. Breakfast on board was a sad affair with the nasty frankfurter sausage having made an unwelcome return. The Crew however were fine. The return flight out of LHR was less joyous. We were treated to an unintentional and lengthy display of origami by the check-in agent writing folding our lounge invitations (Why cannot the boarding passes simply be used for lounge access?) and a whole wad of questions about my wife's visa which is perfectly valid. Thank goodness for the Etihad lounge - a truly professional and quality experience but the joy ended there. The flight was full and service was very slow with dinner not being served until we were well over Nice. When it came the chicken was tough and overcooked and the dessert was unrecognizable either by looks or by taste. The stewardess was stretched whilst the purser sat behind the curtain doing absolutely nothing until late into the flight. Wine and Champagne were all served in tumblers (a pet hate) and the seats themselves are very uncomfortable for a flight where most passengers want to sleep. Priority luggage on Air Malta is also a joke when it comes off with all the other luggage. This is not unique to Air Malta but on a recent Emirates flight it really worked properly.

I have enjoyed Air France for several reasons the past few years on these long-hauls and this flight was no different. They are on time reliable and the food is good. Their premium economy seat and benefits suits my space requirements though as many have said the seat bottoms are very hard and there is no recline. If you're awake the entire flight no problem but don't think of sleeping. I upgraded for an extra fee on the return. The seat is much more comfortable and softer but it is not a flat bed and doesn't allow for sleep. The food was even more creative and delicious up in business but the mid-flight ""buffet"" is paltry. Flight attendants are usually very polite and efficient and I've never had a problem with language. One small complaint I experienced this trip was that they tend to cater to and make over the French nationals while being slightly perfunctory with non-French passengers. This is a mixed review but really the flights are smooth food good connection easy at CDG and I am booked on two more premium economy flights from Japan to Europe this winter. One last comment the flights and seats on long haul flights in premium economy are unique. The intra-Europe flights are always a let down in terms of seats. They are the same exact seats as economy.

The rest of my family were seated in row 21 and myself in a middle seat in row 17.

To make matters worse my pre-assigned seat (17E) was occupied by someone else who was reluctant to move despite being in the wrong seat. The saving grace was that the flight was short and punctual.

So I had 3.5 hours cramped in a really uncomfortable seat. The cabin crew were even less friendly.

Seat comfort is not good. Food service very basic and no service for first 90 minutes due to turbulence.

I handed in my luggage at the international terminal in Mumbai but this was not on the flight. After numerous telephone calls the luggage arrived on 26. Flight from Delhi to Chandigarh took off despite the pilot telling us there would be little chance of the fog clearing which meant that we circled above Chandigarh 4 times before returning to Delhi. Chaos on arrival and were it not for 2 helpful passengers things could have been a nightmare as no onward transport had been planned. It eventually left in the form of a coach 2-3 hrs later.

When dinner was served; my choice of chicken was quite good while my husbands choice of risotto was not good at all. Flight departed at 1.50 pm the lights were dimmed after dinner to enable passengers to get some rest. Attendants came through 3 or 4 times offering snacks and ice cream as well as additional drinks. The entertainment options were exactly the same offered on our previous flight. Once again we did not need the blankets so we sat on them which compensated for the hardness of the seats. My only complaint is the handling of our luggage. One of the advertised benefits of booking and paying for premium economy is to have your bags tagged priority’ which is supposed to insure prompt delivering upon arrival. As I stated our flight was an hour late departing therefore we only had 45 minutes to make our connection in Minnesota. We were traveling with friends who did not opt for premium economy. We both checked in at the same time. Upon arriving in Minnesota our bags which were tagged priority were definitely not delivered in a timely manner. In fact many non priority bags arrived long before ours; including those belonging to our friends to flew economy.

Inflight entertainment - seat-back screens worked intermittently and the neighbouring seat had buttons missing from the controller. Choice of non-Indian movies very limited anyway. Plane held at the gate for about an hour after 21.30 scheduled departure and no attempt made to serve drinks. Drinks eventually served 2 hrs 40mins into the flight. No wine with the meal. Chicken curry was excessively greasy. Breakfast coming into DEL was also poor. Indian airports offer tediously repetitive security checks at different points and DEL-BKK was delayed 1 hr 20mins. After boarding we waited at the gate for another 40 mins whilst passengers from a delayed flight straggled on. The Airbus looked pretty tired but seats were more comfortable again not overly busy and service was somewhat better on this flight with water offered frequently. Drink service was limited again. Dinner was better quality than LHR and tasty but tiny portions were disappointing. They didn't seem to make up any time on this flight so although I'd allowed 3 hrs for my transfer to domestic in BKK I missed my connection.

Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles.

The food was plentiful and very nice quality: a salad starter with fresh bread and NZ olive oil a warm meal; dessert cheese and biscuits and good NZ wines. Breakfast and afternoon tea were also excellent with e.g. warm scones clotted cream and jam. The food was better than BA's Club World. The seat provides lots of space and the entertainment system is stocked with films I missed at the cinema so enjoyed catching up with on the plane. The seat doesn't recline that much but there's a bean bag a big pillow and a nice thoughtful amenity kit. There were other fun touches too like a photo of shelves of books with jokey titles on the walls in the toilet. On the way out the luggage belts at Heathrow were broken so most bags did not make it to the plane. Air NZ handled this efficiently on the plane and with minimal fuss in LA we were handed US$100 in cash.

air-tahiti-nui,/airline-reviews/air-tahiti-nui,Air Tahiti Nui customer review,L Nelson,United States,2015-04-20,We flew on April 7 and 14 back and forth to Papeete. While the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights. A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea.

Flying business class on AA with a code share. They are having some dispute with AA so AA and Air Tahiti are refusing to let each other's business class passengers into their lounges but they don't tell you until you get to the lounge. With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldn't let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over. Apparently they used to let people phone in the credit card number to avoid having to exit security but now they have decided they rather make passengers spend over an hour at their desk/security.

The cabin temperature was very cool and we were advised by staff that this was ongoing problem with this particular aircraft. The food quality was at best average comparable to budget airlines servicing Europe. That said the selection of wines offered is very good.

Did not get upgraded yet when I went to Air Asia's website there were several premium flatbed seats available for sale after I was denied an upgrade. Was offered an upgrade at the airport for $299 which I took. Why would they promote Optiontown and get us to sign up and pay not allow the upgrade when there are seats available and then sell the upgrades at the airport? Highly unethical business practice. 2.

The transfer desk had no capability to do this - they instructed me to exit immigration and go to ticket counter or use business centre at airport hotel in terminal. I chose the latter paid $3 for the privilege. This is unacceptable This was after checking in online and having the barcode sent to my phone which Air Asia said was not acceptable.

airbaltic,/airline-reviews/airbaltic,airBaltic customer review,W Wynants,Belgium,2015-01-14,I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,0,0,NA,NA,2,0

On board staff are generally helpful. Customer Service could be better especially at check in in Riga - often long queues that merge into one - airport check in area is rather small and often the queue is out of the door so it pays to arrive earlier. Airport airside is pretty good now with the addition of new shops. I generally travel the London/Riga/London route which is nearly always full. Tend to be expensive at times - out of season usually the better deal. At least assigned seats - unlike the free for all on Ryanair in which case if you are not Latvian or Russian you will not win because they are queuing for plane 30 mins before boarding starts - look out for the passengers who stand up immediately the wheels touch the runway preparing to get off - it always amuses me.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

This was my first experience of flying with a low cost airline and it was better than I expected. I did purchase the Optiontown option for an upgrade to Premium Flatbed on both sectors SYD-KUL-SYD. I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to Premium Flatbed on the Sydney to Kuala Lumpur leg but missed out on the return. Food was fine and as ordered but I did find the entertainment tablet a bit of a waste but we learn. My criticism of the airline had to be with the ground staff and handling of passengers. The check-in at Penang could only be described as chaotic. I arrived early and decided to check in at one of the six open check-in counters. I was approached by a ground staff and asked when my flight was and was told I was too early and to come back in 1/2 hour. I did that and then stood in the queue for 1 hour and 10 minutes to check in. Every so often they would put up flight details for a specific counter but people would not move to lose their place in the queue. At the LCCT in Kuala Lumpur which would have to be one of the worst passenger terminals I have ever been in I was trying to find out about buying an upgrade to Premium Flatbed. I approached a AirAsiaX ground staff member she had no idea. She asked another staff member and I was told to stand in the queue for Sales. I did this and after nearly 25 minutes I was directed to the Premium Check in Counter. They were helpful but told me that no seats were available - the last seats had been sold about 1 minute before.

Although the shared lounge was very ordinary. No fault of AirAsia. When flight was called we were again escorted through departure gate into private mini-bus to the plane. The rest of the queuing passengers seemed aghast to our VIP treatment but well worth ever cent. In fact the cost is minimal. On board meals were OK but limited breakfast are ordered Hotcakes.

My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Rohit Thukral,United States,2013-10-25,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown.

On landing at Anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt (squeal on the brakes hard stop) then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around. ANC-SEA-MCI late flight out of ANC substituted a smaller plane which put us in a non-recline seat. All in all we have been satisfied with Alaska and will continue to use them as these are somewhat minor issues and tend to be found on all airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip). If you consider all this the price is not too different from what you can get on regular airlines and this will be my choice next time.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,5,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

The agents were friendly but they were completely oblivious to what a Schengen Visa meant. Anyway once on board everything was fine. Brand new A330 with comfortable seats. Recline and legroom was decent although it did feel very tight once the person in front of me reclined. Entertainment options was decent and they had some recent movies as part of their selection. My only complaint is that the screen was extremely unresponsive. Food was average ordered the Seafood Meal and it was delicious. The pre-arrival snack was a disappointment it was literally the same tuna salad served as the side during dinner but slapped between sliced bread. Crew was professional and efficient but were not warm or friendly. Only complaint in terms of service is the lack of beverage runs during the flight. They seem to be too worried resting in their crew rests area (at the back of the plane) and even turned off my service call without asking me if I needed anything. Appalling.

This is the second time I have flown with the airline. I travelled on a newly refurb plan. I travelled with my family and we had a baby and paid additional money for the bassinet seat at the front. I really can't say one nice thing about this flight. The lighting is awful fluorescent mood lighting which appear not to work and was directly over the bassinet no method to dim. Seat arms are solid and could not be lifted up (unique to the front row middle) which is crazy. In addition all the galleys have been removed so there is one at the front and back with just row after row of seats. I fly a lot long haul and typically you have some space to stretch your legs or stand around. Not with this config. Food - rubber pasta with cheese sauce - this was not even edible.

So travelled from Florence to Bucharest via Rome on 31 July 2014. It is a 1.5hr flight that was delayed by about 30-45 minutes but there was no acknowledgement or announcement of the delay. Transiting through Rome itself is a case study in how not to organise an airport for transit and boarding the flight was a nightmare. No priority for families or business no possibility to upgrade to business with miles from the alliance even though the business class was completely empty (meaning not one seat was taken). On the flight itself food was very poor and the cabin staff just disappeared. There were no sick bags in the seats and the staff did not answer the call button at all - too busy chatting in the empty business class - and then spent 10 minutes looking for sick bags. Also no announcement for landing or beginning of landing. In fact no pilot communication whatsoever after taking off. And as we got to our destination in Bucharest our checked in bag was lost and apparently many other people on the flight who transited via Rome had the same problem so long queue at the Claim section.

I tried to contact Air Transat whilst in Canada but could only get a recorded message telling me that I should have requested this through a travel agent at the time of booking which I had done.

The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane.

Seats are not as comfortable as a United or larger carrier, they don't recline and they aren't as cushy. But the upside is that my flight was a direct flight and the price was super low.

The passengers were allowed to return to the gate and await the problem's resolution a two-hour delay on a one-hour flight. Although the crew thanked us for our ""incredible patience"" no compensation of any kind was offered! Upon arrival in Portland I sought out a gate agent requesting compensation.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,William Gustin,United States,2015-07-17,"Flight from Boston to O'Hare, fair to good. Basic experience. AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation.

Flagship Lounge great with plenty of breakfast options and an extensive beverage selection. The lounge was not crowded. Seating was comfortable and WiFi was fast.

Power ports, USB plugs, remote control and a bunch of other features located by your seat. Seat was private, minor complaint would be the firmness, wish there were a lot more soft like the ones they have on the Boeing 767-300s. TV screens were huge, great interactive map with plenty of entertainment options. The purser was interactive and friendly, although they lack some finesse. She dropped my appetizer on the floor and constantly spilled liquid on my tray table.  Food in abundance, they also introduced a new menu that I got to try out. Appetizer, main and dessert were all good quality, although nothing memorable. Salad was extremely disappointing. It tasted and looked like leftovers from a prepackaged bag of salad and the dressing was oily.

The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day.

The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines.

Service onboard very professional with an excellent hot snack (omelette and salmon) for a duration of 2.5h. Transfer at Rome Fiumicino painless using fast track lane and the airport has lots of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia Giotto lounge was packed but the drinks selection was fine as well as the variety of sandwiches. Boarding A330 to Rio quick using Sky Priority lane. The aircraft had the new Magnifica Class with a 1-2-1 configuration. It was half full. Plenty of space in overhead lockers however if you seat in the middle there are none and have to use the ones on the side. Pre-taking off drinks given great selection of appetizers and the best moment was the food. Alitalia won best Airline Food recently and I was very much looking forward to it. Succulent Beef with Roasted Mediterranean vegetables as main course and for dessert a light unctuous Neapolitan Almond Cake. A 5 stars food and the espresso is served in a very beautiful cup and lid. The IFE had a good variety of recent movies but I thought the international selection was lacking. They have Flat beds (Only Skyteam airline in Europe to have these) and managed a good 7h sleep with a very comfortable duvet. The amenities given were a Bulgari bag with lots of toiletries products very much appreciated and high class. Staff very professional smiling and very happy to go for the extra mile for the customers. Breakfast consisted of a selection of Italian pastries and cakes with fresh fruits excellent! On the return leg Alitalia uses Air France/KLM lounge that can be cramped at times but it has great selection of hot snacks (the palm tree heart quiches are gorgeous). Boarding the A330 was painless again and the Magnifica class was full this time. Despite taking off 1h later we managed to catch up 30 minutes. The amenities given was another Bulgari bag and the best highlight was the food again with Pork Milanese as main course. Slept a good 7hours and had a copious breakfast before landing in Rome. The A321 to London was on time and service very good again. Overall a good value for money their new Magnifica class is an excellent product their Flat beds very comfortable and it's the Best Food I've ever had on an airline.

On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions.

I went through security as usual and then proceeded to the gate written on the boarding pass. At the gate there were very few people there and I saw no Allegiant advertising. I asked someone who worked at the airport and she said yes you have the right gate. Since ever all flights were being delayed due to bad weather in the area I thought mine had been as well. About 10 minutes after the flight was to take off I saw one of the Allegiant employees who had been checking people in when I arrived. I asked if the flight had been delayed. She told me no I had missed my flight. I showed her my boarding pass with the hand written gate number on it.

Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling. On the same holiday I was on a delayed Delta flight from Atlanta to Boston and the difference between staff was unbelievable was even given a free beer and sincere apology for the delay and more importantly was kept informed and the crew were cheerful and happy.

I had to stow my bag because I had a shopping bag. When I offered to collapse the bag and place it under the seat I was told that I could not carry both onto the plane. Once we boarded the plane we were kept on the ground for 3 hours without water and/or food for those of us unlucky enough to not have brought our own on board. When I asked an attendant if I could have a bottle of water I was told that no service could be provided and to be patient that we would be departing soon (this was about two hours before our flight took off). When the flight eventually took off we were offered options for snacks when I requested my option I was told that they had run out. Why offer an option at all? When the drink cart eventually made its way to me I asked for a coke and was given 1/2 a coke served for me in a cup. When I asked for a second one I was told that they had limited quantities.

Legroom was sufficient and flight attendants managed to a conduct a beverage service on a full flight despite a flight time of only 39 minutes. Connection at DFW was seamless. Flight to LGA on a 737-800 had the seat next to me empty which provided a more comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very young which was surprising.

Their professionalism is excellent and each interaction was followed by a bow and a thank you even though they are the one doing you a favor. However the IFE seat comfort and food was average. 77W was configured as 3x4x3 however legroom was still excellent. IFE was disappointing and the choices of movies were just poor.

In fact one of the cabin crews told me that they had received many complaints on the Back-Fixed seat from passengers. The cabin crews on both flights were very friendly and helpful.

I am not a particularly tall person. The flight to JFK did have lie flat seats but I found them to be quite narrow and felt more comfortable sleeping at a slightly angled upright position. Food on both segments was OK and typical of business class fare found on other airlines. What sets ANA apart from other airlines is their onboard staff. Simply put their staff has to be the warmest and friendliest I have encountered on any other flights that I have taken. Everything was done with a smile.

ana-all-nippon-airways,/airline-reviews/ana-all-nippon-airways,ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,M Finch,Japan,2013-05-04,San Francisco to Tokyo in economy class. This was the first time my wife and I have flown an international flight with ANA. From the moment we checked in everyone was extremely polite professional and even smiled. A smile goes a long way. The aircraft was clean and had the hard shell seats that slide forward instead of reclining. This took some getting used to but I managed since I didn't have anything under the seat in front of me. I don't think large people will like this style of seat. The benefit is not having the seat in front of you recline into your lap. The seat backs were higher and the top pf the seat did not taper to a head rest. The top of the seat back was the same width as the rest of the seat back. This allowed for a much larger video screen. I usually need to wear my reading glasses to watch movies but not this time! They also had room to put the remote next to the screen. Nobody hitting the seat back behind me like those touch screens and no remote in the arm rest taking up space. I also liked the foot rest. It gave me another option when adjusting to get comfortable. The differences with this aircraft did not stop there. The lavatory had automatic faucets. No need to push down and hope the water would last long enough to wash your hands. There was a beverage holder on the back of the tray table so you didn't need to pull down the tray table for only a drink. Then when you did pull down the tray table for your food there was another beverage holder in the seat back so you had more room on your tray. The main dinner course was excellent. By far the best airline food my wife and I have had in economy. Then another cart came by with miso soup. As if that wasn't enough an FA came by with Haggendaz ice cream for dessert. Throughout the flight beverage carts were making their rounds offering the soft drinks juices wine and beer. FAs walking around offering three different types of hot tea and another one offering coffee. We were rarely interrupted with those annoying long announcements in English and Japanese throughout the flight. When the seatbelt light came on no announcement. Instead FAs walked the aisles to ensure everyone was wearing their seatbelt. When dinner was served FAs carried a menu to show you what was being offered. All of the small details made a huge difference from our experiences with United and Delta. This flight was part of a trip which included flights with United.

For the first leg of this trip the plane was operated by IBEX and arrived on schedule. I have bad knees so I need assistance. It was offered each time. Plane to Frankfurt was a 777-300 and the flight attendant greeted me by my seat number: 24C. Service was excellent and the AVOD superb. Food was reasonable. For the changeover I had a courier who took me straight through passport control to the gate. Without this assistance I would not have made the connection. Flight to Amsterdam operated by Lufthansa and the difference was rather obvious. Nevertheless food and drink were served on the 50-minute flight. On the return trip the Lufthansa flight to Munich took off late and I was concerned about the connection. I was taken to the ANA plane by car and made the connection without difficulty. Departure delayed 2 hours however while the plane was de-iced and it was here that the superb ANA service was slightly lacking: given relatively little information. After takeoff the flight was good but again I was not told about the arrangements for assistance at Narita. 777-300 arrived well behind schedule and I missed the connection to Hiroshima. I was given a bus ticket to Haneda hotel accommodation next to Terminal 2 and had been booked on the first flight to Hiroshima the following day.

To Gran Canaria was a very pleasant flight we unexpectedly all had an own personal entertainment screen in the headrest and on our return journey too. Therefore we expected to have them on our 11 hour long intercontinental flight to Mombasa but surprisingly we did not real letdown. Our seats (row 15 before the emergency exits) were said to have 'limited reclining capability' but they did in fact not move one inch at all on the journey there they did recline a bit on our red-eye back. We flew comfort class which is really worth the additional charge (15EUR per person per flight). The 8 centimetres extra are the difference between sleeping fairly comfortably or cramped and the night comfort kit really helped me get some rest. Out of the 4 flights 1 was delayed but it was only a little over an hour and they caught up a with quite a few of the lost minutes.

Transfers were one of the easiest we've experienced especially on the return flights.

This gave us more time to relax in the lounge. Onboard experience was fantastic. Three out of the four legs had excellent flat beds and only the Sydney to Seoul leg had angled seats which were great for a day flight but I'd question its comfort overnight.

The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800.

I see Austrian Airlines is taking its cue from the lacklustre North American airlines.

avianca,/airline-reviews/avianca,Avianca customer review,S Stewart,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,Flights AV121 from LHR-BOG and AV120 from BOG-LHR. We booked these overnight flights to make the most of our limited time in Colombia. However our outbound flight was delayed due to a technical fault and we were kept waiting at the gate until about 11.30pm when they finally decided that we wouldn't be leaving that night. The arrangements weren't very well communicated and we ended up standing outside the airport in the freezing cold waiting for buses to take us to the provided overnight hotel. We were also unable to retrieve our hold luggage (perhaps because the airport had mostly shut down by then) so had to manage with just what we had in our carry on luggage. We were initially told that the flight would leave at 12pm the next day but eventually it left at about 5pm - a delay of almost 19 hours. We were put on a replacement plane which was very new and reasonably comfortable (although our pre-booked seats were not honoured so we ended up on the back row of the cabin near the toilets). The main meal was pretty tasty actually and the cabin crew were reasonable polite. However once the meal service was over there was no sign of any cabin crew until breakfast the next day. On long haul flights with other airlines the cabin crew come through every so often with glasses of water or fruit juice to help keep hydrated so it was disappointing not to have that simple touch on this flight. The breakfast did include cereal with yoghurt though which I did like! Our return flight left on time thankfully and was back on the usual Star Alliance branded plane which didn't feel quite as new and shiny as the one we'd flown out on. Shortly after takeoff we entered some turbulence which lasted about 30 minutes - it would have been nice if the pilot had communicated this with us before take off like other airlines often do. There was in fact very little communication from the pilot (in Spanish or English). The inflight entertainment was reasonable but with only a limited selection of films. We landed back at LHR about an hour early but then had to wait because there was a technical problem getting our bags off the plane. All in all I was hopeful that this overnight service would be a useful way to get to Colombia but next time I think we'll fly indirect on a different airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,2,4,3,NA,NA,3,0

Economy class. Friendly check-in and boarding gate ground handling staff at LCA. LCA to VIE on A321. Airbridge available. Nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. Clear announcements on aircraft. On time departure from LCA. VIE to LHR on A320. Airbridge available. Departure delayed about 20 mins due to earlier weather issues at LHR. Friendly boarding gate staff. Aircraft nice and clean. Cabin crew friendly. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. Clear announcements. On both sectors seating is typical Airbus economy poorly padded utilitarian seating. Adequate leg room for a 176cm height person. IFE on both sectors was typically advertising the highlights of a visit to Austria combined with cartoons for the kids and a great deal of promotion for Red Bull! The only disappointment was the catering: on the LCA-VIE sector just about edible small (and I mean small) meal + drinks. On the VIE-LHR sector only a tiny bag of pretzels + drinks.

Onboard everything was great. Flight attendants were nice and helpful. The toilets were clean and usable. Seat (1K) was comfortable enough but they should definitely have the option to lie flat for longer flights. Gave us amenity kits which contained L'Occitane products. One of the biggest selling points for Avianca is their Inflight Entertainment System. Served breakfast shortly after take off and it was rather good but afterwards flight attendants disappeared until one hour before landing.

Seating very comfortable on domestic legs but tight on international flights. Competing with Iberia probably keeps standards low on flights out of Madrid.

You come off the DLR down to the check in desk. Because we were flying Club Europe we were able to the use the dedicated check in desk so that was quick. Security was very quick and friendly. They seem to have even more security zones than my last trip. No lounges at LCY. Boarding was on time but no priority for CE pax or OW elites. However given as they board from the back and front of the plane it didn't mater. On board the 2 crew worked hard delivering the breakfast meals out to a full plane load. Nice product but the eggs were are bit crumbly. Arrived on time but bags took a while to come out with no priority. Return journey from BCN was good. Check in a breeze. Sala Miro lounge to wait in but being on the cusp of lunch there wasn't much in the way of fresh food about. Boarding was done by cabin/status. Not as full as before - 6 in CE only. Both meal options were salads ie fish or meat on rocket with some other little bits. Could have done with more leaves and some vegetables! Dessert was some cream concoction imitating an Eton mess. The crew were good and even offered their meal to a pax that didn't fancy the options. Bags at City came out in some order ie some priority bags then standard then a few more priority.

IFE excellent with programming on demand. First time going to TAS that we did not have to use a bus to get to the terminal. We had to gate check our stroller but at the Tashkent airport you need to pick it up at the baggage claim so we had to carry our baby until then which if you are familiar with the speed (or lack thereof) of the customs officials at TAS you know that it is not a small feat. The return was nice in business but even though we gate checked the stroller at TAS and told them we needed it at ICN they sent it through to the baggage claim. Luckily the ICN staff were wonderful and retrieved it for us quickly. Return was in the new Quadra business lie-flat seats which were comfortable for us but I can see how they might be too narrow for people with a larger build. Also strangely enough the business class bassinets are more narrow compared to the economy class ones. Nice amenity kit with L'Occitane products excellent food and service.

Since I first started flying with Bangkok Airways back in late 2011 their prices have increased considerably such that the cost of a return ticket Dhaka to Bangkok is only slightly less than Thai Airways but with no Business Class far worse flight times and crap on- board entertainment. Their so-called 'lounges in Bangkok and Phuket are also not worth bothering with.

Bangkok Airways are almost always good apart from their route to and from Samui. This flight is expensive and from Samui regularly late. We flew back USM to BKK on Songkran (thai new year). As few people were leaving the island Bangkok Airways cancelled a few planes. This was to bump us all onto less flights. Luckily I had no connection that day but the delay of 2hrs was annoying for the person picking us up. Bangkok Airways had a special deal to Chiang Mai and the flight was half full. The flight attendants were great and the flight was smooth. For locals and regulars to Samui Bangkok Airways are not liked on the island due to their high prices.

Online check-in did not work at the advertised time (48 hours). I called customer services and the rather indifferent phone operator casually told me it was always like that. Secondly passengers should be aware of their unusual baggage allowance. The checked plus carry-on can total 20 kg. Nevertheless carry-on weight was not checked at either LCY or JER. We arrived at City Airport and couldn't find the bag-drop desk - told to use the Luxair desk. Aircraft itself was showing its age and could do with a deep clean but was comfortable. One member of cabin crew for 50 passengers and each way they were cheerful and pleasant. On the outbound morning flight a croissant with butter and jam was offered with non-alcoholic drinks. On the return evening flight there was a full bar service (even champagne) but no snacks. Blue Islands passengers can use their dedicated lounge at JER. However its based at gate 7 which is at the far end of the airport and not air conditioned. Drinks biscuits and wi-fi were good.

Apparently this is routine at either Baku or Tbilisi on either or both legs as Iran will not provide a full fuel load in retaliation against EU sanctions against Iran.

In addition this flight carried passengers to Baku as the airline's earlier flight had been cancelled. A number of the passengers onboard complained some quite rudely to the cabin crew about this.

There is no customer service on this they palm you off to a third party insurer but the latter claim they haven't been sent the claim by bmi. So I have to follow up with bmi but discover you can't call bmi on such issues you have to write. Very strong feeling of being kicked into the long grass.

Checked-in at the machines for the 1540 flight to find an hour delay reported so I went to the bar. This hour delay was put back an hour every so often. After two hours I was quickly given a £5 voucher for use in Belfast City Airport and the delay eventually showed as 2000. Thankfully this is a boring but good value airport to be stuck in. During this time announcements were made for various passengers presumably to sort out connections or be moved to any spare seats on other BMI departures which were ongoing. Finally at 2000 we did get a plane and get away. The crew explained they were not themselves delayed as they should have been making a flight at this time anyway; fair enough but reasonable empathy with passengers delayed over 4.5 hours is not too much to expect. The delay was down to two technical faulty aircraft and the pilot made a pious speech about customers understanding that safety came first. The plane was ok in terms of comfort though not too clean. This is also one of the handful of routes on which nothing is served free - BMI should re-assess this and move back to the levels of most European full service airlines. Crew fairly ambivalent and didn't know how much the things they were selling cost. Overall an average flight experience with a well below average delay and I won't rush back.

Booked via Austrian Airlines to VIE as part of a trip to Macedonia. 6am departure meant an early arrival at Heathrow.

People in front had problems with excess overweight baggage children or groups trying to sit together. Eventually get to the desk and have my printed out boarding passes replaced with proper ones! Not much open at Heathrow and was worried about food onboard. At T1 the first shop you see open is a Costa and its likely to have a long queue. Walk deeper into the terminal and there is a Pret that was also open with no queue. Gate was miles away. Boarding was slightly later than anticipated but handled by rows. Comfortable seating onboard. Once airborne there is a drink run and food service - a hot egg cheese and tomato panini which would rank as one of the most tasteless meals I've had on an airline. Given that this was a 2 hr breakfast flight more could have been provided. I remember flying BMI from LHR to AMS and they served a full hot breakfast in 45m of flying time. Here there wasn't even a second drinks run. The crew seemed intent on clearing up before most people had even finished their breakfast! Crew were fairly robotic.

If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front. To convert these to Business Class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3.",A320,FamilyLeisure,Business Class,Helsinki to London,9,1,5,5,NA,5,NA,4,1

OK, so the plane may be rather old, but it was in immaculate condition and the cabin crew (older, mostly British) delivered efficient professional and friendly service. The lie flat bed (I took a rear facing window seat) is excellent for sleeping and gives great privacy. The food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and I was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows. I fly often with the middle eastern carriers who offer newer planes and a more luxury feel, however BA scored highly on crew, seat comfort and ease of sleeping.

Sandwiches were fresh and very nice. Plane as a 747 that had seen better times. The seat was clean but tired looking. The biggest let down was the screen that was blurry in comparison to the Bling Airways screen I had in economy. The main meal was really nice. Beef fillet that was tender and cooked. Side Salad full of flavour and Mediterranean starter that I wanted more of. The 2nd meal was ""afternoon tea"" of 3 finger sandwiches and a piece of chocolate rocky road.

Just enough seats. Nice snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was a big disappointment.

Check-in was interminable despite a Club Europe desk. There was a fast track option for security but this was roped off for our flight. No lounge was offered even though there are lounges available and used by other airlines. Not surprisingly there was no priority boarding.

I got an upgrade for the outbound flight which was a bonus. There were a few niggles on the outbound flight. Sound cancelling headphones but the sound quality was poor even at maximum volume. The reading light worked but was inadequate (probably because it was too far away). The cabin temperature was a little erratic and there were queues for the four toilets in economy (it could have been a problem if we had been flying through prolonged turbulence). But as I said these were just niggles - I enjoyed the upgrade and the flight. The return was delayed and the APU unserviceable (not uncommon with a 747). We had to wait for a second air starter unit (if it requires twos order them in advance) and it got rather stuffy whilst waiting. The pilot kept us informed of what was happening.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2015-05-31,Punta Cana - Gatwick. World Traveller Plus cabin on B777. I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny. In summary World Traveller Plus is probably just about worth it for the extra comfort and space but don't get your expectations too high in terms of food and drink and be prepared for inconsistent inflight service.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,2,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

Facilities at Bromma are quite desolate and overpriced though I don't suppose that's Brussels Airlines fault. However they probably have enough influence to put in some more chairs. Despite the fact that the terminal is essentially a re-purposed hangar it is in a great location and for that reason we were thankful that Brussels Airlines flew there instead of the more crowded and less convenient Arlanda Airport. Once we got on board we were somewhat surprised that the business class seats were identical in their physicality to those in the economy sections. However our fears that we had not gotten what we paid for were lifted once we discovered that the seats were quite comfortable and the legroom between the seat and the bulkhead (The Avro’s sole row of business class seats is the front-most row just behind the bulkhead) was more than adequate and the flight attendants were very attentive spoke decent English and served meals that were in their quality above the normality for short-haul flights. Hot washcloths were available at the beginning of the flight and later on upon request. No ""real"" IFE but newspapers in a variety of languages were given to the business class passengers as were various magazines some published by the airline some not. I read the New York Times and the Economist both of which were available in English. The airline also had a magazine in English French and German highlighting its various destinations.

Brussels airlines operates this route as a duopoly with SAS and it shows in the fares that are charged. My travel plans depended on the weather forecast in Denmark so I was only able to book 72 hours in advance. The cheaper of the two economy cabins had sold out on all 3 flights. The flexible ticket cost about 3 times the advertised minimum fare. Despite this I was charged 8 euros for paying with a credit card (none of my debit cards were accepted by the airline's web site). The ticket allowed fast track security although as this lane was merged into others there was no advantage. Extra cabin baggage was also allowed but as the ground staff did not enforce the cabin baggage policy this was again no advantage. The flight left 20 minutes late as the handling agent had not loaded the bags in time. The seat had no head rest and felt like it had almost no padding a bit like resting on a leather covered ironing board. There was no magazine in the seat pocket. The advertised free light meal/snack was a bread roll with two slices of cheese with terrible coffee served in a small paper cup. The stewardess even had the nerve to tell me to enjoy my meal as she handed me the bread roll.

As a BA Executive Club member I was able to use the Club bag drop where there was no queue. The Fast Track security staff were disorganised and patronising. The Gold/First lounge was busy and at times uncomfortably hot. Boarding from the C Gates was well organised. On taking my seat I was offered a water or orange juice. The 777-300 has the newish seats that were quite comfortable except for the headrest which does not have adjustable wings. The situation was helped by the fact that I had been able to select an emergency exit row aisle seat (22B). Departure was on time. Bar service was just before and with the meal. I had used the facility available on this route to pre-order my main course. Overall the meal was quite good. The Mixed Fleet staff commendably avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers of closing the window blinds after the meal service. The seat was a bit stiff in adjusting to a recline. The leg support cushions were useless as they did not move far enough to make contact with my legs. Time passed quickly as the entertainment system was very good.

A year ago you received a little tray with a salad a cold meal and hot bread rolls. Now it is down to a sandwich or a croissant depending on the time of day. European business class seemed to be down-graded too. In business you get now what you used to get in b.flex. Intercontinental flights in business class however were quite a different matter. On the way out to Banjul the plane was equipped with the new business-class seats. In one row the seating arrangement is 1-2-1 in the next 2-1-2. Beds are fully lie-flat beds now. Meals were of an excellent quality for airline food and flight attendants were attentive and constantly refilled your glasses. On the return to Brussels the cabin layout in business class was the old 2-2-2 seating so no lie-flat beds which was a pity as it was a night flight departing at 22.45 local time.

Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for.

Great crew. Food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise a few lettuce leaves and a chopped up tomato frankly don't bother. Flights pretty much on time. Both very busy. Breakfast on arrival in London was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran out of options after about half an hour. Some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes. The crew are the best part of BA as the seats and catering are not up to much. Check in was excellent at both ends.

We were 45 minutes late leaving due to weather (ice) at MXP and will give them credit for the updates. Of course all had connections and this created havoc on the plane with questions from many passengers. Will say the Purser handled this with dignity and answered all with a good attitude. Surprised at the amount and size of carry on baggage that was allowed. This was a smaller plane and noticed many oversized pieces that were not able to fit any where. Many people had piled their pieces on empty seats and left them there. Nothing said by crew. No inflight service at all in my section.

I had to queue at the Brussels Airlines desk for an hour to get a boarding card whilst the sole employee dealt very slowly with the 2 or 3 people in front of me.

These flights are operated by bmi aircraft and crews. All flights on time or a little early. Embraer aircraft are a fairly small but I like them particularly if they are not full (only one of these four flights was nearly full); they are light smooth and the leg room is fine for a short flight. My one complaint is the price one of my trips was economy (B.Light) and the other economy plus (B.Light+). Although the latter was over twice the price (and even economy is not particularly cheap) there was virtually no difference in the quality of service - a bit more food and that is it. I believe the hand luggage weight limit is a bit higher but if you check-in online nobody knows. So my advice is buy the cheapest ticket; though as previous commentators have said that is not always possible.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1

I used AVIOS points for these flights and had booked in World Traveller Plus. From the moment I boarded at LHR terminal 5. I was addressed by name throughout the flight. (I have a BA Executive Club Silver Card.) The cabin crew couldn't have been more friendly yet discreet. Offered a glass of champagne extra wine and post dinner drinks. I was given a very warm welcome. On the return from JFK I was surprised and pleased to have been given an upgrade to Club World in spite of travelling on a Reward Flight. This meant I was able to use the pre-flight supper in the JFK lounge which is so much better than eating during the flight so I was able to maximise sleep.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,S Jones,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,Flew from LAX-LHR on BA's new A380. The crew are rightfully proud of their new aircraft and could not stop telling the passengers about its status. My seat was picked as 53K Upper Deck. I couldn't believe how cramped it was for this long journey. The divider partition was covered in red wine stains from a previous trip and staff seemed nonchalant about cleanliness. The available width of BA's offering is a big disappointment. Whilst those socially awkward individuals might enjoy the clandestine surroundings I for one do not favour the casket-feel of Club World. The A380 and 787 were a chance to hone the business class offering after much criticism. Execution of the flight was prompt and we pushed back on schedule. I fly a lot for work and am privileged to enjoy the premium cabins but poor attention to detail and very slow service don't inspire a return to a specific carrier. One alcoholic drink was offered just after take off and then the all too familiar menu was wheeled out. BA's menu for this flight was identical to a return LHR-MIA-LHR leg I took back in early December. Lacklustre choices and the infamous warm chicken breast salad. Maybe I was tired and didn't endear myself but it needs to be better. I recently flew the A380 with AF to LAX in Business and that was a role reversal! No limp and greasy bacon sandwich on AF either. LAX Teminal B a massive improvement over the years. From fast immigration to pleasant design it's the leader in aspiring all US airports to improve their standards and get rid of carpet underfoot!

The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min.

Return on BA56 on 29th Jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you.

On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat.

I flew them BFS-SOF-BFS in February and it was the most horrible flight I have ever been on. The space between the seats is nothing and I sat the 3+ hour flight with my knees jammed to the seat in front. The flight attendants were rude and kept obsessing over the stupid curtain between business and economy (there was no difference on this flight as it was a charter) and only did half the safety briefing on the outbound. The heat on the plane was unbearable and any time you asked for a drink of water the flight attendants would acknowledge your request but made no effort at all to fulfil it. Another person in my group went to the galley himself to get a drink after having asked the flight attendants several times. The flight attendants could barely crack a smile and they only time they spoke was to give an unenthusiastic hello as we were boarding or to stand in the aisle and wave their hands about while complaining about the amount of children in the aisle. The plane had no Bulgaria Air titles on it or anything to suggest that it was the country's national airline.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,S Morley,United States,2015-01-19,Washington (IAD) to Heathrow on Christmas Day returning January 5th. I find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA especially considering what they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it was Christmas Day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and I along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. The same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. Again the other airline lounges were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (I was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747. It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. BA seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the Asian carriers. The crew were very good - friendly and attentive. Breakfast before we landed was very average. The bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. Yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which I went for. Check in for the return journey was lamentable at Heathrow Terminal 5. Dedicated Club World positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. Not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending Avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,2,4,4,4,NA,NA,3,1

On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Check in and boarding were extremely smooth at Manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. When it came time to board the aircraft it was quite frankly carnage. There didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for Club passengers. The downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft I now find. Seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13A and 13B) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line. The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for Club World tickets.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,2,4,5,NA,NA,3,1

Food actually very good including a main course salad with 'warmed salmon' which was as good as in any restaurant. Slow disembarkation at JNB.

I understand that flight operators have to partner with other agencies but you would expect then that they would adhere to standards expected of the original operator. Standards were very poor. No inflight entertainment on a 12 and 13 hour flight. Poor food and on the last leg of the journey we were even expected to pay for our food. What is this a budget airline at full blown prices?

I have had more polite service at Macdonalds than at the desk in the Galleries. There was nothing business class or tranquil about the space. The spa was a fully booked with no appointments for two hours and ""the sorry we can't be of service today"" was more than disappointing especially given the £6K ticket price and the message was delivered with such insincerity. How can BA get it so right offering 1st Class service in London Miami Boston Seattle Hong Kong and Sydney (to name a few) and offer budget airline service with a mediocre selection of sandwiches in JFK. Boarding was a mess. They were boarding a Qantas flight at the adjacent gate and all the passengers got mixed up. We asked a BA member of ground staff where to queue and she said she did not know and it had nothing to do with her! First and Business class passengers were directed down a cul-de-sac marked fast track which came to a dead end in a sea of passengers and eventually all the premium passengers joined the line behind the economy passengers and boarded last. We ask ""why"" as the lady gave us back our boarding cards and she said ""nothing to do with me"".

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,John Frewen-Lord,United Kingdom,2014-07-06,Flew from LHR to YYZ on 23 June on new 787. Not impressed. Very bumpy taxiing. Smooth inflight but I couldn't really notice the extra cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to be so wonderful. I was seated in a window seat. Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since I paid £30 extra to choose my seat! Cabin crew friendly and efficient though why they didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it I don't know - safety issue if nothing else.

Return a different matter unable to check in online and no self service machines at Jersey Flybe have at least six. Check in opened over half an hour after stated time when a sullen agent appeared eating an apple and carrying a newspaper. She then managed to seat by wife and I in middle seats in different rows.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,C Denson,United Kingdom,2014-06-30,London LHR to Hong Kong on 27 May. Was really looking forward to flying in the new A380 but for some reason the plane was swapped on the day for a B777. Flight left about 25 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early into HK. On boarding I agreed to swap seats with a woman who had been seated separately from her husband. Having ordered a vegetarian meal I let one of the cabin crew know that I'd swapped seats. When the meal was served I got told off very rudely by one of the cabin crew for moving seats without telling them - even though I had. Before I could explain my meal was dumped in my lap and he flounced off. Food was ok. Cabin crew smiles were forced. Serve the meal turn out the lights and disappear for 9 hours seemed to be the order of the day. No way was World Traveller Plus worth the extra money.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,2,3,3,NA,NA,3,0

Complaints to the cabin crew just got a ""sorry we have no control over the air temperature"" response. Veggie meal ordered was given to someone else by mistake so I had to have fish. Video screen is tiny on these planes - not that it mattered as the system wasn't working properly so I couldn't watch any films. Pretty poor on a 9.5 hour flight.

I had flown CX before and was looking forward to the experience. The First Class Lounge was as usual excellent. I had a light breakfast in the dining room so as not to spoil my appetite for the meals on board. The 777-300ER was updated with the new First Suite fabric and seat/lighting controls. The Flight Service manager was wonderful as were the other two Flight Attendants in the cabin. As it was my birthday the crew surprised me prior to landing with a birthday card. The food was as expected - stellar and love the caviar course. Studio CX consistently delivers with plenty of entertainment and the bed is a favorite part of the experience with actual turndown service and so comfortable. The wardrobe/closet is a welcome touch to store shoes hang clothing and more.

The new economy seats might be an improvement over the old clam shell seats but leg space is minimal and being 6'2"" I have major problems without the passenger in front even reclining. I find it quite odd that the regionally configured older 777s and 747s offer substantially more legspace than the newer aircraft used on the London route. The cabins are kept at a freezing temperature as standard and there is no respite for my feet as they no longer provide socks. Meals are pretty poor and they don't serve water from a bottle but use tap water that tastes bleachy.

Singapore ground staff to be commended for their efforts to assist in lost bag on the previous LHR- SIN leg of the trip due to massive problems at Heathrow on June 9.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,A Moreitz,Australia,2014-12-31,I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient. Had to unexpectedly break my trip in HKG and ground staff went out of their way to help me.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,5,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1
cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,S Howard,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,Recently had to make an emergency booking and the prices were very high no business class seats were available so flew on Premium Economy. Check in was very fast and efficient at Heathrow and being a Marco Polo member was able to access the lounges London and HK. Boarded very quickly and settle into my seat with no seats in front of me (I actually found it uncomfortable compare to having a seat in front). Champagne served before take off food was surprisingly good and as usual Cathay pacific stewardess were excellent. At HK I flew business class to Cebu. Check in at Cebu fast and efficient and onto HK in premium class never did like the lounge in Cebu lack of decent food. Quite surprise no champagne was offered perhaps it because it is regional flight. Food wasn't that appetising so didn't bother. Premium class from HK to London champagne and soon settle into my seat this time half way with seat in front and this time I had a superb air steward he really did look after me I wasn't feeling too good – many thanks for that. OK Good point about premium class it is worth it if you can book in advance as the prices are much more reasonable excellent cabin crews quieter cabin and great food on long haul flights. The bad point about premium class I don't think you get welcome champagne on regional flights and the food isn't good except on long haul flights divider curtains remain open for an hour before takeoff and landing and I didn't like the fact that economy class passengers were using our rest rooms facility. Plastic cups for soft drinks or wine is a big no for me it should have been in a glass.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,5,NA,NA,2,1

A330s on both flights. My first-time with CX as I usually use QR for the whole route. After having read some poor reviews on here I wasn't looking forward to these sectors especially as QR are my favourite airline. But what a surprise! Both sectors were fairly busy yet the cabin crew were faultless: friendly talkative helpful and completely professional - some of the best crews I've come across anywhere. Both flights arrived early. Both planes spotlessly clean. Bags on the belt at HKG soon after clearing immigration. Stress-free in-town check-in as always at Hong Kong Station. My only criticisms are: the seats are better suited to short-haul not the 9-10 hours needed for the DOH-HKG sector the food isn't Asian enough and they make everyone close the shades for most of the flight - but the latter is just a personal issue and I know some may prefer it this way. Overall the two flights with CX were better than the two flights with QR and I am now considering flying direct from MAN with CX for my next trip to Hong Kong.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,2,5,3,4,NA,NA,5,1
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,J Rose,Australia,2014-06-08,LHR-SIN in Business on B-747. Hard to find much good to say about this experience. Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less.

Main gripe is they don't serve proper hot meals. Not even coffee. Even Philippine Airlines serves hot meals on the way to HKG. Early morning flight outbound. Online check in meant shorter queue and a chance for breakfast in the airport (which is essential since CX starves its passengers on this leg). I think breakfast should at least have been served. Seats on the older 777-200 was wide and comfortable but IFE non existent. Flight crew attentive and friendly. Mid-afternoon return flight on 777-200 with new configuration. More IFE options but food service basically non existent. Not even ice for the water was provided! My wife's monitor conked out 30 minutes after StudioCX was turned on and couldn't be addressed by the apologetic staff. I think CX should improve its regional service.

Calcutta-Hong Kong section operated by Dragonair. Good service friendly attendants. Interestingly enough I was served a full meal while the others in the cabin received a wrapped sandwich. Eating and drinking ""sumptuously"" while surrounded by passengers sipping cola and chewing on a morsel made me self-conscious and slightly uncomfortable. A flight attendant informed me that the others had been upgraded and had not paid the fare that I had and was thus not deserving of the full meal and drinks and convenience pack normally provided in this cabin!

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,J Rose,Australia,2014-10-28,YVR-HKG-MEL in Premium economy. On balance a bit of a mixed bag experience. Seats definitely an uptick from economy but the fundamental problem is cabin design which is flawed - the cabin feels like a retrofitted afterthought which it is. On the B777 YVR-HKG leg the one toilet in premium economy is in the right front of the cabin necessitating anyone on the left side of the plane to crawl across the four seats in the middle front row to access it. That isn't well thought out and isn't a nice thing to do to the people sitting there and is difficult at night with all four people stretched out sleeping so the alternative is walking back into economy down the left aisle which is a hassle. On the A330 HKG-MEL there is no premium economy toilet which requires a trip back to economy. Food seemed more 'economy' than 'business' but to be expected really. The other big negative on the YVR-HKG flight was the premium economy cabin was filled with upgraded passengers due to a massively oversold economy cabin. I would estimate 80% of the people in premium economy were upgraded and not for status reasons which makes the logic behind paying for it hard to justify. On the positive side Cathay service always shines and the crews are professional and efficient.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,3,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1
cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,L Bree,Australia,2014-10-28,MEL-HKG-YYZ return in economy. It was okay let's face it economy is never going to be fantastic but for economy it was just fine and I would do it again. As we were going to Canada we were allowed 23kg x 2 which is great. I considered upgrading to Premium Economy but it would have been an EXTRA $4000 for the two of us just too much. The flight to and from HKG from Mel was fine. Seat a little hard but we found sitting on their blanket in its bag helped there. The food was okay. The FA's were lovely very friendly. Entertainment very good also. Flight to Toronto was full. We paid extra for exit row seats. Was very cold against the door. I had wrapped just about everything I could around my legs it was really freezing there but still not a bad seat in that you could just walk straight out of it no climbing over anyone so if you go for that seat bring warm items for your legs. Going to YYZ was better than returning. Returning the staff seemed to disappear. They were not very organised at YYZ coming back either the line ups were all messed up and wheelchairs couldn't get through. They called the far rows first before business and it was just a big crazy mess of confused people. We were late leaving HKG for MEL due to late passengers but not surprising as there was a gate change. Mostly though the flights were on time our luggage arrived safely the entertainment was good and thank goodness there were no shell seats as what we experienced back in March. After travelling to Canada before via LA this is a far better option even if longer. Stopping over in HKG is ideal and the airport there is very efficient.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,5,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

The downside was the food what was served was tasty but the portions were small and served on a tray not much larger than an A4 size piece of paper. The meal service was rushed and as it was a night flight there could have been more patrols with drinks and snacks.

When we asked for a snack for her they offered peanuts or mentoes hard sweets-both unsuitable for her. On the HK to London flight our attendant was great but all other flights we felt that we were being a nuisance if we asked for anything and even when they said they'd bring us something they didn't get around to it! This was simple requests like an orange juice or an extra bread roll. Our attendant from London to HK was very young and maybe just inexperienced. She was quite unfriendly.

Premium economy seats all the way. The seats are comfy and have great legroom but still feel cramped when the seat in front reclines. On the first leg KUL-HKG there was no drink service before takeoff or a hot towel in sight something Cathay hypes about in their commercials for premium economy. I was disappointed with the meal service as although we were served economy class meals the portions were tiny for a 14.5 hour flight. Staff were great pleasant and courteous and it was always service with a smile. They weren't around much after the meal service but did respond to calls. Personally I do not think these seats are great value for money due to the inadequate meal service and the general similar cramped feeling of economy. The seat mechanism was difficult to work and my seat would not go upright without the help of a steward who said that they were having problems with the premium economy seat recline mechanism.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,4,5,2,3,NA,NA,2,0

We boarded the aircraft and sat in our seats realising we had a long haul flight in short haul seat pitch with a very small seat width designed for a below averaged size person.

Bought ticket in WT+ and managed to get a last minute upgrade using Avios to Club. First time in a premium cabin. The seats are comfortable if a little narrow but they easily move to the lie flat position meaning I was able to get 6 hours sleep. Plenty of good quality champagne and wines offered before and during dinner. 3 course dinner sounded a lot better than it actually tasted. BA should think more about ease of food preparation on board rather than trying to do lavish dishes that don't quite come off. Breakfast was better than expected - plenty of choice and a good selection of fresh rolls and croissants. AVOD worked well. My only complaint was that the cabin crew found it very difficult to be friendly. Every request appeared to be an inconvenience to them - little things like milk and sugar for my coffee. Generally though I would have to give Club World the thumbs up if only because a lie flat bed is infinitely more appealing than cramped Economy on a 12 hour flight.

Both lounges had a decent selection of food with local and international food and alcohol brands. No priority boarding and no newspapers available other than the Daily Mail. The flight crew were excellent - polite addressed passengers by name and did several drinks runs throughout the flight. On one pass through the CE cabin a flight attendant spoke to every passenger to check that they were enjoying the flight and service.

What was annoying was that I was 4 rows from the front of the World Traveller cabin and by the time the crew had got to my row to serve lunch 1 of the 2 choices had already run out! That in itself would have been ok - it was perfectly acceptable pasta but the starter was a pasta salad. Not very sensible offering 2 dishes almost the same. The crew did what was required of them - serve drinks and food but then we didn't see them again for 9 hours until breakfast was served.

Overall the flights were very good with above average catering and comfortable seats. Cabin crew were excellent and were available throughout the flight. I would make a couple of comments. It would be nice if Cathay could fit ""ears"" to their economy class seats - it helps avoid getting a pain in the neck. Also it would be good to fit adjustable air vents above each seat.

Flew on the last 747 service from London to Hong Kong on 31st December 2013. We were all given a lovely commemorative postcard set at the gate. As we taxied a firetruck water canon salute was in operation although the fact that it was pouring with rain rather spoiled the effect! Seats were reasonably comfortable and although I know others find these older style 'sliding' recline Cathay Pacific seats not so comfortable at least you don't get problems with the person in front if you reclining their seat all the way back. Food was nothing special neither was the movie selection and crew not the most attentive I was expecting Cathay Pacific in-flight service to be up there with the other major Asian airlines and so was a little disappointed. Return flight Hong Kong to Heathrow was on a 777. It may be my 'shape' but I just could not get comfortable in these seats (economy class) and unlike the old style 747 seats the new 777 seats recline by tilting and so inevitably the person in front of me decided to recline fully for the entire flight. This combined with the uncomfortable seat (no lumbar support and either very low armrests or high seat cushion - I couldn't work out which) made it one of the most unpleasant long haul flights I have taken in recent years. Cabin crew not friendly (aside from one female cabin attendant who seemed to be doing more work than all her colleagues and who was genuinely personable and friendly) and as on the outward leg cabin crew not especially attentive.

Connecting flight to Cebu on an A340 and it was interesting to be seated in the old style funeral type business seat I can see why most hated it but I am not bothered as it was only a 2.5 hour flight.

It was a pretty terrible experience all round. First flight to HKG was a 747-400. The seats were bizarre they did not recline but the seat slid forward a little bit and the support for the bottom of your back is rock hard. Terrible pockets on the seat in front mean if you put anything more than a newspaper in there the seat pocket is touching your knees. Also as with all Cathay flights I've been on there was no personal air conditioning control. Food as always was terrible - 2 meals on a 12 hour flight both of which were not nice at all. Breakfast choice always seems to be an egg based dish or seafood congee. I'd rather just have cereal next time. The dinner is always a choice of an oversalted Asian dish a vegetarian pasta dish or something else unappetising. Having already flown the opposite route we luckily knew to take snacks on board so we didn't starve. With Qantas / Emirates I usually end up feeling almost overfed not with Cathay though where you feel like you're in prison. With 2 or 3 hours before landing when breakfast was about to be served my girlfriend noticed that a child on the seat in front had been sick which had trickled between the seats and gone all over her tracksuit pants which were on the floor in front. We tried to get the cabin crews assistance but they continually ignored us. We ended up just putting them in a bag and then throwing them away. Never again!

It was no more expensive for our family of four to take the CMA flight than it would be to take the ferry to Vancouver and back and for a couple of nights in hotels to make our connecting flights south. Being a smaller plane it was open seating. We were in the emergency seats going both ways and both times the pilots made sure to make eye contact with us when explaining the procedures and asked if we had questions. CMA is very good about the schedule. Both flights left on time and arrived on time. It's a nice short flight. Being a smaller plane it was a bit bumpy both ways but as someone who has become airsick on bigger jets I had no problem at all.

Good service new plane poor food. 11 hour layover at TPE allowed family to explore Taipei prior to connecting flight and enjoy the local fare. TPE-SFO on a refurbished 747. Full flight and ticket class meant seating in the tail section with no USB port and a bumpy ride. Service below average with only one drink/water run after meals on this 12.5 hour flight. IFE above average to good. Returning from SFO used the same aircraft but this time seated in the midsection. USB port barely working and so was the underseat power. Meals small and barely edible. Service was friendly and prompt but again only one water run in the long haul flight. Took this flight only because the price was almost half of DL PR and OZ.

First Melbourne to Xian via Guangzhou, then Chongquin to Guilin, Guilin to Melbourne via Guangzhou. All flights were on time. I found them not quite as good as Cathay, but still adequate. The entertainment (personal) was quite limited for English but still had a variety of TV sit-coms/dramas and movies. Coming back a bonus was that even for domestic-international if you have more than 6 hours wait (we had 12 hours) they put you up in a hotel room for free including transfers even during the day. You go to international check in, find G17 which is opposite the G's for check in and they check your details and then escort you onto a bus for your transit hotel. Bonus. However the seats we had 51A, 51C coming back from Guangzhou to Melbourne, mine didn't recline and my husband had NO tray table. It was removed some time some how. We mentioned this to the flight attendant who said they would be willing to let him sit somewhere else to eat. Me, well too bad. Not the greatest help. So instead of the hassle he just balanced his meal on his lap. Not really acceptable. Shame as we would have rated this airline much higher if they had done the right thing by us and let us sit in seats that had all their bits working, like a table and a recline (it was an overnight flight).

The day before they were due to fly I again phoned to check the figures and got the same charge to book in additional case at the airport. On arrival they were told the fee was double as it was two flights and would not budge. She felt she was being treated very badly and the attitude of the staff was absolutely dreadful.

The service on the aircraft was very poor with most of the cabin crew having very limited English. The food was just about edible. Getting served was very hit and miss with some crew just walking up and down the aisle with drinks and not asking each passenger if they wanted anything. It was up to passengers to attract their attention and many time people were just ignored. Some staff were friendly some barely hid their contempt for the passengers. We booked a baby bassinet but it wasn't provided and the cabin crew couldn't even understand what we wanted when we asked so we had to spend a 13 hour flight with a baby on our laps. No children's meals were provided even though we booked them. We checked the baby buggy at the gate in Heathrow. When we got to Shanghai it had disappeared and it took us several hours of speaking to unhelpful staff to get it back. Shanghai airport is a huge gloomy depressing place with zero facilites beyond basic seating and horrifically expensive shops. 8GBP for a fruit juice.

However when I arrived for check-in at PVG they refused to provide through check-in to CCU and said that I would have to collect my baggage at KMG and go for a fresh check-in. This was ridiculous since PVG is the home base of China Eastern and they can easily manage to put systems in place for through check-in for through bookings.

These flights employ well-used A330s. Flights smooth and on time. However my economy seat was narrow and very poorly padded - little better than a city bus. The entertainment system was old and tired with a limited selection of movies. Flight attendants did the basics but disappeared for long periods. They did however keep the toilets very clean. Loading procedures were amateur and chaotic as if the ground staff were improvising. Individual staff were OK but as a group they lacked management. This unpleasantness was magnified by the loading at Beijing. For reasons unknown the SIN and YVR flights had to load using buses out to the tarmac (when gates at the main terminal were obviously available). This is not appropriate for a large plane at capacity. Beijing airport is a liability as a hub. It is very large dreary inefficient and immersed in a toxic smog. Moreover as a passenger in international transit I had to go through a passport check and then through the general security check.

Full flat seats in an angled 2-2-2 configuration. Very comfortable seats for sitting and sleeping. Good food and drinks with a full bar and helpful FA's who sometimes struggled with English but could get by. Large IFE screen with AVOD although I wish they had a wider selection of English titles. Both flights were delayed by about half an hour. SHA-PEK was bang on time and was on a 777-200 which surprisingly had identical seats to the B777-300ER ie full flat - very nice for a 2-hour domestic flight.

china-southern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-southern-airlines,China Southern Airlines customer review,G Chin,Australia,2015-01-14,MEL-CAN-LHR. Flight was delayed by a total of almost five hours due to a faulty emergency exit light - not what you need with an original departure time of 11.30pm. This information was only forthcoming when you actually asked the ground staff who seemed reluctant to publicise a technical fault. The airline asked for volunteers to fly a day later (with accommodation and meals provided) and boarding commenced very soon after they had found approximately 20. Apparently the light problem meant a reduced number of passengers could be carried. The volunteers were essentially tricked as at the time it was far from clear that boarding was imminent. We then sat on the plane for two hours whilst the volunteers' bags were unloaded and spent the flight to CAN wondering whether the LHR leg would be held for us. After landing we were quickly ushered through the CAN terminal handed a 100 Yuan note each as compensation for the delay and soon on board the Boeing 787 to LHR. The 787 passengers appeared to have been waiting on board for about two hours. Food beverages and seat comfort were reasonable and the aircraft near-new with slightly below-average IFE. The standard of staff English is much lower than comparable airlines but on the whole they do their best in terms of customer service. Overall not a terrible experience for the price (a quarter to a third lower than the competition) and we were probably unlucky with the technical fault.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,3,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

A particular problem I have encountered on all CI flights is that the crew seem unable to co-ordinate the service of wine with food and then to keep glasses topped up even in a small business class cabin. Twice I had to use the call button in order to get some wine. Although it was answered instantly this is no substitute for a proper drinks trolley service.

The headphones aren't great - you'll need a two-pin adapter to use your own ones. There was lots of legroom and the seats were the type that slide forward to recline. This is really important on a flight into China as people recline as far as they can; the person in front of me reclined all the way but this did not impinge on my space.

The most frustrating part of this whole saga was finding someone at Guangzhou and Beijing Airports who could speak proper English and explain to me what was happening they put me and a few others up in a hotel in Beijing and collected us at 6am the following morning. Then had to hang about for a few hours to see if I could be transferred to a KLM flight leaving later that morning what a relief when I got a seat on that plane and all the flight attendants spoke English and with a smile! I missed my connection to Birmingham and had to pay again and eventually arrived in Birmingham some 12 hours late. The biggest problem I found was the lack of English spoken which surprised me but the service generally on all China Southern flights was poor with hardly a smile from anyone plus the food was very ordinary beer and white wine came warm the entertainment unit was not working on the first leg and although available on the next leg was nearly all Chinese.

The airport is easy to get to and flights in and out of Nanyuan do not seem to be subject to delays as serious as those at Beijing Capital. There's also very little taxiing.

Had no idea what he was doing. Another two turned up some 15 mins later who also had little idea of what they were doing. Finally checked in with 1 hour to spare until the flight allegedly departed. Got through security etc to find that the flight was delayed by half an hour then it was delayed again then again until eventually the 13.20 flight left Florence at 15.50hrs. Oh and it would take an extra 40 mins because of head winds. The cause? 'Delay from incoming flight' - yes because they had been delayed leaving London.

There are deficiencies in English with many staff but since at least 90% of passengers were Chinese on every flight it is unreasonable to expect too much. The written English in their publications videos and notices also needs attention.

I chose the option of not paying to preselect seats and it seemed as if it was a scam to have me pay out of frustration with the free option. It eventually worked and we got 6 seats together. Condor doesn't have a bag drop option in Calgary we had to stand in the checkin line for 45 mins even though we were checked in. It was the first flight of the year from Calgary so once fully boarded we sat in the plane for an hour because the contracted ground handler didn't train their staff on condors systems. The pilot told us such. Once enroute the flight was fine. Entertainment was one free basic movie and then a small fee to access the premium content. Overall selection was mediocre. Dinner and breakfast were served and again the food was mediocre. Crew were fairly robotic and weren't overly friendly.

One must give themselves at least 2 hours between flights. Condor have limited gates and the size of FRA requires at least 2 hours for connection. On our return, I was injured a day prior to our flight and we contacted Condor to reschedule our flight and to request a wheel chair and was refused due to their rules for needing at least 7 days notice for any request changes. Flying business class and not having any customer service was astonishing. We had to contact the airport to arrange our own services. When we arrived at the gate in FRA, we were told business class was oversold and we were asked to fly another airline to get home. We asked if wee would be in business class and if we would have seats together and would our luggage be on the flight. The Condor representative assured us all would occur. When we arrived at the other airline, we did not have seats in business class, we did not have seats together, and our luggage was not in their system.

The girl on the desk said ""It's always like this""! Why don't they do something about it? Once on board we realised why - it was a bun fight for overhead locker space. Despite a supposed restriction of one carry-on bag some people had 3 and some were huge. Oversize bags were just left hanging out of lockers for the flight crew to sort out. It was absolute chaos and we finally took off an hour late. I thought Expedia had ordered a veggie meal for my wife as my e-ticket said it had been 'requested' but apparently this is not the same thing! The stewardess asked if I had paid for it which I hadn't so we weren't getting it. Turns out you have to pay extra for a veggie meal (or any other special diet). Never ever heard of this before on any airline ticket for which meals are included. The seats in economy were narrow and uncomfortable (impossible to sleep) the TV screens were few and very small the washrooms dirty. To top it all after disembarkation at Frankfurt we had a 20 minute bus ride to the terminal. Then we had to walk about 2 miles right across the airport and even go through security again despite being transit passengers before catching our connecting Lufthansa flight to Manchester which we only just made although the layover was nearly 2 hours. Why can't Condor/Lufhansa (both German) connections be simpler than this? The only good points were that they did make up time on the flight (lucky with the prevailing winds I guess) and they didn't lose our luggage! Oh and they were at least cheap.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Although I had booked a vegetarian meal there was no vegetarian option for one of the meals - only a meat sandwich. The flight attendant did not care and I was denied a meal. On the return I asked at check in to confirm my vegetarian meal had been ordered. The reply was along the lines that if there wasn't a vegetarian meal onboard then I should make do with what there was available - eg. remove the meat from the meal. I did receive my vegetarian meal this time but it was frozen and by the time it had defrosted I discovered it wasn't worth the wait. We were left with the trays on our tables for 45mins before flight attendants came around to remove the rubbish.

Interestingly Continental had 5 seats available together with extra leg room for an additional $109.00 each - upon enquiry I was advised that even though the flight was fully checked-in it is Continentals policy not to release these seats unless the upgrade price is paid! Boarding the aircraft I made a further request to the cabin crew to be seated next to my partner in the empty seats which was flatly refused. Only later in the flight when I asked a senior member of the cabin crew to confirm Continentals seating policy in writing was I advised that if I sat in the empty seats with my partner they would not ask me to move back! The seats in question were extra leg room emergency exit seats over the wing. I noted the emergency seating row in front was occupied by a teenager sleeping across all three seats and wondered if it was company policy to allow this? Other than my seating problems the flight was good and economy seats had plenty of leg room - just don't expect Continental staff to be helpful and assist with seating requests apparently it is company policy not to upgrade customers into empty seats even if this means you will be seated away from your partner & next to strangers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Aircraft in Trinidad was a new Embraer and while roomy and comfortable - we had exit row seats - the most noticeable feature was how cold the plane was. Given that it was 30+ degrees outside this seemed a bit ridiculous. I mentioned it to one of the crew and was given a blanket promptly. One of our party was told in Port of Spain that 'due to a computer issue in Panama' one of our travel party - who had been unable to check in online - would have to have a standby boarding pass for the connection to Lima but that she would definitely be able to travel on the flight. This was not true. In actual fact the flight was massively oversold and the airline had suspended check in that morning.

The flight was early in the morning with an ATR42. Check in was a bit chaotic at the beginning.. sort of a rush hour and the new ""check in for all Czech airlines flights"" system that I am not very keen of but I have to admit that its a saving factor for the airline. More check in counters opened 20-25min from my arrival. I guess knowing their bottle neck times all check ins should have been ready. But all in all it took me around 25minutes to check in. Czech airlines check in kiosks were all over with ladies helping those who didn't know how but the line for the baggage drop was as well full. Beware Czech airlines will not let you with even 900g of extra weight! The check in agent was polite and helped that I took one of the fairly larger bags with me onboard (around 10kg) so I kind of wonder of the logic as I had a back pack and this bag with me. Passport control quick. Czech airlines has a fairly large fleet of turboprop ATR42s however I caught one of two older generation so the interior even though clean showed its age and older design. The cabin crew did their job looking at the fact that this was a very short hop. Security demonstration English Czech and German as well as newspapers in all these languages. Captain talked to us explaining de-icing and 5 minutes delay. A small sandwich and free (juices and water tea and coffee). I love Czech airlines but a reason for taking a star away is having to pay for coca cola beer and wine on their flights. CSA was known for impeccable service and plenty of food and drinks. Saving on visible things like food and drinks make a difference.

Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight.

Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet's ""midnight check-in"" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I'd paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn't find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we'd be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay €100 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I've had bus seats more comfortable.

Our first time travelling with EasyJet. We had a slight confusion with a staff member at the baggage drop as after he'd weighed and labelled my case I mentioned that the case was my hand luggage but he didn't understand what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but the confusion could have been avoided if there were signs up at both Bristol and Reykjavik airports telling people with just hand luggage that they don't need to go to baggage drop but can proceed to wherever the next step is. Staff on the outward flight were very polite friendly and helpful but the staff on the return flight (EZY6002 on Thursday 9th April) seemed eager to get the journey over and done with and reluctant to go the extra mile for the passengers. Sandwiches were also sold out by the time the staff came round asking people if they'd like anything to eat and drink. Refreshments expensive especially crisps and chocolate but the bacon baguette I had on the outward flight was tasty! Overall the flights weren't as bad as I'd feared from their reputation and I would probably fly EasyJet again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,1

delta-air-lines,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,2014-12-18,JFK-ATL-AUS in F. Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,8,5,3,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

First class was standard. 757 for JFK-SEA not spacious but felt roomier than in the domestic 767 from LAX-ATL (2-2-2 in first class). Food on all flights especially the international legs was good. Having priority check-in at LAX was especially welcome as I didn't have to take my bags over to the checked bag x-ray station. I didn't need the allowance of 3 checked bags up to 70 lbs for biz class to Brazil but it can be a plus. Service was good especially on the international legs. We chose Delta because it cost less than American or United for this trip.

My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats. I reached Frankfurt to find out - my ticket was never issued for Munich! However being German speaking and after being handed to competent Fraport staff and discussing the issue with them in detail - the situation was dealt with in an excellent manner and I was on my next flight to Munich.

The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg.

There were a lot of Russians on the flights but EasyJet have employed some English speaking Russian flight attendants to handle them. Yes the food wasn't cheap but in quality and price it compared favourably with UK rail and motorway services offerings. Even with the food added to the ticket price costs were less than half of a comparable flight with other airlines. Maybe on a longer flight I would yearn for an in flight movie and some free drink but if I go back to Moscow I will use EasyJet.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,5,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1
easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,L Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2013-10-15,"5 return trips with easyJet this year and all have been eminently satisfactory: no hitches no delays no unwelcome extra charges. If it were not for easyJet we would not be able to afford so many foreign trips. Moreover we have always found easyJet staff efficient friendly and helpful. Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through ""manually"" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue. The introduction of allocated seating seems to have made the whole boarding process more relaxed though it does mean that you can no longer vet the passengers in your immediate vicinity before sitting down: on one of our flights we had to suffer seat kicking children behind us with parents who took no notice.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers.

It's not a problem but I was just thinking the person in front of me weighed at least 95 kgs and is not charged for their 20kg bag. I weigh 65 kgs and have to pay for 1 kg over. Appreciate you cannot charge based on a person's total weight but for some reason it seems unfair. Also they are not very consistent - I often carry 21 kgs on Easyjet and they do not charge anything - could depend on the mood of the Easyjet check in assistants.

Ticket purchase fairly easy online but printing the boarding pass and online check-in could be made simpler. Due to the early departure I checked my luggage in the night before. Arrived the next morning and saw that at 5.30am they were still full. Shocked that at security at Gatwick I went straight to an x-ray machine! No queues! Eateries rammed as it was the start of the school holidays. Gate announced on time. At the gate they called all those with reserved seats and speedy boarding first. Told to go to the front of the bus and cram in there. Non-priority pax got on the same bus. Longest journey to the plane round the back of the airport and across most of it. At the plane the driver opened only the front door so speedy pax could exit first but as easyJet allocates seats you don't get the disgusting crush and rush as you do on Ryanair. Clean cabin. Thanked by the captain for boarding quickly but then told that the flight was to be delayed due to Air Traffic Control not giving them a slot until 2hrs later! I missed my connecting ferry. Captain came on and said the slot had been pushed back even further to 10am. Crew came down with free water a couple of times. Eventually take off 2 hours late. Fairly uncomfortable for a long flight when you add the extra time on the ground in. Crew were very cheery and professional. The chicken wrap I got had limited fillings and was very dry. The box of crisps were over salty and very oily. Next time I'll buy something at the airport to bring on board. Arriving at Kefalonia we were behind another flight so had to wait to clear immigration a bit and for our bags to arrive. Mine was the last one off!

We arrived at Gatwick nearly 2 hours before the flight to be greeted by a huge queue to check in bags we had to join. I guessed early on that the queue was pointless as there was no way anyone could get through it in time for the flight. The check in staff were just calling people out of the queue just before their flight closed. We had about 5 minutes to check in the bags before the flight closed. I had paid for an extra bag through the web site. Not having used Easyjet for several years I assumed all would be well. But no buying an extra bag does not mean you have extra weight allowance. Told to speak to the supervisor and come back. As we came back we were told the flight had closed.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,A Martin,United Kingdom,2013-06-10,Having flown Easyjet since 2005 I can certainly say they have gone downhill. What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair.

The seat I was assigned 10D did not recline and was broken. The system was rebooted 3-4 times from the shoe holder from the rack alongside the seat from the control area of the aircraft and separately by another to physically try and push it down each one extending for up to 15 minutes and me forced out of the seat for the majority of this period and this went on for about 3.5 hours of the 7 hour flight. Until then I was not moved to any other seat with the rebooting I couldn't use the entertainment options for a couple of hours as well. After the Chief Purser heard about this she immediately took action and moved me to another seat. I was for approximately 2.5 hours of the flight moved to seat 4K on the flight thereafter. The electronic console handset which is connected to the seat did not power on and didn't work. There was water clogging in the shower in the bathroom on the right side of the aircraft. I had a vegetarian oriental meal requested and instead it was an Asian Vegetarian Meal that got loaded. Once again we are now in the 21st century and still Emirates Business Class does not have a single (out of four) main course meal options in the menu which are vegetarian. Often last minute travel options have to be ticketed and this means I will not have any assurance of a vegetarian meal option on Emirates. Seems odd and not befitting an airline such as Emirates which has fantastic infrastructure and options available to it as well as world renowned chefs.

As another writer recently bemoaned the aircraft used on the Bangkok/Cairo sector was truly ancient. I do not honestly recall having riden an airliner that looked as worn as that used on this route. I too rode in Business Class yet felt like a sardine in coach class given the paltry amount of leg room available. A complete disaster was averted by fairly decent (but not great) meals and a hard working flight crew. The trip from Cairo/JFK was a totally different story.

Negatives: for some reason during SEA-DXB leg the formation of two lavatories each per section didn't seem to work very well. There always seemed to be a line up. All four times they seem to be always taking off a bit late from all the four points of departure. We were bussed to the terminal at DUB on arrival from DEL which took extra 30 minutes of our lay over. Cabin crew could use a bit more politeness.

First sector from Dublin to Dubai was astonishingly poor for an airline as reputable as Emirates. Chaotic boarding late departure - 1hr 10 minute delay. Staff onboard were generally surly abrupt extremely rude and unhelpful. One particular stewardess on this flight demonstrably lacked the people and interpersonal skills required to carry out her responsibilities. The aircraft's ICE system was particularly ineffective and difficult to navigate. However the further three flights resonated as if it were a completely different airline. Staff were utterly professional courteous caring and engaging throughout.

Some even refused to bring water to passengers. Disgraceful conduct. The IFE system was also difficult to navigate on this sector leading to a less than satisfactory flight. However all other sectors were extremely good particularly service aboard the A380 from PEK-DXB. Staff were exemplary chatty smiling engaging and above all courteous. Our group received complimentary champagne on two occasions during the flight. They went out of their way to make us feel at home. Space was very good the IFE fantastic and food was excellent.

We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF).

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,K Cornelius,Netherlands,2014-11-06,Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event.

Boarding was just turn up and go. No order. Once onboard the difference between the A380 and B777 is quiet marked. Seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. I had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by I was bumped. The person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. It was most uncomfortable not helped by the AV units under the seat taking up space. The food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. A roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. No sausage bacon or baked beans. The last dinner I had was a bit bland a beef casserole. Would have benefited from a wine reduction. The AV on this craft was the old ICE. Far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. Very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. We had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in India. We were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 BNE time. At no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in BNE. I had to spend my time in Singapore looking on the web to find out and make arrangements. Very poor form.

No footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. Entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. The choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. However this was the only exceptional part of the flight. Flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. I've never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. I've had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the United States and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. Service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. It took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. Catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. Omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast? So basically it's a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. Also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. Only good part was the cool mood lighting. Overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but Emirates' customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,2,2,5,NA,NA,2,0

Had business class seat in Row 8 the bulkhead. Rather than an A/V screen as part of my seat my screen was bolted to the bulkhead. Made for poor viewing experience. Also found the handheld controller to be ridiculously slow. Getting from my window seat to the aisle was a mountain goat experience when the adjacent seat was in sleeping position. Was also surprised to learn the 777 seat was not a 180 degree fully lie flat. Staff were pleasant and attentive but not any more so than British Air or Lufthansa. Food the same as BA and LH.

I tried to upgrade the other sections five times over three weeks and was given the run around each time including at the airport three hours before departure. Turns out the plane was full on every leg so they could have saved me time and angst. The crew in economy looked unhappy without exception and were overworked and brusque. Seat comfort was what you could expect - but narrow seats made sleeping very hard. Luckily my fellow travellers were sanguine about the heat stuffiness and general mayhem.

I was very impressed with the efficiency of meal service and taking up the trays when finished (some airlines leave you waiting for ages). On the other hand on the Sydney to Dubai leg the crew were very straight faced and wouldn't crack a smile. It was as if they had a timetable of stuff to do and any other communication was an inconvenience to them. A cabin crew member was very rude pushing by me as I was waiting for the bathroom and she did not excuse herself. I asked for a second wine when all meals and clean up etc. had eased off and was left 40 minutes waiting and had to search out the guy I asked. From Dubai to Dublin was the same experience minus the wine. Food was awful - stale rock hard croissant was included in the breakfast. On the way back I had trouble with my travel agent booking and the ground staff in Dublin were very kind and helpful. The Dublin to Dubai leg was very enjoyable - crew seemed happy and engaged with passengers and food was slightly better that my trip from Sydney to Dublin. I would recommend plunger coffee - Emirates serve instant. Each plane was very comfortable. I could stretch out - I am 5'7' and my partner is 6ft and a large build.

My daughter and I were extremely impressed by the comfort of the seats the quality and variety of food and the huge selection of movies etc offered on the IFE. We flew out overnight on 30th May and were looked after by a lovely FA who quite simply could not do enough for us. We arrived early in Dubai and were provided with Fastrack passes for Immigration. I have travelled to Dubai on many occasions (with BA KLM and Air France) and this was the best experience so far. The return (day time) flight was also excellent - again could not fault anything. Another fabulous FA - a young man this time - friendly and helpful. Ground staff in Dubai and Glasgow were courteous and helpful. One minor thing - if Emirates are serious about their commitment to Glasgow Airport they should establish their own lounge. This was the only downside of my experience - they do not have their own lounge in Glasgow - they have space in the ServisAir lounge which has to be one of the most soulless places I have encountered. Very limited choice of drinks no fresh foods at all (only packs of crisps!). Polar opposite is the lounge in Dubai - wonderful is the only word to describe it. It is large airy and offers free WiFi. Hot and cold meals and snacks available in abundance - and Moet and Chandon by the glass! Chauffeur driven cars were provided for both of us for the journeys to and from Glasgow airport (I was travelling from Edinburgh my daughter from Glasgow).

Flawless crew and aircraft all on a very well priced ticket. But the food standards have dropped dramatically or should I say the product has somewhat become much cheaper and basic. This is a pity.

Arrived at Dubai and followed signs for gate and Business lounge only to be told we were at the terminal. Signage was poor and quite a few other people made the same mistake. Phuket airport was confusing as the terminal is not well signed. Again business class so whisked through security and passport control so no need to queue. Coral Lounge at Phuket is very small and serves First and Business class it is also a lounge were you can pay to enter. NO wines or spirits are on offer was told to go outside and buy wine if I wanted it. The toilets are also a few minutes walk away from the lounge.

As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated.

Not clear why we could not check-in online for this route. Got a prompt answer from the service desk though when I asked about it. Not a big deal since check in at Abu Dhabi Airport was a breeze. Overall a much better experience than the outbound flight with partner Air Berlin. Better legroom better entertainment program better headphones and better food. Liked the fact that they didn't serve a full meal at 2.30 am but a snack bag and a full breakfast just before landing (Air Berlin did it they other way round) so you can get as much sleep as possible on this 7 hour flight.

Passengers will fly Etihad and discover: uninspired cabin service narrow seats rude cabin staff (yes coming from a Dutchman) poor on-time performance an absolute joke of an airline hub have written a separate review on the Airport headings. When you pay extra for exit row seats legroom don't sit in the window seat. It has a horizontal bit of door perfect for stretching out your legs (shoes removed of course) but the stewardess will wake you up by shaking your shoulder forbidding you to do this citing a safety issue with the door. There is a sticker on that door bit saying “Do not sit here” something I was not doing. Meal choice was run down to one choice only every meal. The seats on the B777 were painfully narrow painful for me but particularly for the overweight lady being wedged in the chair next to me. Will I fly this airline again - no thank you.

Booked 5 business class seats Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Cairo return for family with 3 children. Thought it would make the trip easier as younger 2 kids only 5 and 2. Also Business promised overnight hotel accommodation in Abu Dhabi so we justified the huge expense and thought we'd travel in style! Every leg we were seated separately including putting the 2 year old next to strangers. Just assumed I guess we would have seating together. After first leg refused to change seating for other legs. Refused - told we had to wait until on the aircraft and for attendants to approach other passengers to change. Watched anxiously on every leg as they seated and settled every other passenger before they would try to get my kids near us. Arrived late at night after long flight into Abu Dhabi from Sydney expecting hotel room. Airport almost deserted eventually found long line of weary travellers waiting for single attendant. Waited in line for 2 hours with children and adults close to hysterical by then. Eventually reach end of line and are told no booking made for room for us - then later found. Kids in separate hotel room on another floor! Unable even to have adjacent rooms. Service in plane polite but hardly existent. Bell would expire before attended. Twice sent feedback to Etihad. First not even answered second approach through social media got quick request for details which I provided. Response then was not an apology but ""disappointment' at my negative 'impression' of their superior service and well trained staff. They assured me that just because I didn't get my 'preferred seating' (as if I'd just wanted a window seat rather than to be near my children) they win awards for their 'inspired' experience.

The return journey was okay initially the flight left BKK on time and arrived in Abu Dhabi as scheduled. We boarded the Abu Dhabi - Manchester flight about 30 minutes late and were removed from the aircraft because of a 'maintenance issue' about 20 minutes after embarking. We were then told we could 'show our boarding pass to any of the restaurants in the departure lounge and we'd be able to get some food and a drink. Attempting this proved impossible I was told I needed a voucher from Etihad and wouldn't get anything unless I did. So a 25 minute queue for the voucher. Back to get some food. Oh the voucher only entitles me to what? A doughnut and a coffee! A 6.5 hr delay and this is all that was offered I was pretty disappointed and felt like this was in contradiction to Etihad's excellent reputation. We were eventually boarded on a flight some 7hrs later and whilst on-board the crew and staff were very attentive and professional.

As the flight to NRT was half-empty there was plenty of room to stretch out. Arrival at NRT spoilt by the non-arrival of my baggage.

When I got to the airport I had lost my credit card (must show purchasing card at check in) and had to buy a new ticket.

In my haste I misspelled my own name and this caused a real problem when transferring the ticket. The ladies at the counter worked on it and got me on the plane with minutes to spare. Stressful but my own fault. I was told that I could apply for a refund of my original ticket online which turned out not to be true because of the original reissue / changes I made. Turns out the refund would have to be worked out with the Hanoi office. When I mentioned that this would be hard as I was staying in San Francisco the woman at the San Francisco ticketing office said she could handle it if I faxed her some information which I did.

Super-fast boarding very comfortable lie-flat seat/bed excellent choice of food and drinks from a very extensive menu with great presentation and very professional service.

Food and drinks (water) kept coming. Washroom was clean all the way that's pretty good for 21-22 hours. But the reason I may not travel again on Etihad on a long haul flight are the seats very uncomfortable I am not very tall so leg room was adequate but the seats were very hard and not at all good for my back. The armrest on all flights did not have the cushion part sewn on it it was just hard. For long haul flight all passengers whether first class or economy require a certain degree of comfort which was sorely lacking on Etihad.

Did all get two free sandwiches and a drink of choice though with a value of about 500 shillings which isn't too bad considering the flight cost about 2500 shillings each.

The connecting flight from Amsterdam was fine. A tiny curtained off Business section with economy seating with middle seats left vacant. A pleasant dinner good Champagne and on time. From Helsinki to Singapore was one of the old A340s (OH-LQA in this case). First impressions were favourable with the cabin being spacious and clean. We had pre flight drinks and a snack and left on time. Once seated I tried the seat out and it's more of a recliner but seemed ok. Menus drinks and dinner all happened smoothly and quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed my supper. It's a bit of a no frills offering but enjoyable and had nice wines also. IFE is poor. The screens are tiny and the offering is limited and old. Didn't really matter as I wanted to sleep as much as possible and despite the seat being at quite an angle I managed a few good hours. Breakfast was simple but tasty. So overall the experience was a good one - on time fed and slept well.

Finnair uses an old leased Air France Aircraft on these Routes and they have not been updated or refurbished for years. The seats are old and worn and certainly could use a bit of TLC. On the outward flight the inflight entertainment system in my seat was not working and the lights in Business Class could not be switched off during the night. Space is good but if in stretched out setting you tend to slide down the Seat. Cabin Service on all Flights was excellent but Cabin Crew were quite frustrated with the problems associated with those ageing aircraft's.

I booked the ticket for a very good price at last minute and was not sure what to expect. Check in at LAX the toughest part - I am a professional musician and fly regularly with my instrument I was informed at the check-in desk that I would have to pay $50 USD for extra equipment and gate check the instrument as the flight was full and it wouldn't fit in the overheads on a 747-400. Check in clerk got the manager who advised me they would tag the instrument and if the flight crew deemed it too large than I would have to gate check it. This was great as I never have a problem with any flight crew and I know it fits in any over head locker it's smaller than most peoples carry on bags and very precious to me. LAX-NAN was fully booked and the overhead lockers were packed I did what I do every flight and presented myself at boarding at the front of the line secured my space in the overheads and took my seat we managed to fit everyone's carryon's from the row behind me my row and the row in front in the over head bin. The food was OK entertainment system was awful but I never use them. I did manage to catch a movie when I awoke 3 hours outside of Nadi they seemed to have got the system working by then. Seats were comfortable cabin crew friendly more so than Qantas. Nadi was unorganised with 3 departing transfer flights leaving at the same time roughly with one transfer desk with two staff for everyone. I think the entire 747 was transferring. There was also another security check point after the transfer desk which I thought was strange. NAN-BNE was great on time and no problems on a 737 had an entire row to myself on a 4 hr flight!

Boarding was accomplished quickly and efficiently for both flights and the aircraft were clean and tidy on boarding.

In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport).

My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels.

Departure 8.47 on time. Good. Flight was safe landing was nice. All good. Cannot complain. The main reasons I log this review is because if you are flying on a budget (which you likely are on Frontier) then beware of the surly attendants the lack of snacks coffee and beverages available on a 3 + hr flight. This was a 8.47am flight no coffee no individual snacks for purchase one box snack available for purchase and some sodas/juices. I don't look forward to airline ""snacks"" but when you fly with kids creature comforts are welcome at times. Very strange airline. Very strange flight.

I know they recently changed their policy on carry-on luggage where I believe you have to pay to have a carry-on bag using storage above. My last trip with them was in January of 2014. They were on time friendly bathrooms were clean and the flight was comfortable. In September of 2013 I flew from KC to PDX with a stop in Denver. On the way back to KC we did miss our connecting flight by about 5 minutes. They hadn't taken off yet but they wouldn't let us on because they were to leave the dock in just a few minutes. While it was a bit annoying they got us on the next flight to KC which left about 90 minutes later and I understand why they couldn't let us on that original connecting flight. Of course we didn't have to pay anything extra for the next connecting flight. With the changes in carry-on costs I'm not sure I will fly with them again because it all really depends on where I can get the best deal but if they are still the cheapest I have no qualms with flying Frontier again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,0,4,NA,NA,4,1

We had to stay on the plane and only 1 of the 3 lavatories was operational - there was a line of about 30 people waiting to use it. An hour later I was close to the lav and had to sit down again for take-off. We got to Denver 2.5 hours late and my connecting flight to Little Rock had already left. After standing in a long line I found out their next flight to Little Rock wasn't for 2 days. They gave me a ticket to Branson Mo for the next day and I slept on the airport floor. In the morning I exchanged the Branson ticket for a Little Rock ticket for Friday since I didn't have transportation from Branson to Little Rock and got a hotel room for Thursday night. I left Denver Friday evening and got into Little Rock just before 11 pm. My luggage was not there. It had not been in Denver the 2 days I was there.

On a recent trip from Chicago to Denver changing planes then Denver to SLC I was frustrated by the lack of compassion by the Frontier staff. My daughter has MS and uses forearm crutches. Because we booked on a third party site the attendant assigned us a seat on the back row of the plane. It was very difficult for my daughter to navigate her way to the back of the plane. From Denver to SLC I asked the gate attendant if my daughter could please get a seat with more leg room closer to the front of the plane. He said they had a seat with more leg room on row 2 however it would cost an additional $15 for each of the three seats we needed. I did not think someone who is disabled should have to pay to be accommodated. While we were waiting to board the plane he announced several times that there was seating with additional leg room available for $5 or $15 depending on your type of ticket. In the end the seats with additional legroom were empty and my daughter had to go to the back row of the plane. Another frustration was we had to pay $85 to check our baggage because our third party ticket did not allow for carry-on luggage. Then there was the tackiness of having to pay for a soft drink and snacks again because we purchased our ticket through a third party. If you're going to treat customers poorly because they booked their ticket through a third party then don't offer tickets through third parties like Jet Blue does.

She would not issue our boarding passes until we lowered the weight of our carry-on bags from the high amount allowed on the Delta flight to the 5 kg.

gol,/airline-reviews/gol,Gol Transportes Aéreos customer review,S Koenig,NA,2008-11-23,Fortaleza-Rio roundtrip. Basic no-frills flights. Tiny sandwiches soft drinks juice coffee water included. Biggest gripe was the fact that while the airline e-mailed my original itinerary to me they did not notify me when my original flight to Rio (a non-stop flight) stopped flying a couple of weeks before I was to depart. Unbeknownst to me I was put on a flight through Brasilia (fortunately leaving about the same time as the original flight). I learned of the schedule change only because I happened to look at the airline's Web site to confirm whether they were taking into account daylight savings time in Rio. I did ask them to send my revised itinerary via e-mail to make it official but they did not. Other than that the flights were fine. On the return we were put on a plane operated by Flex Airlines apparently a low-cost subsidiary. Once inside it was pretty indistinguishable from the Gol flight in which I had flown to Rio.,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast.

Many people had their own headphones (they clearly knew the routine on Ibearia) and settled down for a movie. I finally got up and went back to a cabin attendant and asked for a headphone. he very rudely told me they would be passing them out and to sit back down. An hour later (honest) they finally passed out earphones. It was that way the entire flight. When we tried to check in online for a flight the evening before in Seville we could never get the internet system to accept our information. We went to the airport early to check in we went to a ticket agent who was very nice and sent us to the proper flight check in counter but there was no one there and several people in line. I went back to the agent and asked if there was a check in agent. He called and said ""I guess they are not working yet."" Yes in addition to the ticket agent a couple of agents were very friendly and helpful but overall they simply had no interest in providing acceptable customer service. So based on the mechanical equipment and food I would recommend Iberia but I would not recommend Iberia based on the customer service provided.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,1,4,5,NA,NA,3,0

They had good legroom comfortable seats the flight staff was very courteous the flight was smooth overall the plane was in good repair with excellent in-flight entertainment including several really newly release films that I'd wanted to see. I was impressed. Also I loved the slogans on their seat backs and they had really nice overnight blankets that were much fluffier than what you usually get on planes. It was a cushy ride which was good since one flight was an overnighter. The only thing that could have been improved would have been more food selection which was very minimal with just a few options although what they did have looked good and they had a great drink selection on board. Of course a larger plane also would have been a plus since it was just three seats on each side. Otherwise I would take Icelandair again from the US to Iceland over another airline any day.

iberia,/airline-reviews/iberia,Iberia customer review,Harold Bush-Howard,United Kingdom,2014-06-09,Madrid to Bogotá on 29 May in Business. I find the new business class seat claustrophobic. They are very narrow and I felt trapped especially when I put the seat in bed position. The strange thing is that there is a gap of around 12cm between the seat and the wall which could have been used to make the seat more comfortable and wider. The food as I expected was just ok and boring. Iberia should try to make it catering more interesting. 5 star Michelin chef and everything but the food is not worth it. Before landing we were given surprise surprise the usual selection of dry ham and cheese with bread. Come on I know they are very Spanish and Iberia wants to showcase the best of Spain but please offer something else or spruce up the menu a bit.

Spanish cuisine is of the most delicious and interesting in the world and Iberia hired several Michelin-starred chefs to deal with their catering but this airline serve some awful stuff onboard. My started Salmorejo was very good even though it was served from a Tetra Pak container. Yet my main course tasted as though it was bought from KFC and then they poured some sort of gravy over it. It was dreadful. I did not mind the old business plus seats as the cabin was almost empty but I expected a good meal. I do not drink so cannot comment on their wines. Shame on IOberia you are not a good ambassador to Spain's wonderful cuisine. As for the second meal again dreadful: the usual dry and fatty ham bread. tomato sauce cheese etc. I have been using Iberia to travel to Latin America for many years and this second meal is the same. Time to change. Those expensive chefs are useless. Listen to your passengers not to them. I have a flight with them at the end of the month and will take my own food. The good thing apart from the seats is that the flight attendants are very charming they engage with passengers and are not grumpy as they used to be.

Nobody spoke English but I managed enough Spanish to explain the situation. The employee was curt and unhelpful even when I asked her to speak more slowly. I then discovered that Iberia had refunded my account the fare days after the first payment and Iberia had taken a further amount of double the fare. I have had enormous trouble sorting this out and getting a refund. A call to the same ""helpdesk"" in Madrid resulted in the insisting that the problem was with my (Spanish) bank and that there was nothing further she could (or would) do. Of course my (Spanish) bank disagreed and said I needed to deal with Iberia. Very stressful for someone whose Spanish is not fluent. The actual flight was fine. Air Nostrum planes are small a 2x2 configuration but leg room was adequate. No free food or drink but available at a price as in low cost airlines. A late departure resulted in a late arrival.

I went on a 90s Fokker 100 from Tehran to Isfahan and to Shiraz (leased or bought from Iberia since some of the signs were in spanish) which was comfortable. The ticket only cost $30 for each leg. The service was a lot better than I expected finding bottled water in the seat pockets (luxurious compared to the 2 dollars you have to pay to get a cup of water with American Airlines) giving me a mint before the flight and serving a Snack. The seats were comfortable but I did not try the bathrooms (I heard too many stories that they did not work). They had excellent service for handicapped (my grandmother was with me). Crew is kind and attentive actually serving to the passengers request but don't interact much or show emotions. Shiraz-Tehran we took a Soviet era Tupolev 154m (which belonged to Iran Air tours) which while having the same service as mentioned above was extremely uncomfortable air conditoning broken and with all signs written in Russian - avoid Russian planes at all cost.

icelandair,/airline-reviews/icelandair,Icelandair customer review,Max Davidson,Canada,2010-04-20,SEA-KEF-LHR. Check-in & boarding at SEA was good. Very impressed with onboard service and found it interesting that very few pax actually opted to take advantage of the on-board meal purchase which enforces my belief that most pax only eat airline meals because they feel they have paid for it so they should eat whatever is offered. Found the customs / immigration at KEF to be friendly and welcoming which was not the case with the security people at KEF who were anything but friendly and welcoming and quite aggressive with pax. Departure of flight from KEF was on-time as was arrival at LHR with luggage waiting on the carousel. LHR-KEF-SEA check-in and boarding and well organized with friendly staff who went out of their way to solve problems with my seating assignment. Overall impression of Icelandair was very good - they will get more of my business if they continue to offer great fares.

Toilets were smelly and not maintained. Seating clearly was old and showed signs of wear. It is amazing how little service was offered on such a long flight (13.5 hours). Only dinner at take off and until one hour before arrival there were no cabin crew to be seen. Staff didn't show any interest. One could get drinks in the galley. No snacks served in between.

I though I was unlucky on my flight from London to Mumbai but the crew on the return trip were possibly worse. Clearly passengers are an inconvenience that should just go to sleep and not bother the crew. I was refused a coffee as we were an hour from landing (even though they still hadn't finished clearing from breakfast so it should have been a simple ask). Another major annoyance were the tannoy announcements all through the night telling us we were entering turbulence so should fasten our seatbelts. Most humane airlines mention at the start of a night flight that passengers should keep their belt visible so that they don't have to wake us. There were only 15 movies on offer of which only 2 or 3 are new releases.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Weiss,Canada,2015-01-21,Took a total of six round trips with Westjet last year between Calgary and Abbotsford Vancouver and Ottawa. For an airline that promotes itself as the cheap and cheerful alternative to Air Canada it's no longer much of either anymore. Morning flights usually managed to arrive on time but afternoon flights were uniformly late. Cabin and ground service varied from enthusiastic to completely disinterested and disengaged. In-flight entertainment ranged from non-existent to broken. Fares were comparable to AC and the only reason I chose Westjet was because their flight times suited my particular schedules. It seems Westjet is trading on the good will it engendered in their early years. They seem to have run out of steam and are now content to wallow in mediocrity.

As this was one of WestJet's newer Boeing 737-800 there were no personal TV screens on the back of the seats. Instead WestJet rented Samsung Galaxy tablets for $5 + tax to anyone seeking inflight entertainment. The Tablets and the headphones that came with it were horrible - I was unable to hear what was happening in the movie. In order to properly view the movie one had to hold the tablet in front of one's eyes for 3 hours - my hands became quite tired after a while. The selections of available movies and TV shows were extremely limited and dismal. No hot meals available for purchase - only a choice of ham/cheese croissant or turkey sandwich for $7 + tax each. Flight crew took over 2 hours to serve beverages and sell sandwiches.

How refreshing after the take-it-or-leave-it attitude on most US- based carriers! 787 was a nice experience with the oversized windows which darken at the touch of a button and the ride is slightly quieter than other aircraft's but cannot see that the individual passenger experience is greatly improved.

This cabin is a well-priced alternative to economy in theory contains shell-style seats good IFE etc. My biggest complaint is related to legroom. Although Premium Economy has more advertised legroom than Economy due to the presence of large metal boxes (presumably supporting the IFE) under the seat in front of me I couldn't fully extend my legs which made it hard to sleep hence negating the value proposition. I did notice these boxes throughout the cabin so suspect it wasn't just my seat. And I'm neutral to negative on the shell seat as well.

We did and they told us to check back every 15 minutes. We did. There ended up being 2 spots on an earlier flight that they gave to someone who happened to just walk up to the gate. When we asked why we didn't get those seats we were told nobody told them we were waiting. We were told lie after lie by 4 different reps.

Inflight service reasonable though flight attendants used very basic even rude English with customers whom they believed could not use Japanese which was a sharp contrast to the elegant Japanese used with Japanese passengers. The economy class seats are terrible unless you are a dwarf. They do not properly recline. The seat slides forward as the back reclines so the legs hit the seat in front: quite unsuitable for a 12-hour flight.

The aircraft was clean and seats very comfortable.

jet2-com,/airline-reviews/jet2-com,Jet2.com customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,NCL-TFS-NCL. Booked as part of a decent package deal for some last minute winter sun. We've often flown with Jet2 in the past and have often found them excellent and this was no exception. Their flights were very well timed so we weren't arriving into Tenerife at some god-awful time of night. The pre-flight add-ons weren't horrendously expensive and the website easy to navigate. We printed boarding passes at home which meant check in was a breeze. You can both outward and return well in advance but most passengers appear not to do this for reasons which are beyond me clearly preferring a lengthy check in queue rather than the (no queue) fast bag drop. Boarded and departed on time. Onboard warmly welcomed both directions by friendly experienced crew. The seats are not like sitting on a cloud but at 6ft tall they were fine even for me for 4.5 hrs. The additional god-send is the inability to recline which made the whole thing very bearable. We pre-booked hot food both ways which was very good and filled a gap. Bags waiting on carousel in Tenerife. Return much the same with zero queue at bag drop lovely staff and on time departure. The only slight snag was a 40 minute wait for bags in Newcastle. Overall Jet2 is a great company that is a clear example of company able to operate a low cost model while caring about its customers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1

As we were making travel arrangements to return back to the Miami area JetBlue had the only flight that worked with our time schedule. We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company. We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015. It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight. It also made us question the cleanliness of the flight attendants' hands provided the lack of water on the plane.

First return trip both legs were flown on a Titan Airways A320 aircraft with a mixture of Jet2 and Titan Airways crew who were all very pleasant. Excellent legroom both outbound and return flights on time and the online check in service was easy to use and saved us a lot of time in the airport as we were travelling with hand luggage only. The 2nd return trip was taken with my wife and 8 month old son. Outbound flight on the same Titan Airways A320 and once again on time. Online check in was unavailable as we were travelling with an infant but I was still able to pre book my seats and check in was a breeze at both airports and took less than 5 minutes. Once on board our outbound flight we realised that the back of the cabin where we were was mainly rowdy youngsters off to San Antonio and at the front of the plane mainly families. Without us even asking and despite the flight being almost full the attendant told us row 8 had 3 spare seats next to each other and we were welcome to sit there once the seat belt sign was switched off. As soon as the captain allowed passengers to move around the cabin she came straight over and told us we could move down to the front and even helped us with our baggage. The return flight was on a Jet2 Boeing 737-300 and although it was clearly an old aircraft it was clean well maintained and once again on time. I really can't praise this airline enough and thankfully they are now the biggest carrier out of Newcastle meaning we will be using them many more times in the future and have indeed already booked to fly with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Simple Web site but functional easy to navigate book and buy - however in Portuguese only. Seat allocation can be reserved only by phone. Decent fares no surcharges transparent rules frequent promotions. Very friendly and efficient staff both on the ground and aboard; one can see they were very well trained and enjoy their work - a rarity today. Immaculate plane inside (in spite of a few worn paint spots on the fuselage) seat pitch better than in Gol or TAM. Announcements in English for foreign travelers. Food is a cold sandwich small but not microscopic and a small sweet - both very good. No alcohol but plenty of soft drinks fruit juices and mineral water. Punctuality was impressive - not a single flight delayed on the airport panels on both legs. The only real minus I saw was a very long time on the ground in stops (50-60 minutes) while one waits inside. My flights were nonstop but were it not so I'd be annoyed with that.

Boarding by seat number and fairly easy. Adequate leg room in 737-800 but the tiniest most uncomfortable arm rests imaginable (I had a constant battle with my neighbouring passenger for the use of the arm est!) good and pleasant service and with plenty of information from flight deck. Landing aborted about 1 mile from touch down after a very bumpy approach which certainly shut up the noisy drunk a few rows in front of us but the second attempt was smoother with a competent landing given the conditions. On return we were bussed to the aircraft this time a 757-200 which must have seen service in the Far East as the second language on the passenger warning signs was either Chinese or Japanese. Quite an old aircraft and comfortable enough but with the terrible arm rests. Twenty minute delay on departure with very little information from the flight deck throughout but arrival in Glasgow only a few minutes late. Good and pleasant service from the cabin crew and plenty choice for snacks and drinks. This was our fifth experience of using Jet2 and we would be happy to repeat the exercise.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Morris,United States,2008-02-21,LTN-DXB. Check-in and boarding at Luton was incredibly easy and personal and the private terminal was very comfortable and spacious with very nice shower facilities (food not worth mentioning). This makes up for the headache of accessing Luton airport from Central London. Onboard food was below par. The cabin although comfortable and new was nearly empty on this flight. Arrival at the VIP terminal in itself almost makes the entire trip worth it as there is no hassle or waiting in Dubai's notorious passport control queues. However there was some confusion in finding where to go as this is currently the only commercial airline that uses this terminal and Silverjet staffing here was sparse. After wandering into a private waiting area a few of us were ushered upstairs by a non- Silverjet employee to the correct facility. Agents casually take your boarding passes and return them to you as you relax in the very upscale facility. However their Dubai lounge inconveniently lacks shower facilities and the staff is not subtle about rushing you out as they have shift focus to greeting departing passengers going back to Luton. Silverjet has some issues to iron out but overall is a product worth giving a try.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,David Ellis,United Kingdom,2007-09-15,LUT-EWR-LUT. Outward journey was thoroughly impressive from start to finish. The car valet service happened without a hitch and check-in was over in a minute. The Luton lounge is spacious and comfortable and the 95% occupancy for the flight seemed to be accommodated easily. Security was a breeze and the private bus service to the plane was efficient. On board staff were friendly and attentive throughout and really seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Food was actually as good as I've ever had on a business class flight and the individual attention given to preparing and plating up the food seemed to make a real difference. Immigration and baggage collection at Newark was efficient and our pre-booked chauffeured limo was pretty much ready and waiting. The return journey didn't start too well because of the overcrowding in the Newark lounge. The flight was again full apart from a few seats and the lounge couldn't handle this. I've heard that a new lounge is due to open soon but Silverjet haven't confirmed this. The Silverjet CEO was actually on the flight so hopefully he'll have realised first-hand how unacceptable the current situation is. Take-off was delayed by about an hour because of air traffic control issues. The service on board didn't seem quite as polished as the outbound flight and the food was only average. Sensibly Silverjet offer a two-course meal on the night flight so that one can get the maximum amount of sleep. As others have commented the seats are far from truly flat but comfort wise they're not bad and we both managed to get some sleep. Breakfast is a sort of on board 'take out' i.e. yohourt smoothie fruit and a choice of cheese and ham stuffed croissant or cream cheese bagel in a bag. Not really my ideal for breakfast but probably better than a ghastly reheated omelette and hash browns and certainly easier for the FAs to dispense 40 minutes before landing. Baggage handling at Luton again let the side down but the car valet service was as efficient as on the outward journey. Overall I'd rate Silverjet very highly; better then MAXjet not quite at the level of EOS but then it's half the price.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,P Simpson,NA,2007-08-08,STN to JFK and flight was fine apart from a number of issues. JFK is a disaster for small airlines as the big boys get priority on departure slots. We waited two hours to be assigned a slot sat nailed to the seat unable to visit the bathroom was no fun for anyone. The endless queues in the immigration lounge also should put off any sane traveller. Other points of interest: The food was good (not exceptional) though service speed was ponderous. The tv system sits on the table and is therefore an aggravation when the food arrives due to lack of room. The choice of films/tv programmes is excellent. The planes are old and the bathrooms are in dire need of a professional upgrade - the current bathrooms have obviously had a paint job but the job was rushed and shabby. FAs are ok - some smile some dont. The seats are fine for the price but don't compare to VA or BA's business class offerings. They are vastly superior to Premium Economy seating. The plane could do with on-screen maps to show the progress of the flight and the PA system is poor.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,John Oram,NA,2007-06-13,So inadequate were Maxjet's replies to my two e-mails on disrupted seating assignments that I have written to their Customer Services VP an address provided in their onboard literature. Maxjet are offering a dood fare good seat and pretty good food but let themselves down badly on reliability timekeeping and customer service. The comment on the good seat does not apply to 8D/F which they should not be selling as their regular product. My battles on changed seat assignments continued at LAS. It appears that the Reservations department do not fully understand the impact of aircraft changes some of which occur because of Maxjet's flaky reliability. The inbound aircraft was late but still had time to go out on time at 5pm. However they were always chasing the clock when the cabin crew were boarded late perhaps because of the TSA. We didn't push back until 5.15 and then had a 20min taxi. One thing that goes straight out of the window with time constraints is the canape service which I have not seen in a while. I imagine they are loaded so am I to understand that they are simply wasted? Maxjet show an overall time of 10hrs LAS-STN which I think is actually unachievable given the time factors at LAS and flight on two engines. The pilot made a bizarre departure announcement that the forecast weather for London was 54 degrees (F) and must have been reading an actual rather than a forecast. My lobster was unexpected and very good but it would have taken more than an agreeable crustacean to improve my overall impression of Maxjet on my 4th round trip.

After almost 20 minutes and about 40 plus customers all standing about awaiting bags, several customers like myself started making approaches to Jetstar.

Jetstar never made any PA announcements, nor did they apologise when we finally got luggage 1.25 hours after the flight landed. They aren't a cheap airline to fly on anyway.

The food was interesting - a tangerine and a dry bread roll (no butter or anything) - but it was inoffensive. Passenger discipline an issue as it is on most domestic Chinese airlines : one stupid woman stood up to get her luggage out the bins when we were still about 100 metres in the air.

As a normal Qantas traveller and having not travelled on Jetstar for 8 years I was pleasantly surprised of how good the service was. The flight itself was full and boarded late. Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas.

We were put up in a below average hotel and left in the dark about further arrangements. The next day we called them every half hour but they themselves did not know what went on. Furthermore they told us that we could not easily get our luggage. In the end I had to get very angry. Only then did they become more co-operative.

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,G Cook,Australia,2014-10-12,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary.

First trip on the 'Dreamliner' which might as well be named 'Nightmareliner'. I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner.

We checked in with no dramas and we boarded and flew out exactly on time. Once seated however I discovered that a mother and two young children aged around 4 and 6 years were seated behind me and the youngest child started to kick the back of my seat pull the tray up and down and make a fair amount of noise bickering with the other child. I put up with it until after takeoff before getting the attention of a flight attendant. I explained the situation to her quietly so as not to offend anyone and we were moved to a seat at the back of the plane immediately no questions asked. I can appreciate that it is difficult for children to sit still when flying but I was not looking forward to having my seat kicked for 2.5 hours and I was grateful that flight staff on Jetstar were able to move us quickly and without fuss.

Jetstar insist that their own international passengers claim their bags at Sydney domestic and then carry them across to International although they will check bags through for American Airlines passengers! In fact nowhere on the ticket is it mentioned that passengers have to make their own way from the domestic terminal in Sydney to the international - either a bus or a train fare away. The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid. I would suggest that elderly passengers in particular stay away from Jetstar International if their flight involves a domestic connection because Jetstar will require them to claim their own luggage and check in again at the connection point.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,3,3,0,NA,NA,3,0

The fare was surprisingly low for this time of year (under $900) but the service was top-dollar. Seats on A330-200 were maybe a tiny bit tight but basically comfortable overall (took an aisle seat toward the back with fewer seats in the rows). A full plane but any situations were quickly dealt with by the friendly helpful cabin crews departures and arrivals were quite punctual and connections were handled perfectly. Decent meals (with freshly warmed bread rolls served from a separate basket - a nice touch) and plenty of drinks available throughout the flight.

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,J Rose,United States,2012-06-11,SYD-HNL Star Class. Typically poor experience on Jetstar. Exceedingly long queue for business class check-in of 45 minutes they were checking in 3 flights using only one counter for business class. Several agents standing around doing nothing. Inflight experience leaves a lot to be desired. Star class bears no resemblance to international business class standards. Seats are much more akin to US domestic airlines first class seats with limited recline limited legroom and a worthless footrest. When the passenger in front of me reclined my knees were jammed against the seat. I measured 6 inches of space between the seatback and the front edge of my seat. Do not be fooled into thinking this class is a bargain at any price. Cabin service was cool and indifferent. Cabin attendants served meals and disappeared for the rest of the flight.

Tight legroom made a bit more bearable for short flights by having magazines etc behind the headrests rather than jammed up against one's knees. On the forward journey I observed the cabin manager briefing a passenger with mobility issues about safety aspects of the flight.

No food or drinks offered on domestic sector. Seats in business are really premium economy and the only inflight entertainment option was an ipad that was only given out after the meal service.

The A380 was a dream with a tomb like silence in the upper deck. The service is as good as any Middle Eastern airline and the connections to places like Vietnam from New York are amazing. The trouble is that they ruin it all with the transfer desk in the Seoul airport. After a relaxing flight, you arrive in Seoul at 5 AM and are tossed into a seemingly endless maze of travellers who are forced to go through security all over again to transfer flights. There are no special lanes for business or first class. Poor families with babies are also tossed into the cauldron.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,G Cueto,United States,2015-04-26,I live in DC but flew out of NYC to MNL and TPE via Incheon to take advantage of the lower fares offered out of JFK and to fly the A380 on the NYC route (vs 777 on flights to Dulles). I had flown EVA Air 777 JFK to TPE a few months prior and Y class seats on the Korean A380 definitely felt more spacious both in terms of pitch and seat width. And the more generous headroom on this aircraft was also noticeable. I also appreciated that the Korean lunch/dinner option (usually a pretty healthy bibimbap or some variation thereof) always came with soup and the snacks between meals - fruits chips chocolate hot ramen and/or hot sandwiches - were filling and tasty. The attendants treated customers with respect. Flight attendants were proactive helping parents with babies. I also thought the attendant uniform and the overall branding and color scheme of the airline were quite stylish and appealing. The AVOD movie selection was comparable to EVA but not as good as Cathay or Singapore. The only downside to the journey was the horrendously long and slow-moving check in line in Manila. Online check in was out of commission so I arrived at MNL a full three hours before the flight and completed check in with only 50 minutes to spare. But I suspect this had more to do with the poor infrastructure at this particular airport/terminal than Korean Air. Incheon is a wonderful airport for with lots of pleasing amenities for extended layovers so I would not hesitate to fly Korean (or Cathay for that matter) for future transpacific flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Due to the many changes in itinerary aircraft equipment and seat assignments made by the airline I had 45 mins minimum connection time in Seoul which did work barely as the flight was on time and the connecting passengers were escorted from the arrival to the departure gate. The return leg departure time for the flight from Xi'an to Seoul was brought forward without previous announcement (although this is part of their terms of service). I had previously been obliged to change my itinerary to return to LAX instead of SFO when this flight had originally been re-scheduled to depart later. Now I find with the revised earlier departure that I could have taken the SFO flight after all and made my connection back to SFO. I did get a free pass though for the Prestige Lounge for the 3.5 hour layover. The return flight to LAX was on a packed A380 and the cabin staff were completely disorganized rushing individual meals from one end of the main cabin to the other. The meals were okay but not served up to the standard of their competitor Asiana Airlines. The traditional decorum of the cabin staff wore thin dealing with a huge Chinese tour group who had probably never flown before. The leg room is restricted by almost 2 inches due to the thick airline sales catalogues that they cram into the seat pockets.

Several flight attendants were friendly but a couple wouldn't make eye contact or smile. I don't have a huge issue with those that don't smile or are too troubled to say hello but the following was certainly unacceptable: The seats are below average in legroom. I'm 5'5"" and thought that it was tight legroom for me! The flight attendants were on a mission to complete tasks and be done with attending and I can give several examples. On a 3.5 hr leg we flew Premium Business and the attendant didn't come through until she had finished prepping the meal - no drinks were offered beforehand. She came through in one swoop returned once to retrieve and another final offer of service. On a 9hr day flight the service was similar swooping through to be done. We had 5.5 hrs of absent flight attendants. An overhead compartment opened mid-flight and remained open for 1.5-2 hrs until a passenger closed it. This not only a safety issue but just another plain example of the laziness that seems to omnipresent with flight staff. On this flight we had to get up 2-3 times to get water from galley and they flight attendant couldn't be bothered to poor the water into the glass.

A flight to JFK will include a certain number of Americans who don't prefer warm drinks. The cabin in row 14 was extremely warm i.e. uncomfortable. When using the restrooms I noticed the rear of the plane was quite comfortable. I went to ask flight attendants if something could be done of if they could look into the temperature. They acted like it was a crazy request. A few hours later after my hands and feet were uncomfortably swollen a flight attendant stopped by to see if anyone had answered the call button. This I'd pressed about an hour before. This is lousy service. This flight attendant was marvellous. This new attendant however said that the pilot controls the cabin temperature and in fact it was quite warm in our area. She said she'd discuss the issue with the pilot.

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,Chris Beck,United States,2015-03-04,I flew LAN on Feb 14 from JFK to MVD via SCL. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8pm. However it snowed (not heavily) that afternoon. Arrived at JFK with plenty of time. Flight shown on departure board as being on time. I was at the gate at 7pm and the flight still showed on time however there was an Air Berlin plane at our gate. According to the agent the flight was still leaving on time even though the plane was not there. We finally left the gate at about 10pm and had to wait to be de-iced. Took off at 11pm. Plane was a Dreamliner and other than the having little room between seats was great. Food service on LAN was much better than on American which I usually use to go to MVD. Flight attendants were young enthusiastic and had good rapport with the passengers. Dinner was a choice of beef or pasta and I chose the beef which was quite good. LAN still uses regular cutlery for meal service (no plastic ware) and glass for wine (no plastic cup). Breakfast was also a choice of two different meals cheese sandwich or eggs and sausage which I chose. The eggs and sausage came in s ceramic dish. Far cry from American's minuscule continental breakfast. Arriving at SCL all transit passengers went to transit area LAN had already printed boarding passes for connecting flights and also provided voucher for food while waiting for the connection. I don't think that any US carrier would do that nowadays. Flight from SCL to MVD was on A320 which was more comfortable than seating on Dreamliner. LAN offered snack service (sandwich and beverage) on 2.5 hour flight which most US carriers do not do any more. Return from MVD to SCL was also on A320 boarding pass issued at MVD showed Gate 5 however departure board showed Gate 4 (which was correct gate). Again LAN offered snack service to SCL. SCL to NYC was a nightmare. We were scheduled to leave at 11pm but did not depart until midnight. The plane was full with families with children onboard many of whom cried screamed at night. Perhaps airlines should keep a stock of pacifiers on board. After take off dinner was served and again the offerings were much better than American's. We were scheduled to land at 8am at JFK as we began our approach and landing gear and flaps were down the captain announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather conditions and we would go to Newark instead. Landed at Newark at 9.30am and waited for an hour on taxiway for gate to be made available. Disembarked at 10.30 and by 11 was through passport control. Then we had to wait for 90 minutes for the luggage to start coming onto the carousel. Left the airport at 1pm.

The flight departed at midnight and arrived in Santiago at 6.30am next day so food option was a quiche for dinner and a muffin for breakfast. I personally expected something better and I did not eat anything in LAN's beautiful lounge at Bogota's airport before boarding. Most people went straight to bed after taking off. One would have to be extremely tired and sleepy to be able to sleep. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. They are very hard and narrow and there is not space to store anything apart from in the literature pocket in front.

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-05-23,BOG-CTG Quick hop between Bogota and Cartagena one way for about £60. There's always a slight issue when flying internally from the capital's airport as neither airline or airport websites taxi drivers nor some employees seem to have consensus on which terminal anyone flies from. The issue with this is that the old terminal has no physical connection to the new so transit between is a bit of a bother. Thankfully all LAN flights currently go from the new El Dorado terminal which is clean and modern. Even though it wasn't that busy it still seemed to take around 45 minutes to get to a check in desk - large numbers of employees chatting rather than working seemed to be the problem. Once checked in quickly through to domestic departures which has a few bars and shops. Warm welcome onboard a brand new A320. Very comfy seats with decent legroom. Minor altercation as we approached the runway as a gentleman behind me had brought a chicken onboard with him unnoticed by the crew - or indeed by any security personnel on the ground. Incredulously the captain elected to take off anyway. Smooth flight with complimentary tea coffee and juice as well as a small snack box of chips and cookies - nicely presented and perfectly adequate for the 60min flight.

Flew this route a few days ago and agree with earlier comments. Online check-in in London only results in you getting an online check-in receipt and nothing else not even priority check-in desk at LHR. Aircraft are dated IFE almost never works. Food is pretty bland and nasty aircraft dirty and crew can be quite rude and snappy.

I was about the only one in biz. Comfortable seat nice inflight entertainment tasty meal and friendly crew. The purser introducing herself was a nice personal touch. 787 Dreamliner is a great silent plane and I like the coloring of the windows instead of blinds.

LAN expect you to be at the airport 3 hours before departure for international flights. They are not joking. Passengers like me who had already checked-in and printed their boarding cards were made to wait outside the cordoned off check-in area. We were admitted after airport security complained about the queue getting in the way of other passengers. After 50 minutes waiting it was my turn but the agent just held his hand up and got out his mobile phone. He was still chatting after I had finished leaving my bags with another agent. Boarded in strict priority of cabin class frequent flyer status and row numbers - then all got on to the same bus! Cabin crew too busy having coffee to check the boarding cards. Crew surly with no smiles or good-byes. Usual economy class type snack. Arrived on time with fairly quick bag return.

A few days after booking we received an email stating that our SJU-DOM flight had been canceled and we would be rerouted through ANU at no additional charge. Inconvenient but we sucked it up. After all it would only be one more hour. Arrival in SJU was stressful. We had to find a LIAT employee to check in and get boarding passes. The transfer service desk was unstaffed and personnel from other airlines told us that they had no idea when a LIAT representative would show. Exited the secure area and checked in at the painfully slow and incompetently staffed check-in counter. The other half waited at the customer service desk inside the airport and checked in when a LIAT representative finally decided to show her face. At the check-in counter I checked in without issue though the computer crashed multiple times. Our 14.50 flight ended up leaving the ground around 16:40. Needless to say we missed our one-hour connection in Antigua. We were livid. Our plane was the largest in LIAT's fleet - an ATR-72. Nice enough clean and comfortable. No beverage or food service but at this point that was not unexpected. Landing in ANU we were informed that although we had missed our ANU-DOM flight the airline ""graciously"" scheduled another flight to take us to DOM. There was a single LIAT employee or so it seemed in the entire terminal – we initially encountered her at the desk that dealt with passengers in transit. There was a line at this desk that reached out the door of the terminal and onto the tarmac as people needed to get boarding passes for this new flight. The new ANU-DOM flight was scheduled for 18:30 but we were not surprised when we took off at 19:00. The plane was on an old Bombardier.

The interior of the plane was so hot probably 50 degrees) that the older passengers were dropping like flies which further delayed the departure by a couple of hours. Sitting beside me fanning himself at high speed (the interior was now like 120 large beserk butterflies) was a flight engineer for LN who explained that there were no spare parts for the Auxiliary Power Unit that provides the AC so that’s why it was hot. I thought that this was not the moment to ask if there could be similar spares shortages for the main engines. People perked up above 10000 feet when they recovered and the cabin crew were not as aggressive as they were on the ground. Your heart goes out to these folks who are on these planes it’s both unpleasant and dangerous work.

Tried to do the online check in and it only worked for one of our tickets. When we got the the airport the lines for check in were long so we all went to the online check in counter and they allowed us to check in. Flight on time and boarding was quick. They serve a horrible roll after take off at 1am which was inedible. Seats quite uncomfortable. Headsets can hardly hear and this looked like a new aircraft. Crew was pleasant enough. Overall uneventful flight. Landed in MUC on time with a 40 minute connection and had to run for our next flight which we made with moments to spare. LH did nothing to make the connection easier which they so proudly advertise.

Check in at LIS was a breeze and flight on time. Breakfast served was okay and service was nice on this 3 hour flight. Got to FRA with a 2 hour connection. Had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. Got to our gate and sat down to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time I went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. LH then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers- nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros! Flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in Mumbai instead of 1am.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,Margot Love,New Zealand,2015-07-19,My original flight for my return to NZ was to Shanghai however due to Thunderstorms at Frankfurt the Paris flight was delayed and arrived an hour and a half late causing missed connection to Shanghai. Hope was given to us by the crew as they said everything was delayed and so we had a good chance but this was a false hope. On the Paris flight the English announcements were hard to hear as the sound was not turned up loud enough to overcome all those that had understood the German announcement and were now talking loudly. Attendants on Dubai flight were friendly and professional. There was mixed customer care when hundreds filed in to the customer service area. Some received overnight kits some received juice and water and some did not. The processing of people got faster when a second area opened up downstairs. Again mixed customer service. I got great service with all vouchers explained as well as clearly written on what was what as well as a meal voucher where as a lady I buddied up with didn't get as good service and no meal voucher. On return to Frankfurt airport the next day for rebooking great professional staff sorting out re ticketing of new flights. Accommodation was supplied in Frankfurt and also at layover on Dubai.

Check in at Lufthansa at new Terminal 2 Heathrow at 06.00 in morning chaotic and lengthy - lots of passengers, too few check-in staff, check in equipment seemed not to be functioning well. Transfer at Frankfurt is complicated and long, compared with for example, Schipol, but better than Paris. All flights pretty full - but full compliments to Lufthansa cabin crew, very friendly and attentive given busy short haul flights. Complete punctuality. Also, a nice touch that pilot comes out of cockpit to say goodbye to passengers at end of flight. In contrast to Heathrow, check in at Barcelona extremely quick and efficient.

The food on the TXL-LUX-TXL segments was a choice of sandwiches (ham or cheee) which was enough for a leg shorter than one hour. The leather seats were very comfortable. The only downside is that LG uses three different check-in systems at all three airports which means that no boarding passes for the onward flights can be issued at either TXL nor SCN. The strangest thing however was that the LUXAIR check-in system would not assign to us seats in the emergency exit row from LUX to SCN.

Cannot fault this low cost carrier departed on time fair legroom on way out much better on return with an emergency seat. Snacks on board were reasonable cost though Mango was let down by the airport baggage claim at both ends. By far the worst was Bloemfontein having to wait just short of 45 minutes. Taking into account that the Mango plane was the only plane there and that it was a 2 min walk from the plane to the baggage reclaim I was sorely tempted to walk back to the plane and get the bag off myself. As for Cape Town there were 4 conveyors to pick from but they loaded/mixed the bags on the conveyor that had baggage from another flight hence major confusion. Not Mango's fault but they should be nagging the airports to get heir acts together,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

The upper deck cabin is comfortable and spacious and the window seats have loads of storage space. The seat was OK but I didn't really find it particularly comfortable for sleeping even with the mattress topper. A bigger softer pillow would have been good. The crew was very proactive and efficient throughout the flight. The chef on call service worked fine and the food was pretty good with a decent snack bar set up at the front mid flight. The IFE was just ok - seemed to be a lot of the same selection as there was in December. KUL-CGK on 737-800 was fine - much more comfortable than European short haul in J class.

Friendly staff -ground and air - and a very punctual performance on both legs. Tasty sandwich two drinks and reasonable comfort on the A320. A little more expensive than the LCC's but it's worth it.

All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the A330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the A380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. MAS now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their A330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for MAS would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money.

On the outbound sector service was generally good albeit a little perfunctory by a male flight attendant who was occasionally a little rushed and gruff. Otherwise the rest of the staff were great. In contrast to previous journeys there was no rush to get the meal service over. There was a good choice of wine and spirits. Inflight entertainment was extensive but not to my liking but that's a personal choice. They supply you with a duvet pillows and a rather sad amenity bag which is embarrassingly cheap and tacky (apart from the creams and moisturizers). The seat is angled flat and is terrible for sleep. I am 183 cm tall and was constantly sliding down and ended up setting the chair at an armchair recline to try and get some sleep. The return flight was great just 6 people in business class so there was lots of attention and the attendants were truly warm and friendly . They got it right in that they were unobtrusive but yet managed to keep their eye on your glass and plate offering second helpings of food and topping up wine regularly. I used the book-the-cook service and my main meal of nasi lemak was just okay nothing special. Bear in mind that nasi lemak out of Adelaide is not to be recommended!

Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person.

It would have been nice to be able to check-in online but on charters this isn't possible apparently. Queues at both airports no more than 15 minutes. I noticed the cabin crew taking time with all customers and being friendly and professional. In my opinion the on-board menu is rather dull and I can't figure out why airlines can't sell stuff of the quality of high street coffee shops either heated or fresh? Both flights were on time and the return flight was in fact early to leave and arrive. Monarch is distinct because of it's high quality cabin staff and characterful identity. No problems experienced but nothing amazing about it all either. Would use again with no problem.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,5,0,3,NA,NA,4,1

monarch-airlines,/airline-reviews/monarch-airlines,Monarch Airlines customer review,Michael Shoesmith,United Kingdom,2015-01-05,Birmingham to Sharm El Sheikh on an A321. The plane was immaculately new the staff were lovely and professional but the leg room is so bad. There are other budget airlines out there with much better leg room. All in all a quick 4 hour 50 minute trip down and an okay 5 hours 40 minutes on the way back but I am nearly 6 foot and it is quite trying on a near 6 hour flight with no entertainment and a 3 x 3 layout on a rather long medium haul flight. I like Monarch for the price and flexible flight times and I know they have suffered recently with the economy and cut backs it is a huge shame that Sharm El Sheikh Hurghada and Banjul is not served by bigger planes. I loved the Airbus A300 when they had it 3x4x3 configuration in the 90's. I would fly Monarch again but preferably Canaries or Cyprus would be my maximum range.

monarch-airlines,/airline-reviews/monarch-airlines,Monarch Airlines customer review,D Smith,United Kingdom,2014-12-01,Just come back from Cyprus with this airline I am 6 foot 4 and the seat leg room is unacceptable for a 5 hour plus flight. I spent most of the way standing at the back of the aircraft. How anyone should have to put up with seats with very little leg room and have to stand most of the journey speaks volumes about the bean counters at Monarch. Also the new seat design is very thin and you can feel the person behind you placing their water bottles in the seat holders which then stick in your back. This day and age travel should not be uncomfortable for 5 hour plus flights or any flights. Flew with Jet Blue last month on an internal flight to Boston and the leg room on a 40 minute flight form JFK was superior with room between my knees and the seat in front.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,5,3,1,NA,NA,3,0

Outbound on a 737 - even though it's only a 3.5 hour flight it's unusual for major airlines not to have individual IFE (even Qantas has it on DRW-SYD!). Return on a 777 that was much more pleasant - in fact just having 9-across on a 777 is a reason to choose Malaysian (or Singapore) over someone like Emirates and their cattle trucks. Otherwise it's the Malaysian I remember from a few years ago - reasonable service facilities and organisation.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,P Anderson,Hong Kong,2014-03-04,I am a frequent flyer. Having flown 6 sectors with Malaysian over Christmas and New Year I have enough experience to make a judgement. The cabin crew are generally inefficient and disinterested. The food is mediocre (breakfast during an 8 hour flight consists of a soggy chicken pasty and no hot drinks). Despite relatively calm flights on all 6 sectors I was offered tea just once due to the seatbelt signs being illuminated for most of the flights on all 6 sectors (which the majority of passengers ignored but the cabin crew ignored their non compliance). No safety demonstration given on 2 flights. They failed to honour a bulk-head seat reservation that they charged me extra for due to a change of aircraft and instead gave it to someone else.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,2,NA,NA,1,0

Check-in at SYD was fast and the agent was really friendly. Fast-track through immigration and security provided because of elite status. Priority boarding for status passengers honoured. Seated in bulkhead rows on both flights where legroom was plentiful. Onboard catering was reasonable and of a decent portion but nothing outstanding. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful with the exception of one particular female attendant on the SYD-KUL leg who was a bit abrupt with other passengers. IFE was AVOD with a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Seat itself was much more comfortable than I was expecting and recline was also quite generous which made it comfortable enough to get a decent amount of sleep on the overnight flight back home. Both flights on time. KUL-PEN-KUL was on very old B737-400s. These planes will thankfully be gone by the end of this year. Priority boarding on the domestic flights for status passengers honoured. Both flights slightly delayed. Peanuts and juice offered on these flights. Cabin crew for these flights were friendly helpful and enthusiastic.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,Emily Borowski,United States,2014-04-24,I flew flight 434 from Munich to Chicago (ORD) on their A340. The plane was new beautiful and the flight attendants were pleasant. I had the chicken with rice meal option and it was good. I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option.

Flight between SYD and KUL were on new A330-300s and flights between KUL and LHR were on the A380s. All flights on time. Cabin crew on all flights were very friendly courteous and helpful without being robotic. Check-in at SYD very smooth and quick with a very friendly agent. Angled flat-bed seats on the A330-300 is behind industry standard but they were comfortable enough to allow sleep but storage space is severely limited. Flat-bed seats on the A380 are much more comfortable with a lot more storage space for personal items but still not an industry-leading product. Forward mini-cabin on A380 feels very private and quiet. On-board catering reasonably good on all flights with the satay being consistently top-notch. Check-in at LHR also quick with friendly agents. All seat requests honoured as well as Chef-on-call meal orders. A very good product overall let down only by the hard product on the A330-300 but it was excellent value for money. Taking everything into consideration Malaysia Airlines will usually be my first choice to Europe.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1
monarch-airlines,/airline-reviews/monarch-airlines,Monarch Airlines customer review,W Ryan,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,This was my first time attempting to fly with Monarch and I will never try this again. The date of travel was 8th Sept 2014 when there was a security alert at Luton Airport where the flight was to originate. I will only address my remarks to Monarch rather than the chaos and mayhem which occurred at the airport. The basic problem was their complete lack of communication with passengers and the complete lack of any Monarch representatives at the airport. All the other airlines were decisive even if it meant the cancellation of flights and made some effort to assist their passengers. I could not help noticing that Ryanair were the first back on their feet and giving coherent advise to their passengers. After waiting hours after the other airlines Monarch cancelled everything giving no guidance as to how we should get out of the departure area when and where we could get our baggage back what if anything we were now being offered etc. The screens in the baggage arrival hall were out of action and it appears that Monarch simply put all the bags from their cancelled flights on any carousel where space was available even if these were being used for the now incoming flights as well. I could go on about this airline where unrelated strike action is now forecast which gives me yet another reason not to use them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,1,0

The plane although it is old it was perfectly fine and the seats were in brilliant condition. You are supplied with a clean fleecy blanket and pillow which are very comfortable. The flight was good meal service was served twice and rubbish collections were frequent. The only negative would be the in-flight entertainment as there are no seatback TV's only in the aisle movies are old and bad quality.

Previous experiences with airline had been mixed. Overall their Business product doesn't have the polish of Emirates or Singapore but is a satisfactory alternative given the price. 777 MEL-KUL A380 KUL-CDG-KUL and then A330 KUL-MEL. 777 is aged but found it very comfortable (more so than the much newer A330). A380 was spacious and seat was good. A330 seemed more cramped than either 777 or A380 and lacked privacy. All flights had good service. Food varied from good to excellent and there was always plenty of it. IFE was a weak spot with not much of any interest to me. Lounges too were mediocre even in KLIA which surprised me being home base. However despite all this given that the cost of the ticket was substantially less than any other carrier and comparable to China Southern it represents good value and would happily fly them again.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

My head was above the seats my knees touched the seat in front and there is just no room.

In fact there seemed to be more babies and toddlers in this cabin than elsewhere on the aircraft! Overall the flight was fine which is probably about as much as you can hope for in Y class. Crew were efficient food was adequate although I'd have preferred sandwiches and a piece of fruit in the snack pack rather than peanuts and cookies.

I booked quite high priced booking class ticket last year hoping to earn more miles and to renew my Frequent Flyer status and loyalty with them just to be faced with the fact that earning miles is now 25% - 50% from mileage flown unless you pay full Y or C priced ticket. 23hrs check in before flight is useless 3 of my 4 flights were of change of equipment and I was automatically moved from reserved first Y row seat to the last rows of the bus. Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles.

Check-in agent at LHR very friendly and advised of fast-track through security and location of lounge. First class lounge (due to OneWorld Emerald status) very nice with great views of the tarmac and having a good selection of food at the buffet stand. A-la-carte menu was of excellent quality. The staff at the lounge were very helpful friendly and accommodating making the experience a complete pleasure. Priority boarding not quite what it should be as there is a boarding gate for business class passengers and economy passengers on the upper deck who board together and a separate boarding gate for first class passengers and economy passengers on the lower deck. Despite this boarding was relatively quick orderly and efficient. Non-alcoholic pre- departure drinks offered. Flight was delayed due to a crew member being injured prior to departure and they had to wait for a replacement crew to arrive. Seat was very comfortable in both the sitting and flat positions. There was also plenty of storage space for personal items. Good selection of IFE with a reasonable amount of latest releases. Cabin crew were excellent on this sector. They were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Pre-ordered meal through their Chef-on-call service was honoured. Quality of meals on this sector was quite good. Flight arrived late into KUL but some time was made up in the air. However it meant that the connection for the flight to SYD was still a bit tight. KUL-SYD was on a new A330-300. This flight was held back to ensure that connecting passengers and their luggage made it onto the flight which was much appreciated. Cabin crew again were great on this flight. My pre- ordered meal was honoured and it was excellent. This was probably the best steak I've ever had in the air! The satay of course was excellent. IFE similar to what was on offer on the A380 flight from LHR to KUL. The seat is comfortable in the sitting position but not so much in the angled flat position. Storage space for personal items is very poor on these seats. Flight arrived an hour late into SYD. Check-in luggage did make it through but did not come out first.

No champagne before take off and no satay which they brag so much about. The older all male crew were efficient but not warm or attentive.

Have found Nok to have the most frequent service however ran into a serious problem with their mobile website functionality which wouldn't allow me to pre-purchase additional luggage before the flight during online check-in. This limitation then 'forced' me to purchase the additional baggage at airport which was priced ten times higher than the online rate (I paid 1200 baht vs 150 baht online). Absolutely no sympathy from surly unfriendly Nok staff the 'all smiles' airline. They told me I should've known and bought the baggage at ticket purchase. This is preposterous as I bought the ticket two months prior and had no idea how much luggage I would have. I don't mind paying a premium but absolutely resent the idea of being extorted into paying a premium due to their own website lack of functionality. Given the frequency of my travel on Nok I would've expected them to be more reasonable and understanding but there is a complete lack of commercial sensibility with the employees basically suggesting that I'm a fool. I am a fool for choosing Nok and would recommend Air Asia or Thai Air on the route unless you like to be taken advantage of humiliated and extorted by draconian policies extortion pricing and rude employees. Their employees all explained this away as Nok being a 'low cost carrier' which is a spurious explanation as the high cost of baggage makes them a 'high price / low service' carrier and other 'low cost carriers' such as AirAsia and Jetstar allow you to buy additional baggage online during check in Nok Air does not.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,3,NA,NA,1,0

So we wait on board for a further 2 hours then are told it was only a minor problem & we can take- off. The only thing we got as an apology was a cup of tea/coffee.

The flight to Lahore was on an ancient A310 which had definitely seen better days. You know that a plane is old when they have to use a VHS tape for the safety announcements! The flight was uneventful until the landing. We were only 1000 feet from the ground when suddenly the airplane ascended sharply the captain then came on the pa and announced that a warning light had come on causing the aborted landing but they had determined that everything was okay and would attempt the landing again. The second attempt was successful but I suspect that the landing gear did not fully deploy on the first attempt! The return was uneventful and luckily on a much newer B777. The only problem was that the IFE was not operational during the flight.

The lounge at Dulles is very nice the plane was spacious food and wine were good. The return was fine as well. My next trip the first leg went very smoothly but now as I approach the final part I am terribly frustrated and disappointed with OpenSkies. Unfortunately I had to book my return flight for this summer in November when my schedule was still a bit up in the air. About 3 weeks ago however I finalized my schedule and saw to my dismay that I would need to change my ticket by about two months. I was bracing myself for a ticket change fee - but was shocked to find out that in order to change my ticket (giving them months notice) I will need to pay $450 in addition to about $150 extra for increased gas prices - that's $600 extra for a flight change with months notice! I emailed and called and spoke with many people - all said that same thing - that's policy no way around it. Now I don't expect a big cooperation to just change their policy for me but I do expect some sort of help or at least a little sympathy when I pay thousands of dollars for a ticket. The lack of care or sympathy from those I spoke and emailed with astonished me! Not only did they not give me a break at all but they didn't even put out the effort to seem sorry for my circumstances. Perhaps most people who use this airline are wealthy but I am not. I used them this year as a special treat and now I am absolutely paying for it. As of today I can buy a round trip ticket with British Airways from Paris to NY for less than $600. And unless a miracle happens soon I'll be paying $600 just to switch the day of my flight.

The experience was stressful like taking a public bus in downtown Bangkok. The plane was a worn-out B747-200. More than 500 passengers packed in. Chiangmai airport is clearly unable to cope with this. Departure area was a madhouse. Departure delayed 45 minutes precisely because of the “cattle-herding”. Taxiway buses had to make many rounds to pack the crowds into the aircraft. We were squeezed into the buses to the point of bursting. Pity the old ladies standing up who had to cling on to dear life. Aircraft was very old with torn seat pockets. Interior looked like an air-con public bus in Bangkok. Audio system not working. Safety procedures shown on video but with no sound. However there are two things I appreciate about this airline. First is that unlike other budget airlines Orient Thai provides just one fare regardless of the day and time of travel – no hidden charges no surcharges no extra charges no tricks! Second the staff behaved quite professionally. But I will not do it again although the fare is considerably lower than THAI. Just not worth the stress!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
orient-thai,/airline-reviews/orient-thai,Orient Thai Airlines customer review,Gareth Duhig,NA,2005-01-01,12/04 on their new onetwo-go 'no-frills' service Phuket - Chiang mai via BKK. Being a budget airline you have to book each sector separately. They are having some issues with their website which makes it difficult to book unless you read Thai (the English option reverts to Thai every time you change a paramater then trying to change it to English takes you back to the start & back in a circle many times) Booking online you should receive an email ticket 24hrs after you book. This didn't happen for me & resulted in a very frustrating 40 mins telephone call being passed from person to person at the call centre - when all Ii wanted was the booking code to enable be to check in i spent the whole time explaining that I didnt want to book a flight etc so I had to get a Thai person to get the info I wanted. From Phuket to BKK we fly on a 747 which was old but comfortable no service was offered on the 60 min flight which was fine. Bags came through quick so we could check in for the next sector to Chang Mai. 757 used on this flight & again given emergency exit rows so very comfortable.

Flight departed on time and arrived an hour ahead of schedule in JFK (however due to congestion we had to wait on the runway for an hour on arriving so no difference in the end).

We flew with Norwegian as part of a package holiday booked through Monarch. At first we were surprised that we were flying with Norwegian instead of Monarch due to Monarchs flights being full. We were a bit concerned when we found out that the airline was a low cost airline but we were extremely impressed. Our outbound flight was on the 29/8/14. We used there self-service check in and it took no more than two minutes to print our boarding pass and drop our bags off and we were through security and airside within 5 minutes. The flight was 10 minutes delayed but the flight still managed to land so early that our coach wasn't even ready for us. Coming back on the 5/9/14 check-in was a nightmare we were in the middle of the queue for check in and still had to wait over 50 minutes it was only after about 30 minutes that they decided to open another check-in desk taking it up to two. The flight however still managed to board quickly and pushed back 10 minutes early. The aircraft we flew on was fairly new and had Boeings new cabin lighting which was really relaxing and changed colours. Cabin crew were smart professional and friendly and although you had to buy your own drinks and snack on the flight (very expensive but it's how they make their money) the service was very good. The plane had wifi and they use the wifi to display the flight details and flight map rather than on the overhead screens. Inflight entertainment was available on your phone/ipad/laptop for 7 euro but for a part of the flight they had short films playing on the screens such as Tom and Jerry. The only thing I can fault about the actual flight is that I found the seats fairly hard but at the end of the day the flight was less than 4 hours.

However I have to say that the whole experience was as good as economy class air travel gets these days. Norwegian is using the budget airline model for this service so if you have to be realistic in that you will either have to pay for everything or take it yourself (drinks snacks pillows blankets etc.). We did a combination of both. All the staff we dealt with were professional and polite we travelled on the Dreamliner both ways which was comfortable and had no issues with the entertainment systems that others have described. We were delayed on the return leg of the journey however this was not the airlines fault as someone had checked a bag and then not turned up for the flight we had to wait while their bags were removed. My only negative comment is that Norwegian put the time of the return flight back by several hours after we had made our reservations. Although we had a lot of notice of this and were offered the option to cancel the flight we were unable to re-arrange our plans as we had already booked connecting flights etc. As we were travelling with young children this was a real pain. It seems that when the transatlantic service works it is great if you can avoid the teething problems!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

The IFE was extremely limited with small grainy screens and within 40 minutes of the 11 hour flight one of the few lavatories was shut down due to the sink facet stuck to the on position. All the above can be somewhat expected with a low cost charter airline however what was must alarming was their flight attendants. On such a long flight they only appeared in economy about every four hours. Of course they were present for the pre-flight speech and then reappeared about an hour later to ""toss"" box lunches to each passenger then quickly pick up the trays (I say quickly because the majority of passengers took one bite and knew instinctively to not eat the meal). After that we did not see another FA for four hours. There was no drink service but we saw many passengers going to the empty galley and figuring out how to open the cabinets searching for water bottles and soda. There were children running and playing tag in the aisles and around the lavatories. Our flight two weeks earlier on a Norwegian 787 from FLL-CPH was wonderful. Great service free wine in economy (we did pay for the seat/luggage/meal package) and a nice IFE system.

After further delays she eventually left Thunder Bay on Porter flight 638 at 21.29 and was diverted to Hamilton during the last stages of landing just minutes before 23.00. The diversion is due to a curfew on landing and taking off from Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport. Our issue is that Porter Airline did not communicate to passengers that the flight would be diverted. Porter did not inform those waiting to pick up passengers at Billy Bishop Airport. Airport was closed at 23.00 and no staff were present. The family member sent to Billy Bishop Airport was left searching for our daughter. We eventually found that the flight was diverted to Hamilton and that our daughter took a shuttle bus to Union Station in downtown Toronto. Sometime after 02.00 am a local hotel was arranged where she stayed for a few short hours before making her way to the Billy Bishop Airport for her connecting flight.

PAL doesn't have online check in for international flights. Fortunately flight was fairly empty and an early morning flight and check in meant that the airport was not as crowded as usual. Painless going through check in with a full compliment of baggage from the family (wife and 3 kids). Immigration and security was a breeze. Because of the few number of passengers on this 6am flight boarding was easy. In fact the plane was fully loaded a good 20 mins before scheduled push back from the terminal. The good part of the flight ended there. I knew beforehand that there was no personal entertainment on PAL's A330 so I loaded the kids' gadgets with entertainment to keep them occupied for the 3 plus hour flight (an eternity in kids' clocks). What ruined the flight for me was the FAs attitudes of just going through the motions of completing the cabin service. It was rushed and no effort was made to accommodate passengers' requests. My wife's aisle cart ran out of the beef option but mine was stocked with it. When she requested for the beef she was merely told they ran out. I had to point out to the FA in her aisle to get the selection from the other cart. The food was pretty tasty for airline food though. Twice requested for coffee and it never came. No after meal drink run and the FAs were just in the galley chatting away. I recall the time when the saving grace of Philippine Airlines was the friendly and efficient service of the staff. Now they seem to even be losing that. I never thought I'd live long enough to see the day when I had better service from American FAs (was on Delta a few months ago) than from Philippine Airlines' FAs.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,1,4,3,NA,NA,3,0

I had lamb kofta one way and lamb tagine the other. Even ice creams and chocolates were distributed after the main course - nice touches for economy class. Inflight entertainment better than average. Negatives were that both flights left around half an hour late with limited announcements and no obvious cause for delays other than the ""late arrival of the incoming flight"" mantra which airlines love bandying about these days. I'm not aware of being late to your last appointment being an acceptable excuse for being late to your next one in any other form of human activity. The other negative is the Qantas approach to pre-booked online seating. The tactic seems to be to open up very few seats in the hope that you will select an emergency exit at extra cost. I am happy so long as I have an aisle seat which took a bit of negotiation both flights and meant sitting next to the rear toilets.

This was the first leg of a multi-leg journey in combination with partner airline Emirates which made for an interesting comparison. A380 although relatively new was starting to look tired inside.

Tasty meal but for an evening service where dinner would normally be served very limited. A tiny carrot muffin and juice served just before landing. Qantas are obviously cost cutting evident through their reduced meal service adding more rows into economy by removing a number of toilets at the rear of the A380 and lack of legroom.

This is not such a direct criticism of them but seeing as there is no way to add feedback or complaints to their website I hope they read this and act on it. Check in at Dublin was very poor. Sky handling partners had only one person to check in a whole flight (for at least 30 mins until someone else came and helped). This was very frustrating as there is no online check in you have no option but to stand in line and painfully watch the families and groups of travelers slowly check in. Flight was at least an hour delayed. Scheduled departure time 1220 actual 1345. Why do they lie to you at the gate and say expected time 1300 - totally unrealistic. As for the actual flight no travel updates from pilots along the way and not much of an apology for the delayed flight from FA's. As I said though this is the 1st time I have had anything negative to say. As for the previous comment about bags. I actually like the lenient approach to cabin baggage.

Apparently a family wished to be accommodated together. The clerk at the counter gave us our new boarding passes row 88. We said we were happy as long as they were not next to the toilets. We don't make a habit of sitting near toilets in restaurants or airplanes hence the reason we paid the money to pre-book allocation. The clerk checked on his monitor and categorically assured us they were not next to toilets. Having boarded the aircraft we realized we were duped. Row 88 is the farthest row back and is sandwiched between two toilets. Furthermore the seats have limited recline. They are also immediately in front of a bulkhead behind which is situated some form of noisy refrigeration unit for the self service galley area immediately behind us. We were not provided with equivalent seats for which we had paid. More to the point they were arguably the worst seats on the plane.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,J Rose,Australia,2014-10-05,JFK-LAX-MEL in economy. This trip turned into a nightmare due to an unimaginable 'operations' decision that adversely impacted the travel plans of 50-100 passengers. As background QF runs the JFK-LAX flight for passengers going onwards to Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane. It is a huge convenience as there is no need to change terminals at LAX no need to go through TSA security a second time and generally better to fly QF transcontinental USA than the US carriers except on this night. That said the JFK-LAX flight on this particular evening was running about one hour behind schedule due to late arrival of the aircraft and typical JFK evening delays - this isn't all that unusual and the delay not all that long. For inexplicable reasons however Qantas chose not to hold the LAX-MEL flight for all of the passengers on the JFK-LAX flight who were Melbourne bound. Even with the one hour delay on the domestic leg we still arrived LAX before the scheduled departure time of the overseas leg and the LAX-MEL flight was running 30 minutes behind as well so Qantas had no legitimate reason not to hold the flight for another 30 minutes or so to get all Melbourne passengers on board. This forced all 50-100 of us to fly a packed B747 instead of the more comfortable A380 lost seat assignments and change planes in Sydney which is more complicated than you would think (domestic and international terminals aren't close and there is no easy from one to the other) and even worse added approximately five hours to the trip. It is inexcusable and Qantas has been unapologetic and unresponsive to emails I've written them about their decisions on that evening.

Middle of the night flight and no pillow or blanket no seats where one could even attempt to sleep on as they do not have head rests that would keep the head where it is - no food either (unless one pays for it and then it's only sandwiches or crisps) - On my online tickets it says by meals (Qantas) - ""we offer a wide variety of food"" - nothing! The least they could have done is tell their customers. If they do a codeshare that is fine but at least offer the same service.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,2,2,NA,NA,3,0
qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,B Johnson,South Africa,2015-06-13,"For someone who has become used to the standard European business class long haul (BA/Lufthansa etc), these middle eastern airlines are quite a revelation.  Much like the Cathay Pacific's of the worlds, these guys put the staid overpriced tiredness of the European airlines in perspective.  Business class on Qatar is, for example,
certainly more than the equivalence of BA's first class. And at significant cost reductions. Part of it is the staff, you just don't get the level of service orientation on European airlines like BA and Lufthansa.  Its like there is no motivation to go beyond the standard, drummed in training they've done a hundred times. You know those adverts where you see the service crew gently put a blanket on a sleeping guest?  I had assumed that was rubbish, it had never happened to me.  Well it did with Qatar!  One of the staff even made a personal plan to get an out of stock duty free item to me!  Unreal stuff.  Or maybe this is how it should be?  And long  may it last, I hope these guys continue to put pressure on the old hens of the sky like BA and Lufthansa - the competition can only be good for the passengers.

regent-airways,/airline-reviews/regent-airways,Regent Airways customer review,S Walker,Bangladesh,2014-01-29,I have flown with Regent a couple of times between Dhaka and Chittagong and Cox's Bazar and in general have found them to be OK although the air conditioning on their Dash 8 aircraft frequently doesn't work. However more recently I have twice flown with Regent on their new 737-400 aircraft fro Dhaka to Bangkok. However when they say new this actually means new for them as both aircraft are leased from other airlines and are actually starting to show signs of age. Only one of them has an onboard entertainment system which didn't work when I was on board and the other (seemingly older) aircraft actually still has ash trays in the arm rests which have been taped up to stop people from using them but on a lot of the seats the ash trays have been removed leaving a rather sharp and dangerous metal edge on the end of the arm rest. On my last trip from BK back to Dhaka the Pilot went AWOL and so were almost 2 hours late leaving BK. The meals on board are very typically Bangladesh and not good and of course you cannot get an alcoholic drink on board. The tea and coffee is also pretty bad. The FA's are for the most part friendly enough but efficiency is not their highpoint. However despite their shortcomings their prices are very good.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2015-05-11,A day before my return to LHR from BKK I received an email from Qatar offering me a good deal for an upgrade to Business Class which I took up. They were meant to start check-in process at BKK airport at 5 pm but did not do so till 5.20. Check in staff was excellent and efficient. I was offered a drink after boarding but not a hot or cold towel. The person next to me was offered both. I opted for a middle seat in order to have aisle access; configuration of 777 is 2-2-2. The seats are indeed very comfortable but there is not much privacy. I was rather disappointed again with the food. I was expecting a lot more. It was all nicely presented and the FAs do go out of their way to make one's journey enjoyable but I do not think the food was as good as people claim and I have had much better food on Cathay and BA in Business. The food from Doha to LHR was even less interesting. And on this leg on an A340-600 the seat was much smaller and with even less privacy. The person next to me almost damaged my glasses which I had put on the little shared area between the seats. The business lounge at Doha is superb but again the food was a let down. My option salmon was not available from the a la carte menu. I had a lamb which was hard and very salty. The buffet stuff looked like something from my local Waitrose and was simple. The snack area was far more interesting. They prepare whatever you want. Lovely. There are many areas in the lounge including a large business room next to which there is an area hardly anyone uses. The so-called 'quiet area' was anything but quiet: people snoring breaking winds pulling trolleys talking etc. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and in no way one can have a good nap there. I do not understand why they cannot put stuff like in the BA's cabanas at T5 with blankets. My verdict is that Qatar Business is good but definitely not well above that of Cathay or BA as people claim.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,5,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2015-04-27,LHR-DOH-BKK in economy all the way on their brand new A380. Two great trips. Only problem is that the food is terrible and portions extremely small. Why do they bother? Best take your own. I had a rubbery chicken which tasted like something else. Space in economy seats on the A380 is extremely generous equivalent to BA WT+. Very impressive. Connection at Doha was very easy: off the plane and straight into departure area for connecting passengers no security check there. I am a BA Gold card EC so am allowed to use First check in First lounges and priority boarding. However Qatar is so fussy about its premium passengers I was not allowed to board via priority First class boarding even though I was in small economy cabin at the back of the upper deck where First and Business are located. I had to board and disembark via usual channels via lower cabin which means if you are in economy in the upper deck you will be last to disembark. Cosy small cabin though. Is this in breach of Oneworld rules regarding perks of being Emerald? The word that first came to my mind is segregation. They take incredible measures to protect their premium passengers from any contact with the rest of us ordinary mortals. I have never seen anything like this in my many years of continuos travelling in First Business and economy. Staff are professional. I had access to First class lounge at Doha which is gigantic nice but mayhem at peak hours. Amazing service though. The good thing about it is that there are several areas one could choose from. I went for the one adjacent to the business centre which was very quiet indeed. Both flight were not full. LHR to DOH was almost empty.

Unlike another airline that completely mishandled my bookings Qantas called me regularly rescheduled flights quickly and allowed free changes to connecting flights that I couldn't make because of a problem with a different airline. That's generally the biggest plus about Qantas - their customer service and ground organisation is efficient and problems are generally resolved quickly. Inflight the experience was good with nothing special. Medium-quality food. Service appears to improved drastically compared to a few years ago. Quality individual IFE on the 737 from Darwin-Sydney but the 737 in the opposite direction didn't have individual IFE - which really seems outdated for a 4 hour flight on a major airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

Qantas flight attendants are some of the most attentive and professional I have come across. The amenity kit was nice and included what one would expect. The printed menu was a bit too casual and three were left for me which was a bit confusing because they were all different. It took me a while to realise (small letters which I find hard to read) that two were from the previous Sydney to Santiago and Santiago to Rio legs (on 11 June the Rio service was a special for the World Cup). Qantas certainly are well above the average and are different in many ways from other airlines. They try to be so different that they do not have a sign for the Business or First classes check in areas in Australia but instead there is just one in black that says Service. This is annoying and idiotic.

I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request ""for technical reasons"" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen.

Because the base airfare was already around $400 cheaper than Singapore Airlines and Philippine Airlines (who fly direct) I was not expecting a great deal. But from this experience I can say that aside from the no alcohol policy there was little to separate the flying experience between RBA and Singapore Airlines. The new B787 flying between MEL and BWN was presented in spotless condition the food onboard was very good and plentiful with very good customer service from the staff. Even on the shorter A320 flights between Brunei and Manila we were served a full meal similar to the longer Melbourne services. Probably the only downside to the experience is the small Airport at Brunei which was undergoing renovations at the time of my trip. Very little to see and do in the small terminal. No wifi TV to watch or even interesting activity on the airfield. Thankfully stopovers did not last much more than one hour or so. Like most modern economy class offerings the economy class seats on the 787 were not so comfortable and felt very hard. I have noticed this is also the case on new SQ A380s and CX 777s so it's not a unique fault of Royal Brunei. But besides these small faults I will be flying with RBA again the next time I return to Philippines and can say that as an overall experience they were well worth the money.

IFE system a bit on the old side but there was a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Meal was tasty and of a good portion. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Return flight to SYD was an overnight flight. Seat not great for sleeping as legroom not quite enough. Maybe another 1-2"" of pitch would have made all the difference. Cabin crew were very good on this flight.

CMN to LHR - absolute chaos checking in nothing works baggage labels not printing took over 1 hour just to check 1 piece of luggage in - no apology no explanation. Upon boarding it was noticeable that the level of cleanliness was not up to scratch. Staff spoke broken English and were all rather rude. Half way through the flight I started to get a head-ache switched on the attendants light and sat there in excess of 20 minutes before a very kind fellow passenger actually went up to the business class section to speak to the crew manager. The attendants replied 'We are not on duty now - we do not have to serve you anymore'!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,Booked MAN-DOH-HKG return. DOH-HKG operated by CX so this review refers only to the MAN-DOH sectors. Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room) return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia. However both flights were early and the fares were excellent value even after paying for a change of flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,3,2,NA,NA,5,1

I flew from London Heathrow-Casablanca which was bearable although the staff were very rude and aggressive - they obviously have no customer service skills. I would probably lose my job if I spoke to customers the way this airline's staff do. The return journey was a shambles - the original flight from Marrakech- Casablanca was cancelled and no explanation given so I was put on another flight at a later time which meant I made the connection from Casablanca-Heathrow with mins to spare.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2014-10-31,Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all honesty isn't the best I’ve been in but as it was almost empty its OK to while away an hour or so plus they come and tell you when your gate is open. Unfortunately the usual carryon once in the departure area of people standing directly in front of the doors despite being told to sit down and wait for the announcements a few passengers tried to follow the wheelchairs through the doors. Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around.

royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,L Bree,Australia,2013-10-25,We flew business from Melbourne to Bangkok via Brunei within the last month. Decided to fly business as the price was better than others on the same route. In perspective it offered good service for the money. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne is adequate and comfortable. On boarding you are offered a drink (non-alcoholic of course) and hot (very hot) towel. Shortly after take off you are given a menu to mark what you want and then offered a series of magazines etc. The entertainment system worked fine the selection adequate. Meals were huge you could have five courses then snacks also if you wished. The service was excellent going with less in the cabin (business) but coming back it was full and the two people serving were struggling. I asked for a duvet instead of a meal coming back and I was eventually given that when the meal service was complete which was not my aim (I wanted to sleep through service). Anyway it was fine really the price was right and it was a comfortable easy flight. The staff are very nice Brunei airport is small but functional. Arriving our bags were first off which was very nice and on arriving back in Melbourne were given a fast pass but that didn't matter as the plane was the first international that landed.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

All flights on 777-300ER except DOH-FRA which was an older A330-300. This was our first time with QR (would normally use SQ or CX for this type of trip)and we were quite impressed with the overall economy service. Planes were quite clean and well maintained although the A330 was definitely showing its age. We found all staff to be professional and in general were quite friendly even if smiles were a little limited. The economy food was surprisingly good and varied plus of decent quantity. Alcohol limited without asking but always available. Call buttons seemed to get quick attention from what we observed. All flights on time or early except for one which was only 20 minutes late. I found economy seat comfort and legroom acceptable despite being 192cm tall. Very happy the QR 777 is 9 abreast and not the 10 across that some others try to squeeze in. Connection in DOH was a breeze (we had over 2 hours each way).

Had an emergency exit row window seat upstairs which seemed to me to be the best on the aircraft. Ample storage space around the seat. The only drawbacks of the new layout are that you need to climb over your neighbour to get out at night from the other window seats and the overall metallic grey colour scheme is decidedly dismal and depressing. The flight was punctual and the cabin service of a very high standard indeed. Lunch was excellent with even a desert wine available.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Walker,Bangladesh,2014-01-29,Living in Asia there are not a lot of route choices with Qantas especially as they have recently withdrawn a lot of their Asian flights and/or downgraded from 747 and A380 to A330 aircraft. However as I am still a Qantas Gold member I decided to remain loyal and travel back to Brisbane (via Sydney) from Bangkok. This flight used to have Premium Economy but since the introduction of the 330 aircraft there is only Business or Economy and so because of the exorbitant price for Business Class ($3920) I chose to travel Economy. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable with a ridiculously small amount of leg room (I am only 178cm so I have no idea how a tall person would cope). The seat fabric and carpet was very worn and faded and stained and the entertainment system only worked for the first 2 hours of my return trip. The food was terrible but thankfully the wine was good. However by far the worst issue is the FA's most of them have obviously been in their jobs way too long and no longer seem to enjoy what they do and show it through their couldn't care less attitude and lack of attentiveness to their customers. I am now thinking about taking my loyalty to Malaysia Thai or Cathay Pacific all of which are far better and less expensive than Qantas.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

The Trans-Tasman service was the early business shuttle with a Jetconnect 737-800. Firstly the IFE itself was fantastic same provided on the A380. For a 3 hour flight it was more than satisfactory. The screen itself was large and at the perfect height for viewing. The seat itself was rather narrow and the seat pitch was rather narrow (and I have a height of 5ft 5!). However we can attribute this to the size of the aircraft. The Flight Attendants themselves were fantastic and were overall bright and cheerful for the early flight time despite one haughty young woman (no more than 20) who was leering and smile-less for the entire flight. When I merely asked her for a blanket and pillow she gave me a scowl as if it were the hardest thing for her to do. However the overall flight was great. On to the A380 service to HKG. The seat pitch was more than sufficient and the width was great. The IFE screen was large and had more than enough entertainment for the 9 hour flight. The Flight Attendants were bright and cheerful for the whole flight and the catering of lunch and pizza bread refreshment was hot and fresh - probably due to the introduction of induction ovens on the A380.

Qatar Airways offers a Business Class layout as First Class on this route we flew out on a 777 and returned on their new 787-8 a first time for me on the Dreamliner personally I would call my review a mixed review. No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated.

Departure delayed due to an ill passenger having to be off loaded but the cockpit crew kept everyone informed of the situation. Seats are not the newest design but the airline supplies a duvet too fit over the cushions as well as pyjamas which really aid sleeping. The crew were very friendly and efficient making the trip all the more enjoyable. For example they got some balsamic vinegar for me as I could not use the dressing provided. My main gripe is about the food. The salad is just a few leaves and the main course I had amounted to a fancy Panini sandwich. Nice as it was it did not fit the business class image. Nor did breakfast which was a choice of either fruit one cinnamon cake or a spinach/cheese tart. Rather poor given you often get more in economy class on some routes. Baggage delivery at Sydney was quick which was good. All in all not bad for a first experience of Qantas but I think they really need to look at improving the food offerings on long haul judging by this flight.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,5,5,2,3,NA,NA,4,1

Out of 10 trips in 10 weeks the plane has been delayed by more than 45 minutes twice causing me to miss my flight connections. Let's not even talk about smaller time delays. When I was flying business from BWN to BKI on 19 April 2012 the flight was delayed and I was not going to be able to make my connection. I asked the staff in the business lounge whether she could switch my flight to Singapore and she said she had to ask her manager to come to a decision whether they could switch my flight. The manager took more than 20 minutes to arrive and because of that they couldn't issue me a flight ticket due to the fact that we were too close to the boarding time for Singapore. The attitudes of attendants and the bureaucratic decision making hierarchy of Royal Brunei creates a highly antagonistic customer environment. In addition for the past 3 months that I have been flying Royal Brunei the online check in facility isn't available. Imagine that from a full-service airline!

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,2013-11-22,Bangkok-Doha-Cairo and back. All in all a very pleasant and civilized experience. Reservation and online check in and seat selection a breeze. At the airport very pleasant staff and my online check in had me bypass a rather huge line at the regular check in as I only needed a baggage drop off. The colour coding of Qatar Airways and the airport is great. The check-in was handled in Bangkok perfectly with rows as well as seats navigated from the left 1 and 2 doors. This resulted in a very speedy and no stress boarding of a fully booked huge airliner. Staff were great with a personal service but without the over-cheesy attitude of another Middle Eastern airline. The food was good and the staff ran every 30-45 minutes with drink rounds. Connection was short and the airport OK. Flight to Cairo was good and the staff had to work double to control passengers that simply ignore every and each announcement from standing while landing etc. The return flight was good but certain points ruined the perfect first impression. Check in was closed but the screens were on and staff at economy check in with a large crowd. The boarding was terrible but I guess I can attest to the less than friendly Cairo terminal 1 holding gates that is barely enough for a small plane but not a 100% booked 777-300. It was a bit of chaos and people standing everywhere. Very claustrophobic. I would suggest Qatar to change its check in counters from the very tight side of T1 as there was no space whatsoever and to request 2 gates since at the moment of waiting to be bussed to the plane it was a less than 1 star experience. Otherwise the flights were on time food great and staff consistent. Definitely will recommend and I believe that the new airport in Qatar is desperately needed. The transfer was very easy and rather pleasant but the terminal was a bit too basic. So 7/10 just for not being able to handle check in and boarding as elegantly as in Bangkok. Qatar should look into it.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Bangkok flight was on 777 a vast improvement on the airbus comfort wise similar to previous flight movie and a little doze had a walk down to the galley for a drink and spent some time chatting to the cabin crew. A nice breakfast and arrived in Bangkok on time. Luggage already on the conveyor by the time I'd cleared customs. When I checked in for return flight I used my Qmiles to upgrade to business class from Doha - Manchester so checked in at the business counter and discovered I'd been upgraded to Silver level so I was given access to the priority customers clearance and a pass to the business lounge a nice surprise. Just after boarding the senior cabin attendant came to see me and explained she was aware that my next flight was in business and that prior to landing in Doha she would move me to a seat closer to the business cabin so I could go on the business class but direct to the premium terminal. I spent 8 hours in Doha that the reason for the upgrade to business had a nice dinner followed by breakfast before boarding the flight.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2015-05-13,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,1

The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Mark Smith,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,I was booked on a flight from Birmingham to Dublin today. On all other flights being a small hop flight you can turn up an hour before the flight do a self-service confirmation get your ticket and get on a flight. I arrived an hour early and was told I had missed my flight! I asked the helpful airport staff and they directed me to the Ryanair desks. 50 minutes to go - no staff on any of the 5 desks. When I enquired further the airport staff told me that since I had not checked in on-line they had closed the flight. They would not be manning the desks again until 10 minutes after my flight left. They told me that even if I could have booked in on the self-service (Ryanair only) terminals I would have been charged an extra £60 for checking myself in. My advice? If you are a business traveller never use Ryanair. The lack of any customer service is appalling. I would rather pay a lot more for a seat with a company that cares about its passengers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,0
sata-air-azores,/airline-reviews/sata-air-azores,SATA Air Azores customer review,G Evans,United Kingdom,2011-07-10,London Gatwick-Ponta Delgada Sao Miguel Azores. The outward flight departed on time Airbus A320 aircraft looked in an excellent condition very clean and looked brand new. Flying time 3hrs 40 mins very smooth flight with no turbulence. The crew were very friendly and helpful. A passenger was unwell during the flight and the stewardess was very caring bringing extra drinks cold towels and checked how she was feeling every so often. The flight was approximately three quarters full. The small complimentary baguette tasted nicer than it looked and there was a chocolate bar with tea and coffee. In addition to this there was two rounds of soft drinks water apple juice orange juice etc all complimentary. Alcoholic drinks were available for a charge. The outbound flight was direct but the return flight was via Manchester. The flight left on time just after 1pm and we arrived in Manchester 10 mins early. Flight was very smooth with the same complimentary drinks and sandwiches as the outbound flight. Cabin crew were friendly and very professional. When we landed in Manchester Airport there was some confusion. We knew before hand that we had to disembark the aircraft at Manchester. Some of the passengers were unaware of this and the crew only mentioned that the Gatwick passengers had to disembark when we landed. When the cabin doors opened all of the passengers for Manchester and Gatwick stood up and the crew announced that the Gatwick passengers should sit down to let the Manchester passengers disembark first. If the crew told us this before hand it would have made life much easier. The Gatwick passengers eventually disembarked (with lots of moans and groans) and the passengers were given an in transit boarding card. Gatwick passengers had to take all of their hand luggage to the security check point have the bags scanned and then board the same plane back to Gatwick. The whole process was ridiculous but apparently this is due to UK immigration not SATAs fault. We departed Manchester on the same aircraft 1hr later for the 35 mins flight to Gatwick. We arrived in Gatwick over 20 mins early. Overall very impressed with SATA. Modern aircraft excellent timekeeping with a friendly and professional crew.

For some reason they revved up the left engine to full blast when the plane was parked and then throughout the flight that engine's rev level was continually and dramatically going up and down.

Check-in was easy and smooth and the flight left on time. However from there on things got disappointing. Since the flight was the most expensive one I expected better service than LCC level buy-on-board service which was offered. Also seat comfort was terrible due to the aircraft having those awful Recaro Slimline Seats which are possibly the most uncomfortable things in the sky. Even Ryanair is better than this and they charge a reasonable fare unlike SAS. This is poor value for money. This really lets them down as their crews are very friendly and helpful. What also lets them down is their chaotic hub at CPH. Arriving and departing passengers are not separated and therefore it is a bit difficult to find the baggage reclaim area and it takes a long time to get there. Furthermore the airport is clearly understaffed as we were stuck in the queue at immigration for 15 minutes + which is unacceptable given that the airport had only 1 out of 4 passport control booths open at the time. I would fly SAS again but only if they are cheaper than any other option because the value for money is poor and the comfort is poor.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,5,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

The plane a very old ATR72 was in the colours of Jet Time a small Danish charter airline. It was parked at the most distant gate in the sun. Copenhagen had a hot summer day the outside temperatures were around 30C. The plane stood in the sun without any power supply thus no ventilation or air condition was working. It must have been around 35 to 40 degrees in the cabin everyone was dripping sweat. And we had to wait and wait for two SAS pilots who were obviously needed in Hamburg. SAS had delayed this flight to get their pilots into Hamburg. We left about 35 minutes late. The seats were extremely narrow service consisted of the 125ml orange juice package.

The aircon was broken it was freezing and we weren't offered different seats even though there were many available that were much warmer. Eventually given a free blanket hours later. The sorting out of pre-booked meals is stupid. It takes hours to get all the pre-booked meals delivered and meanwhile there is no service from the cabin crew you cant get a drink or anything until about 2-3 hours into the flight.

Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot.

At 10.30 am got an SMS advising a 2.10 delay so I'll miss the connection. I called my travel agent in Australia and asked him to find an alternative. I was quite willing to drive to Shanghai and change onto SQ 17.00 flight - it had seats. I was given the complete run around by Silk Air directed to three different phone numbers with no one willing to act. Next I got my secretary in Hangzhou to try she got the exact same outcome. After about 6 calls over 3 hours time had run out. I took the original flight and missed the connection. At Singapore at midnight SQ gave me a hotel voucher for the Conrad and told me to take a taxi. The taxi queue was at least an hour long. I would have had a couple of hours sleep before needing to get up and return. At the SQ desk I swapped this for a much more logical bed in the ""pay by the hour"" mini hotel in T3. Why wasn't this offered in the first place? Why do I have to ask? Silk Air A320? I had a seat in 2nd row avoiding the 1st row - that has too little leg room. There is in no power point despite being a 5 hour flight so my PC battery ran out.

Super polite friendly and helpful staff at all times. Plenty of food drinks and snacks and virtually every meal has a ""Chinese"" and ""Western"" choice.

We went return from Luton to Marrakech and would not do this journey with them again. In fact we'd only think about it for very short flights for weekend breaks and to be honest that would be pretty desperate. Where to start? They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat. After all who wants to gallivant around an unfamiliar foreign city looking for an internet cafe that may or may not have a printer. The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows! They couldn't even be bothered to give out landing cards either which just prolonged the bad experience at the airport. I reckon that after all the add-ons it would have been cheaper to fly with BA.

I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with âstuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with.

I noted down the exact service timings on a 75 minute flight (SQ959) between Jakarta and Singapore on 4 Dec 14. Flight take off 15.05 special meals service started 15.15 I was served at 15.50 and my tray was taken away at 16.03 when I had not quite finished the meal. If you order a special meal you will be embarrassed to receive it too early when your neighbors have even not received their drinks. The tray-by-tray special meal service takes so much time that those receiving a standard meal have very little time to eat it at least on short flights. In the glory days of Malaysian Airlines (which I almost exclusively flew between 1998 to 2009) somehow they would bring the special and regular meals together so that all passengers were served at the same time. Wonder if SQ could think of some way to reduce the time lag between special meal and regular meal service? This is not a complaint but a suggestion.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

Flight last Friday from Treviso to Bristol was due to take off at 15:20 but about 30mins beforehand a small storm arrived with torrential rain and lightning meant there was likely to be some delay. However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known!

Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again.

For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random.

First time I have used them for a while and the gaudy yellow and blue cabin interior is a bit hard on the eyes but the crew were friendly and efficient and the legroom and leather seats were better than the Monarch flight we flew down on.

In addition I've travelled with them from UK to Indonesia via Singapore many times. I think I've been to Singapore around 90 or so times. I've seen terminal 123 all built and improve their great standards. I have huge admiration for Singapore. But in recent years I feel S Airlines has cut and cut its standards. Sadly they seem to be steadily slipping down in standards as they expand. It used to be easy to contact SA and change bookings add trips etc. But now it's a major hassle to get into contact. The food (I travel economy class) is truly awful. It used to be OK. I don't eat a great deal or care a great deal about food but the stuff served up is inedible! I saw many meals barely touched. The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good. The ground ticketing staff in Singapore were rather incompetent. I wanted a business class side trip to Indonesia. It took about 4 staff to look into it for half an hour and they said none were available. I went economy anyway and found every seat in business class empty.

The flight itself was fine professional attendants good information and reasonably priced snacks. However the outbound flight was delayed by 90 minutes (not good on a Friday evening) and the return was suddenly flashed up as being delayed by 3 hours as I queued at PRG for the check in! No information was volunteered the check in staff were not employees of the airline and couldn't explain the delay so i spent a thoroughly dull afternoon in one of the least interesting airports in Europe. Speaking to my Czech friend again she told me that because they are quite new and not part of the CSA (Czech Airlines) ""club"" Smart Wings is basically the first carrier to be bumped down the priority list when problems occur. I hope this will change because there is clearly a growing demand for cost effective travel to what is a delightful city but I am personally going to leave Smart Wings alone for the time being and pay the little bit extra with easyjet CSa or Lufthansa.

Make sure you have booked in any hold luggage on line its much cheaper but you can take 10kg each as hand luggage6 of us so spreading it round saves you a lot of money.

I do not have a printer so just pop down to a local library to print them out. Yes Ryanair is a bit like catching a bus and you just sit where there is space but so what flight times are not long haul and I'm sure you can put up with it for a few hours. There is a lot of selling during the flight but again so what. Don't buy anything if you don't want to. Food is a rip off agreed so I have never purchased anything.

Staff were also abrupt in directing passengers to fold up their blankets and stow bags on a better airline the staff would do this themselves if it was so important.

Boarding on time but very chaotic. Boeing 737-800 looks very old. Not very comfortable seating. Plane is delayed for 40 minutes 'as 12 meals in Economy are missing'. I can't believe it. As a result food was almost inedible because it has been put in the oven at boarding and was completely overcooked. Upon takeoff some (minor) parts of the cabin ceiling fell off.

south-african-airways,/airline-reviews/south-african-airways,South African Airways customer review,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,2013-10-18,Flew Jo'burg to Heathrow with SAA. A rather chaotic boarding process in which those at the rear of the plane ended up often boarding last because they didn't embark via seat rows. It therefore took twice as long as it needed to to get everyone seated. The cabin was boiling hot and as is often the case we were seated for a very long time before the plane went anywhere without so much as a glass of water though of course those in business class were busy quaffing champagne as we baked. Dinner and drinks service was good and served by efficient and fairly friendly crew unlike our outbound flight. IFE is really not up to scratch now compared with the competition and my handset kept jamming with TV programmes and games taking an age to load. Seats are rock hard so very uncomfortable for a long night flight but one of the crew helpfully suggested that my partner re-locate to the empty seats in the row in front of us which meant we both (and those next to me) had more room.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,1,4,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

Both flights left bang on time and arrived early inbound even 45 mins earlier. Efficient boarding on big A380 which has fantastic IFE but not more legroom than any other plane or airline.

Flight on a new 737 but legroom was tight but the seats were ok for a short 3 hour flight. Service was extremely inefficient it felt like the cabin crew did not go through proper training. It took them more than 2 hours to service the entire aircraft and we were lucky enough that we pre-ordered our meals beforehand. Also they served our meals first before our drinks which should have been the other way around. We nearly choked waiting for our beverage. Food however was of excellent quality.

Movies: Did JFK-JNB-JFK in the same month so I was hard pressed by the end of March but it is a good on demand system. Value for money: SAA has monopoly on the routes to South America from SA so they can and do charge what they like. Worst Part: SAA continues to use low grade cheap instant coffee in Business class which is not acceptable when so much attention has been paid to other aspects of the product. Additionally JNB-EZE is day time flying during comparatively 'normal' hours either side of the south Atlantic yet SAA insists on blacking out the cabin with all window shades down. 11 hours is too long to sit in artificial blackout especially since I have never been in SA226/7 when Business class is more than half empty.

Duvet and pillow are real! Food (on long haul) excellent (didn't look at it on the SA local sections) though SAA offers the worst instant coffee. I am usually disinterested in the food on most airlines but this was notably good. I'd forgo some of the service item enhancements to have a decent cup of coffee. Staff: All exceedingly efficient. Some - I suggest those who have been there many years very efficient to their duty but not vaguely hospitable. The others all excelled in all areas. Movies: on demand large choice headsets are not noise cancelling but a good system all the same.

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,Lee Ho Seok,United States,2013-03-06,CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected.

This was a constant announcement for several hours. Then about 5:30pm the gate agent announced that they are giving our plane to the Denver route since we don't have pilots. At 6:30pm the gate agent announced that our flight was cancelled and to follow her to the ticket counter out front. The scene was crazy. We were lucky to be toward the very front of the line.

Lounges in Singapore and Paris shared with other Airlines very clean and well serviced. Business Class Lounge in Colombo is well laid out well serviced clean great range of Eastern and Western foods and Wines from all major Regions.

Check-in was straightforward staff were ok onboard not great but certainly much more courteous than other carriers! Unfortunately the flight was a let down. The plane really needs updating. The overhead CRT screen rattled above us for the whole 10 hour flight. The entertainment system was archaic. The headphone jack for the entertainment system doesn't allow you to use your own headphones the audio didn't work anyway so no entertainment on a 10 hour flight. The food was ok. They didn't have landing cards - luckily I was in transit. But the deal breaker for me is the reliability of this airline granted my flight was only an hour late but my wife's flight is 5 hours late today.

A340 Business: Staggered seats arrangement if on an aisle seat try to select one with the arm rest console on the aisle side yourself for extra distance from the aisle. Seats are narrower than some - a little on the hard side but fully flat and ""cosy"". Entertainment on demand and a large choice even for those of us who fly often in the same movie/month cycle.

tap-portugal,/airline-reviews/tap-portugal,TAP Portugal customer review,Steven Curfs,Luxembourg,2015-06-26,"Operated by Portugalia, two very different stories. On the first leg, nice crew, good tasty sandwich and drink, old but good airplane which was clean, priority boarding with infants respected, all-in-all positive experience and would fly with them again. On the return leg, TAP Portugal's Porto ground staff decided to ruin my day. I am a Star Alliance silver member and should have had no issue with luggage. But for some reason they now told me that my two bags were overweight (30 instead of 23 kg) and that I had to pay 50 EUR each supplement to carry them to BRU, even though I had exactly the same amount of luggage going to OPO, this apparently did not matter. They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply. As for the return flight itself, it was just as good as the one coming into OPO. So a real pity, a nice product but ruined by some ground staff in OPO and some very restrictive rules on luggage.

tam-airlines,/airline-reviews/tam-airlines,TAM Airlines customer review,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,Flew back from Sao Paulo with TAM (having also flown out to Sao Paulo from Heathrow with them). As usual a number of issues. Firstly it wouldn't let us check in online instead confirming that we were on stand-by. Naturally this caused us concerns so we enquired on arrival at Sao Paulo to be told that this was because when we flew out to Sao Paulo we paid extra for exit seats. So essentially they inconvenienced us just so they could try to upsell these exit seats again. Thank you TAM. The check-in clerk was very friendly anyway so that was good. Boarding was utter chaos. The time between boarding starting and the plane starting to taxi was two hours! I don't remember ever having had a flight like it. The seats were hideously uncomfortable as ever and the IFE extremely limited unless you wish to watch hundreds of episodes of Downton Abbey. The crew was alright but expressed the usual bemusement about my partner's veggie meal.

First flight was awful. Paid nearly £90 each just for the privilege of an exit seat. Didn't sleep well all the same as plane was freezing cold all the way. Crew were just about polite but nothing more and certainly no engagement. They spent the time during what I assume would have been the safety briefing chatting in the galley. I normally love airline food and am easily impressed typically devouring everything I am given but both my meals were disgraceful attempts at food and if it wasn't for the fact that we got such measly catering on a 12 hour flight I would've left most of it. The crew vanished after the meal service not even returning with more drinks or even water. IFE is about 20 years behind other major airlines so quite depressing on such a long flight. Having paid extra for exit seats there was then nowhere to stow books and magazines etc. The short haul flight was no better. A pre announced 40 minute delay turned into a 2 hour delay with no explanation and little updating along the way. In fact while we were waiting in the lounge our flight disappeared from the gate screen altogether again with no explanation. The 'meal' was a very unpleasant cheese and ham croissant. Really a horrible airline.

I was not however altogether too pleased with their online check-in system. Since I was flying Swiss through United I was unable to check-in online 24 hours before. I called the company and they told me it would not be possible. The unavailability of online check-in led to problems on the flight namely many passengers being unhappy with their seat assignments. I was asked twice to switch seats. I also overheard 3 other passengers asking other passengers to change seats. They were also very adamant about the weight of carry-on baggage being under 8 pounds. I felt this rule somewhat arbitrary but was happy to comply. Many passengers in line ahead and behind me had to pay the $100.00 fee to check their bags.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,4,5,5,NA,NA,4,1

The aircraft's were clean the cabin crew smart and reasonably friendly. The service provided was good. We know not to expect 4 star cuisine on European short-haul flights and the snack provided is quite acceptable. The seats and legroom are perfectly adequate. Lisbon Airport is now a joy to travel through with the recent improvements made. Contrast this with the shabby and overcrowded T1 at LHR!! The only downside is for some unknown reason the LGW-LIS flight is always parked at a remote corner of Lisbon airport necessitating a somewhat lengthy transfer by bus to the Terminal.

To add insult to injury on my later visit to the toilet I witnessed a crew member unwrapping and consuming a hot bacon roll. It's ok for some!

I usually fly Iberia to Spain so TAP is a huge improvement in the IFE area as Iberia does not have individual screens. I was able to secure exit row seats in all flight legs when I checked in online and at no extra cost. In flight service on the MIA-LIS was lacking a bit. After dinner service they mostly disappear. On the daytime flight returning to the US they were more attentive however they ran out of meals and we were not able to have a choice. Fish was the only ""option"" and as I don't eat fish I wasn't able to have lunch. Next time I will request a special meal. We weren't even in the back of the plane rather in row 28 and they had run out of meals. The only major scare in general was the ATC strike (which got called off). Otherwise I found the Lisbon airport to be a bit disorganized so I'd give yourself at least two hours when leaving from Lisbon (at least on the transcontinental portion as there were no mazes to navigate when going from Lisbon to Madrid). Also a tip is to print your boarding pass in advance as the check-in line for TAP in Lisbon was incredibly long.

My son wanted a model plane which was in the inflight brochure and they cheerfully found it for him.

The 757-200 aircraft was slightly old inside but with leather seats. Crew were polite efficient and very friendly with passengers. I would imagine that had I not booked extra leg room seats it would be a less comfortable flight but really if you have that much of an issue with leg room simply pay £25 for a seat with extra room and enjoy the flight rather than moan about it. There was one bar service each way but the crew would also get drinks for passengers on request later in the flight so everyone was happy. We had meals included for free as part of our holiday package. Outbound was a choice of Tikka Masala or Beef Bourguignon and return was Tarragon Chicken or Roast Beef. They have been created by Chef James Martin and whilst they were OK I wouldn't be impressed if I had paid for these meals pretty basic.

I choose to fly with Tiger as they are cheap and no frills. However when you purchase your ticket or tickets via the Tiger Airways official website it asks if you would like to choose your seat and some seats with more ""leg room"" cost more. On the seat selection page it shows which seats are empty and which seats are booked. Generally the seats with the added leg room are an extra cost and generally always the first booked. I always skip the seat selection and let Tiger assign me a seat at no extra cost. Now whenever I go to check in at Sydney airport or Coolangatta airport the check in staff often ask me where I would like to sit. So I ask for the seats with extra leg room which are the emergency exit rows and generally I'm assigned a seat with extra leg room despite the fact that I didn't pay anything extra and despite the Tiger Airways website stating that those seats which cost more and were ""booked"". So some poor fools are specifically choosing a certain seat and paying extra on the Tiger airways official website for a seat with extra ""leg room"". Yet I'm not paying anything extra for my seat and I'm offered the choice to sit in a seat which was shown as ""booked"" on the Tiger Airways website. I have to admit that I don't always get the choice to sit in a seat which costs extra on the tiger airways website but I find if I check in early enough then roughly 80% of the time the check in staff will give me the choice to sit anywhere at no extra cost.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2014-06-02,Gatwick - Cancun - Gatwick. This was in the new 787 Dreamliner. Premium Economy has a 2-3-2 configuration and a 36” seat pitch. All flights on time. Meals rather ordinary but drinks dispensed generously. A good selection of films and other entertainment on the IFE system stored in the armrest. Two toilets in the Premium cabin one in the forward galley and one at the rear of the cabin; on the outward leg I was rather brusquely asked to sit in my seat rather than wait in the galley for the toilet to become available this seemed a bit unnecessary and over assertive for the sake of it since I wasn't in anybody's way but other than that service was generally good. Regarding the Dreamliner cabin air is apparently of a higher quality than other aircraft due to greater cabin pressure and humidity difficult to say for sure how much difference this made but I disembarked both flights feeling in good shape. The cabin ceiling is comparatively high and the overhead baggage compartments are generously sized. A few issues though. As many others have noted there is a serious problem with the design of the seats / armrests; even with a 36” pitch if the person in front has reclined their seat then it's very difficult unless you have an aisle seat to exit your seat without climbing over the passenger next to you. Also although the aircraft have been in service less than a year the seats are already looking the worse for wear; some of the plastic trim in the armrests is coming loose some of the IFE screen mechanisms were also very loose (on the outward journey I noticed that someone had needed to jam bits of cardboard in the mechanism of my IFE system to keep the TV screen upright) and on the return journey the footrest on the seat of one of my party was jammed in the extended position. Finally although we were given a nice printed menu of all the beverages supposedly available on the return journey we were told that several of these had been withdrawn so the variety of soft drinks is actually rather less than Thomson were advertising. On the whole pretty good and I think the 787 sets new standards but for the extra we paid for Premium seats we expected a bit more.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1

The Dreamliner is a superb plane and the jet lag was minimised. Our complaint is the stub for screens etc which is between each passenger and projects too far toward the seat in front and makes for a very difficult exit to the toilet etc. Everyone seemed to mention this and although the staff were sympathetic this design needs urgent re-styling considering the extra charged. I also felt that the food was not up to scratch particularly on the return journey. I always highly rated Thomson food but not on this occasion. Most people seemed to think that with the introduction of the Deamliner this was a golden opportunity lost to upgrade the safety video and get rid of ""that precocious child.""

This is a very quiet aircraft even on takeoff. The Premier Club cabin was spacious and there was plenty of legroom between seats. The inflight service provided on both the outward and return flights was excellent. The crew in both directions were professional and attentive. Food was generally very good in particular the main meals on each flight. Numerous drink rounds were carried out throughout the flights. The IFE worked well although the choice of films on offer I felt was not that great. The system is all touch screen with quality headphones which produced a great sound for both the films and music channels. Overall this was a very pleasant charter flight and we really had no complaints at all. This aircraft claims to reduce jet lag and I have to say we have never felt so good as we did after the 10 hour flight so I believe the claim to be correct.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

The problem was not with the flight itself but the way Thomson uses Dalaman airport. They land about 9 aircraft within minutes of each other and they all (attempt!) to take off again within minutes of each other and the Airport simply cannot cope. The problem arises with the aircraft using remote parking spots on the airport apron. Passengers for these are shunted off into the suffocating basement of the terminal where there are about six gates with nowhere near enough room to accommodate passengers. So you get families with young children sitting on the floor and being treated like cattle. It's human nature - certainly amongst the British - to start forming queues which bear no relationship to the order in which the flights depart. One gate was being used for two different flights. There were no announcements from the departure gate staff even though some flights were delayed without any reference to it on the screens. Such confusion can lead to panic and stress situations - what a way to treat your customers! When we eventually got in a bus - the driver had no idea which aircraft he was supposed to decant us to - he had a choice of nine! When we eventually departed an hour late and after such a stressful boarding process there was not a hint of an apology from the Captain.

Food and service is what you would expect from the price of the ticket. The return journey was a little more complicated because of the volcanic ash. Everyone was asked to check in and several hours later the flight was cancelled. They should have phoned everyone not to come to the airport.

They dont have staff who can speak English no particular manners and in general they are rude. No information in English or Hindi/Punjabi on board or at Ashgabad. How one should know what to do or expect in term of time for board? I think they treat passengers with contempt and anger directed towards them; I have witnessed the so call air hostesses being rude. As for the onboard entertainment the less said the better. They make all announcements in some language that not a single passenger understands - I know they sometimes have one air hostess who pretends to speak English but no one can understand as it simply isnt English! The occasional films they show are in Russian and always highly embarassing for Indians. Overall I would rate TA 2 out of 10. You may say why 2 when the whole service is so diabolical. Well they usually let you sit down in a sort of seat and if you dont ask for anything they dont hit you over the head. And also because usually flights are on time. Would you fly with this thing?

Economy seating is quite cramped on Turkish B777's however but not to the point of discomfort.

You can try as many as you want. The same logic holds true for desserts. You had perhaps 10 different options to choose from.

I liked Continental a lot so United when acting under the Continental side is wonderful. However I got a bit more ""tulip"" and less ""globe"" on my flight from Miami to Newark. The check-in and gate agents were wonderful as usual but the flight was delayed two hours before taking off from Miami. I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United's horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80's synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming. If I'm flying in and out of Newark a former Continental hub I deserve Continental service. Let Chicagoans keep their United I'll keep my Continental.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,4,1,1,NA,NA,3,1

Our flight on 2/5/2015 from Maui to LAX was UA417 an ancient 757-200. We paid a total of $4924.40 for two round trip tickets. Flight 417 was more like riding an old dusty city bus. Keeping in mind that we were in first class we were offered only a small bag of potato chips. That was it. We were told that there were no more snacks and we could have only one bag of chips. The flight attendants mainly sat in their jump seats the whole time just chatting or snoozing. The purser was pretty snotty when asked any questions. We had the old style seats that didn't recline much. And beyond our belief on the ongoing flight from LAX to DEN we had lay-flat beds. For a flight lasting less than two hours. We sure could have used those lay-flat beds for the over-ocean portion.

Our 13-hour flight was delayed for three hours after we had boarded because of radio issues. About 30 minutes into the wait they opened up the main door and with temps outside around zero the F cabin quickly became a freezer. I could actually see the breath of the pax in 4A. The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The “sausage” that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles. Service was not rude for the most part but below economy standards on any Asian carrier. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of dishwater coffee. When the woman seated next to me asked what the squid sushi was the FA replied (with a smile to be fair) “Don't ask me I don't make it.”The shoulder harness that F pax are required to wear on takeoff and landing was extremely uncomfortable. When I remarked on this (politely and with a smile) to the FA while putting mine on she patronizingly replied “We can endure anything for a few minutes Mr. Johnson.”Will never ever fly United long-haul again.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,1,2,1,1,2,NA,NA,1,0

turkish-airlines,/airline-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,D Stanley,United Kingdom,2013-10-29,London to Dhaka via Istanbul twice in the last month. Usually I have a good experience with Turkish. However this time it was not so great. The London to Istanbul segments were mostly OK with the exception of the last return flight which was one of the most unpleasant flights I have had in a long time. It started with the children from hell in the row behind. The aircraft was an older A321 which had very poor leg room no IFE to speak of and it was too hot. One lady was quite ill because of the heat. The cabin crew refused to do anything despite complaints. I think everyone just wanted to get off so we were not pleased at having to fly around London on hold for half an hour. The Istanbul/Dhaka part is not operated by Turkish but by Meridiana an Italian charter operation. The A330 aircraft are old and do not come close to the normal Turkish standard. The IFE was very limited - no video on demand seats were old and business seats were basic and not worthy of the price. All airlines seem to put their worst and oldest aircraft on the routes into this part of Asia. I have flown with Emirates and Qatar Airways and both do the same. It is unfair as you do not pay any less for the ticket. On the positive side the overcrowding of the business lounge in Istanbul has improved.

Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in.

Food was limited to snacks but that was to be expected (why US airlines do not have lounges with food selections akin to those of international airlines is beyond me). But two unexpected plusses were the presence of showers (which I did not use) and free alcoholic beverages (albeit of limited varieties).

Because I was just taking a day trip to Philadelphia to drop off someone who had a 10 hour layover it ended up being a waste of money for me.

The 10 minutes turned into over an hour before they could get a first officer and 2 flight attendants. The service on board on both flights was poor. The attendants were cold and impersonal. The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying.

The flight itself should include your luggage fee. The way this airline does seating is entirely asinine - you can book your flight at any time, but you have to wait until within two weeks of the flight to actually pick your seats. The flight was very loud and the lights and air conditioners at each seat were difficult to adjust, at some points feeling as if they would break if you tried to point the air toward you. Snacks all have to be paid for rather than being included, which also seems ridiculous when the flight already costs so much.

ORD-FRA on 747 and FRA-EWR on 777. Had upper deck on the 747 and it's the best place on the plane. Less people in a much more secluded environment. On both directions the crew was congenial and the service was top notch. I appreciated being thanked for my business and for flying UA.

Flight to DCA on an E190 and it barely half full which provided a very comfortable flight and legroom and recline were good. No beverage runs this time due to heavy turbulence. Made it to my flight to SYR with a minute to spare this flight on a smaller E170. The flight attendant serving my row was an absolute delight. Per usual like all other major US carriers they lack the polish and finesse of their Asian counterparts. However she was very friendly warm and she made a lot of interaction with me and other passengers. I was given a whole can of Coke which is always nice flight was seamless and arrived on time.

At 7pm when I went to check in online I found out that my flight had again been cancelled (couldn't blame the weather - reason given was no crew) and I was re- scheduled for a flight at 1.30pm. There was no email sent to me nor was I contacted to be informed of this change less than 10 hours before my flight. When my flight 5876 was cancelled on 3 Jul 14 there were 2 staff members to re-schedule over 50 people - it takes about 45 minutes for the staff to re-schedule each person. How come United could not find more staff - this was known there would be cancellations predictable that flights would be cancelled. Overall a pretty shabby performance from United. Now again today they cancelled my flight - also did not inform me at all - I found out by accident by looking at their website. This was the only flight cancelled going to Harrisburg PA.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Howard,United States,2014-07-01,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day. The fares are a poor bait and switch tactic and I would be surprised if the FAA does not step in soon.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,3,3,1,NA,NA,4,0

Plenty of leg room and space around seats. Great inflight entertainment on Manchester to Philadelphia leg with personal video screen and on demand movies TV and games. Lots of films to choose from. Food ok - usual airline offering. No better or worse than all the rest. Soft drinks tea and coffee are free throughout the flight. Free wine with meal but there is a charge after that plus there is a charge for other alcoholic drinks. Staff attentive and efficient. Flight from Philadelphia to Miami on A321 - lots of leg room but no IFE - only a couple of hours so no problem. No charge for soft drinks/tea/coffee but there is a charge for food or alcohol.

Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines.

First flight was taxiing to the runway we went back to the gate and changed flights. Replacement plane was fine. Connecting flight delayed due to a problem with the fuelling truck and then had an aborted take-off. We had to wait over an hour until they put us on a different plane at the opposite end of the airport. On the returning flight from Cancun we were notified mid-air over the Atlantic that there was some kind of electrical issue and that we had to make a cautionary landing in Miami. We were in Miami on a hot plane for 3 hours. Flight attendants did not check on us. They didn't come by with water. We had to go get it from the back where they were filing cups. Finally we left again and were served 2 tiny cookies. We of course missed our connecting flight in Philly. They threw a voucher at us for a hotel 15 miles away. By that point everything in the airport was closed in regards to food and we had nothing to eat all day. We tried calling customer service only to be told repeatedly that they have no phone support for such issues.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,2,0,2,NA,NA,1,0

This airline wouldn't let me pick my seats during on-line check in. Assigned me and my 9 year old son Exit row seats because the flight was completely oversold.

Told to leave my boarding passes and they would fix it.

FAs fine once they trust you are not going to be another difficult passenger.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Brian Lamprell,Australia,2015-07-29,"SYD-SGN on Vietnam Airlines because of the 8 hour flying time compared to 13-15 hours travelling time for its competitors. Check in was terribly slow, mainly due to the high percentage of passengers who had 3 or 4 large cartons as excess baggage. It all has to be weighed and labelled and that takes time. On boarding, the cabin crew pointed us unsmilingly towards our seats. The A330-200 looked in good condition with the cabin clean and tidy. We asked for extra seats at check-in so we could stretch out and had 4 seats to ourselves. In the rear cabin section there were only about 30 passengers. With the seat-belt sign illuminated the crew made no attempt to check the passengers or items on seats. While the A330 was waiting to enter the runway, the woman sitting in front of us stood up and walked to the rear toilet. The two cabin crew looking at her frowned but said and did nothing to stop her. During the flight, the seat belt sign was illuminated and passengers told to belt up as there was turbulence ahead. The flight smoothed out but the sign stayed on for over an hour but some passengers took no notice and moved around the cabin without challenge. The PTV selection is limited but passable, however my unit locked up and none of the controls would fix it. After a frustrating ten minutes I reported it to the cabin crew who advised me to change seats. Okay, but later my wife’s PTV also locked, but later went into re-boot and after several minutes, the programs returned, but the screen was still locked. Food served during the flight was edible. The toilets used by us were in poor condition. Floors wet, dirty stains under the seats, damaged fascia around the mirror, toilet seat and cover broken away from its mountings and tissues on the floor. We didn't see cabin attendant refresh or tidy toilets. On the final approach to Saigon, with the seat belt sign illuminated, passengers still moved about the cabin uncontested by the crew. Of the attendants who worked our part of the cabin, only one was smiling, and she kept it up all the flight. All in all, a very deficient performance from a somewhat surly cabin crew and poor maintenance, particularly the toilets.",A330-200,Couple Leisure,Economy,SYD to SGN,3,4,1,3,2,3,NA,4,0

Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.",Boeing 747-400,FamilyLeisure,Economy,LGW to CUN,7,4,5,3,3,4,NA,4,1

Check-in good the usual 3 desks open processing passengers. Boarding on time and pushback about 10 minutes early arrival also 10 minutes early flight on a relatively new A321. Overall the attention to detail let down the flight and was indicative of some underlying attitudes.

A passenger decided to get up to use the toilet just after take-off when the Fasten Seatbelt sign was still illuminated but no comments/instructions from the cabin staff to return to seat! The final point was that the seatback pockets were not cleared out after the fights or even overnight as both my travelling companion and I found old boarding passes and other rubbish stuffed in the pockets - clearly the attention to detail is missing and needs work if the airline is to be truly successful!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,2,1,0,NA,NA,0,0

On my occasional previous flights with Virgin I'd noticed that they're inferior to Qantas in every way but not by much. Now that I've flown at a peak time I've seen what cost-cutting at check-in does. There was a queue for the small number of self-check-in kiosks (at least one was broken) then you can't drop your own bag like at Qantas so the queue for the measly 4-5 bag drop counters (they kept closing them due to baggage system problems) stretched to the terminal door. There were 5 proper check-in counters so some people took a punt on those being faster than kiosk + bag drop. 30 minutes to check-in should not be expected for a domestic flight (Qantas will take 5 minutes even at peak times).

Though to be fair I do not like the fixed armrest between seats it makes you feel more enclosed. Service on board was good staff kept busy were friendly and very well turned out a credit to their airline really. Food and drinks were served regularly. I do think the food has declined in quality for the main meals. They were a bit lacklustre and the desserts were just not nice I left mine on both legs. What happened to the Gu pots? They were always of a reliable quality why change a winning formula.

As this was an evening flight I found it acceptable but would not have wanted to be in it for an overnight flight. The service was personal polite and attentive throughout.

Found seat uncomfortable especially when the person in front fully reclines their seat you need to be a contortionist to get out from the window seat. The worst thing from my point of view was that there was no Audio music available due to problems with performing rights issues as some one who always listen to music on a flight I found this disgusting that this had not been sorted out.

Boarding at Sydney absolutely chaotic. Was at the gate 10 minutes prior to scheduled boarding time and boarding had already commenced. Further boarding calls were not made with flight number or destination so had to go by the flight status board at the gate - which had a VA flight to Melb at 10am and a Delta flight to Adelaide at 10am needless to say the Delta flight was a glitch. Cabin crew warm and friendly. No issues in having water as well as juice/tea/coffee and a second complimentary snack. Both flights on time.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,C Perman,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,"Flew ABZ-LHR-EWR returning JFK-LHR-ABZ. Outward flight with Little Red was as with my previous flights outstanding. The Little Red service exceeds what is expected of a short domestic flight and the crew clearly take pride in delivering the product. Another exemplary flight with the short haul branch. This was my first experience with long-haul Virgin. The outward flight to Newark was comfortable and I found leg room to be sufficient. It was perhaps a bit tight at the shoulders but I was in fairness seated towards the back of the A330's cabin where the cabin begins to narrow. In flight entertainment offered an excellent choice of movies including many that were nominated for Oscars. The crew were polite and friendly not exceptional but gave no cause for complaint. The food (chicken something or other) looked a bit pathetic and the chicken was a bit tough but actually tasted OK otherwise. The sandwich box was a tasty way to round off the flight. Ground staff at all airports went above expectations and were particularly helpful on arrival at Newark. I returned on a 747 from JFK. I had paid extra to select my seat choosing the upstairs economy cabin for the novelty value. Unfortunately my flight was remarkably quiet and they closed the upstairs cabin re-allocating me to the rear of the plane. The ground staff at JFK were not particularly helpful at first in addressing this although eventually offered me an exit row seat which was more than comfortable and although I wasn't offered a window seat (which I would have preferred) the offer to upgrade my seat was certainly welcome compensation. The flight was very lightly loaded and I had very few people around me. The beef stew for dinner was again not particularly appealing to look at but actually tasted very nice. The Gü puddings were absolutely delicious. The IFE broke down and was unusable but we were offered tablet devices and compensation for this - the issue was dealt with well. I managed some sleep on this overnight flight - the complimentary amenities kit helped a lot! I awoke to find I'd missed the breakfast service but the crew had kindly left me a tasty breakfast box without disturbing me which was very thoughtful. As for the final Little Red flight back to Scotland - again excellent. It is clear that the Little Red staff take a great deal of pride in offering what I judge to be the finest short-haul economy product in the skies. The Virgin product is pretty standard and although they promote excellent service certainly for the Economy product it only shows in small areas such as the nice puddings and some little touches here and there. It's certainly not a bad product but not quite the ""rock star"" service that they sell to us. I'd certainly use them again long haul although probably will not be able to with the domestic flights being withdrawn in due course. The Little Red service continue to provide the best short haul flights in the skies and will be sorely missed.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

What I can say is that the flight was perfectly fine for a low cost airline although VA now position themselves at similar costs to full service airlines. The good - the crew on both flights (NZ based crew) were lovely and came through the cabin regularly to offer water. Complimentary tea and coffee was a nicer touch than what they used to offer (nothing for free). Straight to a check in counter at AKL this morning and the lady there was lovely. Both flights left on time and the flight crew gave us clear and helpful updates. Exit row seat purchased at a very reasonable price so happy to have the legroom. The bad - huge queue to check in at MEL due to 3 flights departing at similar times. I was travelling with cabin baggage only but since there was no online check in I was in a queue for close to an hour. I booked the light fare and thought I would like to add baggage. Couldn't be done unless I paid $120 at the airport or booked an entirely new flight. With a 7kg allowance I was fine for a quick trip but the laptop and other things I would have liked to take stayed at home. Some flexibility is desirable. They didn't have the gate number on any of the screens at AKL on departure despite the flight boarding. Advised the ground crew and he didn't care much for my advice. The inflight menu is poor quite frankly. I always eat on planes and am not afraid to hit the user pays menu. I took my own lunch from the airport on the way back to AKL. Just not appealing.

The inflight entertainment was circa 1980 however the flight was so short it did not really matter. If there was a disappointment it was the seats.

Asked for meal entertainment system tea coffee glass of wine when I booked my ticket. Issued ticket with only tea but could not tell from e-ticket that I had no services. Later told it was my fault for asking for the services I wanted I should have researched the tiered fares and requested the correct fare tier. Ridiculous.

Undoubtedly two of the worst flights I can remember in recent memory. First time on VN and will be the last time. Can't think of anything particularly positive to say other than one of the two flights was on time. Other than that it was an awful experience. The A330 equipment is dated and falling apart. Masking tape used in several places to hold together broken parts. Problems with IFE on both flights which required resetting the screen - unsuccessful on all occasions - so no video either way. Food was unfit for human consumption. But even worse was a compete lack of warmth or professionalism by the cabin crew or ground personnel. Very few smiles cabin crew disappears for long periods at a time is gruff when approached with a small request. Having flown several of the carriers throughout Asia most of which are models of efficiency and great service VN sits rock bottom in my opinion. This is an airline from the dark ages.

Direct flights and choice of seats are the only positive points. Crew are quite surly and as said before not seen for hours after meals are served. On both flights one of our screens was not working as were quite a few others. When people called the crew they kept saying they will reboot the system but never came back to check so we assumed that either they did not bother looking into it or they knew it was hopeless! Also we flew over 2 different months but the films were not changed with limited choice. Food was awful both Asian or Western style and drinks choice limited.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,Virginia Bolton,Australia,2014-02-25,Flew Virgin Australia ex Hobart for connecting flight with Singapore Airlines to Yangon Myanmar on 1 Feb. The upside they checked my bags all the way to Yangon thank goodness. The downside there was a technical fault with the seatbelts causing a delay by 1.5 hours. Why were they not checked earlier? I did make it to Melb in time to catch my international flight (plus immigration had put on extra staff in Melb which helped enormously) however there were others who had international connections that were delayed by 24 hours. I found a staff member in Hobart to be quite curt but the other Virgin representative was very nice and managed the customers very well. I was thrown a breakfast because it was part of my ticket but I did not want it. Ended up handing it back to another flight attendant. Return flight from Melbourne was better and on time (food average-dry biscuit and cheese).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,3,2,1,NA,NA,3,1

We got to the counter and were issued with new boarding passes and given a voucher for free tea or coffee. We got to our gate and sat down to wait to board. They announced boarding for people traveling with kids or people who needed assistance to go first. Other passengers seemed to not care and boarding became a free for all so we decided just to get on the aircraft. We were greeted by name which was a nice touch and told were told were our seats were 43h&K. The vera on-demand system was not turned on until 20 mins after the flight had taken off. Food was very bland and had no taste to it when served. The seats we found were very uncomfortable almost like a charter plane the headrest would not adjust the way British Airways or Aer Lingus would. Overall I don't think we would fly with Virgin again BA United and Aer Lingus are far more comfortable and have better service than Virgin.

All flights were on time and used fairly new Airbus aircraft. Legroom was quite limited but no worse than other short haul flights. Inflight service was limited to a small bottle of water on the domestic flights; we got a small meal on the international flight but the quality was very poor even by airline food standards. I suggest eating beforehand - though not at the airport as options for food/drink at airports in Vietnam were surprisingly bad for a country with such great food.

I didn't realise you couldn't pay with a debit card only credit card after ordering sandwich and chocolate I said never mind ordered tea instead.

Excellent domestic flights which really put the joy back into domestic flying. Online check-in was a breeze and then straight through security to the plane. Outward flight was fantastic. Complimentary bacon roll and cup of tea were really nice and greatly appreciated after a long drive to the airport early in the morning! Seats were pretty standard for domestic flying and suitable for a short flight although if the person in front reclines their chair it does feel lightly cramped. Flight crew were fantastic and really friendly punctual landing into LHR. And free love hearts - quirky fun and really give the airline a character. Return flight was slightly marred prior to boarding when I was asked to put my hand baggage into the hold as it was large (not over the limits) and the flight was very busy. In fact there was plenty of space on the plane for my bag so this did little more than delay my departure from Aberdeen. But again a really nice flight and very quick. Friendly crew again and a complimentary drinks service (including alcoholic but unfortunately I was driving). Overall great value. Slightly more expensive than the low cost competition but you do get value for money and for Heathrow it is usually cheaper than BA. Would fly again in an instant.

I tried checking in online but there was a problem with the system. I cannot remember the last time the online check in went smoothly with VLM/CityJet. I eventually managed to do so. Passage through LCY was quick and efficient due to the extra security they've installed and the fact it wasn't a busy period but it was a bit manic at the gate as the ground staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. Consequently we left 20 minutes late. Once in the air the flight was fine (about 70% full) cabin crew managed one bar service and one tea/coffee service during the short flight and handed out Belgian chocolates (at least this VLM feature has been retained).

The plane was clean and the drinks were served in glasses as opposed to plastic cups. The single sandwich was a bit stingy but of high quality.

Flight leaving Melbourne was very delayed boarding. The flight was then delayed in departing by an hour - we sat on the tarmac for that time in a hot stuffy aircraft because 6 people had to have their luggage removed. Whilst the pilot was apologetic about this we were not offered any refreshments while we waited and the crew seemed to care less about passengers irritation at the delay. Check in itself at Melbourne airport was an exercise in inefficiency. 4 check in staff allocated to economy class passengers but with 4 international flights being checked in all at the same time the wait to check in was well over one hour. Very poor. The lady who checked me in appeared to be unsure about procedures and had to refer to her supervisor standing behind her. No ability to check in online either so check in was time consuming. I received a txt from Virgin before the flight saying that the wireless inflight entertainment would be available on my flight so I downloaded the app in anticipation - but the IFE did not work on the plane - the stewardess told me so when I asked. No apology from the captain or the head stewardess. It was a long boring flight up to Bali with no entertainment options and hungry passengers who expected to be able to purchase some snacks or food on board but there was nothing available for purchase. The meal was not served until 1pm (4 hours after the flight was scheduled to depart) - with nothing provided earlier in the flight other than a drink and with only 2 meal options one of which they ran out of early on. Why not have snacks available for purchase on flights of this length. Coming back on the redeye at 10.10pm was slightly better as the meal was served promptly departure was relatively on time and the IFE worked. Check in at Denpasar airport in Bali was a shambles. Virgin insist on your arriving at the airports to check in at least 3 hours' prior to departure time they do not have ground crew available to check you in until 2 hrs 50 mins prior to your flight. Long queues eventuated as a result. Check in was slightly quicker than in Melbourne however. Seats on the planes were comfortable but Virgin should be ashamed of using such small planes on these flights. There were only 2 toilets available at the rear of the plane to economy class passengers (there was one at the front but the crew refused to allow even ""desperate"" passengers to use this saying it was for business class passengers. There were ridiculous queues for the toilets as a result. The crew on both flights were generally not particularly friendly or helpful.

My colleagues on the 7:20 flight didn’t take off until 10:30. Upon boarding the fokker 50 the cabin crew (just one person) may just have been wearing a sign saying “I’m having a bad day” the attitude was absolutely terrible. It would be unfair to name this person but she did not smile once during the flight and was stern and just so unfriendly. There were no pre take off sweets. I do not understand how anyone can say VLM’s food is good you get offered half a brown sandwich in a plastic wrapper or fruit not even both and no plate.

The T3 Heathrow 'wing' is a fantastic perk and enabled us to step out of the car get through check in and security and to the Clubhouse in under 10 minutes - a minor miracle at Heathrow! Clubhouse is as good as ever. A346 out was quite full. Food is as ordinary as ever but I liked the choice of wines on offer. The 'bed' is ok. IFE has a wide range of things to watch or listen to although I went to sleep. Breakfast was horrid - but it always is on every airline. Staff all very nice and worked hard all through the flight. Return - the lounge in CPT isn't a Virgin lounge and is pretty rubbish. It also got full although we had seats some didn't. Return equipment was A343. Tablets handed out as there's no on-demand on the old VERA system. Didn't bother me as I slept for 10 hours.

I have seen a gradual disappearance to what made WJ unique and my choice. Have only flown with them regionally during the last 2 years. My biggest complaint is how often they are late or delayed. Passengers are not given the truth as to why planes are delayed. I would rather know that my plane is going to be 2 hours late rather than told several times that it will be 1/2 hour late. My second complaint is how uncomfortable the seats are now! I'm a 5'4"" woman who is not overweight and the seats are so narrow that I find it difficult to get comfortable at all. Sitting beside someone with any normal width to their shoulders has us touching each other and I feel I need to keep my arms as close in as possible - making for a very uncomfortable situation. The seat in front has been moved so that it's difficult to read a magazine at times because it presses up against the seat in front. Flying WJ is now like flying Air Transat or other charter company flights. I also find now with the odd exception the inflight crew to be disinterested and not very friendly. Last the inflight entertainment system - small screens don't work half the time but the biggest annoyance is the advertising that we are subjected to!

The service on the Cancun to Toronto flight was appalling. I was flying with my sister who has 2 young children. We were boarded first but only after approaching the attendants as there was no pre-boarding call. Once on the plane my sister asked if she could go to the back to stand with her 5 month old child to put him to sleep while the plane was loading. The flight attendant said no there was no room so have a seat. After take off passengers were bombarded with merchandise play books (as there was no in-flight entertainment provided) headsets food drinks duty free. You had brief mins. of opportunity to go to the washroom as the aisles were always blocked by carts and you were told to sit down and wait while they finished their task.

Boarding for both flights was well handled by gate staff in both LGW and UVF and both flights departed and arrived on time with very little turbulence en route. Contrary to many comments I was very impressed with Virgin's new long haul economy seating as it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom. In addition I even managed to sleep for 6 of the 8 hours on the inbound flight to LGW which was great as I usually never manage to sleep on long haul flights. Amenity kits were also given out on the UVF-LGW night flight which was a nice touch. I especially liked the new IFE system offered on the new A330s as it is touch screen operated and is also very simple and quick to navigate with a good variety of films and music to choose from. Throughout both flights the cabin crew were friendly and were eager to go out of their way for you. Furthermore call bells were answered promptly and the service felt more personal than on previous airlines that I have flown with. However the only thing that is letting Virgin down is the quality of their catering. On both flights the food portions were far too small for long 8-9 hour sectors so I'd suggest bringing extra food with you if possible. In addition there was very little to choose from on both flights unlike other four star airlines such as BA and the snack service offered on board was very limited. All in all our first experience with Virgin Atlantic was by no means disappointing and we would certainly consider flying with them again. The new A330 is an excellent aircraft to fly on as it offers Virgin's latest long haul product and is also extremely quiet compared to similar long haul aircraft.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

Very attentive staff! Could not fault them. If you were not too lazy to get out of your seat there was also the self service bar which was full stocked and was restocked throughout the 14hr flight with roast beef/chicken sandwiches soft drinks alcohol potato chips nuts etc. The entertainment was good because you can start watching TV shows or movies as soon as you sit down you don't need to wait until the plane is at cruising altitude.

I've used Virgin a bit over the last few years in Upper but this was my first experience of the premium economy cabin. As a bit of a caveat absolutely love some of the upper class gripes ultimately this is a unique product with the herringbone seating for heavens sake do your research before flying guys if you like regular business seating use someone else! Outbound on slightly tired 747 (Tinkerbell) cabin crew however very good food good and entertainment also had a decent amount of choices even if the screens themselves were slightly behind the times. Return flight delayed almost 2 hours after having arrived at the airport early anyway this wasn't ideal. Spoke to Virgin ground staff who immediately moved me to the earlier flight without charge - fantastic service. Return was on an a340-600 (Miss Behavin') and although I have my reservations this felt a slightly enhanced overall product with a better partition between premium and regular economy including separate toilets. Food and entertainment much the same again which was good. Didn't fancy the cooked breakfast option before landing so they brought a yoghurt fruit and warmed pastry item all of which were perfect. Overall for what was a 7hr outbound and 6hr return flight premium economy felt adequate. Seats wide and comfortable with a decent amount of recline. In my opinion not worth the large % increase to upper on this route unless of course using air miles to bridge the gap. Will be travelling the same route in a couple of months and will be glad to use Virgin Atlantic again.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

This is a classic Low cost carrier operation and you get what you pay for - the only problem with this kind of tarmac dash boarding is if you want to make sure you sit next to each other then you need to buy priority boarding. I had read other reports prior to the flight and wasn't looking forward to it but the experience was much better than I thought it would be. I think the problems on these airlines are caused by people who don't abide by the rules and expect a full service airline product on a low cost carrier.

My flight was on a very old (25+ years) MD-83 owned by SwiftAir a Spanish charter airline with some scheduled service I believe. In all my years of flying I don't think I've ever been on a plane in worse condition inside. Ripped carpet tons of places where serious scrapes and dents had been painted over shabby seats loose interior panels and just a general level of dirt and grime etc. It was a huge contrast to the nearly new A320 on my outbound and really does a disservice to WOW Air because it felt entirely bargain-basement. Crew was half-WOW Air and half-Spanish and the Spanish side was fine but rather brusque. No in-flight entertainment. Check-in was pretty slow - about 100 people in line maybe 8 agents. They moved quickly but still a fair bit of waiting. I'd recommend WOW Air as I'm sure that this plane won't be around long. I'd certainly think about avoiding them if more of these MD-80s are going to be part of their fleet on a regular basis.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,4,1,NA,NA,3,1

There were delays at the airport and while on the tarmac waiting to take off - ground staff and cabin crew were extremely good dealing with the delays and offered passengers a great drinks service etc. When boarding the aircraft the air stewardess noticed that it was an Air New Zealand printed boarding pass as I had just connected from another flight and asked me how my previous flight was - small thoughtful things like this were very much appreciated on such a long journey! All staff were extremely attentive courteous and friendly throughout. The food and drinks service was far above what I had been expecting and there was a great selection with a drinks service regularly. Seat was comfortable and inflight entertainment was great.

wizz-air,/airline-reviews/wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2013-07-21,LTN-OTP / TSR-LTN. LTN-OTP on new A320. However Wizz Air urgently needs to restructure their boarding system at Luton people were pushing and shoving and there was a lot of confusion and mis-communication as to where we were supposed to line up. I think Wizz Air would benefit from establishing a seat allocated boarding system like Easyjet as this would put an end to the 'free for all' pushing and shoving issue. If you travel through Luton there are delays to almost every flight there are far too many Wizz Air flights leaving and arriving at the same time and as such this airport cannot cope with the huge surge in early morning traffic. Cabin crew were helpful as always. As usual there is now very little seat pitch on their latest A320's so you might want to consider paying for an extra leg room seat as there is virtually no room for your legs. TSR-LTN: Flew back to Luton on a new A320 as on outboard flight. The way boarding was handled in Timisoara was noticeably better than we experienced in Luton. Departure was on time and like before the crew were excellent. All in all Wizz Air is a good low cost airline much better than the likes of Ryanair and we will definitely continue to fly with them on our future trips to Romania. It's a real shame that they have chosen London Luton Airport as their main UK base I seriously hope that they will consider flying from Stansted Airport in future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,0,0,NA,NA,4,1
xl-airways-france,/airline-reviews/xl-airways-france,XL Airways France customer review,H Gomez,Spain,2013-05-19,Flew XL Airways JFK-CDG last week. Its a low cost airline so you get what you pay for. Tickets are always really cheap but it has its toll. The plane was a brand new A330 with 400 souls inside so be patient. The check-in was probably the slowest I have seen in my life. They have a strict 1 bag 20 kgs policy and they could even charge you extra if your suitcase is a bit big even if its empty so check terms and conditions before buying a ticket.. No IFE on board no drinks or snacks just a breakfast upon arrival. Small seats little leg room but for half the price than anyone else.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,2,1,NA,NA,4,1

On the route from Moscow to Palma-de-Mallorca via Barcelona: the planes were new the crew were great the seats comfortable and the timetable convenient. The problems began on my way back. The plane from Palma to Barcelona was delayed for an hour so at the time of landing in Barcelona my connecting flight to Moscow was supposed to depart. Instead of delaying the flight to Moscow for 30 min which would have been sufficient for us to board Vueling opted to send a plane to DME without us. What was even more infuriating is that Vueling representatives assured me that the flight was waiting for us at D10 gate. The transit desk managers could offer nothing better than the next flight at the same time tomorrow! Such situation was unacceptable for me so they gave me a boarding pass to Paris-Orly flight in the early morning. The flight to Orly was not good - the plane was extremely old and dirty. What I can say is that Vueling is not so cheap but has very convenient schedules from Moscow to Barcelona and back. To sum up could be an option if you are flying without baggage and with at least a 3-hour connection. Otherwise stress is guaranteed.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

yemenia,/airline-reviews/yemenia,Yemenia customer review,Sahar Choudhury,NA,2008-05-30,The return tickets London to Bangladesh were cheap so I chose to try them out. Both the economy and First class seats are shabby. London-Yemen flight was less than half full on an Airbus 310. In flight entertainment was abysmal with the same film shown on both outward and inward flights. There is no personal in-flight entertainment system everyone shares the same overhead screen. Sana'a airport transit lounge lets the airline down. There were over 200 people in the lounge with only 3 filthy cubicles for men and none of them had a working flush or toilet paper and all of them were overflowing with excrement (I have photos). There was no soap either. The 5 hour transit wait was unpleasant. Sanaa to Bangladesh flight was full. The aircraft was infested with flies and it was hard to eat. Food isn't great but its ok for the price. There are no snacks even if you ask. No extra milk for tea either except the powder sachet that you get once with your main meal. Reconfirming the flights in Bangladesh was erratic. Local agent asked I present my passport and ticket in person and present a copy of my visa (I was told by UK travel agents I only needed to phone in order to reconfirm)! In the end I argued with him and sent him a copy of my ticket and passport by fax. Return journey from Bangladesh to Sana'a was the same on Flight IY0873 and the first class seat I was in (seat 2E) was very shabby and only slightly larger than economy but did have good legroom. The footrests were broken and there were flies buzzing around. Trasit at Sanaa to London was done in the bus and boarding cards handed out while the bus was moving to the transit lounge where more people got on. The official took all our passports and disappeared for a while. He then left all our passports with a fellow passenger and jumped off the bus. We had to frantically grab our passports because of the risk of theft. Sanaa to London flight had same food and flies and the stewardess explained that the flies were around because of the dates in Yemen. We requested she spray insecticide and she said she would try but it never happened. 20 minutes before landing at Heathrow she sprayed insecticide but that was because of UK rules. Verdict - Flight schedule was super crew dont go the extra mile. I will travel with them again if the fare is cheap and I am the only traveller otherwise I will give them a miss. Not recommended for families because of the really poor transit lounge and toilets.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

However having travelled to Cluj and back this weekend with them I have to say I was wrong to doubt. For everyone who complains about the luggage charges can I suggest they read the conditions carefully. They are very clear about the size of luggage. I booked priority boarding and extra leg room. Boarded fine got the seats plenty of room. Plane pushed back on both trips dead on time and left without a hitch. Ok the cabins are low cost and no frills - don't expect more but the staff I found to be smart highly presentable professional and assertive with customers who tried to pull a fast one with the seating.

I found their seating reasonably comfortable far better than Ryanair's but the thing that really lets Wizz Air down is the incredibly tight leg room slots which are actually tighter than Ryanair's.

This has always been untrue and merely a ruse for the company's convenience. My wife and children unwise to the deception arrived three hours before an early morning flight from Warsaw to Luton in early January and found the airport was not even open and they had to sit outside in the freezing temperature for two hours. 2. The hand luggage rule is being applied in a manner which can only be described as inhuman. On a recent flight from Warsaw-Modlin to Luton many passengers were forced to leave whole cases behind rather than pay the draconian penalty fee for being few centimetres oversized.

Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable I'm an average 5'8'' in height and was having difficulty moving this onboard their A321 and Boeing 737. IFE was average not much new movies and quite unresponsive the touchscreens you'll still have to use the remote. Information from the cockpit came only twice before take off and before landing. Food - their lunch and dinner are good above average servings are large plus Turkish delight is distributed prior to take off.

This was the third consecutive flight for us having already flown from China to LHR and on to MAD and my Iberia first impressions weren't so great. Ideally we would have gone BA LHR-EZE but price was a factor and Iberia was the cheaper though still expensive option. Luckily I'd already been travelling for 15+ hours and had stayed awake the whole time as to try and get some sleep on this flight as there was no personal IFE and just some poor quality drop-down televisions around the cabin. I don't mind this so much on a cheap airline but on a flag carrier charging full price? Come on. The flight attendants seemed grumpy and never smiled and everything seemed like a chore (compared to the lovely BA ladies).

We then spent 2 hours on hold to finally be told that there were no flights available until a minimum of 4 days later.

The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche.

china-southern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-southern-airlines,China Southern Airlines customer review,J Cavanagh,United Kingdom,2015-05-02,We flew standard class from Heathrow to Guangzhou then a change and on to Bangkok. The flights were cheap £400 each. The staff were very friendly and polite food was fine - you have the choice of English or Chinese. I would advise anyone to take their own water supply on though as they were a bit mean with the drinks. However the seats are so small and squashed together. Very much like Ryanair style. Which is fine for a short flight but certainly not to Bangkok! It was very uncomfortable and I am only 5ft 2 inch tall and a small frame so goodness only knows how anyone larger than myself coped with it. Actually I did not cope. I took a valium because it was just too claustrophobic. I would advise anyone reading this to think very carefully before booking a long haul flight with this company.

us-airways,/airline-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,Ken Walsh,United Kingdom,2015-05-25,Yesterday I flew PHL to LHR on the day flight departing at 9.35am EST. This very tired old plane needs to be retired pronto as not competitive at all. Sat in row 1 with bulk head in front with a seat used typically from internal US flights not a standard transatlantic seat although seat card indicated being refitted previously plane felt in a sorry state. As I am tall the bulkhead prevented me from stretching legs out at reasonable angle you would normally expect - straight was not possible. Outbound flight to PHL from LHR was with BA and was usual solid service but this was shocking by comparison and not worthy of the fare at all (had this been a night flight I would have walked back off the plane in disgust and gone with any other airline). I urge nobody to pay for Business on this route if with American from Philly until they put the modern seats in. Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight. Tray table can not come out and sit flat unless I am sat up right - this is a nuisance. I did not like the food one bit. I was at my most happy when I got off the late plane (late leaving as someone left passport in checked luggage resulting in waiting behind 17 planes to take off at PHL) - had sat in useless seat for 8+ hours as we were late.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,NA,1,3,2,1,NA,NA,1,0

Service for YVR-TPE was excellent with good attendants and drink runs every hour virtually on the hour. TPE- YVR service was less personal with fewer drink runs but still far better than most North American airlines. AVOD responsive with good selection of movies TV shows and others. Pillow and blanket offered and slippers with amenities kit. Where they faltered was the catering food was plentiful for me but definitely on the bland side. Elite seats are worth the money for 10 hour plus long-haul. I walked to the back to check out the economy seats and they frankly looked a bit horrifying - narrow with 3-4-3 layout and seemed a bit thinly padded.

Announcements with announcements about future announcements is all they can announce. This may be my second day trapped in St. Kitts airport but I will not give in and buy a one way ticket home on a different airline for twice what I paid for this one only because they will not refund my ticket.

My husband and I were very excited to become a part of the Emirates airline family once again when the routes to Asia from US were introduced. I flew the SFO to India (Bengaluru) route for the second time in 18 months last month (May) with a stop over in Dubai for 2 days. I received an e-mail confirmation 24 hours prior to my travel time. However, when I arrived with my 7 year old daughter at the airport to check in 2 hours prior to travel time, I was informed that our seats had been given away. I had even requested and reserved specific seats for our family 2 months prior to the travel date over the phone with an Emirates customer service representative. We had to wait 30 minutes and were then given 2 seats to travel to Bengaluru and then were made to rush to the gates to make the flight. I was informed by the agent who was checking me in that my seats were given away because I had not checked in online! I told her that I had received e-mail confirmation just the day of travel, confirming my seats and now I was being told that online check in was necessary to ensure getting seats to travel. Our family travels all the time in several different airlines and have never heard of online check in being required to confirm having seats! We had to deal with this same stress once again upon our return journey from Bengaluru at the Emirates check in counter. This time I had confirmed all our tickets online prior to travel as suggested. However, when we were ready to check in our baggage, we were told that my husband's seat was not available and they could not seat us together. We had to wait for 20 minutes and insist on getting the seats that we had requested and wanting to speak to the supervisor before we were finally given the 3 seats together. Once again, they said that they had to hold our seats as the flight was over booked and full. I fail to understand how this can happen to any passenger traveling on an international flight who had confirmed tickets 2-3 months prior to travel date! We arrived on time as per schedule at the airports both the times to check in luggage and followed standard Universal airlines protocol. There was no apology for all the inconvenience and stress that was caused when we were finally handed our boarding passes. The agents at the counter made it appear as if they were doing us a favor by being able to give us boarding passes and seat us together.

The B738 was old and there was overhead screen for entertainment for MAN-IST a 4 hour flight. My seat's earphone plug-in was spoilt therefore inflight entertainment was as good as non-existed. IST-ICN flight entertainment was good but limited choices. Amenities were given on the IST-ICN flight which includes eye mask lip balm ear-plugs socks and slippers. The cabin was warm for some reason it was not like other airline's where the cabin would be cold. Food was tasty but not delicious. Service was average.

In Curacao no plane had been scheduled to take us to Aruba. No explanation was given about what transportation was available until we demanded answers. No flight numbers were ever posted in Curacao for the leg of my trip to Aruba. I received different versions of why my flight was not available from staff. After hours of negotiation with different airline staff a flight was put together for us and other upset customers. It left late in the day and caused many persons including us to miss their connecting flights out of Aruba and to forfeit their tickets on other airlines. I arrived 3 days late to my destination in the USA.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Boarding delayed as 15 min before scheduled departure the plane was just coming to the gate. Gate agents were horrible - that is the only part of the trip that was bad. Flight boarded quickly and pilot apologized for the delay. Flight attendants in economy were really great - friendly and prompt to respond to requests. Breakfast was french toast and there was a lot of food provided - I was surprised as usually breakfasts on AA Int'l are small. 2 movies shown on the overhead monitors - this is where AA fails without excuse. These planes need AVOD in each seat - end of story - period. But the service made up for it. Left Chicago 45 min late - arrived London 15 min late.

My boarding time was at 11.15 nothing had happened by 12.15 so I started to get a bit nervous inquired with airport representatives who was sitting at the boarding gate. They said they don't know what was happening and would check. I found that to be quite unprofessional they should have known there were complications. They came back 30 mins later to advise us that they apologize for the delay and will advise accordingly. Flight left after 3.00 that morning.

Flight was delayed from 8pm to 3am because of weather and late flights and we were sent to the airport and passed through customs only to be told that the flight was cancelled because the crew needed rest. We then had to pass through all the arrival procedures and security checks. We eventually arrived at another hotel at 4 in the morning and it took 2 hours to check in because there were 180 passengers and 3 clerks. Everyone got to bed at around 6am. The next morning the flight was set to leave at 6 pm but none of the Sunwing representatives had any idea what was going on. After arriving the airport for the second time the flight was constantly delayed by 10 minutes for reasons unknown to everyone. The flight ending up leaving 2 and a half hours later. When we arrived back in Canada everyone thought this nightmare was over until we find out the baggage is locked into the plane because of a frozen door. We ended up having to wait an extra 2 hours for our luggage. Total delay time 26 hours.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,2,2,2,2,NA,NA,1,0

After reading some reviews I was a bit worried but shouldn't have been. No real issue at all. Flight out was a little late but nothing major. Plane was clean and cabin crew very polite. I'm 6'3 so was worried about leg room in a Standard seat but although not great I was by no means uncomfortable. I got up to stretch my legs twice and I was fine. The meals were great. Either Beef or Chicken both lovely and Pasta as a kids meal which my son loved. On the return we were on time and made up 30 minutes coming home. This was a night flight and I was told Thomas Cook no longer do blankets on board. All money saving I suppose. Again the meals home were great. A Chicken Curry or Beef in Red Wine sauce. I ate my sons meal of Chicken Strips as he was asleep best out the three. Thomas Cook are all about money. Everything costs. Food and drink is not cheap but you have the option of buying in the airport so I don't know why people complain so much as they know what to expect. Headsets headphone adapters etc it all costs but what do you expect? I don't understand anyone who would book through a low costs holiday firm and expect everything to be handed out free. Cheap airlines charging for these things is not new. If you want it all free book a Virgin airline but I bet it will cost you more for the flight overall with them. My only issue is that we did not have Thomas Cook representative on our transfer to the hotel. Simply told which stop to get off.

KL-BNE was day flight. Took off at 10am and the first meal service was 2 sandwiches and some fruit. There was then no other food served until 2 hours from Brisbane. What food was served was of a good quality but why it wasn't the other way around in terms of meals I really couldn't understand. Considering it is a reasonably new product I was very disappointed by the seat on the A330. It is narrow hard and doesn't got flat which on the night flight back from Brisbane makes a huge difference I think MAS are good and the value for money was very good but this is not a 5 star airline not even close.

Etihad in my opinion is very close to being a premium airline but are being seriously let down by Air Berlin who are absolutely a Budget Airline in every sense. Today (6th August) we sat in the plane on the tarmac for 2 hours at Abu Dhabi. It appeared that Air Berlin had over booked the plane. Some passengers had the same seat ticket and had to be let off. The food on Air Berlin is a joke. I had pre-ordered a vegetarian meal however there were none and the stewardess said the main meal (omelette and sausage) - I could eat that and just eat around the sausage. She then said the vegetarian option was really only for children and I could have that. It was a 'crepe' with a slice of peach. Hours old and disgusting. The food on the Etihad flight was excellent. The drinks on the Air Berlin leg were all lo-cost type drinks. The entertainment system on Air Berlin is rubbish. I absolutely will not fly with Air Berlin again and I will be complaining directly to Etihad that they are being seriously let down by their partner in this leg. I do not expect to pay a premium price for a budget airline which makes up half the leg (The Phuket to Abu Dhabi leg).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,3,3,2,2,NA,NA,3,0

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,G Pritchard,Australia,2015-06-20,"JQ30 on 16th June was my first flight on the new Dreamliner. In row 2 of Business Class, I had expected a comfortable ride notwithstanding the restriction of this budget carrier. There is an inherent design problem with JQ's configuration: Row 1 seats recline at an angle which allows good legroom but restricts Row 2 seats' access and space. When the seats in front were reclined as they were for the entire trip, the back of that seat was less than 30cms from my face with my seat in an upright position. I reclined my seat part way out of respect for the passenger behind whose seat in the last row of Business Class reclined to limited extent. This meant that I was trapped in my seat for the time that my fellow passenger was sleeping. The exterior of the aircraft has no window shade which means that even with the window tinted electronically, if you are on the sunrise-side of the craft, you have a mini heat radiator next to your face. Food on this service was minimal with none of the usual courtesy request to passengers to put their seats upright during service which meant that I ate in a space of less than 30cms. The food was basic at best and the staff virtually unseen throughout the flight as the three assigned to take care of 21 Business Class passengers spent most of the flight seated up front.

thomas-cook-airlines,/airline-reviews/thomas-cook-airlines,Thomas Cook Airlines customer review,B Glover,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,Manchester to Cancun 18/12/14. We flew from Manchester to Cancun with Thomas Cook and against these other poor reviews it was a faultless flight. I've come to the conclusion that people only review if they have an unpleasant experience. I advise anyone reading this to fly with Thomas Cook long haul. It's a comfortable and friendly airline: Check in - no queues with many desks open and ready. Boarding - very fast and organised immediately onto plane. Plane interior - We flew on the new refurbished A330. The cabin was a 2-4-2 configuration and at the back a 2-3-2 configuration. Seats were comfortable and reclined slightly. There was a large amount of leg room and overhead lockers also. We flew economy but in premier economy at the front there was a 2-3-2 configuration. There was no significant difference. Slightly larger seats with a pillow and amenity kit but not much benefit in upgrading. Inflight entertainment - absolutely fantastic entertainment. Touch screen 8 inch screen on the back of each seat. Economy came with 5 films and around 100 different music albums which was fantastic ranging from pop to country all free. if you paid £4 you gained 20 films and 30 TV shows which most people did. Films could be paused forwarded etc. There was also a USB port and headphone plug in. There was games and a map saying how far you had left and time at destination etc. As well as immigration details and Thomas Cook videos. Staff - Cabin crew were all very friendly. Food - Cooked by James Martin and I did not eat but others said it was average. We received lunch and afternoon tea. Toilets - were more roomy than usual and fairly clean. I highly advise flying long haul with Thomas Cook. It had no delay great service and entertainment. The journey back was a different story. The seats were squashed dirty and impossible to sleep on. unless I was flying on the new refurbished cabins I would not fly with Thomas Cook. The new A330's are flawless but the old ones are disgusting. There was no entertainment and the cabin was old.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

Outbound flatbeds on both legs although I found the 'herringbone' 330 better than the 'offset' 767. Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early.

On the way back on DEN-LGA leg of the journey the pilot made an emergency landing in Indianapolis. The next 16 hours is a case study in trying to buy off customers for poor quality service. Instead of having enough people on the ground to service the accommodation of 150+ passengers the airline effectively paid the passengers to struggle through the limited resources available on the ground in Indianapolis to assist them. I ended up sleeping the night in a cold airport lounge and slogged through multiple re-scheduling of the continuation of my trip from Indianapolis to NYC.

I had never heard of 'Rouge' but was happy that I was flying AC with my 2 boys as they enjoy the TV's in the individual seats and AC is fairly reliable (based on about 4 decades of brand loyalty). I was disturbed to discover that they had taken all the TV's out of the individual seats and we could only access the in-flight entertainment if 1) we had known to download the app before we got on the plane as it won't download on an android phone. 2) Had an I/OS phone or Ipad or 3) rented an Ipad for $10 in flight - which would have amounted to $30 x 2 for the return flight. Staff appeared between about 20 and 25 years old and very immature and unable to make any decisions without asking the 'senior' attendant. They sounded rather robotic and lacked any sense of humour. The pilot never spoke on the way back we had some turbulence and we never heard from him. They offered us 2 free Ipads because I was unimpressed with their inability to entertain people without phones but the system was slow and unresponsive. Flight attendants disappeared for about 40 minutes off the top of the flight - nowhere to be found - very unprofessional. I paid more for my trip to Samana than virtually everyone I spoke to - and they flew other airlines that offered free meals and wine - we got nothing - and only 2 drinks on a 5 hour flight. Plane was delayed at the airport in Samana and then we had to wait about 35 minutes at our gate for a Sunwing plane to move out. I wish I had flown with Sunwing.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,4,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

In any event I took a chance and booked my trip to St. Lucia to attend a family member's funeral. Fortunately I made it to St. Lucia just a few minutes late but not without hassle. I arrived at the airport in Puerto Rico at about 9.30 am. There were several persons waiting to check in. They told me that their flight had been cancelled the previous day and that they were asked to come in today to travel on the same flight that I was travelling. We waited and waited at the desk. It was not until over two hours later that an agent came to the desk and checked us in. The flight was about ten minutes late and we proceeded to our destination. Today is my return flight. I've been at the airport from 7 am waiting on my 8.05 am flight to arrive. It is now 12.30 pm. We were only advised that the flight was delayed upon arrival. Upon asking about the status of the flight I was first informed that it would arrive at 10.30 am then 11.45 am then 12.15 pm and now 1.30 pm. I'm supposed to catch a connecting flight in Antigua but although not on my itinerary the LIAT rep has advised that the flight will be going to my destination and I will not need to disembark until then. Let's see how that turns out! We were provided with breakfast. It is now 5 hours from check in and LIAT's supervisor has advised that we won't be provided with lunch. It's only upon request that we're provided with information regarding the status of the flight or compensation for the delay. I have to reiterate that this is the worst airline ever. They really need some competition. They take advantage of their customers and so little to no courtesy to them. This may very well be the last time I travel on LIAT.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,2,2,0,0,NA,NA,1,0

Checked in 3 hrs early on a Sunday at EWR before 13.30pm flight. Polite pre-flight screening and check-in agents. EWR can be pleasant and uncrowded on a Sunday morning. After priority seating its general boarding for all not by rows. Not chaotic but something to improve. Newish B777 seat pitch good for my small frame. IFE not bad for 10-11 hrs. Flight time. B747 seat pitch roomy enough for me but cabin and IFE looking tired but clean. Food passable edible with regular drink runs. My low sodium meals were served ahead. Inbound they had sandwiches and drinks at galley. ELAL flight crew a gem. Rest rooms were clean. It's passengers who were messing them up. I wish people would not grab seats in front when standing.

The first plane which left on time backed into a baggage cart. They couldn't find a crew for the replacement. Ended up spending the night in Detroit (at my expense) the 1st and 2nd aircraft the next morning both had mechanical issues. Customer Service in Detroit for the most part is the worst I've ever seen. Rude uninformed incompetent etc. Thanks to a fellow passenger who told me that a flight to Burlington had 14 empty seats I got home on aircraft #5.

Dinner was no choice some bland rice and meat dish. The most hilarious was breakfast though some kind of instant quiche soggy potato chips (for breakfast) soggy green beans and a sausage. I was quite amazed. I've lived in Finland and know food is not their forte but wow. Throughout the flight the attendants were quite brusque and when asked for a beer I was told that they're busy and a drinks cart will come eventually. When they did I was told that hardly any of the drinks on the menu where available. So I just stuck with water.

Last time we rated Asiana as very good. Sadly this time the overall level of service was much lower. We had booked through a reputable online travel agency and had a terrible job of getting our seats allocated through them. We eventually got them confirmed but there were a couple of changes along the way. As there is a 19 hour layover at Seoul on the return leg Asiana had previously provided hotel accommodation. We had expected a similar facility this time but after booking we found that not to be the case and we had to make our own arrangements. The flights themselves were uneventful. The seats were comfortable and all four flights were about on time although at least one of the Boeings was quite old. There was a certain amount of turbulence on each flight but the aircraft dealt with that and we suffered no real discomfort. We didn't however think that the meals were as good as previously and certainly the in flight entertainment was quite limited. Perhaps as could be expected there appeared to be more Korean music and films. Unlike their ground staff colleagues the flight crew were very helpful and polite. Most but not all spoke very good English. Our low rating for staff service is due entirely to the way we were dealt with by staff at Seoul. We would not discount using Asiana again but we will as ever consider our experience on this flight with those we experienced with other 5 star airlines when selecting flights in future and we would recommend travellers to look at Asiana as well as other airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,2,3,2,NA,NA,4,1
sas-scandinavian-airlines,/airline-reviews/sas-scandinavian-airlines,SAS Scandinavian customer review,Steve Kohler,Sweden,2014-09-17,Stockholm to Dublin flight (SK0172). SAS is saving money whilst ripping off and inconveniencing their passengers at the same time. It's not until one flies the same leg several times that the pattern becomes clear. I've flown this leg several times and every single time SAS uses the Ryanair gates of the terminal and parks out on the apron with no skybridge. It's the furthest possible distance to the arrivals hall 10-15 minutes walk and they do it because its the cheapest for them. SAS prices are the same if not more expensive than the other carriers yet they use the cheapest gates. Most national carriers provide free food and beverages which one should expect when paying premium prices. Not so with SAS. You pay the full airfares with them but get nothing except a cup of water or a cup of coffee (which they are proud to say is free). There is simply no difference in service between Ryanair and SAS on this route except one. The Cost. Ryanair will charge you around €50 for this flight. SAS will charge you around €300 for the very same flight and service. It's an insult to passengers. I've never been a huge fan of Ryanair but at least they charge appropriately for the limited service you get. As Scandinavia's National carrier SAS should be ashamed of such miserly no-frills service when they are charging their passengers full fare. Imagine how much they are saving by parking on the apron instead of using a gate. And then add that saving to the full fares that their 200 passengers pay even though Ryanair does it the same way and charges their passengers only around 15% of the SAS price.

srilankan-airlines,/airline-reviews/srilankan-airlines,SriLankan Airlines customer review,McDonald Kenneth,United Kingdom,2014-02-18,Flew A330 from Bangkok to London. 2 flights same type of plane. One of the cheapest choices. First off the Pro's: The service is excellent and the staff friendly and helpful. It felt like any request could be met and I saw myself and other passengers receive such. The food was good but not as good as I hoped. Don't sit in the middle of the plane as your choice from the menu will have run out. Cons: Plane seemed clean but a little old and the seat was uncomfortable. There are boxes underneath the window seats and some inner seats so stretching your legs was impossible. The entertainment system is awful for today's age presenting around a small choice 5 Hollywood movies plus some foreign ones and TV but you cannot pause them or restart. So choose one film at the start and that's it. 2 of the screens I looked at didn't work and a 3rd had bad audio.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Jonas Hutter,Germany,2015-01-14,"FRA-EWR-PHX-EWR-ZRH. FRA-EWR on old 767-300 with a tiny little screen in front of you that shows some movies on channels. Own earphones did not work. Plane very loud. However seat quite comfortable very nice cabin crew and good and tasty food. Legroom officially at 31in. but feels bigger than on transatlantic BA or AF. Brought my own entertainment so I had an excellent flight (should have brought earplugs though). EWR-PHX on newly refurbished A319 with slimline seats. Again lots of legroom even for me (6'6"" / 2m) and again no IFE but wifi available. But again a nice crew with two full drink runs (alcohol for purchase) and some walk throughs with water. PHX-EWR on 737-700 also with new interior and AVOD. However this is provided by DirecTV cost is $5.99 for flight of two hours or less and $7.99 for flight of more than 2 hours. Sadly even the flight information part is enclosed here so you don't see it unless you pay for it. Again two drink runs and good service by nice flight crew. Of the four planes on this trip this one had the worst legroom but still OK. EWR-ZRH on 767-400. Old plane with brand new interior - and a good one at that. Slimline seats with a big screen in front of you a large choice of new movies games and shows. Legroom again very good the 31in. at United appear to be bigger inches than those on other airlines. Tasty dinner and small breakfast (with fresh fruit!). After reading many bad reviews I had mixed feelings about stepping into a United plane. I even considered doling out the (quite big amount of) $$ for Premium Economy. But I got corrected. All planes were clean and well maintained nothing rattled or fell of. The crews were all nice and helpful. Legroom was never an issue even with pax in front of me reclining. After this experience I highly recommend United.

When we finally departed (30 mins delay), we were told that the inflight entertainment was not working across the entire plane - while the cabin crew manager seemed sheepish about the announcement, the captain made light of it, explaining ""It's only a short flight"" - perhaps to him 10.5 hours flying is a short flight, but to me, it felt like a very long time without a service that is clearly part of the package you pay for. Of course, with this inconvenience, you would think the crew would go above and beyond in terms of customer service to ensure we all felt comfortable and enjoyed the flight? Hardly! Crew were unfriendly and impossible to find at times - clearly avoiding any possible conflict from the upset guests on board! The food was appalling, the drinks were fine, though the crew again were not exactly generous and did not offer refills or any extras.

Took a quick weekend trip to Montreal from Chicago. The outbound trip Saturday was fine the return trip on Sunday was a total disaster. Saturday's flights were nearly empty but the flights Sunday were packed so it seems that if there is a rush the airline has no idea how to handle it. There were no weather issues or anything to cause multiple delays on Sunday and I really was never given a clear answer as to why all of my flights were delayed. It was a mix of ""technical issues"" and ""delays at other airports"". I was leaving Montreal for Toronto then had a connecting flight to Chicago. When booking my tickets all I was offered was a 30 minute change over between flights for the flight home. Porter in Toronto has a small terminal so on a normal day this should be no problem. In the end I missed my connection in Toronto to Chicago because of the original delay of 45 minutes in Montreal and my new second flight (an hour and half after my original flight) was also delayed by an hour and a half.

We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,Kolesnikov Alexander,United Kingdom,2014-06-13,I had two different impressions of two flights with VA. The first flight was from London Heathrow to Los Angeles Premium Economy and it was great even though the seat I had wasn't the most convenient in term of its location. I didn't sleep and for the whole flight stewards were always there asking if I need something else offering drinks snacks ice creams. The second flight was back home from Los Angeles to London Heathrow Premium Economy and that was a totally different story. It all started from the delayed main meal. In the Economy they were already finishing their meal but ours wasn't even served. Then the meal was served eaten and we had our dirty dishes in front of us for like an eternity. Nobody seemed to care about collecting the dishes the stewards seemed to be hectically busy with something behind the closed curtains - but with what? At some point a lady in front of me decided to recline her chair and doing that she squeezed my dirty dishes so I had to call the stewards and request to remove them. Then we were waiting for a coffee - for more than an hour. I reminded about a coffee a couple of times but again the stewards were just too busy with something not related to serving the passengers. Then there was another lengthy period more than an hour of waiting for liquors. The light was already switched off and most passengers were asleep when at last some brandy was offered. And then the Premium Economy stewards simply disappeared and didn't show up until closer to the end of the flight. Nobody was offering drinks nobody was asking if passengers need anything there was simply no service in Premium Economy. On the way back from the toilet I met Economy stewards who were serving drinks they offered a drink to me. Were Premium Economy stewards on strike or something? I have no idea.

Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website.

I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look.

As soon as we took off other members of the crew constantly kept on making sure I was fine and when some moderate turbulence before landing occurred a male crew member sat by me and talked reassuringly. On top of everything the pilot made various announcements during the flight and communicated with passengers. These small things and professional flight crew contribute to the fact that I will definitely choose Norwegian in the future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

The check in process was horrible and the customer service agent didn't know how to switch my seats for me when I requested and instead tried to upgrade me into Business class. There was confusion as to whether I could get lounge access since I was booked in economy but I was showing status as a million mile flyer and a Star Gold. At the gate I was told that the cabin was fairly open and I could move to an open aisle seat. I asked for confirmation and an official change on the ticket but was assured it wouldn't be a problem. Once onboard the chief purser was polite but was obviously very distracted with her colleagues and wasn't able to assist me. When it looked like the majority of people had got onboard I asked the flight attendant if it was ok to change seats and was told it was not possible I would have to do it once we are airborne. When the seat belt light came off I attempted to move seats and was again told to take my original seats. For the price of the ticket and the fact I am a 100K mile flyer on the Star Alliance I was not only exasperated at how little flexibility and competence the flight attendants have to ensuring good customer satisfaction.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

We booked our travel with Emirates, travelling Brisbane, Barcelona, Paris, London, Dubai and return. The preference for our seating was booked by our travel agent for the window seats in the left rear from rows 46-49. However, on every sector except from London to Dubai, the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle - four of us! I telephoned the booking offices at each location, who refused to help, then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. It was a long journey which we had to endure. I found almost all of their staff, be it Cabin Crew or Counter Staff to be very robotic in their attitude. No customer service at all. No friendly disposition, no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. The food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. However, this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again. I did the right thing, booked our trip with them months in advance of our travel, preference of seats and very disappointed at their lack of empathy that we were travelling long distances and no courtesy in endeavouring to help.

Leaving the plane you could almost hear the flight crew heave a sigh of relief the flight was over and they were rid of us the entire plane load.

Qantas seems to me to have recently undergone a 'mood change' with a noticeable enhancement of service. Best aspects of this particular trip were the First Class Lounge at Sydney the American Airlines Admirals Club (which Qantas uses) at Santiago the excellent food and wines but above all the superb service despite a very full aircraft. If you get a good Qantas cabin crew you will get some of the world's best. Perhaps a word should also be said for the level of engineering and technology that we take for granted these days: it simply amazes me that an aircraft (747-400 in this case) can transport us accurately for 14 hours non-stop over the remote Antarctic Ocean in absolute comfort and safety and also arrive at destinations within one minute of scheduled times - incredible.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

I researched and knew Frontier charges for carry-ons if you don't meet the requirements or book a fare on their website so I made sure to bring a proper sized bag and got on no problem. I do the same thing when I fly Spirit. The customer service wasn't very good in Denver but once on the plane the flight attendants were very nice and helpful especially when my TV broke and the customer service in Orlando was noticeably better.

Back to the hotel woke at 6.30am went back to the airport where complete chaos ensued. There was 1 Icelandair employee trying to make plans for 150 passengers to get to a variety of destinations. Anyone who wanted to leave had to run around CDG trying to find seats with other carriers. The 5 of us left France 48 hrs after our original flight on two separate carriers.

We were also advised that the air conditioning was not functioning but once airborne the air condition would be resolved. The Sunwing customer service is non existent and especially if you purchased the package through a Travel Agent their response was that they did not communicate directly with customers and it would be necessary to contact the Travel Agent for assistance.

Full use of the entertainment system on these legs (good for 3.40 hour flight) and a decent selection of films however the games were not much to have. All fights on time and no luggage issues. Check-in staff in Manchester were very good and helpful and Mombassa staff polite friendly and obliging too. Long-haul flight on single aisle 737-900 service good though not quite the same high standard of the MAN-IST leg. On 7 hour flight to MBA only one full meal service thought they could of managed at least another drinks service many passengers went to the galley to get a drink. The return flight (4.00am) an average breakfast was served and sandwich snack before landing same entertainment system. This flight also included flight socks and shades which was a plus. FAs were friendly on the whole (male FAs more so then the female) though not always obliging and scarce once the meal service was over.

I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him.

I've used this route quite a few times since in both directions and have always been pretty impressed with what was on offer. On the most recent occasion and through necessity my return booking was made less than 24h. before departure but still only cost some £98 return - when BA was quoting something along the lines of £300! There's really no differentiation in service and I've always found the staff - both in the terminals and on-board - to be friendly accommodating and pro-active. It's a real pity that rumours and speculation regarding the future of this operation continue to circulate which no doubt must impact upon forward bookings.

If you are lucky to fly 767 or the new A330 in this route you will have a good service from Avianca but not in these smaller planes. AVOD has a decent choice and food service was OK (although I think that travellers would prefer a breakfast before arrival at 6am than a dinner at departure time on mid-night).

tigerair,/airline-reviews/tigerair,Tigerair customer review,Jarrod McCloughan,Australia,2014-05-17,Brisbane to Sydney on the 4th May on TT377 which was scheduled to depart at 3:55pm. There were delays in Sydney due to winds and all airlines were suffering delays to/from Sydney. Hardly Tigers fault. Boarded the plane around 4:40pm and was ready for take off just after 5pm. Most people were asleep after a busy weekend as we started rolling down the runway. About 1/3 of the way down the runway the captain hit the brakes. We were stopped at the end of the runway and had no idea why. There was no announcement from the cabin crew and eventually the captain came on. A light had appeared during takeoff and he had to abort the takeoff. So he said we'd go back to the terminal and have engineers look at the issue and we were to remain on the plane. The cabin crew made no announcements at all during this time. One got short when people wanted to go the toilet. After about 10 mins we were told we would need to get off and head back into the terminal. Back into the terminal we go and we were told not to go too far so we can listen to the announcements. What announcements?? There was not 1 announcement from the Aerocare ground staff. The captain made two announcements over the nearly 5 hour delay! One of the announcements was that the engineer had just arrived at that was at 7pm nearly 2 hours later and that we should be out by 8pm. Then 8pm came and no announcement. The staff at the gate said a call would be made between 8:30pm and 9pm to see if the flight would be cancelled. Come 9pm there was no announcement! With a delay this long peoples tempers were becoming frayed! The AFP turned up a few times. We received no food or drink vouchers. We also learnt that if the flight was cancelled it was left up to us to find accommodation. The 8:05pm flight to Sydney was cancelled as it was the same aircraft that we were on. There was some very lost passengers at the gate as there was no staff at the gate. We finally boarded around 9:20pm and we didn't get off the ground till 9:45pm. All we got onboard as compensation was a cup of tea or coffee or a cup of water! We made it to Sydney with 6 mins to spare before curfew. Not too sure if I'd fly Tiger again after this experience.

As we pointed out how long we stood in their lines the ""red coat"" got surly and told us that this was our only choice. She would not help us with a room or meals. We asked about a trip the next day which she booked us on that left at 11.45 am. Now 13 hours later.

Short haul flights were comfortable and smooth light meal served and seating is the typical 3 in a row with the middle one kept clear. The long haul VIE-BKK flight was on the new lie flat business seats. They were comfortable and the screen for entertainment very good clear sharp but a limited selection of films. The Sky Chef is a really nice touch and food was good - a really tender steak. Crew are generally reserved - but as a Star Alliance gold member I was personally greeted which is a nice touch. My reservations are basically two. The first is seating reservations. On both legs I pre booked a single seat but got put in both cases onto a pair - with the second seat empty. I thought Gold would have given me priority but it seems the Senator Gold was higher- fair enough but worth noting in future. The second was the space in the seats. On the return leg I had 8A (777-200 config) which was fine but outboard I had 10K - right up against economy and with a tight space to 10H - a real squeeze to get in and out.

There seemed to be friction between the FA's as I was waiting for the toilet one was scolding the other in front of the passengers didn't look very professional. On the way back from MXP we got a remote stand and were transferred by bus. Nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor toilets were filthy and overcrowded.

I am not happy with the whole experience it is value for money because it is cheaper than most airlines but don't expect a whole new dimension it is just an OK airline with good value for money and an average service an extremely good brand positioning and an overrated self-attributed reputation with below average delivery.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,J Ray,United Kingdom,2014-02-24,CDG to Riyadh in Y class on the A330-200. This was one of the worst travel experiences I have had in recent years. I booked with Saudi who codeshare on this day of the week and went to check in at the Saudi desks in 2C. This was a mistake but Air France counter staff nearby were rude and unhelpful. Their customer service skills were so poor. Air France insists you use the automatic check in when travelling in this cabin but after queuing and following on screen instructions the machine then prints a notice telling you to go to the desk for traditional check in. Boarding was ridiculously slow and badly handled. Scanners failed to read every other card and just two agents on duty had to input details manually. The flight was scheduled for 1330 and was full but boarding did not begin until after 1300. The Y class seating configuration is grotesquely cramped. Seats are narrow with very little space. Should the passenger in front recline their seat the minuscule television screen will be almost touching your nose. Riyadh is not an especially lengthy sector but six hours in these tiny and packed rows was five hours too long. The seats cause real discomfort. The meal was only just hot and not pleasant and the red wine offered was very poor quality. Cheap plonk. Crews had barely enough space to move the trolley. Air France makes much of the glass of champagne it offers to all passengers but every other aspect of the service was very unpleasant indeed. Not to be repeated.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,2,1,2,NA,NA,2,0

Ground service at other airports is not on the same level as Frankfurt or Munich but that's to be expected. Food quality is good but could still be improved. One point I would like to critique is that the drinks menu promises a choice of champagne but usually there is only one of the choices on board. While I was never dissatisfied with the champagne that was offered it annoys me to be offered a choice only to hear that there really is no choice. Another points I would like to make is about the inflight entertainment system. First off I have to say that it has improved tremendously on the content side. Sadly there is still no improvement on the user input side which is very unresponsive and on the design of the ""Lufthansa Media World"" is still confusing and overly complex. Service from the flight attendants was very good but felt a bit scripted and unenthusiastic. The seat is excellent for lounging as well as sleeping and has plenty of adjustment options. A nice extra for the seat would be a massage function like you get on Swiss First and many other competitors.",NA,NA,First Class,NA,1,5,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

Cabin manager is assigned to business class only (4 passengers) and was attentive upon boarding hanging my jacket and offering beverages with a choice of water or a mocktail there was no champagne or sparkling to be seen. After take off we were offered beverages and our meal orders were taken. The samsung in flight entertainment systems were handed out however after looking through the selection I instantly regretted not bringing my own laptop as the selection for a 5hr flight was extremely poor. The 3 course meal was delicious and service was good for most of the flight however I had to wait for the bathroom twice the first time as several economy passengers were using the designated business class bathroom and the second time as 4 members of the crew were talking in the front of the cabin blocking the way. After waiting 15 minutes for them to disburse I stepped through the curtain only to be told that I couldn't be up there and to return to my seat. A few minutes later I was approached by the cabin manager to explain that the first officer was coming out of the cockpit and that is why I was told to return to my seat. I wasn't happy with how they handled the situation. The amenities kit was good however it was not handed out until half way through the flight.

I called customer service three times for clarification of water food luggage and check in questions. They were very professional and helped me understand how this airline works. We brought our own food and water. We did not book for seats in advance. Didn't order food. Did check in one piece of luggage and brought one carryon. They do weigh and coming back to US they weighed my carry on. My carry on was a bit overweight and so I took one item out and placed in my backpack. When we checked in we got an aisle seat and middle seat flying to Gatwick. Coming home we got an aisle seat and middle seat and no one sat in the window seat and so we got an entire row . Movies were updated and we brought our own air phones. They charge 3.00 if you need one. We bought our own meals from Gatwick airport 7.00 US and it came with a bottle of water.

austrian-airlines,/airline-reviews/austrian-airlines,Austrian Airlines customer review,N Hall,United States,2013-10-02,Extremely disappointing. Houston to Dubrovnik Croatia. What appeared to be a 3 stop return all on Austrian Airlines was actually across 3 airlines (Croatian Tyrolean and United) so when we tried to check in we were unable to do so online. We had a 1 hour layover in Vienna and the only reason we made our flight is because Austrian was so disorganized they were delayed in boarding the flight from Vienna to Chicago. Our boarding passes we received in Croatia didn't work in Vienna. When I tried to board the attendant dismissed the boarding pass and said it was no good. I had to check in again. My friend had the same issue so we went to the gate and they reprinted the exact same pass. In addition it is very irresponsible for the airline to book a one hour layover when it would easily take 2 hours at least to get from one gate to the other especially with Vienna requiring customs to get in and out of the airport and you have to go through security again. I give credit to the personnel who kept reprinting our tickets at each stop.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,Michel Rail,Canada,2014-09-09,I found the seats and spacing comfortable in coach. The design is minimalist. I understand that taking the wiring and screens out of the seats reduces the cost weight and maintenance. My wife had an issue with the lack of ventilating port above the head. She was hot the entire flight. I was comfortable. I don't like the message Air Canada sends when they encourage a monopoly in their own aircraft by only supporting Apple devices. It doesn't take that much effort to create the applications for Android and BlackBerry. My frustration spans from the surprise I got taking a 5 hour flight with no entertainment. Had I known I would have loaded a few movies on my Android tablet.

First experience on Frontier. I had researched pretty well so I knew all about the extra fees. I paid in advance for a checked bag and an upgraded stretch seat. Seat was very average at best but on a long flight the leg space was worth it. It was my first time checking a bag in years as I couldn't justify spending more to carry my bag on. A bit of a hassle but probably would not stop me from flying them again. Flights were on time and went off without complication. They really hustle to turn the planes around quickly. That also means that they don't get cleaned very well as this is the flight crews job. Floor of the plane was filthy and general upkeep was neglected.

Our morning flight from Birmingham to Tunis yesterday was an experience. We checked in on time with two suit cases for our short journey to Paris (CDG). Flight was enjoyable however the breakfast was poor croissant stale service slow. There were no signs at CDG telling us where our next connection was. All it needed was a screen at the exit to show the flights desks and connecting details. It left us wondering around between L & D2 and the Duty Free. Fortunately the plane took off late so we did not miss our connection. However the reason why it was late some passengers did not check in so bags were unloaded (including ours as we later found out to our cost) and on arriving in Tunis one of our bags was missing. After a long wait in the baggage hall we  with several other passengers who had the Air France experience reported the loss but as no one there could speak English we left hoping that our bag would be sent on to us. Twenty four hours later it was not. We are still waiting for someone from the line to explain and return our luggage.

The boarding was swift plane clean and seats comfortable with good legroom. There were firm pillows and fluffy blankets but no amenity kits. After take off nice snacks and drinks were served (with no ice). Lunch was a choice of pork steak or chicken. I tried both and chicken was better. It was served with a container of fresh fruit small cake and small mixed salad and dressing and warm bread roll and butter. The food was adequate but not that interesting and the mash with the pork steak was particularly bad. After lunch an assortment of low quality crackers/cookies were put in the galley. Later chicken rolls were served and then at the end of the flight another hot meal and I thought the fried rice was tasty. The PTV had a good movie selection and sound. The service was great and I found all the crew to be polite and humble and efficient and they maintained the bathrooms very well.

But the price difference compared to other airlines more then made up for it. Foods was ok and the staff were good and if your prepared with a book then this is good value. Because the planes are older there is actually pretty good leg room in Economy. On my return I'd been travelling for 32hrs and they gave me an unexplained upgrade to Business Class.

The flight was delayed approximately 30 minutes due to late arrival of the flight deck crew from another flight but time was caught up in the air. The business product on the 737-800s was of the older variety with less comfortable seating and lack of inflight entertainment which were the only negatives. As always when Qantas service is good it is unbeatable. Excellent service for the full business cabin from the mature crew especially the CSM. When my travel partner asked for a lolly (to help with ear discomfort on ascent) the CSM gave him some vicks vapor drops from her own bag - and even gave him some more when we were descending which I thought was a really nice touch.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,2,5,3,1,NA,NA,4,1
norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,G Richardson,United Kingdom,2015-04-08,6th April 2015 Long Haul LGW-JFK 12A. Booked this flight when it was released six months ago and paid just £204 for the ticket plus £40 for a suitcase seat reservation and meals. Our departure time was 18.00 but we pushed back ten minutes early and were in the air at 18.10. Flight landed 45 minutes ahead of schedule but took 15 minutes to reach the gate at JFK which nobody minded. The main difference I noticed on the Boeing 787 was that it hardly felt as if I was on a flight. The windows were enormous. Changes of lighting happened gradually which in some ways was pleasant. The entertainment system was of a very high quality. The fact that I had to bring my own headphones (you have to purchase them on Norwegian) actually made that aspect of it more satisfactory. The seat was also comfortable. I'm 6 foot 2 and didn't feel cramped. There was a hot meal a chicken and rice dish served after takeoff and a cold sandwich meal before landing. That was for those who pre-ordered meals or had to because they wanted checked luggage. Terminal 1 at JFK was crowded and unpleasant and immigration was very confusing but it's never an easy process when entering the US. When I got through 20 minutes later my suitcase had just arrived on the belt so it wasn't an issue. That's not really to do with the airline anyway.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

The Flight was scheduled for 11.55 but was delayed for 5 hrs. Unlike most passengers we realised there would be a delay 18 hrs in advance after having problems with the online check-in. Even though the airline was aware of a significant delay no effort was made to inform passengers. No information on our right to compensation under EU regulations was given either. Adding insult to injury the flight attendants on the plane ignored any request for information or service. At one stage I had the assistance lamp on for an hour before I gave up and went to the back to find attendants chatting leisurely. Breakfast consisted of a sandwich with cheese and water. No yoghurt or muffin as included in the regular meal. Again a sign of minimal effort. Even though this flight was relatively cheap it was not good value at all and staff made no effort to improve what was obviously a terrible experience.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,C Chan,Singapore,2015-05-06,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,5,1,4,5,NA,NA,3,0

Great comfort storage and privacy also great to have two biz cabins one with only 2 rows in (always get that one if you can). However the service on the ground and in the air still seems just 'OK' and leaves me pondering on how they maintain their 5* rating. Food was very good but lack of service in the cabin makes me think that I will always only fly them again for a very good price and the seat so long as I can get the window one.

After 3hrs the counter opened and we could check-in with the confirmation that the +3h flight would be 100% on time and arrive in Leipzig without any further delay. While waiting for the flight I received an announcement that the flight was delayed by another 5hrs! As this meant that I missed the lecture I was to give in Leiden I gave up and went home.

I called their ""customer service"" number and after being on hold for 30+ minutes I gave up. I don't understand their baggage and carry on policies and pricing and quickly realized that any money saved by not flying Southwest would be eaten up by these stupid nit picking fees. I finally prevailed on their horrible website and arrived at the airport to hear that their whole software system was brand-new and everyone was trying to figure it out. Then the flight was delayed with no notice to my email or phone. At the gate they had one poor employee trying to handle all these passengers and get the inbound flight all set up to de-plane. This was a bad experience and I will attempt not to fly them ever again.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,3,1,2,NA,NA,1,0
fiji-airways,/airline-reviews/fiji-airways,Fiji Airways customer review,F MacKillop,Australia,2013-02-12,BNE-NAN-BNE. Basically this is an airline that charges full-fare for what is in reality a low-cost business model to them at least: awful food (a revolting soggy 'sandwich' of some kind and a small plastic pot of coleslaw on both the outward and return journey) a cramped ugly and dirty cabin toilet doors that do not lock. All this is mentioned in many other reviews. No IFE apart from the one movie broadcast from overhead. I was not interested in the selection at all. On the positive side beers wines and spirits are available and the crew do try and display the well-known Fijian friendliness and cheerfulness despite working in the same dismal conditions that we are travelling in. My points are mainly for getting us there on time-nay early even- and in one piece.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,4,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

We flew economy outbound and the flight itself was good very smooth and on time and the service was avarage. The entertainment was very poor with limited film selection no musi cand just some old radio recordings. On our return flight we were offered a flight upgrade for £100 which I thought was good value for money and the seat pitch is bigger but this is where the premium upgrade ends. You have to pay for earphones and the poor entertainment is exactly the same no free drinks and same food menu. If you think that paying for a slightly larger seat is worth the money that is fine but Thomas Cook should not advertise this as a premium service.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,6,3,3,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

The SYD-KL flight arrived half an hour early for some reason just making the stopover longer. The KL-London flight was an hour late. This meant I missed my connection and had to sit in Heathrow for 7 MORE hours. The return London-KL was once again delayed meaning another stuffed up connecting flight. The customer service was appalling no member of staff on the planes ever smiled at me. All of the food was inedible (both in economy and business) except the satay.

You know it is bad when you choose the pasta with seafood and the flight attendant asks ""Are you sure?"" and shows you the food before giving it to you). The seat was uncomfortable.

However the morning of the flight we received a notification that our flight had been delayed 2 hours. Upon arrival at JFK staff were very friendly and updated us. Lounge in JFK was the nicest I have seen excellent food spacious and comfortable. JFK-CDG was aboard an A380. Boarding took place through two gates so did not take as long as I thought made comfortable by the fact that Air France was sensitive to the boarding time and distributed drinks hot towels and an amenities kit while economy was boarding. Staff spoke excellent English and announcements were made in both French and English. Flight attendants were friendly the seats fully reclined and the pillow and blanket were comfortable. Plane was clean and bathrooms spacious. Individual TV's with plenty of choice. Passengers kept well informed throughout. Upon arrival in Paris immigration took about 5 seconds.

We were offered stand-by on the last flight to Phoenix along with 10 other passengers. We were told that there were no seats available the next day and would have to fly stand-by on any of the flights to Phoenix on Tuesday. We were confirmed for a flight on Wednesday. This was unacceptable since we had to return to work on Wednesday.

Taking matters into our own hands we chose to fly into Las Vegas and rented a car to make the 5.5 hour drive home.

I have been flying for 40 years. I have seen a drastic decline in the quality of air travel over the years. To go from getting a hot meal on the plane to having to pay for a can of soda.

On check in discovered we not even on the CPT to JNB passenger list / Mango airlines apparently not informed of us by SAA. The matter was resolved by Mango. We then discovered the new SAA excess baggage rules at O.R. Tambo airport (JNB to LHR leg)! I felt the check in staff were unprofessional and unapologetic. Be warned - 2 suitcases at 31kg + 29kg for 3 people equals 14kg of excess baggage (our 6 year old's unused baggage allowance was not considered). Also O.R. Tambo direction/ signage confusing and could be improved (although all staff helpful in re-directing us). I will recommend SAA to others for the excellent in flight aspect but suggest avoiding O.R.

I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. I will fly another airline for my next trip to Florida in a few months time just to avoid the inconvenience of no leg room (and I'm barely 5 foot tall) discomfort of thinly padded seats inability to get in and out of any seats but the aisle nothing to ease boredom - not even a used newspaper from a previous flight.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,N Moss,United Kingdom,2015-06-11,"FR2005, Stansted to Otopeni, Romania. This was our first flight with Ryanair and we approached it with a degree of caution and apprehension. I have to say, that these feelings were unfounded. Ryanair in 2015, simply do not deserve the reputation they have. The entire booking process was easy to understand and administer. Follow the rules and it works well and easy. The flight itself was bang on time, smooth and a joy. A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old. I think that all Ryanair need to do now to complete their transformation to a customer friendly carrier, is make water affordable on board.

I paid extra for an aisle seat by the emergency exit on the Sydney-LAX portion of my flight for extra leg room. After finding the two people seated next to me didn't pay any extra for their seats really upset me. Why did I have to pay so much more and they didn't pay anything. The flight attendants bumped into me every time they went up and down the aisle I couldn't sleep with this happening which made the flight that much longer. I hate to say how bad the food was on the flight. I had 3 meals served and only had a few bites of each meal. I was hoping for much more from Qantas and the extra money I'm out to upgrade was a waste. And having to pay for a seat that the other two people didn't have to pay extra for really was upsetting.

Flight due to take off at 13.20 at 13.45 the Captain announced 9 passengers needed to disembark the aircraft in order to balance the load. A few passengers opted for the US$500 voucher in exchange for disembarking. However an hour later the aircraft hadn't moved. Chief FA then informs passengers that another 10 passengers have to be offloaded. Eventually all passengers had to disembark the aircraft and re-board so calculations could be reconciled with the regulations. At 16.30 after a frustrating 3 hour wait I voluntarily disembarked was taken to the baggage hall to collect my bag only to find all passengers’ baggage had not even been loaded onto the aircraft. Staff lied and tried to pass the buck at every opportunity. I have now been rebooked on 17th April and am not expecting a better show from KQ.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,2,0,0,NA,NA,1,0

eva-air,/airline-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,Sean Kuo,United States,2013-12-05,Non-stop flight in November from Taipei (TPE) to Paris (CDG) on the Royal Laurel Class. The new lounge at Taipei is renovated with somewhat night club decor and mood lighting. Its spacious not over crowded and with a lot of food and beverage selections. However there was long wait for the showers so be aware to allow at least one hour before departure if you wish to take a shower. The new Royal Laurel class is indeed one of the best business class hard products in the industry. The seat is spacious and extremely comfortable. Each seat has direct aisle access and a lot of storage. The pillow and comforter are in good quality. EVA also serves Dom Perignon as pre departure drink which is indeed a plus on already quite impressive hard product. The service was a little disappointing. The crews seemed to be exhausted and just wanted to get things done as soon as possible so in general it lacked the personal touch and interaction with passengers. To be fair my glass was never empty and crews did come by promptly when I hit the call button. The food was adequate but not fantastic and portions were skimpy. A couple of small things I felt somehow to shadow the whole relatively positive experience. One is the crews retrieved the menus while passengers falling asleep. I felt it was sneaky and to be green in the wrong way. In short good hard product and adequate food and service.

Service and comfort excellent as good as many airlines' first class. The seat turns into a flat bed and wide enough for a comfortable sleep. Good food very well presented by their very friendly and competent cabin crew. I just have a few points to make that could improve their service. Limousine service should be part of the deal when flying business class dining should be on demand and flights to Kuala Lumpur should give a choice of Malay cuisine. The short connection time in Muscat can be a source of anxiety as passengers need to go through security again and there is no priority lane for business class passengers. The last few times there was hardly any wait at security so that was fine but should there be a delay I hope Oman Air can guarantee that passengers will not miss their connection flight. If you get time to visit their lounge it is usually quiet and comfortable but they need to provide more shower facilities.

Check-in in PMV takes an hour or so since they fill out the passenger list for MIA manually. Transit in BLA is quite easy no long walking distances BUT broken escalators for over a year now disgusting.

After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed!

The difference between low-cost and full-service airlines is in the was they handle failure. For AAX the way they handle it is - badly. Both our outward and return flights cancelled and re-booked - we were advised this my SMS at 22.45 on a Friday night! It took 4 calls at my own expense to fix it. One of the Premium flatbeds had no power to it so not even the 2 inches of recline you get in economy. Staff said they would fix it - but didn't - nor did they have the courtesy to tell us it wasn't going to be fixed - they simply disappeared off and forgot about us. This was booked as Premium flatbed it wasn't an Optiontown upgrade. We were asked about this several times so I guess if it had been OT they would have cared even less. Our Optiontown for the return flight was not transferred to the re-booked flight. OT has confirmed the refund but it shows the lack of interest of AAX in customer service - naturally when I mentioned this on check-in and asked about OT upgrades they told me the best they could do was to sell me a business-class ticket at full cost. The 5 people I dealt with at KLIA2 (their hub airport) went out of their way to be difficult avoid giving answers avoid assisting arguing why things couldn't be done to avoid actually doing a d** thing and since they all gave conflicting statements I spent two hours arguing with people between flights and left none the wiser.

The airplane sat on the YOW tarmac for over an hour and the flight attendants could only say that it was because there was lightening storms in Toronto. Only good thing I can say is that they turned off the engine and allowed us to get out of our seats while we waited. On my way off the plane in TOR no one was able to provide assistance on how to ensure I could make my connecting flight to San Diego which was showing ""on time"" on the flight board. After passing customs baggage check etc. the flight was no longer showing on the flight board. The AC flight attendants I found roaming around had no clue where to direct me. I happen to find the service desk and was told to get in line even though I said my flight was leaving in 10 minutes and I simply needed the gate number. As there were 4 people in line my flight had left by the time I received ""service"". So booking another flight to get to San Diego I opted for a layover in Los Angeles that night instead of waiting another 24 hours in Toronto. I was not offered any compensation for either spending the night in Toronto nor Los Angeles even though Air Canada caused me to miss my flight. Staff member told me he could not give me the boarding pass for the next days flight but omitted to say he did not complete the booking and that I was expected to go to the AC ticket counter at LAX to get one. I only got the customer service contact information when I returned to the desk to confirm my flight to San Diego was in fact the next morning at 9.55. After a short night in a close by hotel I returned to the LAX airport the next morning. I went to US airlines who had no trace of my info who redirected me to American Airlines I found out that there was no ticket for me as the booking the TO agent did not complete the booking. The agent in Toronto said he could do nothing for me because the notes on file said I had accepted LAX as my final destination. Told I needed to speak with a ticket agent at LAX to see what they could do for me. I walked from American Eagle terminal 4 to Air Canada terminal 2 and back. I barely made the 11.30 flight. I hate to think what would have happened to my baggage had I any with me on this trip.

After refuelling he informs us there's a curfew for our plane to take off. So instead we will be spending the night in a hotel and that there would be buses waiting for us to take us to the hotel. It took us a while to get our luggage nearly 11 pm. No buses waiting. No company people to inform us (I understand LAN has no personnel there but what does oneworld serve for then?)

Flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said about our return trip. Check-in staff were barely civil and one woman in particular gives new meaning to the word 'rude'. Their fees for overweight and/or extra bag is outrageous. Onboard the cabin staff were friendly and helpful but we couldn't get extra creamer for our hot beverages. The attendant came with evaporated milk and proceeded to add it to my friend's coffee resulting in her having to get another one and another package of creamer and sugar. The little TV was loud and there was no way to block it out. The only blessing here is that the flight is short so escape wasn't too long in coming.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,L Renton,Australia,2013-06-26,SYD TO DPS (Bali) a few day ago. I was mortified that there was no inflight entertainment. Appalling considering the cost of the flight. The staff are becoming 'too cool for school' which is a real put off. The reason I left my frequent flyer and switched from using Qantas over to VA was because they were much more professionally casual staff and their pricing was competitive. Not only did the flight have no entertainment it was like a cool room in the cabin no pillows or blankets and the food that was served was tiny! I'm now considering going back over to Qantas to give them another go at least they offer entertainment have a lounge at Sydney Intl and serve spirits whilst providing blankets / pillows.

We're spoilt for choice in Perth with multiple flights daily by AirAsia, Garuda, Jetsar and Virgin. We used to fly Jetstar because as a Qantas Club member we could use the QF lounge in Perth - that doesn't open just for Jetstar flights, so you have to jag it when there's a Qantas international flight going out - not that there's many of those these days. So this time we decided to give Air Asia a go because their fares were excellent. Spot on time departure ex Perth, clean aircraft and we paid extra for Row 1. Pleasant enough flight for a LCC. We paid extra for the Red Carpet service on the return journey, and this was an absolute treat. No queues, someone to escort you through immigration, and access to the Premier Lounge which is on a par with the QF Business lounges in Perth. Also you get to board first, so minimal queuing - for frequent travellers to Bali this is worth paying for. The usual customer types on board making it mildly embarrassing for the FA's but they'd be used to it on that run. It was an on time departure, and this time a little IFE with one of the cabin crew playing his guitar and singing over the cabin PA to well deserved applause from the punters.

The food was good video on demand excellent and the cleanliness of the bathrooms impressive. My only criticism was that they told me that they only have 2 bottles of white wine in Economy for a 9 hr journey. Coming home I paid for an upgrade to Business Class for the over night journey back to Sydney. There was no-one in 1st class and only 4 people in Business Class the crew upgrade all passengers to 1st class cabin and provided Business Class service.

Three choice of entrees and the option I chose was very well prepared though a little stingy in portions. FAs pour alcoholic beverages from large bottles in tiny amounts. Wine selection was poor even for economy and their wine bottles were empty by the time they came to me. On the whole however the FAs on the first sector were gems. They provided service from the heart with genuine smiles. But they were horribly inefficient. It took them 4 hours from take off to finish dinner service and turn the lights down. And this was on a 6 hours night flight. An hour before landing they served breakfast wraps (much appreciated) which Emirates does not on similar flights to Dubai. Economy FAs on the flight to Dhaka were functional. Migrant workers from Bangladesh needed to be transported and fed and that is all the FAs achieved. No smiley engagements as in the first segment.

GOL was once known as Brasil's low-cost airline but prices are now the same as its competitor TAM. The check-in line at GIG was fairly long.

I chose a sandwich combo that included a tasteless sandwich a bag of chips and a can of Pepsi for 20 reais (approx US $15.00 a rather steep price for the mediocre quality).

Etihad has a competitive price on this route but their product is just average and below the standard of e.g. Qatar Airways. Their business class on the A332 is fairly cramped both seat space and cabin space in general. Manoeuvring through the cabin trying not to disturb sleeping passengers is tricky and I'm just a 1.80m 78kg guy. That same average goes for the food served. Flight crew was friendly and efficient. But the worst is that you have to transit Abu Dhabi airport when flying with them. By far one of the worst airports I have ever visited and I travel extensively for the last 30 years. For some reason they forgot to install a sufficient number of toilet facilities resulting everywhere even in their business and first premium lounges for waiting lines of 10-12 people.

The attendants are courteous however attentiveness drops significantly when you do not speak Spanish. On both trips it was very obvious Spanish speaking passengers received somewhat better service. All attendants seemed to speak English they were simply not keen on practising it. I would expect flight attendants on an international route to provide consistent service to all passengers.

The business seats on the Emirates A380 appear roomy until you actually sit in one when you realize that the arrangement of everything around you actually quite crowds you. The extension of the food and beverage tray leaves very little room to move. The bed is actually a flat bed but the shoulder room is too squashed even for the average sized person that I am. This made it difficult to get any reasonable sleep. The hostess insisted on keeping the shutters down for the full 14 hours of the flight as we travelled from night to day and then into the night.

I got on then and everyone with bags for overhead got on quickly with much less stress than the Continental flight I took in May. Return flight the same as the first quiet and on time.

Very clean though boarding was late we still left on time and arrived on time IFE was working though it was very boring. The crew were constantly hardworking and kind of strict. The return flight DAR-NBO was quite the same a rather older Embraer 190 boarding late again but we took off and arrived on time at least the cabin crew were much kinder upon arrival we found our baggage at the new arrivals terminal which I have to say is the most beautiful African terminal I've seen.

Flew PVG-LHR on one of the A340-600 in 60K (G-VWEB). I'm 5"" 8' so not the largest person in the world and yet my knees were being poked the entire flight by the pocket from the seat in front of me. Padding on the seat was pretty much non-existent resulting in a rather numb behind after a short time into the flight. Also it's worth noting that it seems seats in A and K mostly have something under them for the in-flight entertainment system. This meant I had even less space to stretch if needed due to that being under the seat in front of me. The headrest was incapable of keeping the position of the wings that are on it collapsing the second you put your head against it. If the person in the seat in front puts their seat back it makes the experience even more claustrophobic - not to mention making it hard to use the screen for the in-flight entertainment. Not that that matters as the screen quality is so bad you won't want to use it anyway. Then there is the food - it's tasteless overcooked and there's not a lot of quantity to it. At least they came around at reasonable times with it and offered drinks fairly often during the flight. Also the lack of any form of power is annoying not even a USB port for plugging a phone/tablet into.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,2,1,1,NA,NA,2,0
norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,P Gardiner,United Kingdom,2015-01-05,Norwegian just lost another 3 customers. We were pleased when they launched their London Gatwick to Rome service as we go to Rome quite frequently. Christmas 2013 they were superb. Amidst considerable chaos at Gatwick they left pretty much on time and got us there fine. However since then they managed to give my wife a 6 hour delay (Rome to London Gatwick) at Easter 2014 turning a late night flight into an early morning flight. Last night - Dec 28th 2014 - my daughter and I were on the 21.55 from Rome to Gatwick which suffered a 4 hour delay and I finally got to bed at 6.30am. They were also an hour late on the outbound flight. My advice would be to avoid. The late evening slot they have at Rome means a delay does turn into a real inconvenience particularly if you are supposed to go to work next day. Communication from their customer service staff almost non existent. Got the feeling they were scared of us and that these delays were pretty common. Also nothing to do with Norwegian but Rome Fiumicino airport is pretty awful for being stuck at late at night. Everything shut no food or drink and horrible metal chairs with fixed metal armrests so you can't lay out on even though there was plenty of space. People started laying on the floor. Anyway on 6 flights we have had a 1 hour a 4 hour and a 6 hour delay so I'm not interested any more fortunately London to Rome I have many options.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,2,1,0,NA,NA,3,0

Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty.

I was asked to pass every single item of china cutlery and food to passenger seating next to me felt like me being cabin crew. Everything looked rushed without any attention to detail.

No other airline does this that I have flown with. You can watch what you like until 20 mins after landing with British Airways for example and many others. I had 7 mins left of the movie so not impressed. Food portion was small and not particularly nice. Wine is poured by them into a cup so you don't get much. Offered only twice on long flight.

The plane departed from BKK with 40 minutes delay so my luggage could not make my final destination in MRS due to very short transit at CDG. The flight was not full so middle seat were not taken but unfortunately a passenger just took it for herself. Food and drink outbound were ok. However flight attendants completely forgot to clear the tray from my seat due to the lady sleeping with 2 seats! I pressed the call button for someone to take the tray away and a lady came and took it with an unpleasant mood. During the flight only one or two rounds of drinks were served. Before landing no hot towels were given and then breakfast was served they ran out of my choice so I had to take something else which was ok and kind of edible (enough).

Boarding in the limited space area of Gate 74 within LHR’s T1 was a shambles. Economy Class appears to have been heavily over-booked so that many Economy Class passengers were being upgraded. I have no problem with people being upgraded I have been the fortunate recipient of upgrades on various occasions previously but ordinarily upgrades are awarded on a SFU basis. This would not appear to apply with BMI – I was unfortunate enough to find myself being sat next to an upgraded passenger who in shorts and flip-flops was clearly not content with being upgraded without then spending much time both prior to and after departure trying to re-arrange the cabin so that he and his travelling companion who had also been upgraded could sit together. All of that apart the Business Class product on this mid-haul flight was excellent the aircraft cabin was spotless the new leather seating was ideal for this length of flight the cabin crew were attentive and the catering was imaginative in terms of choice.

Flight attendants were rude refusing to take rubbish which I had taken to the back of the plane and was sent back to my seat. My friend overheard two flight attendants talking about passengers whilst they served along the plane. Totally unprofessional. Entertainment system dated and basic. As a frequent long haul traveller this is the worst entertainment system I have seen. Small choice of films and programmes and unable to pause stop and watch at your own convenience. On the return flight the entertainment system was broken and was advised to purchase books and magazines to keep ourselves entertained at our own cost. Half hearted apology from the Captain who also clearly thought he was a comedian. No apology from miserable cabin crew and no offer of a free drink to soften the disappointment. This was my first time flying with TC and to be honest I was very disappointed with the airline staff and on-board services. TC is nothing more than long haul budget airline - charging for soft drinks unprofessional staff rubbish entertainment system (when its working!) poor quality food which I'm sure James Martin would not feed to his dog's! The plane we travelled on (an old MyTravel plane) at one point I wasn't sure it would get us home from all the creaking it was making!

I would love to say I would never fly again with TC but unfortunately I am booked to fly to Mexico with them next year. I will be prepared for this flight knowing how rubbish they are and will not expect anything more than poor service and rubbish entertainment. TC advertise themselves as a premium holiday company.

The two hour delay on the way out was nothing compared to the nearly 10 hour delay on the way back. A brief apology was made when we were finally on board but no explanation offered other than that ""they'd had a really bad week"". What made the experience even worse was the misleading or complete lack of information about what was happening and no obvious presence of staff from the airline at the airport to keep us updated. We were initially informed of a six hour delay by our tour operator (Just Sunshine) on the way to the airport and were transferred to a nearby hotel to wait. We were provided with lunch (though the quality of food was poor). Our tour rep seemed unable to keep us informed of reason for the delay or keep us updated - some passengers resorted to the internet or relatives in the UK for information. When we were taken to the airport after six hours we were informed we would be taking off around 7/7.30. However at 7.30 we were still waiting at the departure gate (although the information boards were flashing 'last call'). The departure time shown on the boards then changed to 8.30 then 9.30. Just after we received a free soft drink for our troubles the boarding announcement finally came and we took off nearly 10 hours late.

Needed very quick tickets to attend a funeral in the US…and Qatar was one of the few that had seats and an almost reasonable price. That said pretty impressed with the airline. Seats had good legroom - one minor issue was the lack of adequate padding - my whole family grumbled about it considering the many hours we were on their flights. We were all a little saddle-sore at the end of the long flights - and we were using the blankets as extra padding. Aircraft's were of course newish 777's with the exception of an A340 out of LHR…IFE was great… wide variety - razor-sharp seat-back screens - we particularly liked their selection of international movies. I'm diabetic and the meals they supplied were fine the rest of the family very happy with their meals as well. No complaints good tucker. Cabin crews varied from outstanding to good. On our last leg back to Perth staff did their job well - if not particularly happily. I did notice they didn't run up and down the aisles with drinks every hour - but given half (or more) of the cabin was usually asleep - I can see why. They were very quick to hand over juice or water whenever requested. Doha terminal is a definite let-down - the bus trips to and from the terminal are dreadful in this day and age.

We first arrive to check-in and we are instructed to use the kiosk to print boarding passes and check our bags. We start using the barely functioning slow as molasses kiosk and it puts 2 bags on one person. First bag is $45 and second bag is $55. So $100. However there were two people checking in so it would've been more economical for us to charge one bag per person ($45 per bag each person = $90). But the system just decides to charge one person $100. Alright we'll just get it fixed with the desk lady. Nope not really! She ""can't help"". But she can inform us that our carry on bag costs $50 more too. They charge for every bag - carry on and checked plus surcharges for more than one bag. The bag fees are one thing but the fact that they don't communicate their fees in advance and clearly is whole other issue. I have never been through a check-in line being yelled at either.

Row 25 (back row near the toilets) and seats E and F which had no width and felt almost prison like. In addition to this the Boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy - especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew. Would recommend people sitting in rows 20 and forward to avoid this issue. Inflight services by Cabin Crew were excellent. Great breakfast options and Drinks. Cabin Crew were constantly looking to top up water. No IFE made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on - considering we had read that iPads were offered on this aircraft?

Meals are served in very basic cutlery (on plastic tray) but the taste is surprisingly good (choices between meat/chicken and fish/seafood plus entree and dessert).

That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight.

The modern A340-600 aircraft has roomy space compared to other international airlines and my favourite comfortable 2-4-2 seat configuration. They also have power outlets behind each seat which many airlines don't have they have many music channels. The meals are a great amount. The flight attendants are friendly and helpful as on the way to PVG a PAX lost his wallet somewhere and about 3 FA's tried to help him find his wallet for over an hour and they made an announcement too. Shanghai's PVG international airport is very nice and modern and easy to navigate around. I've seen many negative comments and review for China Eastern and don't understand why. But most of them i've noticed come from Westerners and I understand why. The food and culture and drinks with no ice is Chinese culture. It'll be unfamiliar so bring some snacks.

There was only one check-in agent for the entire flight. Venice Marco Polo airport is a nightmare to depart from as there are very few security desks and lots of flights. Queue for security was appalling and stretched out of the departure building! I stood in line for almost 2 hours and saw several flights between different groups of passengers from various countries. Small children and elderly people were very upset. As I stood in line my name was called for final boarding. I only just made it to the gate and saw that 3 other passengers were denied boarding. I was bussed out to the flight alone on a transfer bus. Flight was pretty full and departure delayed 45 mins - not the fault of Aer Lingus though. The seats were fine if cramped. Tea and a snack had to be paid for. The crew were very nice and worked hard. I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and opted for the Aer Lingus flight to gain some more points. I booked a Y class seat and yet have not been awarded any points at all by Qantas who blame Aer Lingus who in turn blame Qantas! The fare was not the cheapest as some rivals offered cheaper deals with a stop-over. I would use Aer Lingus again as I like their friendly staff. I feel that the check-in procedure at Venice needs to be examined and Aer Lingus ought to exert some pressure on the airport to improve the squalid experience in the airport.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,5,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

Throughout all flights I was greatly impressed by the efficiency of LAN. Ground and cabin crews were friendly and helpful. The LAN boxed meals on (one class) short flights was consistent. Cabin crew warm and welcoming. Trolley service by cabin crew was excellent despite the fact that the majority of flights were fully booked. The one sour point was that the inflight entertainment (IPL-SCL) failed in my section of the aircraft. However having had a tsunami alert whilst on Easter Island in the early hours of my departure day I relished the chance for a sleep. This flight is treated as an international flight.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,D Patrick,Australia,2014-10-31,MEL-SGN-CDG and return. We decided to try Vietnam Airlines as they offered Australia to Europe flights at a significantly lower price to other airlines I've used in the past. We got what we paid for and nothing more. Note that Australia and Europe flights aren't timed to connect with each other which means a 16 hour layover in each direction. This worked out well as we were able to exit the airport stay at a nearby hotel and freshen up before the connecting flight while our bags remained in transit. The only problem with this is you need to purchase apply for a visa before leaving MEL which can up to 140 AUD on top of the fare. The MEL-SGN flights on the A330 were fine however the 777-200 on the SGN-CDG leg is looking very tired. The seat back IFE is limited and works in channels rather than on demand. Most of the cabin crew could not speak much English. The food out of MEL and CDG was okay but the food out of SGN was terrible.

Very good service offering hot/cold/alcoholic drinks and a sweet or savoury snack not expected but appreciated and the poor steward barely had time to clear up before landing such is the short flight.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to ""buy"" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly. I will not fly Aer Lingus transatlantic anymore when there are much better options.

We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer.

On paper the seat pitch is the same as Singapore Airlines at 32 inches but this does not translate into real space. Sitting normally my knees touched the seat in front and when the person in front reclined the tray table was rendered virtually unusable the TV screen could not be seen properly and my shins were cramped against the seat underside. Getting out of the seat from this position was an undignified affair almost falling into the aisle. The meal menu read like a Michelin starred restaurant but arrived in a tacky sealed plastic tray which when opened revealed a pile of mush. The ""seasonal"" salad was 80% lettuce with a slice of cucumber and a tomato. Portions were very small and we then had to endure an 8 hour gap between meals with virtually nothing. Good economy class travel is about doing many small things well Virgin currently do nothing well and should send staff on a flight with Singapore Emirates or Etihad to see how it can be done.

The wait time to get off the plane on arriving after a nine hour flight was over half an hour the excuse given was the airport was too busy to accept us immediately. On the return to Manchester we were also left sitting on the plane for more than half an hour this was due to parking the plane off stand and waiting for buses. The excuse given was the airport was very busy which was obviously not true because we were the only passengers going though passport control.

liat,/airline-reviews/liat,LIAT customer review,Thomas Scott,United States,2015-03-04,"I have flown several times with LIAT over the last 5 years and had heard many ""horror stories"" of stranded passengers etc.. however my experience was ok up till now. Flying from St. Vincent to Tortola (still in the middle of it) I got the full brunt of Liat's gross incompetence. To make a long story short I was supposed to leave St. Vincent yesterday at 7.20am and arrived in Tortola same day at noon. We board the plane the engines start and then stop - we are told there is something wrong with the aircraft however don't worry we have an engineer working on it. We disembarked and stayed in the departure lounge until 7.30pm. Throughout the day the story kept changing - the misinformation (lies) were extraordinary ""other broken airplanes engineer not coming we will get you out soon"" etc. At 7.30pm they took us to a restaurant in Kingstown for dinner. We waited 2 hours for our food. After dropping us off they disappeared - returning at 11.30pm to take us to a hotel. No info on what would happen the next day but said they would be back at 6am to pick us up. The next day someone banged on my door at 4.30am - saying we have to leave in 30 min. We get to the airport at 5.15 - our flight was supposed to leave at 7.20 for Barbados (the first stop) we left an hour and a half late. At this moment I am in Barbados in the departure lounge - awaiting my next flight (to Antigua) at 1.50pm. Just heard that is has been delayed until 6.00pm. My flight from Antigua to Tortola leaves at 7.30pm (I will likely miss it and have to overnight in Antigua - The saga continues.

It was delayed by bad weather but the problem was the attitude of Transat. We should have boarded at 9pm - instead it was eventually 2am but with no food vouchers or drinks. We then sat on the plane until 5am before a glass of water was handed out. Then taxiing out two people fell ill and we returned to the gate eventually taking off at 7am. In that time no food - just one glass of water - not even coffee. We then flew to Montreal to change crew (they were out of hours that's ok) and then flew to London - and were given just a tiny slice of pizza - on a 7-hour flight!

ethiopian-airlines,/airline-reviews/ethiopian-airlines,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,K McComb,United States,2015-03-28,I have flown Ethiopian Airlines 3 times in the last 4 months (DC to various countries in East Africa via Addis). I love that the airline has a direct flight to East Africa but I am getting tired of a few things that will likely make me use other airlines that pass through Europe. The tickets are good value for money but the more you fly it the things it doesn't do well start to grate on you. The food! Like someone else said it's bad. They have maybe 3 entrees on rotation (a curry chicken seems to be the most common) and it gets old fast especially if you connect on another flight and are served the same entree you ate a few hours ago. The desserts are often a soapy flavored mousse. The middle of the night snack is the worst- it is all carbs and bad! A muffin or croissant a white bread roll and a fruit cup. Essentially it's cheap and not good quality (in terms of airline food quality). Also they don't serve enough water throughout the 12-16 hour flight especially because you can't bring on your own water at the Addis airport unlike you can in the US. That makes for a long thirsty flight. I just got off a flight today where one of the bathrooms was completely out of commission and another had a sink that didn't drain. That's bad and I am not convince that these things get fixed between flights. If you need a cheap flight to Africa go for it but if you are like me and traveling for work it gets old very quickly. I want to save my NGO money and so Ethiopian Airlines is an economical option but honesty not sure that I can tolerate it much more. Also between November an February they did not change the films which meant that my 2nd round trip was a long flight without entertainment.

I got an email that said if your ticket was booked prior to April 2012 and you were flying Coach your baggage requirements had changed since they had added a new class called Comfort Coach. Those new customers who were going to pay more for the privilege could take on 2 carry ons not to exceed 20 lbs. each while the old coach customers me could only carry on 13 pounds. I had to get another valise that complied with this new ruling cutting down considerably on what I could pack. When I tried to upgrade so I could take more luggage I was told expedia had to do it. When I called they said no they couldn't do it try Icelandair. I arrived at the gate boarding passes having been printed there was no provision of separating luggage weights so all my travail was for nothing. I could have taken an elephant on board if it could fit in the overhead. The only thing complimentary on the plane was water. The flight attendants were professional but on the second leg of the trip they didn't even pass out a water bottle. I think I would rather cut my trip one day shorter and take Air France where they still treat you like a human being on a transatlantic trip. Expect to be fitted into a sardine can then you will have no surprises but a meal and a drink still goes a long way to making things a little more pleasurable.

air-berlin,/airline-reviews/air-berlin,Air Berlin customer review,Karim Lankarany,Germany,2014-12-31,Berlin - Madeira - Berlin. Very friendly crew on both flights including regular updates on flight status. Compared to Germanwings all passengers still get free drinks (2 rounds alcoholic beverages are not included) a rather tasty sandwich and then some chocolate later. Space is also ok. So while the service has declined over the years (no more free magazines) Air Berlin still offers better service than most other charter carriers plus the friendly staff made both flights very enjoyable. The only thing I would criticise is that although they show even a movie on this flight you need to purchase headsets which in the end nobody did (yes they are only 3 Euro but giving those out for free would be nice).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

For a LCC I found them really good and for less than half the price really great value.

My intention for this trip had been delayed for that time and needless to say I could not make it back as planned since I had to finish the business that took me there. The Airline refused to reschedule me on another flight as they were booked but had a seat for the full price if I did not want to wait another week to get a rescheduled flight with minimum penalty.

Similar weather conditions days later in Liverpool and not a single easyJet flight was cancelled. Full ticket refund on their website was straightforward so no complaints about that. Staff at Manchester airport were very patient they could not do much about it and had to face all of us frustrated passengers. But equally it was clear that the company had not a clear plan to bring their customers to their destination their advice was more like go home. In spite of all that easyJet when it operates their flights they tend to be very good only when things go out of the ordinary they tend to be very bad.

Across these flights I experienced their B767 on the international route the B737 on the flight to Diego and ATR72s on the other domestic routes. Overall I enjoyed the airline. The 767 does have a tired interior and I would certainly prefer to have preassigned seating. Flight attendants were friendly on all flights but English was not good so I'm not sure how I would have managed if my wife wasn't with me to translate from French and Malagasy into English. All of our flights left on time but I couldn't understand why we were asked to arrive so early for these small flights. My biggest complaint is with the airports in Madagascar not the airline. Seating is very limited and if you can find it it is most uncomfortable. Found the airport in Morondava to be surprisingly the best of the above locations and the airport in Diego is just plain awful. I did find it difficult to deal with Air Madagascar when booking my tickets from Canada. You can't deal directly with the airline but rather their North American agent Sita World Travel and I found they're agents friendly but not all that smart and very slow to answer e-mails.

The good points are planes always on time (never had a flight delay longer than 5 mins) food is quite good and IFE on the 737-800 quite good for domestic travel. The bad points; seats in economy are possibly the most cramped and un-comfortable of any airline I have ever flown with even the newer 737-800 aircraft have a very tired and old look and feel inside some of FA's seem to just go through the motions and boarding at Perth Airport is just a cattle stampede but that is not all down to Qantas. On a side note the few times I have upgraded to Business Class it has been a wonderful flying experience and one of the best regional domestic business class offerings.

Rather outdated compared to other airlines flying this same route. I asked the Flight Attendant a question on the US Customs Form and she didn't understand what I was asking so she brought the Purser and was told a completely different thing. The food was sub par and cold. For the price paid I am inclined to leave the Star Alliance and travel on Japan Airlines.

One reason we chose the carrier was for the Dreamliner service on the 10 hour flight to Europe and we decided after adding on all the extra charges to take the plunge and go for the Premium seats. I can't really say how bad 'Norwegian Air' was as we never flew them except for the leg from Copenhagen to Nice. Instead of the Dreamliner we ended up on a Portuguese charter 777 run by Euro Atlantic Airways. We got nothing the antiquated system on this plane didn't work. When was the last time you had an ashtray in your armrest? The food was inedible - even for airline food. The crew were on the verge of hostile and the seats were worn and uncomfortable.

This flight left around 20 minutes later than it should due to airport issues. Captain kept everyone fully informed which was good. Flight crew provided prompt and excellent service which given it was an overnight flight was very good. Meal served after 40 minutes in the air giving passengers around 7 hours sleep. Aircraft was only half full so pretty much everyone had a spare seat next to them so they could stretch out a bit. I managed to get around 6 hours sleep in which is pretty good for me in economy as I'm tall (having the extra space really helped). Food was very good although the breakfast pastry was bland. IFE was totally pathetic IFE Screen only 10cm in size and the current selection of movies and music was simply appalling. You get much better IFE on domestic flights so lift your game Qantas. Aircraft seat got pretty hard after 9 hours flying and the aircraft is looking old needs to be revamped shortly.

Like many on this site I had assumed that I would be flying Egypt Air but was very surprised when I arrived at the airport with the tour group and saw the ancient DC9 on the tarmac. I'm a nervous flyer anyway and so really had to weight up how much I wanted to see the sites. I decided seeing as my tour manager does this every week and that he's still here that there must be an element of safety! The safety announcement lasted approx 30 secs and did not involve lifejacket demonstrations (you also fly over Lake Nasser not just desert). They omitted the safety demonstration on the flight back. People were using their mobiles throughout the flight and the cockpit door was propped open frequently. Security was a joke. Our boarding passes had random names on (no form of ID was ever seen nor asked for) and we were allowed any type of fluid with us they just didn't bother to check. Everyone beeped as they went through the walk through scanners and no one was patted down. The plane was in a poor state with many seats broken what appeared to be parcel tape holding things together and the constant smell of fuel.

Unfortunately Little Red flight delayed so we had to transfer to BA to get to Heathrow in time. Plane from Heathrow was cramped and uncomfortable seating - economy seats I know but had always been more comfortable and spacious in the past! 1 bar service in a 9h+ flight.

Water or juice only offered. Poor quality meal cheap ice lolly and pretty tasteless 2 finger sandwiches before landing. What's happened to this airline? Plane half empty. Staff more interested in having a social gathering amongst themselves at the back of the plane. Dirty smelly toilets - even just after boarding! Only positive points were we arrived on time with all baggage and to be fair experienced a good flight with Little Red on our return from Heathrow to Edinburgh - much more pleasant staff and the offer of a miniature spirit small bottle of wine - double the quantity we were offered on the long haul flights both out and return to Miami!

All in it was pretty annoying especially considering I had arrived at the airport after midnight for a 3.40am flight. But these irritations aside I found the service prompt and friendly the food about as exciting as I have had on any other airline and the value for money exceptional. Of course a trip across the Pacific on a new A380 is more comfortable but for short and medium haul flights this airline is not incomparable to what other full service airlines have to offer for the same length hauls. It is ridiculously cheap. Return from Japan to Bali on a full service airline cost me less than a flight from Australia to New Zealand (half the distance) on a budget airline where I have to pay for my own luggage food and drinks and entertainment whilst sitting on a hard faux leather chair with my knees under my ear lobes.

My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don't work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead.

On both our outgoing and return flights the flight attendants were very attentive and in both cases asked passengers sitting close to us to refrain from eating nuts which we greatly appreciated.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,D West,United Kingdom,2012-09-23,Return from Gatwick to Luxor 12 and 19th September 2012. At 1.95 m the seating plan made the trip absolute torture. My wife is 1.58m and had very little room to spare - when a seat reclined she had her first attack of claustrophobia on an airplane ever. Cabin crew expertise extend only as far as selling overpriced horrible food booze and cigarettes. Other airlines shift passengers around for the sake of comfort and safety when things are tight - quite infuriating when some passengers were allowed to sleep across 3 seats when others cant even sit with their legs pointing forward. Check in staff on the 12th at Gatwick were rude and dictatorial. Paid 24 pounds for being 2 kgs (combined between my wife and I) over what was a pathetic baggage allowance.

It's worth paying the little extra for business class ($40 per person each way) as the seats are roomy and comfortable plus you get lounge access at both Bangkok and Paro although the Paro lounge is a bit quaint. The other reason for booking business class is if your flight gets delayed as ours did on the return journey for around five hours. There's little in the way of facilities at Paro airport so it's worth the extra for a more comfortable place to wait (and enjoy free drinks of course). Make sure you sit on the left hand side on the flight into Paro as you get the best views of the Himalayas.

Try getting some rest in those seats if you're more than 175 cm tall. Second worst is mileage awards/accrual policy which terribly lags behind the competition in star alliance and elsewhere. Most tickets bought with ANA now only provide you with 50% actual miles accrual. Third is small size of portions (though nice food I must say).

We were then rudely pulled out of the line and asked if we understood English in a condescending voice after being given no time to try and fit our handbags into our luggage. We were then sent to the boarding desk because we couldn't fit one in. The crew member there had no idea why we were sent there so he sent us back. We were then told it was going to cost an extra 55 Euro for a bag 1cm thicker than the allowed thickness which is outrageous not to mention we were well under our weight limit. I then noticed that some other passengers had cabin baggage as big as the one we had to pay extra for and put in the hold and also a large handbag or briefcase. In one country we are allowed certain things and the next we are not. For the same company in these countries policies and procedures are different obviously as a result of poor management.

Had enough miles in the bank to make this work. The schedule was perfect albeit a change of planes in LAX but only a short layover. Took off from Vegas a few minutes late. A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means.

My only option was to remove excess weight, which I did. I removed clothing and gifts until I reached the 8 kg limit and placed them in the garbage pail provided by the ticket agent.

Considering the flight didn't leave until 23.30 even small things such as socks were not available until approx an hour in to the flight which was quite frustrating for those wanting to get quickly in to the night time routine.

Western film selection was reasonable but very lacking in terms of TV shows etc. Staff were professional courteous and attentive although their English was very limited in my experience outside of the most straightforward questions.

All flights were on time cabin crew and service excellent meals pretty good. I really couldn't fault them. The angled lay flat seat on the 777-300 is comfy and I never fully recline it to flat - I find it much more comfortable to put it into a kind of almost lying down lazy boy chair so both ends raised slightly off flat. While I've read many poor reviews on the Business class seats in the A330-200 I have to say I found it very comfy. It definitely doesn't stack up against their long haul A380 seats or even the 777-300 but I was very comfortable with the deep recline great footrests ( so much room) and comfy leather seats.

Reviewing on behalf of my son and parents who flew from Prague to Manchester after joining us for a weekend there. They comment that the plane look old and very worn out inside the air system was very loud and the toilet door would not shut having to be repeatedly slammed throughout the flight. The plane was in fact no spring chicken at 28 years old. My parents were last aboard as there were large groups of young fit men aboard and in their 70s they can't move like they used to. This shouldn't have been an issue as they were booked on the front row. Unfortunately Jet2 seem to be of the opinion that people on the front row don't need an overhead locker. Whilst they only had two very small bags (not roll on cases) they asked the stewardess to help them find some space. At which pointed she shouted at my tiny assuming mother in law that she should have got on the plane earlier. Frankly my mother in law was astonished by this rhetoric. Someone is always going to be last on the plane does that mean they don't have a right to stow their luggage. Of course their luggage ended up miles away so getting off was difficult. As usual Jet2 ran out of sandwiches and of course as usual their flights were booked at convenient times at a premium compared to other airlines and changed to an inconvenient one with no refund. My parents have expressed a wish to return to Prague just not with Jet2.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,1,0

I have never flown Spirit so thought we would save some money but also worried that it was some type of chicken coup carrying fly by night airline and unfortunately it is.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Lee Sarah,Australia,2013-10-07,I flew from Stansted to Vasteras on 3rd October with a group (8 people 4 underage/children). Initially our bags were too large to fit through the allowance restrictions they had set so after shuffling the baggage a little they fit perfectly. The staff however showed no respect and little empathy with the situation of a mother carrying baby essentials in her purse. Of course we did not expect this to be the case but some nice treatment would have been much preferred to the screaming we endured about how the airline punctuality would be abused if we did not pay a fine. Before reshuffling the items in our bags the staff insisted that we pay the fine and requested that some of us be through to the plane. The children passed through (passport checked) and waited for the others only to have the staff lock the door on them separating them from parents simply to threaten our group that punctuality is crucial (even though we were boarding ahead of schedule). Unfortunately a handbag was taken (not disposed of but taken) and we made it to our seats. It seems that the staff of the airline are also not fond of people placing baggage in overhead compartments while safety demonstration is on as they requested to be seated and silent until takeoff. The irony in the situation! After that flight it's safe to say that Ryanair has lost 8 potential customers and maybe even more considering the other customers who had to endure the rude woman at the boarding gate.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0

Flights on time; luggage delivered promptly; cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several juice and water runs on the long-haul flights. YVR-MUC and return: A330-300 with 2+4+2 seat layout. Two proper meals served the usual chicken or stuffed pasta as the mains (and for overnight flight YVR-MUC an omelette as the second meal). The main problem with A330 and A340 aircraft generally is poor seat design in economy. Window seats leave a 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage wasting space and very uncomfortable for anyone trying to lean against the fuselage to sleep. The two outboard seats (window plus aisle) are supported by two central stanchions that rob passengers of foot space. No standard carry-on bag will fit under the seats in front and more foot space is taken up by entertainment boxes. YVR-MUC flight had these problems. However MUC-YVR return flight had a new A330 interior with far better seat design: it still left the 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage but the two supporting stanchions were at the very ends of the pair of seats leaving proper foot space and enough room that two full-sized carry-on bags could be placed under the seats in front if desired. AVOD offered a vast array of films music and television programs (even binge-watching programs like the complete first season of the US House of Cards). MUC-GVA and return: E195 with 2+2 layout with seats more comfortable than on an A330. Even a sandwiches-and-drinks service for these one-hour flights.

This is a problem with all airlines - no information when things go wrong. IFE was very good premium economy seats are very comfortable and sleeping is easy.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,M Germain,France,2014-08-15,My first and last time with Norwegian. I flew from Stockholm to NYC on July 30th and returned on August 6th. I booked with Norwegian because they offered a unique experience about the 787 and direct flights to NYC. I checked the flight status before leaving for the airport my flight was delayed more than 5 hours with a new departure of 11 pm (instead of 5.30pm). I went to the airport on time to learn that the flight was definitely delayed because of a technical issue on the plane that occurred 2 days ago. After waiting 4 hours at the airport with my luggage we were allowed to drop our luggage and check-in. I waited 1.5 hrs to drop my luggage. At the desk the receptionist discreetly ask me if I would agree to switch to another flight (because of over-booking) the following day and Norwegian would offer me 600€. However they were not able to tell me if the flight would be on time and if over-booking problems would be absorbed. I refused as I had to be in NYC the next day and he gave me a voucher for a meal. We were waiting 45 minutes without any explanations. Finally we took of at 11.45 more than 6 hours after the scheduled departure. The plane was an old and dirty EuroAtlantic plane seats were narrow plane was dirty. The EuroAtlantic crew were welcoming but it didn't change the fact that the plane was so uncomfortable. To return we were on EuroAtlantic again with limited entertainment. The flight was only delayed one hour which was a good surprise. The plane was indeed old with limited entertainment but still better than the first one as we had larger seats and individual screens. Seats were old and not in a good shape but the crew were nice and we arrived 40 minutes late in Stockholm. Overall my experience with Norwegian was not good at all.

Technical problems with plane resulted in an hour delay. Repairs were attempted while on runway and after again trying to depart plane was moved to another part of runway close to airport building. We were parked there for 6 hours. During that time absolute mayhem took place. For the first few hours there were no communication and it became clear this airline has no contingency plan and should not be flying. As business class passengers we received no support and passengers were physically prevented from leaving the plane though we were about 25 metres away from an airbridge. Half the plane without connections were put on another plane to Singapore and we were kept detained on the plane for another few hours. Eventually a Customer Service Manager appeared. We were then told it would take 3 days before we could fly due to tickets not being available. After insisting on tickets it took another hour before we were offered economy class tickets which were rejected. After another hour we were offered premium class tickets to Bangkok and then Melbourne. The flight was 2 am and we were offered a hotel room which I had to share with a stranger. I was very relieved to get on Thai Airlines from Bangkok. As for Jet Airways I will never fly with them again!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,2,3,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

flybe,/airline-reviews/flybe,Flybe customer review,R Mendoza,United States,2013-01-08,MAN-CDG-SFO via FlyBe/Air France. FlyBe's online check in system messed one of our party's booking due to this current Air France/FlyBe partnership. In fact it showed (second experience for us with this) the CDG-SFO journey as not having been checked in only the MAN-CDG (FlyBe's portion) journey as being checked in. System is therefore very inaccurate. Although one buys and flies Air France as well as checks in online using Air France's website from the States it's the reverse from the UK. Thus when doing online check in from the UK one is directed from the Air France site to the FlyBe site which does not make sense. Getting to the airport the check in agent claimed the booking was not to be found in the FlyBe system. Told we had to wait until their office opened in order to have management sort out the problem. Thankfully we arrived two hours before departure but I cannot believe that passengers are at the mercy of the office being opened to sort out any booking issues. This almost caused us to miss our flight to Paris in order to connect to San Francisco. The agent then forgot to issue the complimentary drinks voucher and we forgot to ask due to the confusion. Onboard we were refused drinks due to lack of the voucher. Best thing to do is to avoid this Air France/FlyBe partnership and fly Air France for both long haul and connecting flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

Check-in at HKT was the usual disorganized mess without appropriate lines. Agents were not polite which is unusual for Thailand. Gate boarding was the usual chaos and crowding without enforcement of the carry on rules. Flight left on time and landed on time perhaps because this was an off peak hour flight. Landing into DMK was not reassuring with unusual landing bounce and hard braking. (weather conditions excellent). The obligatory crowded bus ride to the terminal was not fun. Although I was on a full fare ticket I was grateful I did not have the preferred seats because the screaming children were seated right behind the preferred seat section. Not very thoughtful of the airline to place small kids in that zone. People pay for preferred seats to avoid the noise. I don't know why Nok provides a ""snack"" consisting of a hotdog roll and plastic cup of water. Most people seem to toss it and it is wasteful. Announcements from the flight deck were inaudible and in fractured English so it was a wasted effort. Seat comfort was fine and leg room was as good as any mainliner. My experience with Nok is that the travel experience is superior to Air Asia it's main competitor on the route and much better than Thai Smile. Nok offers a much better fare most days. Baggage delivery at DMK took approx. 30 minutes which never used to happen as the bags would often be unloading within 10-15 minutes. For a short commuter flight Nok is fine.

We did not choose to fly this airline as we had bought tickets from British Airways however due to flight delays British Airways arranged for us to fly on Alitalia for the first leg of our trip. We were told incorrect information regarding seat availability and flight details from the Alitalia representative upon check-in and boarding the plane was a largely unorganized process which took well over one hour to complete. The plane was older (tube televisions down the center of the plane instead of seat-back screens) the cleanliness of the seats was sub-par and the sink in the toilet was clogged for the duration of the trip. For the first half of the flight the service on board was mediocre but acceptable however once dinner was served the service became non-existent. For 4 to 5 hours (on a 9 hour flight) the flight attendants hung out at the back of the plane and were deliberately ignoring the call button. If any passengers wanted a drink they were required to walk to the back of the plane and pour it themselves all while the flight attendants sat around talking and completely ignoring anything outside of their conversation. This expectation of self service is very inconvenient when someone with anything but an aisle seat would like a glass of water. I also wondered what passengers who require mobility assistance do in this situation? Flight attendants ignoring their passengers for half of an international flight is completely unacceptable.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Mordey Stephen,United Kingdom,2014-09-22,I've been a Mileage Plus member and a United frequent flyer since 1995. The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer. I am confident that I will continue to be. There are some lovely people in the friendly skies!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Onboard the flight in both directions the seats in the standard section were comfortable and of course we had the free DirectTV service. You also had free access to certain SiriusXM stations as well. The service overall onboard was good giving us good complimentary drinks and snacks.

In Dallas we switched planes (again operated by American Airlines) what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover became an 8 hour layover. The legroom was non existent and when the people in front of us tilted chairs back we could hardly move for 10 hours. miserable. I will not support American Airlines to Europe or even to Dallas.

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,W Raven,Japan,2014-10-20,First and last time I will ever use Jetstar. You get what you pay for with this airline. Flew round trip from Tokyo to Fukuoka. The departure was fine nothing too major besides the language barrier. The return trip-was hell. I arrived at the airport and checked into the terminal at 1pm for a 2:30 flight. At 2 pm the notification was released that this flight and only this flight was to be postponed for 3 hours due to weather that was scheduled to arrive later that night. Why would you delay a flight so that it departs when weather turns bad vs while it's nice and sunny? I went to the ticket counter to enquire about being moved to the next available flight out and of course the next flights to my destination are on time and full. Great. So now my 2.30 departure is now a 5pm departure while all other airlines are on schedule. he attendant says I am more than welcome to book an earlier fight with a different carrier and will be refunded part of my trip - I was 'credited' 92USD not even close to half of the cost of the total trip but it was a refund. I proceed to a different carrier and walk away at the $430 one way option and sadly go back the original carrier after the prices were higher at each different carrier. I purchased the only flight to my destination for $115 - the only open and next available flight. I paid for the same seat twice. I have a seat on a plane that once again is delayed.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,Simon Jones,United Kingdom,2015-07-22,"Flight out (Manchester to Heraklion) was fine, pleasant staff and straight forward. We checked bags and carried hand luggage. Cramped and uncomfortable seating, along with expensive food on board, this unfortunately becoming the norm for this level of airline, so no surprises. Returning (Heraklion to Manchester) however ended with further expense just prior to boarding. We checked the same bag for the hold as before no problem and carried the same bags, but afterwards we received very disorganised information from the easyJet staff at this airport. Waiting to board the plane at the gate we were singled out in the line by an particular easyJet staff member and to some extent made an example off. The issue initially involved my fiancée carrying an over the shoulder purse as this is apparently one extra piece of hand luggage. I myself had a cabin bag that has an additional over shoulder bag that attaches via a zip. Whilst both bags joined wouldn't fit in the individual persons size limit, the detachable bag is very small and although crammed full fits easily under the seat (as it did on the previous flight no problem). So detached now we had one bag, a small over the shoulder bag and my fiancée's purse. Both these two smaller items fitted together in the airlines cabin size limit (plus there was more than enough room left for a person to stand next to them). However this particular easyJet member of staff loudly and publicly stated that we had one too may cabin bags. We tried cramming the smaller purse into the other only to have the complaint that the zips were not fully closed. Stressed and feeling victimised at this point with a particularly unfriendly and inflexible staff member, along with feeling singled out, especially as a number of the other customers now going through the gate for boarding next to us carried multiple duty free bags each far larger than our additional 'bag', we were forced to concede to have the cabin bag placed in the aircraft hold to an additional €55 fee. Great end to a holiday. easyJet for us is not particularly good value for money when you consider the hidden charges (charged to check in online also now I recall), inflexibility and lack of customer service (for at least one particular member of staff). Uncomfortable, no entertainment, limited and lastly not that particular inexpensive flight.

No time to do anything then before we went to the gate. Boarding was announced and then one of the two staff disappeared so we waited for 10 minutes for him to come back.

The flight process was very easy and laid out and I did not experience any severe trouble with the flight staff.

I consider myself lucky to only have that one hiccup. The pilot also sped up the flight and we only ended up being 30 minutes behind schedule.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Scott Williams,Australia,2013-09-11,Id originally booked my SYD-LHR flight with Virgin Atlantic. The day before my flight I was informed that the incoming flight to HKG from LHR had been sent back to LHR due to engine problems. I was then rebooked on Qantas SYD to HKG then Cathay Pacific HKG to LHR. I was upgraded to Business on the SYD-HKG leg then had a 6 hour lay over in HKG. All attempts to get the window seat I had requested met with apologies as the flight was full. I am used to a little more room given the fact that I am spending the extra dollars on the Premium Economy cabin. The configuration was 2-4-2. I was stuck in the middle and as soon as the meal service had ended and the trays collected the whole row in front of my row reclined their seats making it impossible to get out of the seat without disturbing my neighbour. Which meant that for the entire 12 hour flight from HKG to LHR I was only able to get up once during the flight to go to the toilet. It would make more sense to remove an entire row and space the cabin accordingly. I can't imagine how bad the Economy section was. I will never travel Cathay Pacific again.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,2,1,3,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

ANA Lounge had good food and drink but it's a windowless set of rooms - too bad you can't see the tarmac. Showers were excellent as I was connecting from an overnight flight from Bangkok so it was refreshing. Boarding was on-time with the friendly bow from the gate agents. Welcomed on-board and attended to by a multitude of gracious attendants. Departed on time for 11 hour flight. Meals were good but menu confusing as it had listed 4 meals yet only 2 were served. Went with a mix of western and Japanese meal options and both were tasty - steak cooked well and pork noodles delicious. Small mattress and nice blanket provided for sleep - but the cabin temperature was insanely high. Both myself and my travel companion were sweating trying to sleep. That was the only complaint from this flight and would deter me from using ANA in the future. Seems like many Asian airlines are now keeping the heat on compared to airlines in the Americas.

air-transat,/airline-reviews/air-transat,Air Transat customer review,S Williams,Canada,2013-10-22,I flew one way from London Gatwick to Toronto in October 2013. The reason for choosing Air Transat was simply cost - other airlines are not interested in selling one-way fares. Only Air Transat and Icelandair offer reasonable prices for one-way trips and only Air Transat is non-stop. Both Air Canada and British Airways wanted about $1900 from London Heathrow to Toronto whereas Air Transat (from Gatwick) was under $500. The check-in agent at Gatwick was rude but she was the only employee I could possibly say anything negative about and since all other staff went out of their way to be positive I will just ignore this one bad apple. The flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful as were the people at the gate. The flight left and arrived on time to the minute. Food was - well let's just say no worse than any other airline. I think the legroom was a bit better than some others. My luggage was on the carousel by the time I got through immigration. There truly is nothing to complain about. The particular plane that I was on did not have seat-back video but instead had the older style screens with their choice of movies. I brought a book to read so did not really even watch this. Really with all the negative experiences I have become accustomed to when flying I must say that this flight (my first flight with Air Transat) was a rare positive.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

On the 16 hour flight between Los Angeles and Tel Aviv El Al kept the cabin lights dim and enforced all window shades shut for 14 hours.

The seats on the A380 are completely lie flat and very comfortable for sleeping if not a bit hard. The A380 is also extremely quiet.

Flight was with Jet Airways at 2.30am took off on time and light snack served. Cabin light dimmed until 2 hours before landing however flight attendants brought regular drinks through the cabin. Breakfast was fine as was entertainment. Flight attendants were professional but not overly friendly. Boarding for flight to Dublin was chaotic to say the least. Only one person dealing with approx 300 passengers until eventually 3 more arrived. Suddenly we had 4 chiefs and no one willing to do the basics of checking people through. Words cannot describe the inefficiency of what was happening. This meant after a bus ride to plane we were an hour late taking off. Welcomed on board by name by the flight attendant at top of steps. This set the tone for the flight with smiling attendants who were very obliging to every request. Food was fine and again regular drinks brought through cabin.

Their friendly and jovial attitude as well as the flexible dining options are something to be commended. I have bad memories of the old CX herringbone layout who based it on Virgin's but in the a340-600 at least the cabin was light and airy and the walls of your cubicle are not as high. The lounge in HK is great but the clubhouse in Heathrow is fantastic. It appears as if every member of staff from check-in to cabin like their job and are happy to do it.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,Lewis Deitch,United States,2014-09-14,I have been an Air Canada Aeroplan member for over 30 years and I do a lot of overseas traveling from my home base in Phoenix Arizona. Fortunately Air Canada has connected Phoenix with Toronto since the mid 1990's making overseas connections quite easy. In winter there is additional service to Calgary which enables flight connections to London and Frankfurt. Recently Phoenix service was converted to the new Air Canada Rouge budget category. All I kept reading were negative reviews about how cramped the business class was and how poor the food and service were. I traveled to Toronto on July 1 to connect to Frankfurt and returned from Toronto (Copenhagen) on August 30. Frankly I found nothing wrong with Air Canada Rouge. Yes the seats are smaller coach seats with the middle seat blocked out. But there was almost as much legroom as on a regular Air Canada domestic flight. As for lunch en route to Toronto and Breakfast returning to Phoenix the food quality was comparable to a regular domestic Air Canada flight. And the young flight attendants though not clearly as experienced were very attentive. I would prefer a return of regular Air Canada service but I did find Rouge an acceptable choice and with Calgary now being a year around connection and the addition of Vancouver I am very pleased. These are short flights and the added comfort of domestic first class would be nice but I for one can live without it.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,3,5,5,2,NA,NA,4,1

The day that the fire broke out at Rome airport. We had a 12.45pm flight. I received a text from BA at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact BA. I called them and they rebooked us on flight BA555 at 8.15pm but direct to Heathrow. We accepted the flight change considering and lounged around Rome for the morning. Than when about to get the train to Rome airport received a text from BA advise that flight had been changed to Naples and if we wanted that flight to make our way to Naples. So we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in Naples. The flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to Naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to Naples. I think the communication and the effect that BA did to get us out of Rome under the circumstances was excellent. A friend was flying to Paris from Rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was not to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. Once on board in Euro Business class it was all pamper. The meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and BBQ style prawns. Finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely Spanish white. Once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went.

Out of Amsterdam it was very good. The sole was one of the best meals I have had on an aircraft in years. My only negative is the departure gate in Schiphol. Security is cleared at the gate. This meant the flight was called an hour and a half before departure. All the passengers were squeezed sardine lik in the tiny waiting area. There was not enough seating.

There's very little that's friendly about United they have become an airline of lesser quality than the budget airlines of the world. Connecting business class flight from Auckland to San Francisco via LA. The first leg was non-stop on Air New Zealand which was excellent and connected in LA to a business class flight to SFO. When we presented our ticket at the United lounge in LA we were refused entry because it was a business class ""domestic"" flight but were offered entry as a guest of another person we had met on our flight from NZ. Sadly the lounge was a worn out mess nothing more than crackers and cheese slices in packets Internet access that was just a bit faster than the old dial up connections - nothing like any of the lounges offered by carriers we had flown elsewhere in the world. On the tired worn plane a minimal offer of chips or cookies and beverages. The worst part is that the personnel seemed tired of being caught between management decisions that have reduced the quality of service to nothing more than a poor commodity and travelers that resent the carrier.",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,2,2,1,2,NA,NA,1,0

I was somewhat surprised having expected less although I had selected a fully-refundable fare option and then was put through a special ""fast"" security clearance line for such passengers. There was a problem with unloading of bags in Nice but this was not an airline issue but rather an airport one. Nice is busy and not a terribly efficient or customer-friendly airport at all.

However the seats were comfortable and leg room acceptable. The complimentary light meal coffee and juice were tasty and appreciated. The cabin crew's English was quite good - some of the crew were young and friendly while there were a couple of more experienced and more gruff senior crew who shouted orders. All PAs are given in Spanish first then English. It was very hard to understand the English notices as the English spoken was heavily accented. There are no personal TVs and on this three hour sector no movies were shown - just the route map on the main screens. Their service is significantly lower quality than their main competitor LAN but they are also significantly cheaper.

We booked a return flight from LHR-AGA. Our outbound flight was delayed by 4 hrs so we missed our connecting flight from CMN-AGA. It took more than 14 hrs it should have been less than 8 hrs. Our flight home was horrendous. We managed to get a flight from AGA-CMN but as we hurried to get our flight to LHR we were refused boarding even though we had valid boarding passes and tickets. The rude check-in staff told us that there was a problem with our tickets and to speak to our booking agent. It turns out our tickets were cancelled without our permission. We were stranded at the boarding gate. The only reason I could think of was that the airline had double booked their seats because there was a large crowd of passengers before us and 2 more passengers also had their tickets cancelled and were in the same situation as us. The check-in assistant did not help us and sent us from pillar to post asking us to speak to the customer team downstairs when our flight was about to depart. We enquired about getting our luggage back and we were told that it was being offloaded. However our luggage was not offloaded and it flew to LHR. We were told that the next plane to LHR would be in 24 hours. We protested (with 2 other passengers) eventually a person at the airport gave us tickets to LGW (not LHR) which would be a 10 hr trip on 2 planes going via Tunisia. We were not given any food or drink for the inconvenience caused. We arrived at LGW at 1am in the morning without our luggage. We should have been in LHR by 6pm. We had to pay a mighty fare to get from LGW to home we didn't get our luggage for another 3 days.

Too much air conditioning but no blanket offered for night time flight. The most offensive service was the fact they put garbage magazines such as People or Star in the front pocket.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,Nigel Rankin,United Kingdom,2013-05-01,I have been flying with Air New Zealand since 2007 primarily Premier Economy or Business. The tickets are corporate and were not bought by me. The routes flown have been both via Hong Kong and Los Angeles. Had I been given the choice I would not have flown with this airline. In general the cabin staff have been friendly and efficient but inconsistent in their service delivery. Some teams have decided to deliver the bistro experience; others have gone along with the norm. On one occasion I witnessed one of the flight deck crew talking to a passenger who was concerned about something on the aircraft. Instead of reassuring the passenger he began shouting and threatened to call security to lift the passenger from the flight. Instead of defusing the situation he drew attention to the situation causing the passenger and his family to be acutely embarrassed. Joining their loyalty scheme through Star Alliance is pointless as the Air NZ routes have become limited as they no longer go via Honk Kong. In addition although I qualified as a Gold Member this was not updated on their system and I couldn’t use their lounges or associated benefits. However the card had been issued and was at home waiting for me. A colleague has had similar experiences and written to Air NZ to complain. More than a month late he still has had the courtesy of a reply. You could put all this down to the Kiwi independence and a refusal to be subservient. However they are in the service industry and if they can’t handle it then they shouldn’t have joined. If you do travel with them you’re unlikely to suffer unduly and you shouldn’t let these things colour you impression of New Zealand.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,3,4,2,NA,NA,2,0

In Bali similar everyone milling around on tarmac unsupervised with small children everywhere no footpath signage trucks moving around whilst we all waiting for bus to plane. No inflight entertainment. I didn't mind but the number of kids on board could have really used it. No online check-in available so couldn't choose seats return flight meant crammed down back amongst the screaming children on a night flight amongst the long queue of people trying to use the bathrooms Crowded flight - small plane with only one central aisle not enough staff. Drinks service took over 2 hours in the aisle. Over 2 hours to get a water. Seats barely reclined and no footrests. Small food a veg pasta was drowned in thick creamy sauce. A veg curry was very tasteless. The last security check at Bali meant that a bottle of water could not be purchased in the airport as no shops past last security so the really long waits to get a (small) cup of water made the flight even more uncomfortable.

Naturally being an airline of it's type anything you want onboard bar the toilet is chargable. Not a problem as what's on offer is priced reasonably the selection being good and if it's hot food you're purchasing it comes to you hot not lukewarm. Cabin crew seem to be far more visible during the flight than on some airlines which is undoubtedly a positive. Whilst no one expects them trolling the aisles for the who flight it is great to see them other than during cabin preparation and service times. Definitely an airline I'd have no hesitation in recommending. Comfortable on time flight priced competitively clean and comfortable cabin.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Slany Gertrude,Australia,2015-01-19,Whilst I noticed the narrower seating (Being 777) on my way to London (Emirates) I was lucky then to have a corner seat right in the area which is usually reserved for parents with small children. But yesterday I arrived back in Perth from Dubai on an 11-hour flight on the same Boeing 777-300ER and my coccyx and lower back are still aching from the narrow seating. I can only say I am going to carefully consider my next flight maybe even save up for 2nd class. Cattle class is just that I am not obese but have wide hips and shoulders and I am above average height. The seats on the Boeing 777-300ER were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the remainder of my particular flight ( Dubai London) legroom is less and the back can only be minimally adjusted. Sleep is impossible. Service was very average crew seemed to be permanently engaged in jockeying their unwieldy carts in that narrower passage-ways food options ran out quickly. The entertainment options do not make up for the unpleasantness of the entire experience. Of course comfort is supplied to the higher-paying customers. I really do resent this!

Flight was a little late leaving Moscow and arriving in Abu Dhabi which made the transit a little stressful as it was not clear that I and my luggage would make the second flight. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive but no one spoke Russian on the Moscow - Abu Dhabi sector. Food and wine were good but the service a little slow especially on the Abu Dhabi sector where I was trying to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Both planes were good and clean and with seats being fully flat beds were restful and spacious. The IFE was good on both planes and we were permitted to use the IFE until we had landed. The airport in Abu Dhabi was undergoing extension/renovation and a bus was used to transport passengers to the terminal. The lateness in arrival meant that the plane was about to board so it was not possible to eat in the lounge and then only sleep on the second flight.

I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers.

Then on the way back we checked in one bag and yes they lost that one too. For our boarding on the way back they called for general boarding and everyone hoarded around the door in one big general mass. So then they decided to let families on board first - it was chaos because everyone was already jammed together. People were trying to squeeze through babies being squashed children crying. One couple complained profusely that it doesn't make any sense to call for general boarding and then limit it to only families.

While this was our first experience with Rouge having had tremendous negative feedback about the very limited leg room my husband and I decided to upgrade to preferred seating before we left on our trip. The preferred seating was better than the regular seating for sure. However while we paid $160 extra to upgrade our seats our boarding zone did not change. This meant that we boarded the aircraft last because our reservation was booked using points. When we actually did board the aircraft the overhead bins near our row were all full. It seems reasonable to me that when a person upgrades to preferred seating at an additional cost they should board right after business class passengers and before regular seating. Until Air Canada discontinues the practice of having passengers pay for their one checked bag onboard storage space will continue to be a huge problem. When I paid extra to have preferred seating I would have expected preferred service!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,3,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

blue-air,/airline-reviews/blue-air,Blue Air customer review,B Seadhach,Ireland,2012-06-17,DUB-BCM return in June 2012. Flying with Blue Air produced very different experiences going out and coming back. At Dublin they were very inefficient. They had one staff member on check-in for a full 737 so it took ages. When I eventually reached the check-in desk the staff member told me the flight was delayed by half an hour. Fair enough I said and I texted my girlfriend in Romania who was to pick me up from the airport in Bacau. It didn't stop there however. When the staff eventually arrived at the boarding gate half an hour late they informed us that the gate had changed causing yet another delay. When we finally got on the plane it literally sat there for another half an hour and we left Dublin a total of one hour and forty minutes late. Now this would be slightly understandable at a peak time like three in the afternoon. However this was at one in the morning. There were no other flights to cause congestion! The flight itself was fine and smooth but there were so many screaming children that getting any sleep was impossible. Legroom was better than Ryanair but that isn't saying much. Coming back was much better in relation to time. We left Bacau on time and even arrived in Dublin ten minutes early so I was happy about that. Screaming children was a problem again (another night flight) but it was cheap so I guess I can't be too upset. As for food and beverages there were none for free just a ridiculously overpriced menu. Unless it proves unavoidable I probably won't fly Blue Air in the future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Second time to fly business class on Emirates after many years flying mostly economy. Service was outstanding from chauffeur pick-up through check-in and most importantly onboard everything went smoothly and everyone was extremely professional and helpful. Drinks and food were plentiful and well presented and when I was unable to get one preferred meal option the cabin crew were very apologetic even expressing their apologies again as I disembarked. It was hardly their fault but I appreciated that they felt it could be important to a passenger. Seats were amazing and i recommend the mattress to add that little extra comfort throughout the flight. ICE was great but on first leg the B777 felt slightly older and the control panel less responsive than on the DBX-NCL leg. Cabin crew couldn't have been more helpful and polite. I've flown economy 15+ times with Emirates and have never had any complaints about their quality or service but it was worth paying the extra to be in business class for two long flights and be pampered. DBX business lounge in Terminal 3 is a little too basic but I won't complain about the snacks or drinks available. Logged on to complimentary wifi easily.

Managed to get online check in completed 23 hours before the flight and got seats 1A and 1K. Because we were transiting through Bangkok and onto Hanoi we had to get our boarding passes at LHR as our visas had to be checked. Arrived at the Royal First class desk where we were processed in an efficient and friendly manner. When flying Thai Airways Royal First Class you are told that you can use the SAS London Lounge which is the general Star Alliance lounge in T3. In fact you are also able to use the Singapore Airlines First Class lounge which if you time it right with their flights is actually a much nicer lounge and much quieter. There are no announcements in the lounge so you have to be a bit vigilant with the time for boarding especially if your gate is a walk away. Arrived at the gate just as boarding had started and after a short wait first and business class passengers were ushered down a separate boarding way into door 1L. Within a matter of minutes the cabin service director came and welcomed us on board he came round with a tray of glasses and a bottle of champagne in hand. The ambience of the new first class cabin is noticeable with its hues of cream purple and wood. The mini suites (without doors) are spacious the seats wide and comfortable and comes with plenty of storage space to the side under the windows and under the ottoman. To the front sits the massive 23"" screen with the ubiquitous Thai orchid in pride of place and on the aisle side is a small closet with hanging space. To the window side of the seat starting at the front is the magazine rack storage for the headphones and a multi pin power socket then the large and heavy wooden table which lifts out of the housing followed by a small touch screen which controls the seat positions and then a further storage area where the entertainment handset 2 x USB ports and a further cubby hole can be found. For couples travelling together seats 1A and 1K are definitely the ones to go for if you want a window view otherwise seats 3E and 3F which are two seated together in the middle at the rear of the cabin. If you are travelling alone any of the other widow seats or 2E will be suitable. There was very little communication from the flight deck throughout the flight but it kept the flight quiet and peaceful. The food service was exceptional and started almost immediately. First came the drinks service and warm nuts. Drinks service was followed by canapés. Once this was finished the table was laid and service began. We had pre-ordered the Lobster Thermidor online and it did not disappoint. Once I had finished watching a film I asked the crew to make up my bed and by the time I returned to my seat my bed was made. I slept for about 4-5 hours before the lights were switched on for the breakfast service. Before we started to make our descent into Bangkok the first class crew came round to each individual passenger to thank them for flying with Thai and handed out an orchid a lovely touch. This particular crew were friendly chatty and attentive without being annoying. The food and drink service was exceptional and the pre-ordered dish was very good. The new cabin is comfortable airy and the mini suites cocoon you from your fellow passengers; I like the relaxed feel of the cabin with only 9 seats compared to British Airways first cabin of 14.",NA,NA,First Class,NA,10,5,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

The first class product is very poor seats uncomfortable and felt like sitting on a metal rod. Cabin service was pathetic with a poor choice of drinks and food. And most shocking is Air India has stopped giving toiletry bags. If you are going to fork out the money do it on Qatar or British Airways.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,2,1,3,2,3,NA,NA,1,0

We were lucky enough to snag seats 32 J&K which are a pair of bulkhead seats in the economy section on the upper deck. It was a peaceful oasis at the back of the plane. Seats were comfortable and we had plenty of legroom due to the bulkhead. Storage bin in the side was excellent for storing handbags coats etc for easy access. Service from staff was excellent. Very friendly and efficient. Food was surprisingly very good. Drinks and fruit/snacks were offered regularly throughout the flight. I hope we are able to snag these seats again next time we fly.

Five flights leaving PIE on the 3rd of Jan all delayed at least an hour. Five flights of people in a four gate terminal. There weren't enough seats the snack bar ran out of food and TSA was a joke.

May not be up to true business class but close and at the price you cannot complain. Only problem with LAS is Virgin Atlantic out of LGW. Depending on slots and delays (appear endemic on VA) Maxjet can arrive just behind a 747 full of passengers so immigration can be a nightmare. First time in many visits to US I've found immigration agent with personality and at pains to apologise for the delays due to VA!

oman-air,/airline-reviews/oman-air,Oman Air customer review,C Leigh,United Kingdom,2015-07-19,"This was the first time since 2013 I'd used Oman Air and I would echo what some other reviews have said in that their onboard quality has begun to deteriorate and is showing signs of budget cuts. As always though the ground staff are excellent in London and Bangkok, check in staff are always friendly, welcoming and good to have a small conversation with. I used their online check in which is vastly improved since 2013 but at check in whilst chatting to staff I was moved to exit row seats due to my height which was very nice of them. On board the seat layout is still welcome as the extra space compared to competitors is felt after a few hours in the air. Even the exit row seats feel spacious in width with the wider fixed armrests. The little extras like menus, hot towels, and amenity kits no longer exist. Not major losses but noticeable. Meal portion sizes seem reduced too but the food quality and taste still seems better than competitors. On board staff are polite and professional, not quite as cheery or conversational as some other airlines but certainly everything you need on board. Muscat airport is starting to feel the weight of increased passenger numbers, I still like this old quiet airport but it felt very full this time and the transfer via bus to and from the terminal building is tiresome. There were problems with processing all the boarding passes for my flight and everyone was issued a new one with a new seat which made for an hour long queue to enter the boarding gate and a bit of a hectic mess on board with people wanting to move. For the price during summer and winter I think Oman Air is very hard to beat on this route.

The inflight experience was great however it was a different story at the airport. Alaska Air is located in concourse E (or Central Terminal) at Miami Airport. The ticket counter area is small and a very inconvenient part of the airport. Unless you arrive very early for check in the line will stretch to where it will block the entrance to a food court behind the counter the exit path of Concourse E the entrance to a TSA check point and the exit of Customs located just below them. The flight departs from Concourse F and the upside to the airport is that there are only about a handful of flights departing from F that morning so TSA checkpoint a breeze. Boarding process was poor there were no pre boarding announcements and passengers just saw other's making the line to board and assumed it was time to board no matter what row they were in. The cabin crew was attentive and cheerful there was actually space in the overhead bins. The seats were comfortable however seat pitch was terrible! Alaska offers Gogo inflight internet and they rent DigEplayers which come with movies/games etc. The flight was 6 hours 24 mins - I had no idea a 737-800 had such a long range. The meals they served (or sold) onboard were fair at a reasonable price. We had the option for a hot or cold meal. Given the long length of the flight the crew did go around the cabin about 3 times for beverage service.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,R Allison,United Kingdom,2014-08-14,I have travelled quite often with Norwegian Air during the past. I have always been satisfied with their service until I travelled on flight DY1633 from Vienna to Oslo on 25 July 2014 when “the walls fell in”. The incoming flight from Oslo was about 3 hours late in arriving in Vienna. The waiting passengers were not aware of the reason for the planes delay in arriving. Shortly after the planes arrival in Vienna 5 or 6 Austrian police appeared and started taking 4 or 5 of the awaiting passengers out for further interrogation. No explanation was given by a member of the ground staff as to the reason for the 3 hour delay in arriving at Vienna which was apparently due to the connecting flight from Bodø to Oslo being delayed 3 hours because of fog. When we got on board at about 00.30 an explanation was given by the Captain as to the delay. Drinks were available on the flight but had to be paid for instead of being offered free of charge after such a long delay. The flight eventually arrived at Oslo Airport at about 03.00 over 3 hours late! As I had 2 tickets for the Airport Train to Sandvika I asked one of the flight attendants how I could get to Sandvika as no trains were available at that late hour. I was given a short rude reply to contact Norwegian Air’s Service company at Oslo Airport. I eventually did and the service company rudely told me to take a waiting bus to Oslo Centre and a taxi on to Sandvika and make a claim to Norwegian Air afterwards. Lack of information and rude flight attendants with in my opinion little experience has made me think twice about travelling with Norwegian Air again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,4,1,2,0,NA,NA,2,0

We had pre-printed our boarding passes and paid for our additional checked luggage. We simply need to check the luggage at the counter. Our party of five - along with several others were redirected out of the line to some type of ""domestic"" holding area as they attended to an international flight. About a half hour into our wait the redirection stopped. However those of us in the holding area were left to stand there for another half an hour without further direction. There must have been twenty travelers that arrived well after we did that found their way in front of us in a very long line. My son- in-law took matters into his own hands as it was obvious that the Frontier service reps had no intention of returning for us. Had it not been for his negotiating with the people in line we all might still be sitting there. Upon arrival at our destination we sat at the gate for a half an hour before de-boarding.

This service is apparently unavailable when you have a connecting flight in Los Angeles (LAX to FRA) and come from the Big Island of Hawaii - Kona Airport for that matter - meaning that our 4 tickets were scattered all over the plane. Luckily this problem could easily be solved by a friendly member of the Lufthansa ground staff in LA. The flight from LA to Frankfurt was okay overall seats on the 747-8I are not the most uncomfortable though a little too lightly padded. Dinner and Breakfast were offered - both were quite good. The inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies in various languages (sadly variety was not that great) the flight attendant were generally nice.

We were taken back to the terminal again and told the flight was cancelled. We were then put on a later flight to Kalibo even though we had paid to fly to Caticlan - this was to leave at 5pm. This flight was then delayed 30 then 60 then 90 minutes finally leaving at 8.45pm. This got us to Kalibo at around 10pm and we then had to get a coach for 2 hours to get us to where we should have been at 1pm.

The night before we flew back we got an email to say our flight was cancelled and we were to call them to rebook or get a refund. We rang and could not get through to anyone. As a result we had to book a Philippines airline flight at our expense to ensure we got back to Manila for our connecting flight home a total disaster. Trying to get a refund from them for the cancelled flight took over 30 minutes on the phone and it will then be 10 business days until the refund is even processed.

I also spoke to other passengers and they had delays of up to 10hrs with the same level of service.

Once onboard we were told that the trolley with hot paninis drinks etc would shortly be coming through the aircraft. Perhaps one quarter to one third of passengers at the front of the plane were served hot paninis the only hot or substantial food offered. Minutes later it was announced with apologies that the paninis were finished and that the only food available were muffins and pringles. This flight over lunchtime and lasting just over 3 hrs had run out of hot snacks - absolutely hopeless. The amount of legroom and the 2 seats rather than the usual 3 seats together was greatly appreciated and the efficiency and cheerfulness of the cabin staff was excellent. Same on the return one week later cabin crew were wonderful but could only offer apologies for not accepting Euros. We had no sterling so had to do without for the 3 hr trip - the stewardess gave my husband and me a small bottle of water each and 2 small packets of biscuits out of her own allowance.

Left with a small space for the 4-hour flight. This is bad enough but at no time during pre-landing checks was the passenger asked to move his seat forward. There were four passes of cabin staff that failed to spot this. Also the arm rest was broken on the outside seat so it would have been almost impossible to make a quick exit.

From the outset (booking your tickets) the experience was horrendous with each separate step being asked if we wish to purchase an add on. And the number of times where we were reminded that carry on luggage that breached the weight limits (which apparently have recently been reduced) would be severely penalised and baggage placed in the hold. On our flight to Hobart passengers were called to board the aircraft then spent 20 minutes in a holding pen waiting to board. The flight left 20 minutes late. On our return journey from Hobart we arrived at the recommended 60 minutes before departure time to be told that the plane had been delayed and would be an hour late arriving which eventuality extended to two hours late arriving and departing.

When we boarded we waited another half hour to take off due to computer issues. We ended up missing our connecting flight to our home city. It took the customer service reps two hours to give us our stand by tickets and food vouchers. They also were unsure about how the hotel voucher worked.

us-airways,/airline-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,C Maher,United States,2014-09-17,"On our last US Airways trip the return from Athens was a complete disaster. I verified my seats and flights twice in the week before I left home. I brought a printed copy of the itinerary from their website. At the airport I was told that ""you don't have seats on the first leg of your journey from Athens to Zurich (Swiss Air). I see your reservation but for some reason US Airways cancelled your seats on that portion of the trip. The flight is full you don't have seats call them. Step aside."" I did call US Airways - on hold for long stretches while their personnel verified that it was the next day in Athens vs. where the customer service is located in the U.S. and while they tried to put me on a flight now leaving in 1/2 hour. We ran to the Lufthansa check-in as instructed - after repeated attempts to get tickets we were told by Lufthansa that they could see the reservation but US Airways hadn't completed the task and we couldn't get on board. I called US Airways again in front of the Lufthansa check-in (more time on hold despite explaining that we had less than 1/2 hour to get tickets clear security and get to the gate). They verified that the last agent had not completed our reservation in Lufthansa's system. They now instructed us to go to Swiss Air and get the same tickets since they were codeshare partners on the Lufthansa flight. While explaining that Swiss Air was where we started and on the other side of the airport the announcement closing that flight was made. US Airways then stated they could do nothing until the next day's flight to get us out. I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor reiterated that nothing from Athens was available until the next day. I told her that I could see online that several flights were available to European gateway cities that morning but was told that US Airways couldn't put me on those flights. She was more helpful when I offered to get us to any European gateway on my dime but then told me that all the flights from London Paris Rome Amsterdam Munich etc. were full. My wife tried again and did reach someone that routed us to Paris and home on Air France. Air France was a welcome change and they actually worked to correct more US Airways problems created during re-booking us. I always thought the day would come where US Airways would turn the corner and become a great airline (and I've waited a long time) but I've officially lost interest in being around to see it.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,3,3,NA,NA,1,0

We bought tickets from their website and purchased preferred seats for an extra hundred dollars only to end up sitting in completely different sections of the plane. Our advance purchase had not been logged into their booking system. Our problem isn't that we couldn't sit next to each other but the way in which we were treated by the Singapore Airlines staff. One particular male check in staff blatantly displayed annoyance at us and showed no signs that he was willing to rectify the issue. We gave in and just decided to sit in whatever was assigned to us and after a promise of a refund for the preferred seating we were dismissively waved off. Started off badly on the ground and continued in the air when we were bypassed during meal service and one rude staff wasn't interested when we questioned her.

The service on this flight was good after the food service there was plenty of drinks runs and the cabin crew were happy to oblige when you went to galley for more.

The first leg was on July 1st 2015, starting from Orly Paris to Prague on 9.55am flight, arriving Rome at 12.00pm with a connection to Prague at 1.00pm. We arrived at the Airport 2 hours ahead of the flight time to find extremely long lines. Vueling process all flights thru a single line. We made it thru the line 7 minutes ahead of the departure time. As they checked our luggage and processed our boarding passes they advised us that there was no flight that day to Fiumicino airport where we have our connecting flight, but that it was diverted to Ciampino. Told we can pick up our luggage there and connect to our flight to Prague. The flight left 30 minutes late, arriving in Ciampino at 12.30. Transportation between the two airports is a bus that leaves every 15 minutes after the hour and the travel time is about 30 minutes. It was impossible to make the connection. Since the flight was scheduled to Flumicino our bags were labeled to that airport. We tried to pick up the luggage at Ciampino to find only one bag delivered and the other one lost. We took a taxi to Fiumicino hoping there may be a later flight to Prague, to find out Vueling has only the 1pm flight. We had to wait in a line for four hours to talk to a rude agent, that advised us that they would put us in a hotel and provide transportation to and from the hotel. We headed to the airport the next morning at 9am to catch 1pm flight. After 30 minutes in line we were advised that the flight was delayed to 4.30. Since I had the time at the airport, I went to Vueling lost and found, and fortunately I located the bag. While waiting for 4.30 departure, Vueling announced that the flight time was changed to 2.30 pm! We hurried to the gate to catch the 2nd bus transporting passengers to the plane. We waited in the bus for half an hour before they told us that the flight time had been delayed again to 5.40pm. The second boarding at 5.10 was manual since all the electronic boarding passes were collected the first time.

In fact Speedy Boarding now seems pointless since you need to get to the gate amongst the earliest passengers or so they told me at the gate last night. Seems to me that EasyJet should now copy best practice by proper airlines and board by seat number on busier flights.

Flight should have taken 5 hrs - took over 17 hrs. Firstly 2 hour delay in Amman due to fog - no explanation given until we were in the air and no drinks given. We tried to land in Amsterdam at midday but due to high winds we diverted to Hamburg. In Hamburg we were not allowed to leave the plane or get any food or drink. Eventually got off the plane - immigration were unaware of who we were and a further delay was caused here. Before we left the plane the crew told all passengers that a representative from the airline would meet us in Hamburg - nobody met us and nobody knew where to go. We were told food and drink would be available for the passengers - this did not happen and each passenger had to pay for their own food and drink.

After looking at past reviews I was concerned that I had made a mistake. I'm pleasantly surprised to have been mistaken. The majority of the complaints I have seen are related to spirits pricing. I was well aware that I was purchasing a ""bare fare"" and exactly what this meant. For me it's not worth the additional fare charged by other airlines to have a ""complimentary"" snack and drink. I don't always require a larger carry-on so their fee for carry-on bags is no problem for me. I appreciate having the option to decide on a per/trip basis exactly what I wish to pay for. The remainder of the complaints appear to be regarding delays etc. I don't think these types of issues are unique to Spirit as I have experienced similar hassles on other airlines which charge higher fares. My flight out of Dallas was delayed (due to weather) and I received an email notifying me of the delay! No full-price airline has ever done this. This was a nice surprise. They also sent an email to my son who was picking me up as I had sent my itinerary to him from their site. Very helpful. The flight back was perfectly on time. The flight was great staff on both trips were courteous and as for space it did not feel any more cramped than other airlines. It's true the seats do not ""recline"" if that's what you call the meagre movement the other airlines provide. The bottom line for me is Spirit provided me with affordable transportation from point A to point B without the so-called frills. I would definitely consider flying Spirit again.",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,3,4,1,1,NA,NA,5,1
qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,W Woon,Singapore,2015-06-07,"4 flight sectors altogether: SIN-DOH-LHR on 5 May CDG-DOH-SIN on 21/22 May. SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

Both flights were on-time and comfortable. The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,Matt Camp,United Kingdom,2014-10-05,We booked with Thomson in the Premium cabin hoping we would be on the new Dreamliner aircraft unfortunately this was not the case and we were on one of the 767 aircraft. What I didn't realize until on the day was that they are still using old First Choice 767 aircraft and when I say old I mean the Aircraft looks like it hasn't had an update since it rolled off the production line nearly 20 years ago. How they can call what that 767 offers as a premium cabin and charge a premium charge for it is beyond me. Looking at the economy cabin I struggled to see what the difference was minus free drinks and an amenity kit was this worth the substantial increase in cost over the economy cabin I fear not. The whole aircraft was incredibly dated dirty and rattled like an old bus this wasn't what I was expecting flying with a company such as Thomson. I understand they are in the process of updating their fleet with the new sought after 787 Dreamliner aircraft but I really can't understand how they can charge such an amount of money to fly in the Premium cabin of the 767's. Our seats looked like they came out of a 30 year old Jaguar and had such little padding in them that we had to buy a large pillow for our buttocks for the journey back. The meals served were awful I don't exactly expect fresh gourmet food on an aircraft but from all the literature I was certainly expecting better than what we were served with. That brings me on to the entertainment on board or lack of shall I say yes they have got individual monitors in the backs of the seats with a control but the quality of the screen was awful. Scratches and marks everywhere and the picture quality of a 90's TV set which I suppose ties in with the rest of the dated aircraft. The entertainment on board was also woeful I haven't seen such a lack of entertainment since we only had 4 terrestrial TV channels. We must have been spoiled going on Virgin Airways expecting quality entertainment with brand new films on board not titles from 5 years ago. I fear that it is not only the aircraft that has let down the Thomson name but also the service despite being in the Premium cabin we were consistently served last for all meals and drink rounds despite expecting a dedicated staff and the galley being just in front of the Premium cabin. Again not like we missed out on much from the quality of the food but we expect to at least be served first after paying the premium cost. Although there was priority boarding there certainly was not priority exiting of the aircraft. Overall we are severely unimpressed with our experience and with it being our first long haul flight with Thomson I am afraid that it will be our last. There is a certain level of quality value for money and service I expect when flying with an airline and I am afraid they have not delivered on this occasion and have pushed us back into the direction of Virgin Airways where we know exactly what to expect.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

CAL has switched to using their A340-300s on this route. Aircraft's are around 11 years old on average and every window seat in Economy class has a large IFE box underneath with severely restricts legroom. I was lucky on the outbound flight since the seat next to me was unoccupied and I could stretch my legs a bit. On the return leg however that wasn't the case and the 12-13 hour flight was particularly uncomfortable due to the cramped conditions. Seat pitch is 31 inches on these aircraft and the base moves forward when reclined which restricts legroom even further. Entertainment was generally good with the latest blockbusters on offer coupled with a wide selection of older films. BBC and CNN news channels were also available as were a good selection of audio CDs. The crew were very affable and free beverages and snacks were available throughout the flight and promptly served when requested.

I booked it not because it was fairly reasonable price but because it was from a nearby airport. After check-in and gestapo tactics used to extort money for oversized hand baggage my partner spent much of our Holiday stressing about what might happen during the return flight home. Check in even suggested throwing some clothing away to keep the weight down even though the same clothing weight had been ok on the outbound leg. Never again I would happily pay an extra few quid to another airline and be relaxed and enjoy the break.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R Hall,United States,2014-10-31,"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,B Lamprell,Vietnam,2012-07-02,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”.

My trip started horribly from LHE where the Pearl and coral lanes were not even separated ground staff had no interest towards assisting anyone. It took them 2 hours to give me my boarding pass and they gave me an aisle seat when I had checked in online with a window seat. The plane was 1 hour late and when I entered the cabin only 1 flight attendant was there to guide everyone to their seats. No welcome drink served not even water. After take off the flight attendant brought me someone else's meal and then repeated the same thing again. It was a short flight and had a longer journey ahead. When I arrived at AUH airport I was happy to see they had extended their terminals and new terminals have been added to the airport. After clearing the security check point I went to the Pearl lounge and was so disappointed that there was nowhere to sit. I went to the new US Immigration's and Customs area which was done very well. The flight was an hour late. 14 hours to DC was ok the flight was full so I couldn't get my seat again. I was very disappointed with their inflight entertainment system as it has nothing at all to watch or listen to. Food quality was ok. Landed at IAD and my limo was not ordered as per the agent at the IAD airport.

Told to go online to save money for luggage prices however you had to pay additional money and/or join and pay for a membership this was not initially told to me beforehand. It was an additional $10 if you had not already printed your boarding pass plus if you wanted an assigned seat that was also an additional $15. The plane seats were horrible you could not recline in them how would your back feel flying from Baltimore to Vegas round-trip it was like standing up the entire time! Finally the bundle menu the prices were terrible and utilizing a credit card for a soda and cookies for $10 is ridiculous.

Our personal item was a bit big width-wise but we got through no problem. Our plane arrived few minutes early the staff were professional and humorous (not expecting that) and the seats weren't that bad. The flight was really smooth. The trip back to KBLI was delayed by an hour because the incoming flight from Bellingham was delayed by the rain and even though the plane was parked in the gate both pilots were on the incoming flight. We made up some time because of strong tailwind (the pilots were trying hard to arrive a few minutes earlier). The pilots landed in the wind smoothly. The only thing I dislike about this airline is that you have to pay to select a seat even upon check-in. When you look at the price tag ($400 for 2 ppl round trip) all those pay drinks could be forgiven even the expensive carry-on. I think that you see all those negative reviews because people who had positive experience took it for granted (though really those delays are horrible to hear).

Supposed to leave at 2.20pm but instead they set it at 7pm which they altered to 8pm and again to 9pm. They decided to board passengers only to realize we would sit in that plane for 1.5 hrs more. During the entire delay they compensated passengers with 10€ coupon? It was barely enough for a drink and a sandwich. We finally take off but to my surprise I find out that you have to buy the headphones and even the blanket on this 11 hour flight. I found it quite shocking that there was no meals on this long trip. I would have to buy it from a Snack Shop on the passenger seat monitor but I would not be able to do so until everyone else has eaten that pre-ordered hot meals. This was not a very pleasant flight and I will not be flying with them again.

Ground experience/check-in were nightmares with rude and inexperienced staff. 25 minutes to print a boarding pass? Don't call them out on poor service or you may not fly as they reminded me repeatedly. Nothing like a threat to start your flight. Flight crews were dynamite! Flights were nice a little dirty. They didn't transfer my luggage to my other airline for my last 2 legs of flight. The airline's baggage tag clearly stated that it should be transferred to Houston. Luckily I passed baggage claim on my quest for a cigarette or I would not have seen my bag sitting alone in the empty baggage claim area. Recognized my bag and 2 nice TSA agents ran me to re-check my bag. Both I and my bag made it on only because of the TSA agent's insistence and the frantic efforts of the US Airways crew.

There were snacks and non alcoholic drinks available whenever you wanted them although more hot drinks would have been nice. The inflight entertainment was excellent with a choice of games and recent blockbuster films. The children were very happy and kept occupied. Most importantly it was a direct flight EVA being one of a handful of airlines including Thai airways and BA who fly direct between the UK and Thailand saving a minimum of 2-3 hours on the journey time.

I chose Royal Brunei based mainly on price but also friends experience but was still apprehensive. They proved to be a very good choice and certainly equal on balance to most full service airlines. From a service point of view I did not have one bad leg and the staff were very attentive - at least equal to Cathay and Qantas and better than the European carriers. The food on all legs was good. I had a special meal order and on each leg a crew member discussed it with me just after take-off. The 777s are about 12 years old but are in very good condition. The seats whilst starting to show their age are inclined flat beds and if you can't get comfortable and sleep well particularly with the big pillows and doona then you may just too picky. The IFE isn't the latest but does a reasonable job. I took and iPad with my own selections and the seats accept a standard power connector so no need to by special attachments. They use the Cathay business lounge in Melbourne a shared business lounge in Dubai and the excellent Etihad one in Heathrow.

Upon landing in IST we were gathered and made to run across the terminal to our IST-IAH fanlight only to find out someone probably forgot to ask for this flight to be held for us (despite what we were told). The flight was already in the air. Lots of confusion and lack of initiative led to a 3 hours fiasco before we were rescheduled for the next day's flight. We were taken to a hotel (Radisson). Kosher food was not available and food that was provided was poor at best. Next day flight IST to IAH took off 3 hours late while we were sitting in the cabin with no food or drinks (see previous posts - same experience).

I couldn't seem to check-in online prior to my flight but check-in at the airport and boarding all went smoothly. The planes were clean and comfortable enough and the flight attendants regularly offered drinks including beer and wine. Although there was not a huge range there were a few decent films and TV shows to choose from for the in-flight entertainment. I had downloaded plenty of programmes to watch on my iPad anyway and I'm pleased I did. The flight attendants were polite and helpful. There was a bit of a language barrier but their English was good enough to get by without much difficulty. The food was a bit hit and miss (some of it I couldn't eat and I'm not usually a fussy eater) so I'd suggest taking some snacks.

Not good enough to pay the extra and then have to sit at an angle to fit into the seat. New seats are uncomfortable as well. Lunch service reminiscent of Economy food trays of the 80s too. Cabin crew doing their best with a full club cabin - CE clearly still popular for the moment even with revised cabin layout but for how much longer? Can no longer recommend BA for a four hour short-haul although good time-keeping. Such a shame that BA has allowed this to happen. Think again BA.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,3,1,4,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

I checked in online and had carry-on luggage only so did not have any interaction with the check-in staff. Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,4,2,2,2,2,NA,NA,2,0

After my family's Rouge experience I am back at square 0. Let me count off the ways Rouge made us see red on our recent trip to Hawaii: 1) highly punishing and inefficient boarding process both in Vancouver and in Honolulu 2) primitive entertainment services 3) a 1980s vintage and obsolete B-767 where essential functions like lighting to read by didn't work 4) hours of discomfort in seats that hinted at promiscuity (that's how close they are to each other front to back and side to side) 5) a Rouge crew that was decidedly green (we figure that this must be a training ground for new Air Canada staff and the perky uniform is decidedly weird).

Thanks to the relatively empty aircraft I managed to sleep throughout the red-eye flight. Breakfast of omelette and sausages was tasty. On returning journey 6 hour flight I watched 2 movies and a short sketch on their VOD system. Selection of movies was decent. In addition to main meals mangoes/blueberry Ice cream was served before landing in Denpasar/Bali My only criticism is the connecting flight arrangement in Bali. I had to take my luggage out before proceeding to the domestic lounge. Although I had staff assisting me the whole process was indeed unnecessary. They should provide connecting passengers with check-in baggage service to their final destinations. I recommend Garuda and would fly them again on international routes nonetheless I would avoid taking a transit route to Jakarta via Bali.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

hawaiian-airlines,/airline-reviews/hawaiian-airlines,Hawaiian Airlines customer review,Wabster Mark,Australia,2014-07-10,Flew SYD-HNL-PDX return June/July 2014 with Hawaiian. The price was right and the A330 aircraft configuration of 2-4-2 was handy for couples and family groups alike. Seats were rather hard on the behind after a few hours and getting up to move the limbs is hard if crew are working the aisles with snacks & meals though these weren't too common. It is all pretty no frills stuff though on the international sectors all the in flight entertainment is free but premium content is paid for on domestic sectors. The meals were adequate on international but really a token effort on domestic although Hawaiian claims they are the sole US airline to feed you on domestic sectors anyway. SYD-HNL is overnight so it is best to just try to sleep or doze the night away after they feed you an hour or so out of SYD. a 3 hour layover and HNL-PDX is a daytime flight that arrives just after dark in the last bit of the trip. PDX-HNL is daytime but is a bearable 5.5 hours or so. My most negative comments are about the HNL-SYD sectors flown almost entirely in daytime again staff feed you an hour or two out and do a few rounds of drinks but then want everyone to close the blinds and basically sleep/doze/not bother them for the next 7 hours or so. Overall we got to PDX for a month at a super low fare and knew what to expect having read a number of reviews here so had reasonably low expectations for all the additional things airlines can add to make trips bearable. I'd hate to have paid full price for the trip. Having said that for the same price we'd probably do it again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,3,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

After Singapore Airlines it was like travelling on a budget airline. No inflight information at all no screen as it was broken awful food. Apart from one staff member it seemed too much trouble to do anything for anyone. I had a young mother next to me travelling with 2 young children the staff did not come near and the children's meal that arrived was turned down by a hungry and disappointed 4 year old. For our meal wine food and coffee was all served together in a rush to get it over it seemed. If I can help it I will never fly with them again.

Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast.

Personally I still prefer the touch screen but with a remote/console so that you don’t feel the person behind you is constantly “pushing” your seat back. Food onboard was a weak point. It was a nice touch to be given a menu but the food quality was poor. On the way out I pre ordered low fat meal but was served normal food. I noticed the crew who said they would try to see what they could do but then disappeared entirely. There was no sandwich or drink in the galley so in my case it was a 10 hour journey without food. On the returning I was served normal food again and I had to remind the crew that I’d pre-ordered special meal – that didn't seem normal in my experience where all other airlines will give passenger their special meals before others so they don't get confused. Breakfast was also poor – an orange juice a yoghurt and a very dry croissant. Service was overall friendly but not as professional as other airlines. Toilets weren't cleaned and some were out of order. Overall an acceptable flight experience but I will still choose BA over Virgin.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,2,2,4,NA,NA,3,0

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,J Miller,United States,2014-10-28,Round-trip IAD-LHR in early October and it was one of the best trips I've taken. The seat may be the same size as on US carriers but it felt a lot larger. I was stunned to be served a free cocktail and a free bottle of wine with dinner which was a totally edible chicken casserole in one direction and a surprisingly good chicken curry in the other direction. I was also pleased to get a blanket and headphones (though I had my own). US carriers don't give squat to economy passengers and I was delighted. Service was the quickest most efficient I've ever seen on an airplane. Loved the entertainment system. Even the boarding process was seriously well organized with separate lines and doors for each section of the plane. This was about as painless as it could possibly have been. I will never fly an American carrier to Europe again. I also got a good deal at a little over $700 as fall is a down season.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Initially I was very excited to use this airline as I saw that the price for the trip was much less expensive than the usual commercial airlines flying into SLC. However I was disappointed as I continued the checking process and realized that I had to pay additional money for seats and for carry-on luggage. I then realized the total cost is not that significantly cheaper than Delta or another big airline. However I bought my tickets only 3 weeks in advance and may have saved significant money if I had purchased the tickets much earlier. I arrived to OAK 2.5 hours early in case there were any problems. Security clearance was a breeze. I am happy to say that there were no issues with delays or cancellations on this leg of the trip. The service was very good. Yes all beverages/snacks must be purchased but it is only a 1.5 hr flight and really who needs to drink/eat in that time. I can see why customers complained about the comfort of the seats as the backs are very thin and do not give a lot of cushion support. Anyway I had paid for a first row seat and I'm glad I did as I could easily get off the plane without waiting. I'm happy to say that I had no problems with my flight but I do wish the total price of the trip was much more of a ""deal"" than what I got in reality.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,0,0,NA,NA,3,1

Travelling with a child under two years I was glad to see that Cityjet charges ""only"" 3 EUR for the child travelling on your lap. Concerning the fact that we had to check in one bag (which costs an extra 15 EUR when doing it during online check-in - completely ok) I tried to check-in online as offered by the airline. Stupid enough that during this process I get the information that online check-in is not possible when travelling with a child under the age of two. This bumped the costs of our checked-in bag up to 30 EUR because we had to do it at the airport. With two flights this makes 30 extra Euro just because we were travelling with a child on our lap - not occupying a seat. So in fact the child was travelling for 33 EUR. Cityjet states in its policies that every child under the age of two may carry one piece of baggage up to 10 kg a stroller and a car seat. When we arrived at the airport we were told that only the stroller was allowed. Neither the car seat nor the 10 kg bag could be taken on the airplane - unless we paid for it.

Although the service is reasonable there is always something to be desired. I book my flights well in advance leaving enough time for connections usually closer to the time they simply change the times making the connections rather challenging. In the last episode TAM changed the flight times in such a way that it left me with under 2 hours to connect. Anyone who has been to Brazil before will know that this is impractical as you need to go through immigration at the first international airport you land before proceeding to the domestic connection. We were stuck in long queues at immigration and long queues at the check-in desk to board the connection flight. TAM did absolutely nothing to prioritise us knowing we would be late. In fact TAM simply told us to remain in the queue and believe me everyone from that flight which needed to catch the onward flight ""conveniently"" missed the flight. We were then accommodated to the next flight which had a stop-over on the way and we left inside the aircraft parked by the gates for over two hours!

This was more before their Star Alliance designation and new fleet. Unfortunately it does not seem much has changed. On the 6 hour flight from Johannesburg to Addis the business class seats barely recline meal service takes most of the flight and there is no personal entertainment system which is standard on most economy flights let alone business. Lounge in Addis which should be their flagship is still overcrowded with slow internet and no priority boarding for business passengers. On the plane from Addis to Nairobi my original seat was taken when I boarded. I asked the flight attendant and simply redirected me to another seat even though I was originally seated next to my wife. Very little room for overhead luggage so the stewardess said she would take care of it. I asked her not to put my bags in the back and she agreed.

This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it.

So we ran to the next gate which took 30 minutes (Heathrow). When we got there my wife looked at the tickets and the layover was 4 hours. So why did the employee have us run? Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place?

brussels-airlines,/airline-reviews/brussels-airlines,Brussels Airlines customer review,F Harvey,United Arab Emirates,2011-07-10,BCN-BRU Business Class. At the check-in gate they had merged the 2 fast bag drop counters and Business Class together. This was frustrating as most people check-in online these days so I had to wait a good 10 mins despite being a Business Class customer. At the check-in the airline had moved another passenger to their seat preference which resulted in my partner and I not being sat together despite the same Business Class booking. Once on board the old B737 was rather dated and there was no separation between Business and Economy. It felt like being on a Ryanair flight with a clear view down to the back of the plane. The only sign of separation was a small label a few seats back which said B.Flex class (Economy) starts here. The seats were standard Economy in 3x3 configuration. There was no attempt to at least relocate the armrests to use up the middle seat and provide a wider seat. The legroom was decent but it still felt tight. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and made up a bit for the disappointing check-in service and seating. Arrival into Brussels was fine. Though we had to wait about 10-15 mins for out bags to arrive after the first bag appeared on the carousel. This was once again frustrating as Business Class bags should get higher priority and were labelled with this sticker in Barcelona airport. I wouldn't recommend flying with Brussels airlines in Business Class (at least on short-haul).

I flew Delta to Atlanta and Atlanta to Miami where the good and bad started. Anyways I arrived in Miami at 10:30 pm. No one even at Lan Peru when I called the day before told me that the check in closed at 11pm. Needless to say by the time I got off the plane and arrived at the other end of the airport to check in it was 11:10 and no one was there. About 25 minutes later I found someone that told me I had to go to where the plane was boarding which I eventually found since the gate had moved from what security had told me. I met there the baggage screeners and the most insincere rudest 20 something year old employee I have ever witnessed. I should have noted her name but she informed me she had already closed the counter and was who I would have saw If I would have got to to check in on time. She told me she could not help me because she might miss her flight and told me to just sit and wait until tomorrow. I asked what time to which she replied sometime after 8am. I asked when she thought the next flight to Lima might leave and she said she didn't know that I would ""have to figure that out myself since she didn't have a computer"" to which she promptly grabbed her purse and walked off!!! This to the complete amazement of the 4 baggage screeners there who all siad they could not believe her that she could have at least called someone. Now all of this was at 11:30pm. 35 minutes before the plane was supposed to leave. I walked off and about 10 minutes later I heard a baggage screener yelling and running at me. He had with him another young girl that had worked at the check in counter also and she said she would do everything she could to help me. I was so relieved since the same thing happened to my wife and she was stuck there for 14 hours two weeks before. The young girl called on her radio to someone (I had no bags to check) and a few minutes later I was scrambling to get through the baggage screeners. We ran and we ran and we ran for at least 10 minutes. When we got to the gate they reopened the concourse and the airplane door and I ran in. She even called ahead and had them make sure my bags were on the plane while we ran!! I wished so much I could express just how much she had and was willing to help me. After my experience with the other girl and her completely not caring I don't think I would have flown this airline again. I will remember next time to take down names especially of those who are so motivated cordial and caring of those they provide services for. Aside from this the flight was exceptional.

The ground staff do not enforce their carry-on baggage rules which mean some people are going on with numerous pieces of luggage or luggage way larger that the specified sizes. If you follow the boarding procedures and are the last group to be called your chances of being able to put your carry-on in the overhead bins are very slight because of amount of carry-on luggage other people have put there.

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,Sidyelyeva Galyna,United States,2015-02-24,Traveled with Southwest for the first and definitely last time. They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits. But low-cost savings are not actually saving you anything when situations like that happens and they are not worth it. Not flying with Southwest anymore.

Check-in was fast at NAIA however small confusion that the monitor is showing a wrong counter for the flight and were directed by the ground staff to the other side. Flight left on time on both sectors clean cabin but with a broken tray table legroom is restricted and uncomfortable for a red-eye flight since most PAX reclining their seatbacks so it was hard to move. FAs were mixture of smiling and cheerful ladies down to bored but still polite crew and I like that they were proactive in turning on/off the reading lights for the PAX. Buy-on-board choices are good and I think were in the right price too.

asiana-airlines,/airline-reviews/asiana-airlines,Asiana Airlines customer review,Michael O'Brien,United Kingdom,2014-01-15,ICN to SYD on 30th December. Sat in seat 27k. Inflight entertainment system did not work (no sound). When I called the stewardess she just said (in limited English) that there was nothing she could do and walked off. Was told that as the economy class section of the flight was full there was nothing they could do and I would have to spend the (11 hour) flight reading or sleeping. When the passenger next to me complained that I had my reading light on (it was a night flight) the stewardess told me that I had to turn it off! As a paying passenger I feel that it is totally unacceptable that the entertainment system does not work in the first place never mind staff being unwilling to do anything about it. 12th January ICN to LHR. Sat in seat 26G - and again the inflight entertainment system for my seat does not work. Staff tried rebooting it 5 times but that did not work. Even though there were spare seats in travel class staff would not let me move as it would mean moving to a centre seat from an aisle seat. So 12 hours in a plane without any working in flight entertainment. Again an utter lack of maintenance or customer care from Asiana. I had further problems with the meals on these flights - on the ICN- SYD flight my main course was served cold it took staff 20 minutes to find a new one. I had a similar problem on the ICN-LHR. Because row 26 was the last row in that service round the western food choice was gone. I had to wait 20 minutes whilst staff waited to see if there was one from another trolley available. Now I accept that meal choices may not be available but by the time I was given mine it was cold. It was reheated. It was still cold. A new one was found (45 minutes after I should have been served) - again cold. Although I can't fault the other two flights on my itinerary I felt that these flights were amongst the worst I have ever flown on with poorly maintained and old planes disinterested staff and an active lack of management in the cabin.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,3,1,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges.

No issues at all with the internal flight - left on time and excellent crew. International flight both outbound and inbound was well below what we have become used to with Jet. We were sat at the back in the 2 seat config this time giving me a little extra room to stretch out 1 leg where the 3rd seat would have been. Seat pretty comfy. Staff were very low quality! On way out as boarding was occurring an argument broke out between two passengers - 4 crew stood around like spare parts whilst the passengers argument got more and more heated. Rather than take control of the situation to ensure comfort of all passengers they just stood there looking very lost. Totally and utterly useless! Service through the outbound flight was perfunctory at best and you got the impression any passenger awake they viewed as an inconvenience rather than someone contributing to their wages. The look I had when asking for a coffee mid flight said it all. Food was pretty good on outbound and return flight. On the return flight the staff were marginally better but not a lot. Again you got the impression we were an inconvenience simply being on the flight! Requests for more coffee or snacks was met with the look of ""oh if you must!"" They need to allow the volume to go higher to block out ambient background cabin noise! I wasn't using their own headsets having learnt before they are tinny ultra quiet and liable to fall apart but my own set and even with the volume on mine set to high with volume on entertainment unit set to high you could still hear much of the noise on the aircraft well other than the PA announcements which came through at a deafening level! In total contrast the staff on the internal flight were the polar opposite friendly welcoming humorous and did their level best to ensure a great flight and for them nothing was too much trouble. This is how Jet was on all their flights previously and this was quality of service combined with stunning value. The value Jet offers is very good on ticketing prices the inflight entertainment is pretty good and the food better than some - but their staff are really becoming budget Ryanair type staff.

I couldn't believe that as we had previously flown in much worse weather. It wasn't even raining but I won't argue with the decision Air China made as safety is a priority. We were already so tired and we weren't happy as our return flight to Korea with Air China had already been rescheduled inconveniently. It was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so It was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in Paris. I asked the Air China Duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid Beijing weather. I am very unhappy with how we were dealt with. One of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us. Furthermore, He said he would do anything he could for us so I requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call. After he was on the phone for a short time he said, unfortunately, there were no rooms available . As much as we were frustrated and annoyed, I thought he couldn't really do anything more for us at that time. I asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least, so if any rooms became available we could get one. He said that wasn't a problem and he said our names were on the list. Although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative, I wish I grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie. After we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as I wanted to double-check our names were actually on the waiting list. They informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay. We explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that Air China said they were not willing to pay for it. With the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the Air China Duty Manager but of course he wouldn't answer the phone. I also called the customer service desk of Air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold. The lady told me that she couldn't help because I chose English therefore the line went through to LA Air China so that she couldn't help us. I don't know where to begin to complain about this situation. The way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable. First of all, how the manager lied to our faces like that I still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers. I have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company. If customer service is only for Chinese speaking people and English speakers only get a dummy speaker and they can't actually help anyone with the problems, they might as well be up front about it. Then they could have saved my time and money for making all the international calls like an idiot at 2am in the morning. I emailed the customer service.

The worst experience for us was Guangzhou airport. All the staff we encountered in the shops / cafes were incredibly rude and miserable and everything is shockingly overpriced.

sunwing-airlines,/airline-reviews/sunwing-airlines,Sunwing Airlines customer review,M Woods,Canada,2015-06-13,"Our non-stop return flight from Jamaica to Toronto was changed mid vacation to include a ""stopover"" in Punta Cana. On boarding we were told we would be dropping off passengers to Punta Cana before heading to Toronto, adding an additional 1.5 hrs to our flight, including an additional takeoff and landing. In fact we were late leaving due the luggage needing to be re-balanced. On arrival in Punta Cana, approx. 20 passengers got off. Apparently they had been diverted from Toronto to Jamaica to spend the night before continuing to their destination of Punta Cana the following morning, due to their flight not being full enough? When the passengers had left the plane we were further delayed by more rebalancing of luggage and refuelling. Re-fuelling, and rebalancing completed, imagine our shock with yet a further delay as Sunwing made some additional cash by loading some fresh fruits and vegetable cargo onto to our plane! Then some additional unloading as they backed some of the cargo off of the plane as they apparently loaded too much. All said and done we sat on the runway for two hours, with a plane full of passengers and young children. We were not permitted to leave the plane, it was very warm and crowded. We were able to use the washrooms, but the line-ups were long and the facilities very messy due to the overuse. No food or beverages were provided during this time and many of the children were cranky, hot and tired resulting in passenger/parent altercations breaking out all over the plane. It was very quickly becoming a very hostile environment. Additionally the inflight entertainment system had stopped functioning mid flight so all passengers could do during the two hour torture session was stare at the clock ticking off a lengthy delay and stare out the window at a very inept airport crew dropping luggage onto the Tarmac. The flight crew lacked a single drop of empathy at passengers comments, in fact when I asked what they were going to do for us to compensate us for our time and discomfort the response I received was that ""they would get us to our destination safely"". So in the end when we finally took off and reached our destination of Toronto, our 4 hr direct flight turned into over 8 hrs, with a 3 hr pre-flight arrival at the airport making our journey over 11 hrs.

The food I was given the seafood stew was inedible. The TV did not work a lady did move me but that was just an hour before we landed. All in all a bad experience.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,D Yoon,United States,2011-09-18,JFK-ICN on 747-400 ICN-JFK on 777-300er The Business Class lounge at JFK is wanting. Limited range of refreshments are provided ie cheese crackers and muffin assortments. It is dimly lit and small. Onboard the flight menu hasn't changed much in 10 years. They serve red wine chilled in mini glasses. Overall the attention to detail in their customer service aspect has diminished over the years. Further the new 180 degree position seats are cold firm and uncomfortable. The Business Class lounge at ICN is large and well lit. However because ICN is the hub for KAL it is always packed with waiting passengers. I've also noticed over the years that the assortment of available food items has shrunk here also. Onboard I will never again fly 14+ hrs non-stop on a B777 too noisy and too cramped. Concerning the cabin crew the service is always better although nominally when flying out of the states.

Good value for money and only a few observations. Having paid for a 'hot seat' the priority boarding in BKK was only to the bus not the plane. There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off. Flights on-time and one of the aircraft was virtually brand new.

We did however choose British Airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. I am happy to report that the experience was totally different. Our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. On the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. We also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. Their screen was so far ahead I couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable.

I was amazed with the service I received from the ground staff as I had a baggage issue that Finnair did not want to deal with but Qantas came to the rescue. The flight was very comfortable as I am not a small woman I felt I wasn't being squeezed into a tiny space.

phuket-air,/airline-reviews/phuket-air,Phuket Air customer review,Claire Everett,NA,2005-02-21,Myself and my partner flew Phuket Air to BKK in Oct 04. The flight over was ok the plane was an old KLM jumbo which was tatty but comfortable. I agree with the comments about the cabin crew not being able to handle drunken louts. On the flight out there were a group of middle age men who were served alcoholic drinks from the time of serving to just prior to landing. Although they didn't cause any trouble I was very surprised that the cabin crew continued to serve them over a period of 11 hours. Our return flight was a bit of a nightmare. Having spent 6 hours waiting in Bangkok airport we boarded the plane at midnight. Our take off time came and went 40 minutes passed and we were told nothing. Then the captain said we would be taking off in 10 minutes (no apology). This came and went then another announcement there was a problem loading the luggage and we would be taking off in 10 minutes. Again this came and went. One and a half hours passed before we finally started to move. This KLM jumbo was really in bad shape and was much worse than the plane on the flight over it was dirty my table was broken and we generally didn’t feel that happy flying in it. As the plane turned the corner and revved the engine to join the runway there was the most horrendous smell of burning. We were sitting at the front end of the plane near to the kitchen in the nose cone. As the plane started to go down the runway the smell got much worse. All the cabin crew were up running about looking in all of the ovens trying to find the source of this smell. They all looked terrified which is pretty off putting to the passengers in the first place! The plane continued down the runway with the smell getting worse all the time. Even as the plane was taking off the crew continued to look for the problem. My partner and I were terrified as too seemed those people sitting around us. One lady even got us and asked the crew what was going on. They didn’t really tell her. The plane climbed very slowly with this smell still present. Whilst we were still climbing the captain came out and sniffed about with all the cabin crew flapping around him then the co-pilot came out and done the same. I think everyone on the flight feared the worst. We honestly thought we were going to be blown out of the sky. About an hour later the smell went away but we couldn’t settle after the adrenaline rush of panic. We also stopped in Sharjah which was awful as the air conditioning was switched off and we were delayed here too. We weren’t given any drinks were told not to use the toilet and weren’t allowed off the plane. Our journey home took us over 36 hours which marred the end of our holiday. I was most upset by the lack of information provided by the crew. We were not told about the burning problem or the cause of it or reassured about it there were no apologies at all. I would never fly Phuket air again nor recommend it. I am surprised that the BAA allows them to provide a long haul service from the UK.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

No business agent per say as advertised. Lounge in T2 even though its new was over crowded. If flydubai expects to operate a dedicated business class in all its flights in the future they will have a problem as the lounge area is very small - both the bar and buffet area in addition to this since its a marhaba lounge most of the credit cards guests are also welcomed. Boarding was with economy class onboard a dedicated crew member who was efficient and friendly. Seat good for short hops better than European low cost business class who block the middle seat.

As a 77 year old woman travelling alone I bought Premium Economy for the longer Virgin flights. The seats were wider and a bit further apart than Etihad Economy but not really worth the extra money. The worst part of the trip was the queue for boarding passes at Abu Dhabi on the return journey on 1 June. I was given passes for both outward legs in Sydney. On the return trip my Virgin pass wasn't available at the Heathrow Etihad check-in so I had to join a queue of about 200 Virgin passengers in Abu Dhabi being serviced by one man at one computer.

singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,Peter Riddell,Australia,2013-12-09,I've recently flown on SQ 423 BOM-SIN connecting SQ217 SIN-MEL in J Class. Can I say at the outset the crew on SQ and their service to the business class passenger is wonderful. I used points to upgrade and it was a rare experience for me to enjoy J class so was really keen to sample SQ business class. Great sized LCD TV screen brand new cabin on SQ423 wide seats and such a massive sense of space! Amazingly for a post-midnight departure ex Mumbai we were served a full 3 course meal which was lovely but it's almost impossible to sleep on a full stomach. Much more logical to serve a light snack on departure and full breakfast before Singapore surely? The menu didn't indicate this was an option to be requested so I assume no breakfast service was available. The seat in recline position was great and quite comfortable but it was after putting the bed down to try and sleep the discomfort began. A very hard lumpy bed from the various joins and cushions. And the massive belt that pins you to the bed is totally uncomfortable. I felt like I was tied to the bed couldn't turn over couldn't breathe and ended up having to sit back up again. Equals no sleep! So so disappointing. I'm happy to drape a seat belt over me while sleeping I'm not prepared to be tied down! SQ 217 on the SIN-MEL leg was an old version of the 1-2-1 config. Dirty walls worn leather seats small TV drinks placed on the shelf at the front so it was a case of having to undo the seat belt and stretch out to take it. Beautiful food excellent service lovely lovely crew. But again the hard uncomfortable bed.

etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,A Joyce,Ireland,2014-04-08,Dublin - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok return economy March 2014. Frequent Flyer and Etihad gold card holder. Etihad are a good but no longer great airline. All flights were punctual. The lounge in Dublin is fantastic. All flight sectors were very busy. Food onboard was OK. The food service onboard seems to take an extortionate amount of time. Also Etihad leave the main lighting on for too long on red eye flight. They should make better use of the mood lighting for those that want to sleep. The seat pitch on the A330 was not good and I could not sleep. The Boeing 777 aircraft with 10 abreast seating and narrow aisles feels cramped but easier to sleep on. The crew were friendly and professional on all sectors. They currently appear to be more interactive and helpful with passengers. I was impressed as I was greeted by name on one sector. IFE is good. Etihad now seem to have a policy of boarding almost an hour before scheduled departure which seems excessive to me. We were sitting on the tarmac after boarding for a least 30minutes on all sectors and I was one of the last few to board. There are still issues with the landing slot in Dublin airport in the morning as no stands are available to park at. Another delay after a 8 hour flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,4,3,NA,NA,4,1
thai-airways,/airline-reviews/thai-airways,Thai Airways customer review,Wade Lindqvist,Sweden,2014-12-01,SGN-BKK TG 551 Nov 24 A320 Operated by ThaiSmile. Short sector little over 1 hour. Snack box meal service was OK. Full flight with very tight seating. Cabin crew good but had trouble asserting themselves to have electronics shutdown for take of and landing with the north Asian passengers speaking mandarin being very uncooperative. No IFE. Remote stand with over 20 minutes to terminal. Congested immigration of course not their fault.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,4,3,1,NA,NA,3,1
turkish-airlines,/airline-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,K Thomsen,United Kingdom,2015-06-04,LHR-SFO (return) via IST. Check-in at LHR was fast en efficient and the PrimeClass lounge was nice with a good food selection. Boarding at LHR was a bit chaotic but we got on board. First leg (LHR-IST) was a A321 with large seats in BC very comfortable for the short trip food was ok and the aircrew were friendly. IFE was an older system with 4 movie running on a loop no great but for a three hour flight it was acceptable. IST airport is very overcrowded and even the BC lounge was packed so I decided to get some sleep at the airport hotel. A little pricey but well worth it. Boarding at IST was without any BC priority boarding and extra document and security check before being bussed to the plane. While airports like the old Doha airport had this down to an art IST seems to have turned this in to organised chaos not a nice experience at all. Second leg was a B777 with a 2-3-2 configuration. I had problems seeing how this would work prior to flying by I saw both a single mum with two children and two parents with a child for whom this setup with 3 seats in the middle worked a charm. Flight crew were nice and service minded but very slow to bring food out and the chefs costume is a terrible gimmick they should drop sooner rather than later as unlike Gulf Airlines where you can discuss the meal with an actual chef and make changes to the menu at Turkish they simply take an order from the menu and that is it. Food was good and plentiful. The seat was ok for sitting and eating or lying down but getting a comfortable position to relax in the middle was very hard and took some fiddling with the limited controls. IFE offered true AVOD with a large selection of films and TV shows as well as live TV. Films were not all the latest and greatest but I think there was something for everyone. Return journey started out better than at LHR with quick and efficient check-in at SFO and boarding done in a controlled and orderly fashion. I had a quick look in the United Club lounge with was nice and quiet but had a very limited selection of food. Plane was again a B777 with a good and attentive flight crew although they seemed a bit more robotic than the previous crews. Food was excellent and plentiful although again it seemed to take quite a while to get it served. Short transit in IST where boarding descended in to a new level of chaos with absolutely no announcements no BC priority boarding and extra document checks. As a seasoned flyer I knew to just get in a queue and get on with it but a rookie flyer would have been lost in the chaos. Not good enough and this needs to be changed fairly sharpish. Again a A321 this time with a refurbished cabin which meant the IFE was true AVOD (the same system as on the B777) and nice new seats. Again a pleasant flight crew that spent forever getting food served. The food was good but we got in to LHR about 20 minutes late because we were 30 minutes late out of IST. Price considered the offering is very good as long as you accept that IST airport is old over capacity and chaotic beyond belief.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1
sunwing-airlines,/airline-reviews/sunwing-airlines,Sunwing Airlines customer review,Qushair Rick,Canada,2015-01-26,Purchased a 4 night trip to Nassau flight scheduled to leave Toronto at 6.10pm (WG746) arriving in Nassau at 9.35pm. We were delayed with no explanation for 3 hours. After de-icing we took off around 9.20pm We were in the air for about an hour and a half the Pilot messaged that one of the 2 airplane systems is down and we have to fly back to Toronto. There are plenty of airports in the states to land in but Sunwing decided to fly back to Toronto. We landed back in Toronto at around midnight. I bought a 4 night trip the first night is done by the time we fly back to Nassau it will 4am the earliest. No food or drink were served customers were complaining. I opted not to go to Nassau since we lost so much time and asked to be let off the plane. I emailed Sunwing looking for my money back or hesitantly a replacement trip. Awaiting a response. I would pay the extra money to fly another airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,2,2,1,1,NA,NA,1,0
