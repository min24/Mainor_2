adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,Michael Asher,Turkey,2013-06-10,Istanbul-Ljubljana-Munich and return. Pre-take off on all sectors given an individual bottle of water and plastic glass. During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm. Also that the Slovenian liqueur speciality advertised in their in-flight Duty Free catalogue is not carried on board. All flights on time.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,2,5,4,0,NA,NA,4,1

Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carry-on bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age - quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea & coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA.

adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,Alex Stare,NA,2004-03-18,Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
adria-airways,/airline-reviews/adria-airways,Adria Airways customer review,G Chew,NA,2002-12-06,I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Online check-in was quick just had to get boarding passes and to drop off bags at the airport. Despite having a bus gate boarding was organised very well and the flight departed ahead of schedule. The seats were quite comfortable and legroom was acceptable for this short flight. There was a small hot meal of pasta on the flight as well as a small dessert and drinks. Sweets were distributed before the main meal service. The red wine served on board was very good. Of note are the cabin crew who were very friendly and went around their work with smiles on their faces - this is rare these days with most airlines. The entertainment consisted of short videos on Greek island destinations and was ok though there was no audio available.

I booked tickets several weeks in advance and got a good value flight. The website was clear with what one needed to pay extra. With the flight only an hour, I didn't want to pay extra for premium economy seats that would've guaranteed a more comfortable flight for a tall person like me (2m). Yet, I hoped that if the flight wasn't fully booked the staff would be flexible and allow me to sit in an exit row. Years of flying have continued to confirm to me that if you want service and flexibility, go with the ""legacy"" airlines, as opposed to the ""low-cost"" ones where you have to pay for everything. Once again, I politely asked and the Aer Lingus staff happily obliged - on both trips. As such, I was very pleased for the quality I got on this short-haul flight within the UK. I've not flown Aer Lingus long-haul, so I can't comment, but based on this experience I would be ready to try Aer Lingus transatlantically if they offered a good price and connection.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy,LHR to BHD,9,4,5,NA,NA,4,NA,4,1

We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time.

Food was pretty bad mostly tasteless slop for the main meal and an insulting muffin and coffee/tea for ""afternoon tea"" which was literally thrown at some people. We could watch movies/TV free but the headset quality was atrocious we couldn't hear clearly (same for announcements which could be a safety hazard). I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole ""Irish"" routine which went on for a while.

The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over.

We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing.

It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled.

I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland.

The views as the flight took off and landed were incredible but the flight tickets were slightly expensive for such a short distance.

Inbound my neighbour had 3 shopping bags and a coat on the middle seat and not an eyelid batted? Food service is also always hit a miss outbound I was able to buy a breakfast offering on return nothing was available. Also I note the seat belt sign seems to stay on unusually longer than any other airline probably to keep passengers seated longer in order for service prep. Seats are comfortable for short haul leather but starting to wear slightly. Gold Circle club is a waste of time. At Dublin I attempted to check in at a computer terminal with my passport and told to report to a physical desk for check in. Oh joy huge queues luckily I tried another machine and it worked fine.

As this was known well beforehand we could have remained in our hotels instead of being jammed into the airport at 1 in the morning then finally boarding the aircraft at 04:30 and sitting on the Tarmac for an hour before takeoff.

We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF.

Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there's plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered.

Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter.

Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board.

I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know.

All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved.

Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules.

When flying Economy Aeroflot is very good for short haul flights to EU. When flying Business quality issues arise. Lounges sometimes are packed both in terminals D and F especially in the morning or late in the evening. Secondly onboard quality service is unsustainable: sometimes attendants are nice and helpful sometimes rude and evasive. Aeroflot always forgets about its Business class passengers and priority Boarding especially in terminal F for long haul flights. However the major problem is the home airport of Sheremetyevo. In most cases people are spending an awful long time just to leave the airport area. Queuing in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2 week vacation and Business Class experience crosses everything out about the Aeroflot flight.

Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights.

You are served only Cola Fanta Sprite water tomato juice apple juice or orange juice tea and coffee. Inflight entertainment was excellent with many films and games as well as music.

Although there are dedicated gates for flights to Russia there is no signage or information to indicate that before reporting to the gate you have to have your Russian visa checked (again) at a desk labelled simply ""Air Berlin service"". To enter the departure lounge you have to pass through passport control. As we could see that the lounge had no toilets and not having been informed about the need to have our visa checked again we and many others decided not to go into the lounge until just before boarding time. At that time we were directed to join a long queue where a single employee was slowly checking visas. All the while Air Berlin announcements were telling people to board the plane immediately as it was about to depart! The whole mess could be avoided by clear signage and information.

I checked in online and had carry-on luggage only so did not have any interaction with the check-in staff. Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers.

The ground services in Istanbul are handled by a third party for Air Canada and are appalling. I am a top-tier AC frequent flyer and used the priority check-in which took an extraordinarily long time to process our party of 4 travellers. There were 5 agents behind the desk with only one dealing with the passengers and the rest simply watching. Boarding process was utterly chaotic with 9 agents in attendance and none of them at all interested in answering the queries from the passengers or helping them. I had to inquire 3 times about priority boarding before I was offered a snippy response. In one of those instances the agent made eye-contact and then simply walked away from me completely ignoring my question. The gate assigned for the flight was woefully inadequate to handle a Transatlantic flight. 200+ passengers were processed through a check-in facility more suited for commuter planes. We were eventually bussed to the aircraft adding further delays to a flight that was already delayed by 90 minutes. Once onboard the aircraft showed its age with tired interior worn-out PODS inoperable washrooms and dull lighting. FA's were very attentive and the AVOD selection offered plenty of options. Two meals and frequent water-runs were offered throughout the 11-hour long flight. The meals were mediocre at best but drink selection was good. The only redeeming aspect of the journey was the amazing Business Lounge operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight arrived late but we were lucky to make our connection. Air Canada must take a serious look at their ground service arrangement in Istanbul as it really gets the passengers off to an unpleasant experience.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,3,3,5,2,4,NA,NA,2,1

air-china,/airline-reviews/air-china,Air China customer review,J Kim,Australia,2015-07-30,"When we arrived at Beijing airport at 10:30 pm to check in for our flight to Paris we were told that the flight was delayed to 5:50 in the morning due to thunderstorm. I couldn't believe that as we had previously flown in much worse weather. It wasn't even raining but I won't argue with the decision Air China made as safety is a priority. We were already so tired and we weren't happy as our return flight to Korea with Air China had already been rescheduled inconveniently. It was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so It was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in Paris. I asked the Air China Duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid Beijing weather. I am very unhappy with how we were dealt with. One of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us. Furthermore, He said he would do anything he could for us so I requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call. After he was on the phone for a short time he said, unfortunately, there were no rooms available . As much as we were frustrated and annoyed, I thought he couldn't really do anything more for us at that time. I asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least, so if any rooms became available we could get one. He said that wasn't a problem and he said our names were on the list. Although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative, I wish I grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie. After we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as I wanted to double-check our names were actually on the waiting list. They informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay. We explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that Air China said they were not willing to pay for it. With the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the Air China Duty Manager but of course he wouldn't answer the phone. I also called the customer service desk of Air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold. The lady told me that she couldn't help because I chose English therefore the line went through to LA Air China so that she couldn't help us. I don't know where to begin to complain about this situation. The way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable. First of all, how the manager lied to our faces like that I still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers. I have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company. If customer service is only for Chinese speaking people and English speakers only get a dummy speaker and they can't actually help anyone with the problems, they might as well be up front about it. Then they could have saved my time and money for making all the international calls like an idiot at 2am in the morning. I emailed the customer service.

Following a somewhat chaotic boarding process driven by the awkward queuing arrangement at the new Terminal #2 boarded the plane only to sit on board for nearly 50 minutes awaiting ATC clearance for takeoff. Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it. I have been a top-tier loyal customer of AC but if they choose to convert all of their long-haul business class to this seating configuration I will look for alternatives in a hurry.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,1,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

Meals were variable: if you're not a fan of pork or seafood order a special meal. Crew tried to speak the menu options but their English language skills aren't up to the task-just give us the menu please. Since I was going to miss my connection in FRA I was asking the crew what I should do-since there was no indication that CA staff would protect us on other flight options.

However the price for a business ticket remains the same! This is what happens when there is no other way to travel (business class) directly between Toronto and Orlando.

air-china,/airline-reviews/air-china,Air China customer review,G Chris,United Kingdom,2015-04-16,LHR-PEK r/t in First Class. Used miles for this trip as CA First was 75000 vs 100000 for VS Upper Class to PVG. Overall it was OK. As a Star Alliance carrier we used United First lounge at LHR T2. 777 was clean/new bed and pyjamas comfortable amenity kit akin to US carriers' international Business class. Food was pretty average (JAL economy on subsequent flight was better tasting) wine list ok but limited whisky etc. I avoided the instant coffee. Cabin nice and quiet only 4 pax in First both ways. Glad we weren't in fully-crammed Business class. Staff on LHR-PEK were decent but hard to get a smile return from PEK-LHR food was much better and FAs much friendlier. As others have noted IFE is on-demand but somewhat limited English options. I know it's Air China but they should take a page from other Asian airlines e.g. JAL who have tons of international film/TV options. First Class lounge in Beijing is pretty poor: self-serve bar but no ice or lemon etc so don't even bother trying to make a gin & tonic just pour yourself a glass of warm white Chinese wine and whimper in a corner. Beijing Capital Airport is a beautiful Norman Foster building but don't ever transit internationally in Beijing. Unlike pretty much every airport on Earth you have to go through Chinese immigration just for connecting flights (it's a separate queue but still). We had a full two hour connection and spent nearly 1h45m just waiting to get the passport stamp to then go straight back through security. Incredibly inefficient and infuriating. No special/fast track for First class and no staff seemed to care that the delays were making everyone miss their long-haul connections. On balance CA First is slightly better than BA Club but below VS Upper Class. However for 25k fewer miles than VS to Asia it felt like a fair trade.

The new AC high density 777-300 on the YVR-LHR route is awful In business the Pods are gone. The seat pitch is much reduced. The seat is poorly constructed and difficult to change position. The table is bizarre - spring loaded and very difficult to put back. The lie flat is not comfortable and has no privacy. You have to climb over the aisle passenger to get out. This is a serious serious downgrade and I cant see how they can compete against CX on the HKG route or BA to LHR. In economy its 3-4-3 which looked awful. Premium economy is 2-4-2. the centre rows look very cramped. I should add that the lounge at LHR is the SAS lounge which has very limited range of food/drinks.

Crew did not check safety measures appropriately: a passenger sitting next to me was using his mobile before take off and it took 3 crew members instructions before he finally switched it off - but they failed to tell him to put his bag in the overhead locker. The bag was on his lap disguising the fact that he was not wearing his seat belt. I asked him to put his seat belt on and his comment was ""relax"". Same thing happened on landing - they didn't check his seat belt. A friend who was seated in a bulkhead seat said a bag was in front of her on the floor during take off and landing. I had to completely unpack my case at check in because the scanner at check in had identified something (it was the plug of my travel kettle!). Check in staff were most unhelpful and officious.

Think we were luckier than the rest in premium economy for this reason only. God forbid if you had to go to the bathroom because you had to make your way down the narrow aisle to the back of the plane loaded with people waiting to use the bathroom. There is barely enough room to pass other people going the opposite direction. But people persist by squeezing past you nevertheless. We ordered 3 pizza slices and falafel wrap. The pizza was the worst. Paper thin. Nothing like the picture in the menu. Ate it because we weren't prepared with snacks of our own. I did find that the staff tried their best in these less than ideal conditions. They must have to deal with a lot of grumpy people on these flights.

The colours are not flattering to any skin or hair colour the bowler hats are ridiculous and they just look downright cheap. The skinny hairbands don't help either. The FA's are very young and void of personality they have no senior co-workers to emulate and it shows. They look lost. They hardly spoke to the passengers and I heard one passenger comment as we left the aircraft that was the quietest flight crew they ever experienced. The aircraft is bare bones the bulkhead doesn't even go up to the ceiling so you are constantly looking into the galley. The seating is so tight a 29 inch pitch it should be illegal in the name of safety. Got off the flight and on to an Air Canada mainline flight to Vancouver. What a difference!

When I compare Air Canada Rouge to regular Air Canada it's like night and day. The seats on Rouge are very uncomfortable and cramped. Inflight entertainment is barely acceptable. In order to access it you have to own an iPad or rent one on board. The movies are old and out of date. On the return flight from Barcelona to Toronto there was garbage (including used napkins and food) from the previous flight still lying on the ground when we boarded. It was filthy. One of the bathrooms was out of service for the nearly 9 hour flight from Barcelona to Toronto. Every time the seatbelt sign turned off when there wasn't turbulence people rushed to the bathrooms that actually worked. Flight attendants seemed very young and inexperienced.

But traveling through Beijing and a sneaky hidden stop over in Shanghai to your destination puts a sour taste in the mouth. For a start even though you are transiting through China to you're destination you must clear customs in both Shanghai and Beijing this process is 10/10 in the stress factor especially if you are a first time traveler via these cities. As this was our first European holiday my wife and I found out the hard way that cheap airfares are cheap for a reason. As for Air China as a carrier I can not complain the service was good food typical for an aircraft seats average for comfort in economy class entertainment good.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,A Cowan,Canada,2014-06-12,"We flew Air Canada 2 weeks ago (not Rouge) Toronto - Munich on an outbound leg to Athens. While boarding the craft in Toronto was a little disorganized the flight and service was great and the flight would have rated full stars across the board. Our return flight was AC 1901 Athens-Toronto only gets 3 stars for satisfaction as we did arrive safely and on time. That is really the only good thing to be said for it. This was an 11 hour flight through 7 times zones. The flight was half full so staff were not overworked. Unless you pushed the call attendant light they were only in evidence when the very poor meals were delivered (not served). No choice available limited beverage service followed 15 minutes later. One mid-flight trip down the aisle to slide some pretzels and 4 ounces of pop or juice onto your tray and two silent passes of an attendant with a bottle of water and the staff disappeared at least in our cabin. No entertainment available at the seat unless you were willing to pull out a credit card again to rent the airline tablet. The worst of it all was the total lack of comfort provided by the seat. We do not like having the seats in front of us recline so that is not really a problem however the seat design offers no support in the lower back and has restricted both aisle and window passengers from stretching their legs. The arm rest design means that you can inadvertently call the attendant or turn your light on or off. Others have commented on the lack of personal ventilation at the seat so I won't. A mixed blessing was having blankets and pillows provided prior to take-off. At 1pm this seemed a little like telling someone that they are being ""put down for a nap"". If you don't want them you must give up your limited space to store the items in the event that might want them. On the plus side overhead baggage storage was adequate (however this was not a full flight and might be a problem if fully loaded). Washrooms were adequate but masking tape holding dispensers and bins closed does not inspire confidence. As has become the norm the audio system was poor - either the airline staff need a lesson in microphone use and diction or the system needs an overhaul as most announcements were so ""mushy"" as to be indecipherable. Finally while we recognize that the airport is responsible at this point the baggage pick-up was a bit of a problem as the overhead monitors specified one carousel but the baggage actually arrived on a different one.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

air-europa,/airline-reviews/air-europa,Air Europa customer review,A Ross,United Kingdom,2015-02-11,LGW-MAD-GRU - Having done this journey direct from the UK I was dubious about the change in Madrid and sceptical about the £2k less difference in the BA price. Check was a bit gruff at Gatwick with the handling agents doing their best to ignore customers while discussing their weekend plans and gossiping about a poor member of staff who had just gone of shift . However the Lounges at Gatwick and Madrid were not as good as the Heathrow Terraces but much better than the rude and over booked facilities of the JFK Terraces. I felt the weak link here was the lounge in Sao Paulo on the way back which reminded me of a provincial airport with basic service and low quality decor. Air Europa may wish to consider changing this. The first thing that strikes you about this airline is the service and the pristine staff who respond to you every need as if their life depended on it  nothing was too much trouble. Dinner service was on a par with old BA first class with leather menus and five courses although the food was on a par with lesser Club World. The seat - was not a lie flat bed but very similar to Club World London City although the Air Europa Corporate colours are a bit garish for my taste. There were plenty of films to watch and an I pad if you ran out the regular on demand service. There was a the obligatory amenity kit comforter blanket and pillows at bed time.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,A Gordon,Australia,2015-03-19,I flew Air from Sydney to Delhi and return because it was a non stop flight. On entering the aircraft it looked old and I found that my touch screen did not work. The toilets were disgusting smelt and were stained. Some panels were hanging loose. The floor was awash. On return the aircraft looked newer but the toilets were still disgraceful. I had to fly via Melbourne which was a pain in the neck as we had to disembark in Melbourne and go through a stringent security check again. On take off the cabin crew did not do a safety check of passengers and we took off with one passenger asleep across three seats unrestrained. One passenger had tray table down and that was what I could see from my seat. The cabin crew avoided eye contact at all times. During the long overnight flight from Delhi children were allowed to run amok. Food mediocre. Would never use again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,3,2,NA,NA,2,0

Check-in was efficient but that's all that I liked about the flight. I've never experienced before such an arrogant and frigid crew as on this flight. Crew did not do anything during the first two hours of the flight. They were chatting for two hours! After two hours of chatting with each other reading newspapers playing games on their phones and drinking coffee they decided to serve the passengers. Coffee or tea and a very small croissant were served. I expected a bit more on a flight of over three hours. After serving they were gone and I haven't seen them again. Seats were horrible in comparison to my outbound flight with KLM. The announcements were very difficult to understand. And of course they lost my baggage.

Air Europa changed my return flight by 3 hours -again with no explanation. Flight was in the early hours so left in the airport with no ground staff from Air Europa at all. The service is appalling. The planes themselves are not set up for long-haul. Many of the seats do not recline nor do many of the screens for on board entertainment work. You have to pay for headphones or bring your own. The food was beyond awful and the air hosts could not tell me what the food was (it was hard to identify and I am not a meat eater). I was told to 'just try it or leave it not their responsibility to know what the food was'!. For me the most worrying element was the lack of safety. We descended and landed with the air hosts standing up and chatting. Some of the overhead lockers were not shut and passengers were not asked to have seats upright or tables put away.

On the Chennai-Dubai sector the passenger sitting in front of me asked for an extra can of beer during dinner only to be roughly ticked off by the cabin crew. The reason given was that they only serve one can of beer per passenger. I have flown hundreds of miles on various airlines but this is the first time that I am hearing such a ridiculous explanation.

However I found the cabin crew to be lazy as they never responded to the call button meaning I had to go to the galley when I wanted something like a drink. Also the entertainment was disappointing because although it was video-on-demand the selection of decent Western films was limited and there was no Western music only Indian. Furthermore the staff at Delhi Airport were so rude with far too many checks yet insufficient staff that meant getting through checks at Delhi during transit took far too long.

On board service was decent but agree with comments that for a country which prides itself on food AF food was disappointing. Seats were not the new ones but still decent and managed 3 hours of sleep. CDG-NCE and FRA-CDG was a total let down with just middle seat blocked ; no clue why European carriers do this yet seem to think this is a huge service- would be easier to have bigger seats like in US.

Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky). As noted before chicken or veg should not be the default option for business class and the quality of both was poor even for airline food. No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers. Entertainment system on the A321 from the 1990's - no on demand and a choice of 5 channels 1 English. Ended up watching an Indian cop movie. BKK-Delhi - more of the same but breakfast of better quality. Delhi - BKK - although late best of all the legs with attentive cabin crew calls answered on request for drinks a good quality meal this time.

On the return journey back from Bangkok the food was poor with some type of very fatty meat as a main course that I (and my wife) could not eat or even identify. Furthermore after the main meal it was a long long time until breakfast was served leaving myself and my fellow passengers hungry. I later established that snacks were available if you made your own way to the galley to collect them but this availability was not announced and by the time I realised (whilst visiting the toilet) all of the sandwiches and most of the ice creams had gone (NOT acceptable). Cabin crew were pleasant and polite but did not seem proactive in any way and (to me) this was evidenced by the fact that they did not bother to serve the snacks or make any announcement as to their availability. The interconnection at CDG was pretty seamless and posed no problem at all.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,Brian Smith,Japan,2013-12-03,"NRT-CDG-FCO and return. On the outbound I flew premium economy and the return business class. I have enjoyed Air France for several reasons the past few years on these long-hauls and this flight was no different. They are on time reliable and the food is good. Their premium economy seat and benefits suits my space requirements though as many have said the seat bottoms are very hard and there is no recline. If you're awake the entire flight no problem but don't think of sleeping. I upgraded for an extra fee on the return. The seat is much more comfortable and softer but it is not a flat bed and doesn't allow for sleep. The food was even more creative and delicious up in business but the mid-flight ""buffet"" is paltry. Flight attendants are usually very polite and efficient and I've never had a problem with language. One small complaint I experienced this trip was that they tend to cater to and make over the French nationals while being slightly perfunctory with non-French passengers. This is a mixed review but really the flights are smooth food good connection easy at CDG and I am booked on two more premium economy flights from Japan to Europe this winter. One last comment the flights and seats on long haul flights in premium economy are unique. The intra-Europe flights are always a let down in terms of seats. They are the same exact seats as economy. The only benefit being that you get a nice meal/snack and are at the front of the plane.",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,2,4,5,3,NA,NA,4,1

All-in-all a fairly reasonable flight experience for the price although we did suffer a quite long delay on the return flight due to technical issues with the aircraft that needed to be sorted out. The cabin attendants were friendly and responsive both ways however there was insufficient water provided during the return flight which in a warmer than usual cabin was disappointing. The food was only fair to be honest but the wine pretty reasonable. My main issue was the ground staff and boarding process at MRU. A lack of updates on the delay and a temporary breakdown of the boarding card readers slowed things down even further.

I handed in my luggage at the international terminal in Mumbai but this was not on the flight. After numerous telephone calls the luggage arrived on 26. Flight from Delhi to Chandigarh took off despite the pilot telling us there would be little chance of the fog clearing which meant that we circled above Chandigarh 4 times before returning to Delhi. Chaos on arrival and were it not for 2 helpful passengers things could have been a nightmare as no onward transport had been planned. It eventually left in the form of a coach 2-3 hrs later.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,J Hutter,Germany,2013-09-09,BSL-CDG-IAD / JFK-CDG-BSL. The short legs on ATR 72 were nice solid. Quick round of drinks and choice of snack. Easy check in / boarding due to small plane and few passengers. Changing in CDG between 2E and 2G absolutely without a problem via airside shuttle bus and many signs. CDG-IAD on A380 with mixed results: Economy seats on upper deck are a plus when travelling as a couple - only 2 seats at window with nice little storage compartment between seat and window. Very good choice of films/music on IFE. However for an airplane of 2.5 years of age the interior looks like straight from the 90s: egg-shell-whiteish plastic and a smallish screen. The weirdest thing is that the screen is offset to the left to accommodate the remote control on the right. This makes for awkward angles of head/neck while watching films. Seats quite hard but enough leg room for me (6 ft 6). Crew very nice and open bar in the galleys throughout flight. Still do not understand the boarding process: They started boarding 40 minutes before departure despite 500+ passengers and a more thorough check due to flight to the US. Departure therefore almost an hour late. JFK-CDG in 10 year old 777-200 with the same seats/video screens/interior design. Crew very nice. They recognized me not fitting in my regular seat (albeit officially the same pitch in 380 and 772) so they moved me to bulkhead seats with lots of leg room. Seats very hard. Weird time of serving a good selection of (for airplane standards) good food: After a midnight takeoff they started serving a full dinner despite almost all passengers longing for sleep.

Brand new A330-200 (delivered 2013) serving Frankfurt - Windhoek route with relatively simple business seats (2 setting only meal/upright and lie flat) any other position in between could be adjusted by pressing continuously either one of these 2 functions. Leg part is for thigh support only as an extension for calf an ottoman is provided where shoes could be stored underneath. Simple and tidy without confusing buttons. Meals are served in very basic cutlery (on plastic tray) but the taste is surprisingly good (choices between meat/chicken and fish/seafood plus entree and dessert). Crew efficient and friendly without being pretentious. Luggage handling excellent with priority collection for business. Overall an Airline product that well represents Namibia: relax neat and tidy.

I especially like the option which allowed me to raise the seat front to support my calves. When dinner was served; my choice of chicken was quite good while my husbands choice of risotto was not good at all. Flight departed at 1.50 pm the lights were dimmed after dinner to enable passengers to get some rest. Attendants came through 3 or 4 times offering snacks and ice cream as well as additional drinks. The entertainment options were exactly the same offered on our previous flight. Once again we did not need the blankets so we sat on them which compensated for the hardness of the seats. My only complaint is the handling of our luggage. One of the advertised benefits of booking and paying for premium economy is to have your bags tagged priority’ which is supposed to insure prompt delivering upon arrival. As I stated our flight was an hour late departing therefore we only had 45 minutes to make our connection in Minnesota. We were traveling with friends who did not opt for premium economy. We both checked in at the same time. Upon arriving in Minnesota our bags which were tagged priority were definitely not delivered in a timely manner.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,David Killick,New Zealand,2015-05-31,"AKL-SIN in P/E. Overnight flight. Air NZ's P/E seats have varied over the past few years depending on aircraft type and routes. These former business-class-style leather seats are extremely comfortable. The only drawback is the footrest which is awkward. Main advantage in P/E is the legroom and space. Our view is that all seats should be like this. Economy cattle class now really is horrible. Air NZ's business class is superb but so much pricier. P/E is well worth the extra cost. If you are hesitating just try it. How nice to have a personal ""Kia ora"" message on your screen. Air NZ's safety video remains hmm quirky though some passengers now find it a little OTT and are fed up with the continued hyping of the Lord of the Rings movies. IFE was only adequate and offerings could have been more comprehensive. Food was excellent. It did seem unnecessary for the FAs to have to make two separate trips to serve up appetizers and main courses when one excursion would have sufficed. Not really a fan of overnight flights if arriving early in the morning (not the case if flying the other direction) as you have to wait hours to get into your hotel.

It's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into the design of the premium economy seats. There is a lot to like particularly the legroom the extra bits of storage space and general layout of the seats. Where they fail is with the reclining system. It allows you to incline your lower body but what's needed to place people for sleep is a facility to lower your head. In that respect the traditional tilt-back seats were vastly better despite the problems they can cause for other passengers who don't want to sleep. By airline standards food and drink were excellent on all four legs. Service too was great but why can't drinks as well as small pieces of food be left out for pickup between meal services? The entertainment system was OK but lacking in recent blockbuster movies. I was glad I paid the extra for premium economy but found it very hard to sleep in these upright pod seats.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,3,5,5,3,NA,NA,4,1

Seats were great and I had plenty of leg room (I am 6'5"") I had an exit seat thinking there would be more but they were all the same on the A320.

Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles.

My primary complaint is about the terribly long lines for check-in at Raro for the Saturday night departure to LAX. The check-in counter is outside in a warm and humid climate and there are only 3 or 4 people working to serve scores of passengers and handle their baggage. We stood in line for over 1.5 hours even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of departure. There's obviously poor management for a process that occurs once per week and seemingly could easily be remedied by having a couple of more persons on staff for this check-in installation of some kiosks a faster computer system and some fans outside of the counter area.

Dinner was a reasonable fish dish and breakfast was poached eggs which were heated sufficiently and not too much. Wine drinks services always very good.

Our options were a non-stop flight with Air Transat or a three leg flight (Toronto-Munich-Lisbon-Faro) with Air Canada. Air Transat cost about $300 each more than AC for economy class. Its planes are all more than 20 years old and this route uses the original seating mainly 3-3-3 in a plane designed for 2-4-2. Leg room is less than AC and seat width much tighter. Food was the worst we have had seen since flying American to California. On the return flight the attendants repeatedly walked the aisles imploring passengers to take the inedible mini-pizzas! YYZ-FAO: arrived early and were invited by the friendly agent to switch from row 28 to bulkhead seats! We chose right side which has half curtains rather than a fixed bulkhead and I was able to stretch my legs out in front of me (I'm 183 cm mainly legs) no extra charge! Unfortunately the 3-3-3 seating does not give enough room for the food carts to pass the fixed bulkhead without slamming them repeatedly against it and forcing through an exercise which was repeated throughout the flight and drove our aisle passenger to find another seat after a few episodes. Overhead screen was directly above our heads so we were unable to see anything. Five music channels with volume settings too low to hear or too high to listen bring your own entertainment. Two rear and one mid cabin toilet for about 240 people is way below what is needed on 6-8 hour flights. Cabin crew were efficient but not overly communicative and not very visible after the meal service was over. The flight left about 20 minutes late but arrived almost one hour early so we had to wait for Ryanair to vacate an arrivals slot at FAO. Return flight was almost 2 hours longer in row 26 middle a claustrophobic experience when the seats in front were slammed back for sleeping. The small overhead screens were showing an animated feature to an audience of snowbirds averaging probably 65years old great program planning. Overhead storage is very limited and too many passengers are permitted to bring oversized luggage causing much frustration for later arrivals. Overall these out-dated aircraft need to be replaced with modern equipment for overseas flights but apparently the once a week flights to Portugal have no competitors so Air Transat can charge higher prices for less comfort and an inferior flight experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,3,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2013-09-18,AKL-LAX-LHR in premium economy on Boeing 777-300 with the relatively new Spaceseats. I have flown NZ many times in long haul but this was my first trip in the new Spaceseats and I was pleasantly surprised. On the first leg I was in the front row seat 23A (window) and 30E (middle section aisle) and found the seats private comfortable and with a great deal of width that surpasses any other premium economy on the market (this is a 2-2-2 configuration where other airlines have 2-4-2 in this class). The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ). It shows other airlines what premium economy can be like although I'll admit the fare reflected this.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,3,1

airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,Bruce McLaughlin,Australia,2014-08-28,SYD-KUL-PVG 23 August 2014. I chose Air Asia X because I wanted a multi-destination itinerary rather than a return flight and the budget airlines (Air Asia to China and Scoot back to Australia) were a much better deal than a legacy airline open-jaw fare. It was a great experience. Check-in at Sydney was quick and easy: the queue was less than 15 minutes and the check-in person was friendly and efficient. Transfer check-in at KLIA2 had no queue at all. I used OptionTown to try to get a row of three seats to myself for the SYD-KUL leg and an upgrade to Business for KUL-PVG. I got both. The row to myself from SYD-KUL cost about A$ 30 I think and the business upgrade from KUL-PVG cost about A$ 50. Both were a bargain. In economy for SYD-KUL there was more legroom than I've had on many legacy airlines. The seat was comfortable - it was fairly soft leather. It was even more comfortable with three seats to myself. Food - biryani - was excellent and good value. For KUL-SYD the business class seat was amazingly comfortable and folded almost flat: I could sleep comfortably lying on my side. On both legs FAs were friendly efficient and unobtrusive: they did an excellent job. One tip for people flying out of Sydney or Melbourne. You may be tempted as I was to buy drinks from a vending machine on airside so that you don't have to buy drinks onboard. Don't. A bottled soft drink at the airport is A$4; cans that you buy on board are RM6 which is much cheaper. The airline's only shortcoming is that you don't have IFE (although you can rent a tablet). But if you bring your own pre-loaded tablet that doesn't matter. I'll certainly fly Air Asia X in future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,1,NA,NA,5,1
airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,D Lee,Singapore,2014-09-06,AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing. AirAsia is ok for the price will consider using them again for flights to and from Malaysia.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

I had booked my tickets via an online booking agency so was dismayed to be informed on checking in at TLL that I would be charged a supplementary fee. Fearing that this would be a swoon-inducing off-the-scale penalty as imposed by certain budget airlines I was relieved that the charge was only EUR 10. Furthermore I was advised I could upgrade to an extra comfort seat with no-one next to me this for another EUR 20. Done deal off I went happy - only to discover that the flight was only one-third full and we all had ample space. Two days later at RIX I presented myself at the ticket sales desk to request payment of the check-in supplement only to be directed to a self-check-in machine at zero extra cost.

Meals were good (I was on Works which includes meal seat bag) when I went for the full meal deal. Cabin crew are a different story. These are disproportionately young (based on the equipment they're recent hires) with good intentions but not quite there. On one flight a passenger dumped his entire scotch and coke on me and the FA was too ""chilled"" in getting something to clean it up. Reeking of booze was not how I intended to arrive at my destination. Only an hour later I was offered a complimentary drink for my troubles. On another journey my seat light didn't work; the row in front had no IFE. We were all moved to new seats and required to move back for landing.

There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor.

By all counts it was excellent and would definitely use this class of service again! The seats were comfortable the service and meals were excellent too! On our return flight we flew on the 747 in premium economy - older style - seats 22 H/K. We enjoy the fact that these seats are on the upper level of the 747. These seats are more like standard seats and not as comfortable as the 777 seats. We had room to spread out with no seats directly in front of us. Unfortunately the service was poor during this flight. The FA mentioned that they were missing a staff member for this flight.

On board staff are generally helpful. Customer Service could be better especially at check in in Riga - often long queues that merge into one - airport check in area is rather small and often the queue is out of the door so it pays to arrive earlier. Airport airside is pretty good now with the addition of new shops. I generally travel the London/Riga/London route which is nearly always full. Tend to be expensive at times - out of season usually the better deal. At least assigned seats - unlike the free for all on Ryanair in which case if you are not Latvian or Russian you will not win because they are queuing for plane 30 mins before boarding starts - look out for the passengers who stand up immediately the wheels touch the runway preparing to get off - it always amuses me.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

air-transat,/airline-reviews/air-transat,Air Transat customer review,S Williams,Canada,2013-10-22,I flew one way from London Gatwick to Toronto in October 2013. The reason for choosing Air Transat was simply cost - other airlines are not interested in selling one-way fares. Only Air Transat and Icelandair offer reasonable prices for one-way trips and only Air Transat is non-stop. Both Air Canada and British Airways wanted about $1900 from London Heathrow to Toronto whereas Air Transat (from Gatwick) was under $500. The check-in agent at Gatwick was rude but she was the only employee I could possibly say anything negative about and since all other staff went out of their way to be positive I will just ignore this one bad apple. The flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful as were the people at the gate. The flight left and arrived on time to the minute. Food was - well let's just say no worse than any other airline. I think the legroom was a bit better than some others. My luggage was on the carousel by the time I got through immigration. There truly is nothing to complain about. The particular plane that I was on did not have seat-back video but instead had the older style screens with their choice of movies. I brought a book to read so did not really even watch this. Really with all the negative experiences I have become accustomed to when flying I must say that this flight (my first flight with Air Transat) was a rare positive.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1
airnorth,/airline-reviews/airnorth,Airnorth customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-07-15,I have to put in some severe criticism of Airnorth's customer service during the ash cloud disruption in June. My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway. However they really can't handle anything unusual and given their monopoly on many routes they probably won't bother to improve.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

Return flight was on their new 3x3x3 configuration which was like flying in a sardine tin. Did not get the extra leg room seats we had ordered and paid for the new configuration makes it impossible to get any sleep on night flights the aisles are so narrow that passing passengers stewards and trolleys bump into you all the time. This is the only overnight transatlantic flight I have ever taken where you need to buy or bring your own blanket! This is taking penny pinching to a whole new level. Food was edible but not a lot of it so if your planning to fly Transat take your own food with you avoid night flights and don't forget your own blanket shin and elbow guards!

While theoretically we had more legroom being by the emergency exit that space was virtually permanently occupied by the queue for the loo so far from being able to stretch out my long legs I was claustrophobically hemmed in. Add to that it was the narrowest airline seat I've tried to fit in and I may be tall but I'm not wide.

My pre- order of Pak Nasser's Nasi Lemak was excellent perhaps the only great point about the entire journey.

Not only was the service awful but the plane hadn't seen proper cleaning and service since the 90s. I flew the same aircraft 4 days apart and the lav didn't work coming or going. I cannot understand how it is possible.

The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane.

One first class line which is really 2 lines that mould into one. We stood for 20 minutes as the line grew longer. Whoever designed this lobby should be forced to deal with it on a busy day. When we finally got to the clerk he was surly if not down right rude. He did not speak two words to us. Off to the ""new"" first class lounge. Small cramped dark. Good bar but the small selection of food looked old and un-appealing. I certainly would not pay to get in. Indifferent staff. Boarding was quick and easy. However after it was announced the rear door had been ""armed"" the crew allowed a first class passenger off the plane to purchase an upgraded ticket for his grandson. So we all sat and waited at least ten minutes for him. Inflight the flight attendants on both trips were excellent: attentive friendly helpful. Nice folks. The food? On the way down a limp salad with what I think were chicken strips and a raspberry soda pop for dressing. On the way back inedible pesto chicken. Absolutely unacceptable for the price of a first class ticket. At MZT it took 35 minutes for our baggage to hit the belt.

I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this.

So travelled from Florence to Bucharest via Rome on 31 July 2014. It is a 1.5hr flight that was delayed by about 30-45 minutes but there was no acknowledgement or announcement of the delay. Transiting through Rome itself is a case study in how not to organise an airport for transit and boarding the flight was a nightmare. No priority for families or business no possibility to upgrade to business with miles from the alliance even though the business class was completely empty (meaning not one seat was taken). On the flight itself food was very poor and the cabin staff just disappeared. There were no sick bags in the seats and the staff did not answer the call button at all - too busy chatting in the empty business class - and then spent 10 minutes looking for sick bags. Also no announcement for landing or beginning of landing. In fact no pilot communication whatsoever after taking off. And as we got to our destination in Bucharest our checked in bag was lost and apparently many other people on the flight who transited via Rome had the same problem so long queue at the Claim section.

Had a very noisy rugby team flying to London along with us whose antics added to my woes. As a vegetarian I got the exact same tasteless bland food while going and coming back. When I checked in at Gatwick for my return flight the lady at the counter surprised me by saying that only 5 kg of baggage was allowed as a handbag and that my shoulder bag now counted as an extra cabin baggage - a clear ploy to earn extra money. So my total cabin baggage now weighed in excess of 5 kg. So what did I do. I took out my jacket and put it on took out my e- reader and lo behold - my baggage now weighed less than 5 kg. So I was let in without paying any extra.

Flight itself was fine although it was a confusing route march to get to the aircraft. Also having a flight to Chennai at roughly the same time seemed to confuse some passenger. Reasonable cabin crew. I ordered meals in advance and they were onboard although I was listed as a 'no-show' on the manifest.

The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore!

Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around.

Got there as the door was closing. Turns out that didn't matter, because there was an issue with this plane too. Apparently, one seat was not functioning.

The woman was smiling and very friendly and handled our suitcases well. Boarding a Fiumicino was 10 minutes late. It was great to see that Alitalia brings a brand new A330 to Boston. Luckily there was inflight entertainment on the flight unlike in the past. It worked very well and was a new touch screen. Sometimes the system froze but most times during the flight worked well. We had an all male cabin crew. They did really well and were always considerate and kind. The food was pretty good but average for economy class food. The seat in front of me was pushed far back and the entertainment screen was in my face for a few hours of the flight. The landing in Boston was great.

Flight delayed nearly 4 hours with no explanation. We went through a secondary security check so water purchased after primary security was confiscated. I should be grateful that AA takes security seriously but several people came through that check with water not found by the baggage checkers. The cabin crew were rude, unfriendly and very unapproachable especially when we needed water. There were passengers in the front seats who we assumed were airline employees.

We flew premium economy so we would have a bit of extra space and I would definitely recommend it. While the cost was a bit higher than on other airlines it allowed me to sleep through much of the flight. Upon arrival our bags were available as soon as we made our way to the baggage claim area after we went through passport control. Our return flight was equally smooth departing Rome on time at 11am and arriving in Boston a bit early at 2pm. Upon arrival in Boston our bags showed up in a timely fashion and all was good. Meals served on both flights both main mean and a snack near to arrival and while none of the food was great I don't expect a significant dining experience in flight so again I was not disappointed.

It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day.

The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines.

One ticketing agent said it was weather but the weather was clear where the flight was coming from so I asked another agent and she said they didn't have enough crew. We were packed in that small airport like sardines with kids screaming people yelling not enough seats for people to sit in. They cancelled some of the other flights but finally got another plane and crew that came from Fort Lauderdale for my flight. Six hours after arriving at the airport we finally left.

Service onboard very professional with an excellent hot snack (omelette and salmon) for a duration of 2.5h. Transfer at Rome Fiumicino painless using fast track lane and the airport has lots of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia Giotto lounge was packed but the drinks selection was fine as well as the variety of sandwiches. Boarding A330 to Rio quick using Sky Priority lane. The aircraft had the new Magnifica Class with a 1-2-1 configuration. It was half full. Plenty of space in overhead lockers however if you seat in the middle there are none and have to use the ones on the side. Pre-taking off drinks given great selection of appetizers and the best moment was the food. Alitalia won best Airline Food recently and I was very much looking forward to it. Succulent Beef with Roasted Mediterranean vegetables as main course and for dessert a light unctuous Neapolitan Almond Cake. A 5 stars food and the espresso is served in a very beautiful cup and lid. The IFE had a good variety of recent movies but I thought the international selection was lacking. They have Flat beds (Only Skyteam airline in Europe to have these) and managed a good 7h sleep with a very comfortable duvet. The amenities given were a Bulgari bag with lots of toiletries products very much appreciated and high class. Staff very professional smiling and very happy to go for the extra mile for the customers. Breakfast consisted of a selection of Italian pastries and cakes with fresh fruits excellent! On the return leg Alitalia uses Air France/KLM lounge that can be cramped at times but it has great selection of hot snacks (the palm tree heart quiches are gorgeous). Boarding the A330 was painless again and the Magnifica class was full this time. Despite taking off 1h later we managed to catch up 30 minutes. The amenities given was another Bulgari bag and the best highlight was the food again with Pork Milanese as main course. Slept a good 7hours and had a copious breakfast before landing in Rome. The A321 to London was on time and service very good again. Overall a good value for money their new Magnifica class is an excellent product their Flat beds very comfortable and it's the Best Food I've ever had on an airline.

I had checked in online prior to arriving at the airport so that all I would have to do was drop my bags. I was herded into a pen with hundreds of other Allegiant travelers and subjected to an Allegiant Airline agent who took great joy in yelling at everyone to check-in online so that they could be fast-tracked to a different holding pen. Many of us tried to explain that we had already done so prior to arriving at the airport - but it was to no avail. Eventually (25 mins later) we were divided into two lines. One for those of us who had checked in online and one for travelers who had not. Standing in this new line the same agent began yelling for travelers who were supposed to be going to various destinations - supposedly in order of departure time. Those travelers were fast- tracked to the front of the online check-in line regardless of whether they had actually checked-in online or not. Even though some of those travelers were ""fast-tracked"" - many missed their flights. I ended up playing dumb and getting in line with some people who were leaving on a flight that was scheduled to depart before mine - just so that I would not miss my flight too. When I got to the counter the agent I dealt with lectured me for being late and wrote ""late"" all over my boarding pass and bag tag. I ran to security and then on to my gate just to make it in time. I have no idea how many missed the flight. Next time I fly - I will be looking at all other airline options before I even consider Allegiant.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,0,0,NA,NA,2,0

Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered.

For the first leg of this trip the plane was operated by IBEX and arrived on schedule. I have bad knees so I need assistance. It was offered each time. Plane to Frankfurt was a 777-300 and the flight attendant greeted me by my seat number: 24C. Service was excellent and the AVOD superb. Food was reasonable. For the changeover I had a courier who took me straight through passport control to the gate. Without this assistance I would not have made the connection. Flight to Amsterdam operated by Lufthansa and the difference was rather obvious. Nevertheless food and drink were served on the 50-minute flight. On the return trip the Lufthansa flight to Munich took off late and I was concerned about the connection. I was taken to the ANA plane by car and made the connection without difficulty. Departure delayed 2 hours however while the plane was de-iced and it was here that the superb ANA service was slightly lacking: given relatively little information. After takeoff the flight was good but again I was not told about the arrangements for assistance at Narita. 777-300 arrived well behind schedule and I missed the connection to Hiroshima. I was given a bus ticket to Haneda hotel accommodation next to Terminal 2 and had been booked on the first flight to Hiroshima the following day.

Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice. The international crew in First save for one employee were polite but simply went through the motions. The food was decent.

I was confirmed in Main Cabin Extra. Miami has always been a ""challenging"" airport but not having been there in over a decade it was a whole new challenge. My bag was 5 lbs overweight so I had to go buy a small personal carry item and remove 5 lbs from my bag. Needless to say a huge hassle. Since I checked in so early American did not offer to put me on one of the several flight before mine but they certainly did send my bag early as it was already in this huge mire when I arrived in Orlando. The security situation in Miami is a nightmare. Once finally through the drama the new terminal AA built was nice with allot more choices of things to do but it seemed gate after gate I passed no one cleaned up the trash left by the customers. Flight boarded on time I asked for some tissue got it promptly then only saw the Flight attendants during seat belt check before and take off and landing.

Transfers were one of the easiest we've experienced especially on the return flights. London ground agents booked our seats not just to Seoul but Sydney as well, and our bags were automatically transferred by the airline to our Sydney plane as there was no layover. This gave us more time to relax in the lounge. Onboard experience was fantastic. Three out of the four legs had excellent flat beds and only the Sydney to Seoul leg had angled seats which were great for a day flight but I'd question its comfort overnight. What was truly memorable was the gracious and respectful cabin service on every single flight. The crew seemed like they weren't just great attendants but great people in general.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Johnson,United States,2014-01-17,Currently flying from Boston to Austin (via Dallas) on AA. Flights have been on time and aircraft condition is not bad. However we are flying with our 3 year old twins who are actually very good travelers and have found that AA is not family friendly at all. They do not offer any pre boarding for families with small children. We travel with carseats for the kids because we find that this keeps them calm and contained throughout the flight a benefit for all on board but this takes a few minutes for us to put into the seats when we get on the plane and is incredibly difficult to do with many other travelers simultaneously boarding. So when they oddly did not call families for pre boarding on this flight we went up to the front during one of the many other pre boarding categories (carrying our carseats and our tired kids walking) and asked if we could pre board. We were told that we could not that others had paid for this service and we would have to wait on the side. We waited as instructed and when we got on we found that most of the plane had somehow already boarded and it was extremely difficult to get set up. We got no offers of help from any staff members. This is the least family friendly airline we have ever flown hope we won't ever have to fly it again - we fly a lot even with the kids will try to avoid AA in the future.

Inflight entertainment system did not work (no sound). When I called the stewardess she just said (in limited English) that there was nothing she could do and walked off. Was told that as the economy class section of the flight was full there was nothing they could do and I would have to spend the (11 hour) flight reading or sleeping. When the passenger next to me complained that I had my reading light on (it was a night flight) the stewardess told me that I had to turn it off! As a paying passenger I feel that it is totally unacceptable that the entertainment system does not work in the first place never mind staff being unwilling to do anything about it. 12th January ICN to LHR. Sat in seat 26G - and again the inflight entertainment system for my seat does not work. Staff tried rebooting it 5 times but that did not work. Even though there were spare seats in travel class staff would not let me move as it would mean moving to a centre seat from an aisle seat. So 12 hours in a plane without any working in flight entertainment. Again an utter lack of maintenance or customer care from Asiana. I had further problems with the meals on these flights - on the ICN- SYD flight my main course was served cold it took staff 20 minutes to find a new one. I had a similar problem on the ICN-LHR. Because row 26 was the last row in that service round the western food choice was gone. I had to wait 20 minutes whilst staff waited to see if there was one from another trolley available. Now I accept that meal choices may not be available but by the time I was given mine it was cold. It was reheated. It was still cold. A new one was found (45 minutes after I should have been served) - again cold.

F&B offering ok but always picked within 2 minutes. AV says they provide you with Food in the Lounge so they dont provide any food onboard not even in C Class. Not even a pack of peanuts!

You come off the DLR down to the check in desk. Because we were flying Club Europe we were able to the use the dedicated check in desk so that was quick. Security was very quick and friendly. They seem to have even more security zones than my last trip. No lounges at LCY. Boarding was on time but no priority for CE pax or OW elites. However given as they board from the back and front of the plane it didn't mater. On board the 2 crew worked hard delivering the breakfast meals out to a full plane load. Nice product but the eggs were are bit crumbly. Arrived on time but bags took a while to come out with no priority. Return journey from BCN was good. Check in a breeze. Sala Miro lounge to wait in but being on the cusp of lunch there wasn't much in the way of fresh food about. Boarding was done by cabin/status. Not as full as before - 6 in CE only. Both meal options were salads ie fish or meat on rocket with some other little bits. Could have done with more leaves and some vegetables! Dessert was some cream concoction imitating an Eton mess. The crew were good and even offered their meal to a pax that didn't fancy the options. Bags at City came out in some order ie some priority bags then standard then a few more priority.

I had expected my bags to be tagged all the way through to my final destination but was very surprised to also get my onward boarding passes for my flights with QR. I use PG frequently and was surprised to find that the flight was about 1 hour late. A member of the PG staff personally spoke to every passenger with an onward connection to ensure that they still had enough time and he promised that we would be met on arrival at BKK. And indeed we were. The half dozen or so transiting passengers were put on in a minivan which took us to the security check thus avoiding a 3 mile hike. Reason for the delay? Late arrival of incoming aircraft. Once onboard there was little apology for the delay and still no reason given. Standard PG snack which is fine after an hour in their lounge at CNX airport. Thanks to the arrangements made for our arrival at BKK I still had plenty of time to board the ongoing flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

As the only carrier serving Siem Reap from Bangkok you don't have much choice. Service is an ATR72 or A320. The food is ok for such a short flight it's nice to have something to eat and drink. Beer is available so no complaints there! IFE depends on your aircraft but pretty basic. One important point I'd like to mention is that in certain airports there is a lounge for all passengers. One general lounge for economy and one of course for business. Not much mention is made for economy passengers but in here you get free food and drink wifi and a much more comfortable place to rest before (and after) your flight.

People in front had problems with excess overweight baggage children or groups trying to sit together. Eventually get to the desk and have my printed out boarding passes replaced with proper ones! Not much open at Heathrow and was worried about food onboard. At T1 the first shop you see open is a Costa and its likely to have a long queue. Walk deeper into the terminal and there is a Pret that was also open with no queue. Gate was miles away. Boarding was slightly later than anticipated but handled by rows. Comfortable seating onboard. Once airborne there is a drink run and food service - a hot egg cheese and tomato panini which would rank as one of the most tasteless meals I've had on an airline. Given that this was a 2 hr breakfast flight more could have been provided. I remember flying BMI from LHR to AMS and they served a full hot breakfast in 45m of flying time. Here there wasn't even a second drinks run. The crew seemed intent on clearing up before most people had even finished their breakfast! Crew were fairly robotic.

As a BA Silver card holder, I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31"" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level.

I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. Cabin Crew were fine, but lack warmth of some other Airlines. Sadly there aren't any other options on this route, so will probably be switching back to rail, despite sometimes competitive fares.",A320,Solo Leisure,First Class,LHR to NCL,3,3,3,3,NA,1,NA,3,0

It started out with an overbooked flight from Oslo and an advice that one of us would have to stay behind. Only after reminding the ground crew that Luanda is an not an easy destination to reach, that we had confirmed tickets and that we hold Star Alliance did we get on board. The flight from Brussels to Luanda was just not good. The cabin looks and feels fresh and clean, food is acceptable but there end the positive comments. The seats are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that's only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back.

I highly rate BA for families. On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1) To be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants. They have offered quiet areas during service (on the A380) to help settle our baby. Left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) Friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. Crew are not servants to passengers. They have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but I find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak times. They are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. It figures. I am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach Silver tier on an annual basis. Having BC check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. The greatest perk is that as Silver I get 2 bags at 32kg each. Not only that but when I travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as I do and our infant gets 23kg bag. Plus car seats and pram free. That is a huge allowance and makes packing less stressful. BA are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, I have no issues with them and find them value for money.

Onboard there is complementary food - in the morning a rather bland cheese roll and a pain au chocolat in the afternoon it was two sandwiches and a cake.

At the check-in the airline had moved another passenger to their seat preference which resulted in my partner and I not being sat together despite the same Business Class booking. Once on board the old B737 was rather dated and there was no separation between Business and Economy. It felt like being on a Ryanair flight with a clear view down to the back of the plane. The only sign of separation was a small label a few seats back which said B.Flex class (Economy) starts here. The seats were standard Economy in 3x3 configuration. There was no attempt to at least relocate the armrests to use up the middle seat and provide a wider seat. The legroom was decent but it still felt tight. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and made up a bit for the disappointing check-in service and seating. Arrival into Brussels was fine. Though we had to wait about 10-15 mins for out bags to arrive after the first bag appeared on the carousel. This was once again frustrating as Business Class bags should get higher priority and were labelled with this sticker in Barcelona airport.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,M Cooper,United States,2015-03-04,British Airways general onboard services in First are generally acceptable. However the airline refuses to acknowledge that premium ground services should be added for paid First class passengers. Ground services such as special assistance for transfers that are so widely available on other carriers for their First class passengers are sorely lacking at BA (ex. Lufthansa First Class terminal and transfers at FRA and others). Even as a Gold Executive Club top tier member there is nothing available - even when I call and request assistance on long-haul First flights (ex. LHR to HKG) that involve changes in planes between T3 and T5 at LHR. BA needs to wake up and examine the overall First product. The upgrades to the First cabin are also marginal. Packing 14 narrow (even on new A380s) seats in First puts the airline at a huge disadvantage to other OneWorld carriers who have a true First product (ex. Cathay has 8 true suites in First). Wake up BA - your premium fare paying customers are irate over this lack of First product amenities including full ground support (especially upon special request) for paying First passengers.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,5,2,4,4,3,NA,NA,3,0

On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat.

I flew them BFS-SOF-BFS in February and it was the most horrible flight I have ever been on. The space between the seats is nothing and I sat the 3+ hour flight with my knees jammed to the seat in front. The flight attendants were rude and kept obsessing over the stupid curtain between business and economy (there was no difference on this flight as it was a charter) and only did half the safety briefing on the outbound. The heat on the plane was unbearable and any time you asked for a drink of water the flight attendants would acknowledge your request but made no effort at all to fulfil it. Another person in my group went to the galley himself to get a drink after having asked the flight attendants several times. The flight attendants could barely crack a smile and they only time they spoke was to give an unenthusiastic hello as we were boarding or to stand in the aisle and wave their hands about while complaining about the amount of children in the aisle. The plane had no Bulgaria Air titles on it or anything to suggest that it was the country's national airline. While it was a new A320 and very quiet I found the seat layout ridiculous.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,M Gibson,United Kingdom,2015-01-19,San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Flew Manchester to LAX via Heathrow on Christmas day in Club World on the A380. Check in and boarding were extremely smooth at Manchester and the lounge was also quiet due to the fact it was a holiday.Upon arrival LHR was much busier so much so that we struggled to find a seat in the south lounge. When it came time to board the aircraft it was quite frankly carnage. There didn't seem to be any real system and we had to fight through the crowds just to be able to get in the (long) line for Club passengers. The downside of such a big aircraft is the number of passengers even in Club world. Once on board it was a fairly standard offering Club World on BA is pretty consistent across all aircraft I now find. Seat and service were all fine not exceptional but acceptable. My one main gripe us that we were seated on the lower deck (seats 13A and 13B) and on our side of the plane there was only one tiny bathroom which often led to a line. The other side of the aircraft had two bathrooms but getting to them meant going all the way round the galley kitchen and cabin staff in there were often busy working or just hanging out and it seemed that they weren't too keen on being disturbed. Whilst there's no doubt the A380 is a quieter aircraft I feel its size and the number of passengers takes something away from the level of service which you'd expect to be high given the price paid for Club World tickets.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,2,4,5,NA,NA,3,1
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,David Ellis,United Kingdom,2015-01-11,LHR-JNB-CPT. Upper deck on A380. 2x3x2 arrangement far from ideal for the trio in the middle although dividing up the club world cabin helps. Seats otherwise identical to usual BA business class. Window seats are best because of lockers at the side. Take-off remarkably quiet and smooth. Dinner service quick - in marked contrast to recent Emirates flight on A380. Food actually very good including a main course salad with 'warmed salmon' which was as good as in any restaurant. Slow disembarkation at JNB. Huge confusion about whether luggage had to be retrieved and re-checked in (check in at LHR informed us it was ticketed all the way to our final destination) and where we had to go for domestic transfer. Eventually arrived in excellent SLOW lounge 45 mins after leaving plane. 2 hr flight on 737 to CPT uneventful and quick baggage retrieval.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

Flight was on an old Boeing 767 - the seating was a bit too firm and not very comfortable. This seat was an exit row so leg room was superb. Gets a little cold here but OK for a flight of this duration. No personal video on demand just old overhead screen system so next to useless. They replace the seats but not the entertainment system and on a flight like this of over four hours it should be better. Food was pretty good with a choice of salad or hot meal with the usual free beverages. Cabin crew were OK nothing special and we never got a pass by the duty free either for some reason they missed out rows 27J/K towards the back. Flight crew gave good flight information and updates.

My flight from Benghasi (domestic) to Tripoli (domestic) was easy to purchase in town (not on Sabre or Galilleo unfortunately) and was just $38 one way. The domestic airport is nothing to write home about but is clean and Benghasians are very friendly with smiles all round. This flight operated with a rather long-in-the-tooth 737-200 you know the ones with long cigar-shaped engines but was clean and the cabin crew were well polite engaging and presented themselves in smart uniforms smiles all round again.

Dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating.

We booked our original flights on WTP on the A380 and B777 both fitted with the revamped World Traveller Plus - far more comfortable than the old style WTP with an infinitely better IFE system. So guess how pleased I was when BA changed the aircraft on both flights to the now very aged and decrepit B747's with the old style WTP. The 747's really should be pensioned off and replaced with A380's - they are old grimy and falling to pieces. Our B747 was filthy. The catering on the way out to Washington was not too bad - a half decent fillet steak. On the way back beef again but nowhere near as nice and a truly horrible pathetic cold hard croissant and jam that passed for breakfast. Inedible and disgraceful. Good grief BA can't you even pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds? The good points: both flights were on time and the FA's were OK. That's it. This would almost be acceptable except for the final insult - charging for choosing your seat after confirmation of the flight. This is cheap nickel and dime low cost airline stuff and not what you should expect from the nation's flag bearing airline. No other major airline that I regularly use does this - not even small ones like Bangkok Airlines or United Express. It is shameful - even our American friends who flew BA back to Chicago were dumbfounded. You expect it on Ryanair or other low cost outfits but this really shouldn't happen on your national airline.

From the moment you make your reservation you actually feel like every employee you come into contact with cares about you. Granted the planes are small - no inflight services since most of the flights are so short but you feel important. Earlier this summer I experienced weather related delays and the gate staff at the Provincetown airport sent out for pizza to feed us on the ground while we waited for clearance to take off.

Having travelled this route several times with Singapore Airlines I was interested to see what BA had to offer. Bad move - in fact a monstrously expensive bad move. Unimaginative and largely tasteless meals - the so-called English breakfast looked like it was thrown together by some greasy spoon in downtown Singapore. Trays not cleared away for a very long period of time (ploy to keep passengers in their seats?) no offer of a second cup of coffee/tea disappearance of cabin staff for much of the flight once the meals had been got out of the way (odd since there were loads around during boarding) - so for vast swathes of time passengers were left to their own devices to obtain water - many went off into the darkness in search of refreshment. Peremptory and insincere attention from cabin staff when they did show up - one had the sense that they wanted to get any kind of interaction over with as rapidly as possible so they could disappear again. IFE not at all user-friendly - the touchscreen didn't like to be touched and the range of films/programmes was limited and tired. BA should use some of the money from their exorbitant fares to send someone on a Singapore Airlines flight to learn how this service should actually be operated.

Both planes spotlessly clean. Bags on the belt at HKG soon after clearing immigration. Stress-free in-town check-in as always at Hong Kong Station. My only criticisms are: the seats are better suited to short-haul not the 9-10 hours needed for the DOH-HKG sector the food isn't Asian enough and they make everyone close the shades for most of the flight - but the latter is just a personal issue and I know some may prefer it this way.

Although the IFE is rather dated in comparison to the entertainment on BA's newer planes the audio quality was much better on this particular aircraft. Cabin crew were professional and polite and most importantly I was able to get about 3-4 hours of sleep! Connection in Heathrow was a bit of a nightmare since security seems to be constantly saturated and we had to be bussed from the 767.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,James Halley,China,2014-07-17,Recently flew return HKG-YVR on CX888/889 combo. Missed the cheaper fares on Chinese carriers so elected to fly Cathay instead of Air Canada. Early morning departures from both ends but earlier flights were more expensive. Flights were very good but more comfortable on the return as we managed to get the back row of the 777 (row 72 a and c no middle seat). That row had more legroom too and being near the toilet/galley wasn't an issue. Food seemed above average for economy class fare but I do wish CX would offer drinks before serving the meal. I wanted a G+T but not with my meal! Entertainment system whilst not up to Emirates standard was more than adequate even for a flight of over 12 hours. Snacks available in the galley between meals if peckish. Was surprised that economy class had so few toilets one of which was very narrow indeed. Flights arrived on time. Cabin crew professional as one would expect from CX. Baggage very slow on arrival at HKG but not the airline's fault.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

The first time I have flown with Cathay Pacific and it won't be the last. Excellent service throughout. Flew outward premium economy and flew back with business class. Aircraft was clean and tidy but the cabin crew were the stars of the show very attentive and pleasant without being too enthusiastic if you know what I mean. The food was excellent in both in premium economy and business class but business class certainly has the edge with the comfort and privacy. My wife doesn't normally sleep well when travelling in aircraft however the fully reclining seat was a great bonus which allowed her to get a few hours of good sleep. In comparison with other airlines I have travelled with the service that Cathay Pacific provides gives it that little bit extra.

Check-in both ways was efficient and friendly. Qantas business lounge in Brisbane was not very good with limited selection of food and unfortunately did not have a chance to sample CX's many lounges in HK. On board the flight staff were friendly and efficient - especially the customer service managers on both flights. Service from other staff varied and whilst efficient some were not very proactive (though this is a very minor complaint). Food was of excellent quality and portions plentiful.

Cathay staff all over the place and did not direct passengers to correct queues especially after call to gate was issued late. Design of Hong Kong Airport doesn't help as queue snaked all the way to the next gate (and thankfully that gate was not open otherwise it would have been a complete mess). Flight departed 20 minutes late. I think Cathay's on ground service at their hub can be so much better if there's better co-ordination between Cathay and HKIA. Anyway once on board the service was much better. Attentive cabin crew served drinks promptly after takeoff and decent early dinner was served one hour into the flight.

Service was excellent all round - champagne and juices before take off and supper service was prompt. Aircraft was an A330 with new regional product I believe. The seats were lovely just what you need when your flight departs at 1am but alas could only take forty winks and not a proper night's rest especially during such a short flight.

Full load but crew proactively help pax to sit. Seat a bit narrow but still quite comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Food not good at all. No choice of hot meal just a chicken with rice and a strange gravy I hardly touched. Crew very friendly and IFE didn't use. Flight back HKG-NRT a few days later a a pretty new 777-300 with the shell seats I found quite spacious and comfortable there was no one sitting next to me so that helped. The male cabin crew attending my zone was friendly and engaging. This time you could opt for pork or pasta. I chose pasta and must say delicious together with a turkey salad which was very tasty.

CEB seems to attempt promoting people to spend more time at the airport. For our recent family trip MNL to LAO they first informed by email and even followed up by call that the flight departure time was 1.5hrs earlier than scheduled. Just to let us then wait for almost 2hrs at a very crowded gate for the departure with a short note that the airplane had not yet arrived. We certainly would have found a better use in MNL for those 2hrs instead of waiting at the airport. It seems CEB starts their implementation of new schedules with informing their customers but only some time later also telling to the pilots and airport about it - interesting approach. Funny enough once we arrived in LAO the crew even announced proudly we arrived as scheduled! On the return flight they seemed to attempt to make up for it by departing 10min ahead of schedule from LAO. Leaves me wondering why they have a schedule at all?,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,2,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

While seat pitch is restricted somehow the A320 felt more roomy than on UL. The 5J flight crew (all female as is often the case) were very pleasant and had manners unlike some on UL. The annoying Cebu Pacific game is repetitive and the prize of a small pouch hardly anything to rave about. In contrast there is quite a good selection of reasonably priced snacks while the pre-ordering of hot meals has become quite popular.

This trip was an eye-opener. Pu Dong airport has issues, however the only thing there that is within the control of China Eastern is the lounges.  They're pretty basic, and not of an international standard, or even close to what you might find in Singapore or Hong Kong. However rudimentary, they are still an escape from the over-crowded terminal 1 at PVG.  The PVG-ICN-PVG sectors were on the older angled-flat business seats, which were entirely fine for 90-minute sectors.  Full hot meals with two choices of main and a few wine choices were offered on both short sectors.  Again, quite satisfactory.  The English-language skills of the crew were not the same as those on the PVG-SYD sector, but one must remember that these were flights between China and Korea, and so it's entirely reasonable to expect that the crews will be best at communicating in Chinese and Korean.  Blankets, pillows and slippers were provided on the short sectors.  It's worth noting that the economy cabins were very full on the PVG-ICN-PVG flights, but business class was a ghost-town in both directions. Not so on the PVG-SYD sector, a ten-hour overnight sector on the A332 equipment designated as 33E, i.e. 6-abreast seating in business class, with 180-degree recline and a significantly larger entertainment screen, and two business-cabins separated by a galley.  There was only one empty seat of the 30 in the split cabin, the passengers were about half Chinese nationals and half Australian, with a couple of Europeans and a Canadian to boot. On boarding we were met by the Purser/Service manager, a young woman of Chinese heritage who spoke excellent English with a distinctively Australian accent. We were escorted to our seats and offered sparkling wine, orange juice (with pulp, not the overly-processed kind) or mineral water.  Soon after that, menus were presented.  The flight had a full dinner service, from which passengers could choose Chinese style with two choices of main course, or Western style, with two choices of main course.  Dinner was served course-by-course and there were no trolleys used for either drinks or food.  Table-cloths were used.  Breakfast choices were either Chinese or Western.  The wine-lists had a (real) Champagne, three reds and two whites, which in my opinion is entirely enough.  A decent selection of soft-drinks, waters and juices was also on offer.  Amenity kits (with Clarins products) were already at each seat. Dinner service began soon after takeoff, and soon after the closing of all the window-blinds (this was common to all the MU flights on this trip, and I found it both odd and a little irritating, however this is what the crew are trained to do!), after which pajamas and slippers were distributed. The seat reclined completely flat, the pajamas were soft cotton, and the duvet was soft and thick.  Interestingly, the cabin temperature was kept quite low on this flight, in contrast with other airlines from Asian countries who, in my experience, keep the cabin temperature warm enough to grow orchids in Iceland. I was woken hours later by the clinking of cutlery in the galley, and having returned from the spotless bathroom, was offered breakfast.  The dim sum were hot and tasty; everything on the tray was tasty.  Breakfast was offered as passengers woke, rather than throwing the lights on and insisting people wake-up because the trolley is coming.  Very civilised, and other airlines could learn a lot from this. We arrived in Sydney on time, and I must say that China Eastern was surprisingly good.  I didn't have sky-high expectations, but that was wrong. The English skills of the crew on the PVG-SYD sector ranged from very good to excellent, and the crew were attentive and very polite.  All in all, a positive experience on MU for a very very keen price.  I would gladly fly with them again in business class.",A330-200,Business,Business Class,PVG-ICN-PVG-SYD,8,4,5,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1

Flight departed on-time at 1pm but further delays resulted in arrival in Hong Kong 12 hours later at 1am. Delays were due to bad weather in Hong Kong leading to diverting flight to land in Guangzhou airport at 5.30pm. Cabin crew didn't notify passengers of the diversion until plane was about to land at Guangzhou 4.5 hours after departing Xi'an at 1om. Passengers remained on board for 1.5 hours until we were bussed to terminal at 7pm where we only stayed for 30-35 minutes and re-boarded the plane at 7.30pm.

Passengers remain in the take-off position at their seats for the next 2 hours without any clue until the plane finally took off at 10pm. After landing the plane in Hong Kong the passengers remained on the plane for 2 hrs until 1am. Due to many planes in the queue from the delay the baggage claim pickup added more delays along with the delays in getting public transportation to leave the airport. At this time the public buses had ended leaving only a few choices - taxis airport express train and private cars. The cabin crew failed to communicate clearly the delay to passengers failed to allow passengers to be in a comfortable position during the delay provide refreshments during the time (2+ hours) on board plane waiting for bus to go to terminal or waiting for gate to be available.

Terminal 3 is excellent leaps and bounds better than T1. Boarding was chaotic as ever on an A320. Seats comfy cabin was new and clean. Legroom was awful. FAs were unfriendly and robotic no smiles at all. Good BOB options good prices. Though a complimentary drink would be nice. CGY-CEB-CGY on a smaller ATR-72 both flights were uneventful. Both flights were departed and arrived nearly 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin were once again spotlessly clean FAs same we had the same FA on both legs sort of friendly.

Transit visa desk and security were relatively painless although you cant help notice the overstaffing which we will put down to 'security'! The trans-pacific flights were more than simply acceptable especially as the flights weren't full. I like the seating layout of the A330 which allows for better sleeping as there is no third person wanting to get into the aisle for whatever reason.

However when I arrived for check-in at PVG they refused to provide through check-in to CCU and said that I would have to collect my baggage at KMG and go for a fresh check-in. This was ridiculous since PVG is the home base of China Eastern and they can easily manage to put systems in place for through check-in for through bookings.

Flight was delayed by a total of almost five hours due to a faulty emergency exit light - not what you need with an original departure time of 11.30pm. This information was only forthcoming when you actually asked the ground staff who seemed reluctant to publicise a technical fault. The airline asked for volunteers to fly a day later (with accommodation and meals provided) and boarding commenced very soon after they had found approximately 20. Apparently the light problem meant a reduced number of passengers could be carried. The volunteers were essentially tricked as at the time it was far from clear that boarding was imminent. We then sat on the plane for two hours whilst the volunteers' bags were unloaded and spent the flight to CAN wondering whether the LHR leg would be held for us. After landing we were quickly ushered through the CAN terminal handed a 100 Yuan note each as compensation for the delay and soon on board the Boeing 787 to LHR. The 787 passengers appeared to have been waiting on board for about two hours. Food beverages and seat comfort were reasonable and the aircraft near-new with slightly below-average IFE. The standard of staff English is much lower than comparable airlines but on the whole they do their best in terms of customer service.

china-southern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-southern-airlines,China Southern Airlines customer review,M Davis,Australia,2014-09-24,I booked with China Southern solely because of the unbeatable price - $1300 from Brisbane to Vancouver return. I flew from Brisbane to Guangzhou on one of CSAIR new airbuses which was relatively roomy with great inflight entertainment. The only downside of this flight was some very ordinary food. I'm not a fan of airplane food at the best of times but this food was close to unidentifiable. The next leg was from Guangzhou to Vancouver on one of the new Dreamliners which was great. CSAIR certainly have some of the most modern aircraft. The food on this leg was much better. The air stewards were good. Obviously English wasn't their first language but they did their best to understand English speaking customers. They don't bowl you over with friendliness but overall the trip was great especially when offered free accommodation due to a long stopover - only problem was I had already paid for accommodation. One thing if China really wants to crack the Western market they need to work on their 'people skills' at their airports. In Guangzhou we were made to feel very unwelcome with unhelpful airport staff. The 72hr transit visa waver is a bit of a nightmare with no one clearly explaining you need the boarding pass for your next leg even if it is 2 days away to get through customs - the airline ticket doesn't cut it. This meant being yelled at in Cantonese by customs officials - not exactly encouraging.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,3,2,5,NA,NA,5,1

Provided plenty of English magazines though newspapers were scarce. Lounge in BKK excellent with hot and cold dishes. Flight was 1 hr late leaving BKK but were given a meal voucher in the airport despite the fact food in the lounge was ample. Connecting in Taipei was easy as it's not a very large airport.

Check-in and security was fast. A long walk to the lounge and the gate at the new Shenzhen Airport. Lounge was mediocre. Priority boarding good. Now about the flight itself. Good things: seats very good comfortable and lie-flat a light quilt and soft pillows placed at every seat. IFE was very nice with headphones and lots of movies and other videos to watch but the ads are a bit annoying but can be fast-forward. Now the bad part. Staff didn't smile much makes you feel you're not welcomed. The A380 seemed under-staffed and I had to wait 10 minutes for a drink refill. Food seemed a little unfresh a mysterious sauce and meat?

Condor doesn't have a bag drop option in Calgary we had to stand in the checkin line for 45 mins even though we were checked in. It was the first flight of the year from Calgary so once fully boarded we sat in the plane for an hour because the contracted ground handler didn't train their staff on condors systems.

This was very much value for money but I do have a few gripes. I was told that I couldn't sit in the emergency exit seats because I don't speak Mandarin but I did see plenty of what appeared to be native English speakers in the seats when the plane took off. I'm 6ft 3ins tall and on the Heathrow to Guangzhou leg my knees were up against the seat in front even before the person in front reclined his seat.

Not much choice for English films and they didn't change on the way back despite the inflight magazine saying that they had. I agree with other people that the staff's level of English is poor this needs to be addressed if they are seeking to get a bigger share of the European market.

Firstly the flight was delayed 1 hour in FRA. However what happened next was a true nightmare. As we descended into Dubrovnik the captain informed us due to a problem at the airport we were to divert to Split. After landing at Split and spending 1 hour on the ground we took off for what we thought was Dubrovnik. However after attempting to land the captain turned the flight around and proceeded to Zagreb (only one announcement and no information as to why). We landed at Zagreb at which point the captain and crew left the plane and the passengers with no information. We were given no food and only one glass of water during this entire ordeal. A new crew came on board about 30 min later and several passengers demanded to leave the flight. We finally took off for DBV and landed 7 hours behind schedule.

We arrived very early at the airport as recommended and the check-in was quick and efficient but not very friendly. The flight was a domestic continuation of a flight from Paris and operated on time. The seats on board had adequate legroom but a hard bar across the lower back made them rather uncomfortable. While the boarding passes had allocated seats in fact passengers could sit anywhere except in the front area which was for the international passengers (some young men not in uniform seemed to be security staff enforcing non-mixing of international and domestic passengers). For most of the flight the cabin lights were totally extinguished (it was an evening flight) and the personal reading lights didn't work. The cabin crew disappeared while the plane was in flight. No refreshments were served. On arrival the plane docked at the international terminal where as ensured by the security staff the passengers from Paris disembarked via an air bridge while we were bussed a long way to the domestic terminal and waited a long time for our luggage. Overall Cubana is an effective and interesting way to get from A to B but don't expect any frills.

On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp.

However if you arrive early there is nothing worth seeing/buying at the whole airport. Everything is overpriced. Used the CSA lounge which is nothing special. Very poor choice of food and drinks. A320 seat pitch adequate. Food was pretty tasteless. On Economy class you have to purchase wine/beer. Service on board was very robotic but ok for a short flight. Arrived at Heathrow T4. Same nightmare as usual. Very long wait after landing due to traffic control. Luggage belt area was very crowded and messy. One positive thing about CSA is their quick response to email. I had few queries on my FFP card and all was resolved within 20 minutes on 3 exchange of emails. Very efficient and friendly. However CSA ticket price is the most expensive in most routes including Prague to London. In the future I would opt for easyjet for the low price or BA for the quality of product of service.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Flight is often almost full thanks to Chinese tour groups. Normally the flight is uneventful and the professionalism of the crew stands out. They are firm but polite in keeping order among the tour groups which is often not easy. One major negative was the meal on the HKG-CNX sector. They offered beef or chicken. I chose the chicken option which turned out to be inedible. I complained after the meal service was complete and they changed it for the beef option was quite tasty. As always the flight was slightly early. Pity their latest A320s aren't fitted with an entertainment system. PG has this for the 1 hour flight from CNX to BKK.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,2,0,NA,NA,5,1

I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight.

Bag drop at Copenhagen T2 was fast, and our carry-on bags inspected for number and size. easyJet use the low-cost terminal F at Copenhagen airport, which is pretty sparten but well lit and clean. Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight –  wonderful. BRS to CPH. Bag drop opened 3 hours before the flight time which is a boon. The inbound aircraft was slightly late, and therefore we could witness the arrival passengers struggle across the tarmac against heavy rain in their scanty holiday clothes. Luckily we had our travel umbrellas as, in addition, we were held up on the aircraft steps for a minute or two. Again, a cheerful crew who dealt with their cabin duties in a professonal manner.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,Dan Ross,United Kingdom,2015-07-18,"I don't know why they call easyjet a low-cost carrier as the flight was definitely not cheap. Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet's ""midnight check-in"" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I'd paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn't find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we'd be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay €100 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I've had bus seats more comfortable. On the plus side I had 2 seats next to me spare which has been very rare from me. This flight was delayed coming to Kefalonia and landing at Gatwick we were held up for about 20 mins. Bags took a while to come out. Overall, a satisfactory journey, but they need to drop the ""low-cost"" moniker and go back to being called a no frills airline as that's what it is with all the charges you pay.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy,Gatwick to Kefalonia,5,2,4,1,NA,3,NA,2,1

The whole thing was a complete  shambles and there were some heated exchanges between passengers who tried to push in. We have seen this before at Madeira airport and it makes for a poor end to a nice holiday. Easyjet need to review their arrangements at this airport. The flight itself was uneventful on an older A320, left early and arrived early. The only slight disappointment was that there was only one refreshment run.

eastern-airways,/airline-reviews/eastern-airways,Eastern Airways customer review,A Lane,United States,2010-06-17,Newcastle to Bergen return: We were flying on the smaller of their two aircraft and there were a total of four passengers plus one flight attendant. All four passengers were seated in the very rear of the plane most likely to balance the weight due to the small aircraft. The good thing about flying with Eastern was that probably it was included in the cost of the tickets but passengers are allowed to go through the Fast Track security line. Also at Newcastle International terminal gate 31 is exclusive for Eastern. The terminal lounge was tiny and had bowls of sweets and copies of their inflight magazine. The downside is that the aircraft is very noisy so one has a problem hearing the inflight announcements and the aircraft seems to feel turbulence being so tiny. Also if you need to use the toilet try not to otherwise it's located in the rear of the plane behind a door that you need to be sure is securely locked or you risk giving a show. I could not for anything find a sink but there was a bottle of hand sanitizer that was available. The flight from Bergen there was no dedicated terminal lounge. The so-called complimentary refreshments on both flights were only drinks and either a packet of sweet or savoury snacks. The flight from Bergen the flight attendant offered hot towels just prior to landing. This wasn't offered on the flight from Newcastle. The flights were over an hour each and I think they could and should have served sandwiches considering they advertise how they are a cut above the other airlines. Perhaps it's due to mounting costs but other than those tiny packets of snacks they bombarded us with sweets before and during the flights. The sweets are not the best quality too.

I was assigned a seat at the last row of the plane and not only there wasn't no window - in what it seems a business measure to book the more possible passengers at the expense of the seat pitch - but the plane itself was a really old A319 very degraded but the worst was the total lack of cleaning on the plane the seats textiles had a vivid brown in an absolutely act of negligence. The Portuguese male flight attendants chat a lot between both of them loud and clear as if the passengers were interested in knowing about their lives.

DL is working hard to be a serious airline and it's mostly paying off. All flights were on time and generally the service and food very good including a new beef enchilada (really!) lunch item that was excellent. The omelette breakfast out of LAS however- not so much. For me the biggest issue with DL is the age of the fleet. Both long legs were on vintage (25 years old plus) 757s with no modern amenities except pay for WIFI. These old ships showed their age throughout including (my pet peeve) dreadful bathrooms no entertainment whatsoever and old style overhead bins. The one flight with no first class section was aboard the dreaded CRJ200 for a 90 minute flight.. DL generously assigned seat 14A with a GE engine seemingly in the next seat.

Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made.

My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,J Hunter,United Kingdom,2014-08-20,EZY5336 17th July 2014. On the plus side Easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. Firstly the baggage drop at Gatwick is woeful. You really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because EZ can't be bothered to have all the desks open (or rent some more). Staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. Perhaps it's better not to arrive too early and just wait for the 'late shout' - it's probably quicker! It's not as if EZ don't know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. The 2nd irritation is being called to 'board' when at the gate. This isn't really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen (eg Toulouse) and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. Again it's for Easyjet's convenience/saving not the customers'. Why call family groups first so > they can stand for longer rather than call them last? Sometimes Easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. For me I'd pay a small premium for a decent airline. But if you don't mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board they're OK. Better than Ryanair though.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,3,0

From LA to NY return and from NY to Honolulu my family were unable to have seating together due to not booking a 'particular way' despite the fact we booked months in advance! It seems this manner of booking was only available to people who booked in USA as no information on booking allocated seats was known to us (Australian origin). Moreover we weren't the only people who encountered this issue. Another passenger was unable to be seated with their 4 and 8 year old children due to their ridiculous seating policy. Do it the right way Delta first checked in first choice. Service was bad. Rude at check in. Rude and unhelpful at the gate and even on flight they held their tradition by attendants having domestic quarrels on the plane around passengers. Food is terrible all flights are over 5 hours and only offered 2 biscuits or a small bag of pretzels unless you pay.

The new cabin baggage policy means most passengers take trolley bags on - fair enough. However those who don't and have a small bag or daypack are expected to forfeit their leg room so trolley bags go in the stowage bins. 3) Nice new clean aircraft attentive crew.

We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg.

When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue. The introduction of allocated seating seems to have made the whole boarding process more relaxed though it does mean that you can no longer vet the passengers in your immediate vicinity before sitting down: on one of our flights we had to suffer seat kicking children behind us with parents who took no notice.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

My overall experience was good. Service on the domestic legs was better than expected with friendly crews and regular drink runs. The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity. No free alcohol even on international flights to/from LIM. Transfer in ATL was easy with airline representatives at the gate to assist passengers in the transfer process.

I was just 1 kg over (21 kgs) and the check in assistant charged me. It's not a problem but I was just thinking the person in front of me weighed at least 95 kgs and is not charged for their 20kg bag. I weigh 65 kgs and have to pay for 1 kg over. Appreciate you cannot charge based on a person's total weight but for some reason it seems unfair. Also they are not very consistent - I often carry 21 kgs on Easyjet and they do not charge anything - could depend on the mood of the Easyjet check in assistants.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,Dan Ross,United Kingdom,2013-08-11,Gatwick to Kefalonia (LGW-KEF). Ticket purchase fairly easy online but printing the boarding pass and online check-in could be made simpler. Due to the early departure I checked my luggage in the night before. Arrived the next morning and saw that at 5.30am they were still full. Shocked that at security at Gatwick I went straight to an x-ray machine! No queues! Eateries rammed as it was the start of the school holidays. Gate announced on time. At the gate they called all those with reserved seats and speedy boarding first. Told to go to the front of the bus and cram in there. Non-priority pax got on the same bus. Longest journey to the plane round the back of the airport and across most of it. At the plane the driver opened only the front door so speedy pax could exit first but as easyJet allocates seats you don't get the disgusting crush and rush as you do on Ryanair. Clean cabin. Thanked by the captain for boarding quickly but then told that the flight was to be delayed due to Air Traffic Control not giving them a slot until 2hrs later! I missed my connecting ferry. Captain came on and said the slot had been pushed back even further to 10am. Crew came down with free water a couple of times. Eventually take off 2 hours late. Fairly uncomfortable for a long flight when you add the extra time on the ground in. Crew were very cheery and professional. The chicken wrap I got had limited fillings and was very dry. The box of crisps were over salty and very oily. Next time I'll buy something at the airport to bring on board. Arriving at Kefalonia we were behind another flight so had to wait to clear immigration a bit and for our bags to arrive. Mine was the last one off!

The only bugbear I have is that when booking a return flight and hold baggage is required one way only you have to call Easyjet to do this as the system is not able to book one-way hold baggage.

The inflight-entertainment was terrible - only one third rate movie was shown - the same on both flights. The music programme did not provide a real choice. The food was mediocre service unfriendly. Drinks were not provided during the night. Very good is the provision of accommodation during the Cairo stop-over at a 4-star-hotel near the airport. However before I left on my journey a local Egyptair rep told me that no accommodation would be available. She recommended that I spend my time in Cairo - between two overnight flights in the heat of July. After two hours at the very cold Cairo airport I accidentally found out that Egyptair provided rooms to stop-over passengers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

On the positive side attentive crew and excellent lunch service. Entertainment program enjoyable. Seat from the old generation but comfortable. Service and comfort would shine more with an upgraded airplane. On the preventive side some flights form the USA and South America connecting in Madrid with ELAL to TLV do not have enough time for luggage to be transfered and go through ELAL strict security process which includes passengers recognition of each piece.

egyptair,/airline-reviews/egyptair,Egyptair customer review,J Hutchinson,Thailand,2010-06-07,JNB-CAI. Impossible to imagine how this dreadful airline made it into Star Alliance. Their aircraft are old and uncomfortable Business Class is little better than recliner armchairs - they claim to have flat-bed seats but these are only fitted onto B777-300 aircraft it will probably take them 10 years to have them rolled out to the rest of the fleet. Food was adequate but unimaginative inflight entertainment very limited with only a few channels not in Arabic. Their lounge at the new (but already grubby and dilapidated) Terminal 3 at CAI is small shabby poorly equipped (no showers for example) and for some reason full of children (clearly having a friend at EgyptAir is the way to travel).

We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with ""First"" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,K Cornelius,Netherlands,2014-11-06,Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late.

Boarding was just turn up and go. No order. Once onboard the difference between the A380 and B777 is quiet marked. Seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. I had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by I was bumped. The person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. It was most uncomfortable not helped by the AV units under the seat taking up space. The food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. A roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. No sausage bacon or baked beans. The last dinner I had was a bit bland a beef casserole. Would have benefited from a wine reduction. The AV on this craft was the old ICE. Far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. Very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. We had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in India. We were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 BNE time. At no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in BNE.

On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests.

Some of our sectors were on Qantas and we found the service to be of a much higher standard on Qantas and they were also more family friendly than Emirates. Ultimately we don't have massive expectations in terms of service in economy on any airline but Emirates service was dismissive at times rude and you had to beg for basics like water.

Once again I was not disappointed flying Emirates. The cabin crew are attentive and have an excellent attitude. The food and entertainment system are the best in the business. Previously queues at Dubai airport security checkpoint for transit passengers could be a nightmare but this has improved drastically with the introduction of a 'snake' queuing system. I was through security in less than 10 minutes while in transit. The only things that could be improved by Emirates are: 1) It could remove the 10-abreast seating arrangement in Economy class on its 777 fleet and switch to a standard 9-abreast arrangement as seats are currently too narrow. 2) A snackbox on the galley similar to that of the British Airways 'tuckbox' would be a useful addition.

They closed the gate immediately after I arrived for my flight which I appreciated. However I was seated at the very back of my flight and knowing my predicament no effort was made to help me off the plane first to make my connection. I arrived in Bangkok to discover that though I had made the connection my bag had not and would not come for another 17 hours. The Emirates staff person at Bangkok informed me off this but gave no apology. They promised to deliver the bag to me but as I was two hours out of Bangkok and in a rural area my host had little confidence that a courier would actually make the delivery so we decided to come back to the airport ourselves to collect the bag.

I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,4,NA,NA,4,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,A Ahmed,United Kingdom,2014-04-24,NCL-DXB-DAC-DXB-NCL. Departed from NCL on newest 777-300ER with newest ICE system flight very full but experience was overall pleasant. Catering from NCL is generally always good there was nothing to complain about and staff were efficient and generally good if not over-friendly. Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Travelling business I at least thought the staff would promptly go around the cabin and get any services out the way ASAP. I wanted a nightcap to help me sleep and it took an amazing 1.5 hours before I got it. I have travelled Emirates before and they have been good but a little more attention to customers paying for service regardless of time would not go astray.

Flight out of Copenhagen delayed 3 hours passengers got food coupons flight one hour quicker than scheduled - no problems in reaching connection flight. On board 777-300ER service very good food better than on most other airlines pre-dinner drinks wine and cognac served during meal. Seat comfort however average with rather hard seats and 3x4x3 arrangement making you feel crammed on a sold-out flight as this. I recently flew Turkish Airlines where 3x3x3 arrangements in more comfortable seats made journey more comfortable. However IFE excellent especially music selection. Flight attendant forgot to serve coffee but - as a compensation - offered mini-bottle of cognac at end of flight. All in all a very good experience.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,L Osman,United Arab Emirates,2014-03-03,First time to be disappointed by EK service. Arrived at the airport on time to find out that my flight to JED was delayed 7 hours not to mention check in staff didn't know why and why we had not been informed. Asked if I could leave DXB intl to go home and come back they said no since it was an estimated time and the plane might take off at any time. Stranded at DXB intl for 8 hours. Later on asked another member of ground crew about the update on my flight he was careless to even answer me properly. Onboard 2 female crew were shouting at passengers. Lack of communication from management to staff dealing with passengers is a major problem. On the return RUH-DXB flight on time A330-200 the oldest in EK fleet no entertainment only one meal option I was surprised that they are serving a full meal on this short 90 minutes flight.

When we received our boarding passes they were printed with a departure time of 00.10 meaning a delay of 3.5 hours. After 4 + hours of no updated information they called us to the gates. Eventually arrive in Dubai at around 5.30 am local time 5 hours after our scheduled arrival time. After an hour or so with very little movement in queues peoples patience began to wear thin.

Emirates sent a B777-300 that was an older version without ICE digital but IMHO it is still much better than those found on Qantas A330-300s. The flight was operating below capacity hence most passengers had an entire row to themselves. Service staff ok dinner decent and entertainment options were very good.

Was very happy to be upgraded from business to first between MAN and DXB. The free car service to/from airport was excellent. EK's lounge at MAN is world class - a full free buffet restaurant and excellent showers with full hotel style towel pack on request. The business lounge at DXB also very good: full free buffet restaurant service. Quite full but so many seats that there was no problem in finding somewhere comfortable to sit. MAN-DXB: service in almost empty first cabin was exceptional with stunning food and extremely comfortable private seat. DXB-HND: business seats a tad narrow but long offering a fair degree of privacy and slept well with the additional mattress provided. Food and service both extremely good. Plane was a little old and sad and would have benefited from small repairs and adjustments to fittings but everything worked and was very clean. I fly EK reasonably often but can always find new content on the excellent ICE AV system. The Emirates' Saver Business ticket represented extremely good value even without the upgrade to first several hundred pounds cheaper than European carriers with the plus of free car service included.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,4,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

Many channels couldn't be accessed and the ones that were had functional text (eg volume brightness) on the screen which couldn't be removed.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,J Springthorpe,United Kingdom,2014-01-23,BKK-DXB Jan 2014. Bangkok Emirates lounge ancient tiny and poorly laid out. Food and beverage choice was however very good. Boarding gate minutes+ from lounge. A380 upper deck boarding via air bridge. Very friendly and welcoming crew they seem to love the A380 and explaining its features to passengers actively inviting you to come for a drink in the lounge bar. Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar. Massive screen but I remain un-impressed with the range of films and TV programmes on offer. Red eye service cabin lights nice and dim throughout the flight. Full dining service offered despite the 1am departure time with a breakfast served before arrival. Skipped the meal had drinks and canapés at the bar. Nice feature of the Emirates A380 but bar seems to have little space for stock and they constantly run out of things and the poor crew are backwards and forwards from the galley constantly. Lie flat bed was extremely comfortable more so than the 777-300ER beds and combined with the seat liner and nice blankets it was brilliant. Best sleep ever on long haul. Breakfast prior to arrival was decisively average yet again tried the cold cuts and cheese as had enough of the hot offerings and the meat was off poor quality with tasteless cheese. Arrival into Dubai as on time. Very pleasant experience overall A380 is spacious luxurious and a smooth quiet ride on upper deck.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,5,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Dubai lounge again was very satisfactory stunning array of food and beverages on offer and very busy for all the early morning wave. Boarding on time and direct to aircraft from lounge via a lift. Upper deck boarding via air bridge. Crew friendly and welcoming on the whole some perhaps just business friendly. Menu for flight looks far more enticing than previous sectors. Extremely friendly and efficient steward from Dubai himself was looking after me. Very attentive throughout. Seat again is fantastic but this time a LH window seat with minibar to the window and seat more to the aisle - does not feel as private. Under window stowage is also hard to access. Variety of appetisers and sweets at the bar was great on this sector and the Manchester born girl manning the bar was chatty and genuine. Skipped breakfast and snacked at the bar on and off. Dinner service before arriving in Manchester was lovely Nice soup Beef Steak and a Cheese board to finish. Best meal in 4 flights so far and probably the nicest crew . Overall impression of Emirates after a 4 leg trip aircraft well kept A380 stands out 777-300 are getting overhauled crew attentive and professional and immaculately turned out.

All flights left on time and arrived on time or early. Seats were comfortable enough as to manage some hours sleep and seat pitch adequate it didn't feel that cramped as stated in previous reviews but I guess because I picked the two seat row at the very end of the cabin.

Outbound I did online check-in which worked fine and used the dedicated online check-in counter at Madrid which permitted me to skip the long queues for economy check-in. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working specially on the NRT-DXB leg. All requests were promptly met and you could ask for any kind of drinks and snacks between meals.

I flew business class with Etihad in 2012 - business class was bearable but when I flew in economy in Oct / Nov 2014 it was the worst airline I have ever flown with. The cabin staff attitude towards economy passengers is poor. My husband and I pressed the button once to ask for a drink and the stewardess looked inconvenienced by us. We paid $5000 AUD for the two of us to fly to Dublin and back and it will be the last cent Etihad ever get off us. The inflight entertainment that they brag about hadn't been updated so the movies / tv shows / documentaries that the magazine promoted didn't match what was actually offered - instead we had to watch old movies old tv series and the ""latest releases"" in the movie section were at least 12 months old.

Overall the Etihad experience was just OK. We found the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the 777-300ER to be cramped and not particularly comfortable especially if the person in front put his or her seat back. The AUH to SYD leg was on a A340 which didn't feel as cramped (2-4-2) although I found the seat to be harder. Meals were average and of standard fayre but my wife found all of her pre-ordered vegetarian options to be very poor. The IFE was acceptable. Cabin staff were OK but nothing special. Abu Dhabi airport was transited with ease although we remained within Terminal 3 throughout. Flight delays were minor.

Outbound check-in surprised to find that there was no dedicated check-in for business class. Boarding was swift and departure on time. Boeing 757-300 was not appropriate for 7 hour flight to Beijing. The product was outdated with old recliner style seats arranged 2x2 with decent legroom and was clean and well-mantained considering the age. IFE from mainscreen was poor and a problem on a day-time flight. Two meals were offered - hot canapes inedible and out of place even in economy class. FAs attentive and professional. A few hours later lunch was served which was much better with generous portions and good quality. Arrival in Beijing was without any hassles. Beijing-Delhi check-in was a mess in spite of a dedicated business class counter - unfriendly and inept staff. The whole process took over twenty minutes. Old Boeing 767 with the same seats but PTV's - IFE choice was limited with 3 movies running on loops. Hardly inspiring considering AVOD being a norm now even on many regional carriers. The dinner was of a high standard. The real issues came when I landed in Delhi. In spite of a new terminal Ethiopian had no clear signage as to where the bags were being delivered. Subsequently upon finding the correct conveyer belt I discovered my priority tagged luggage had not been off-loaded with the conveyer belt showing bags delivered for the flight. The same was with another passenger on the flight. Ethopian Airlines staff could not be found and when we finally found one we came across one of the most unhelpful and petulent staff I have come across. The person was firstly dismissive stating bags would come in later until we had to show him the screen on the conveyer belt. Finally he picked up his cell phone and dialled someone asking for two black bags. No attempt was made to check on the baggage ticket numbers. Finally we waited another ten minutes until he stated that it was time for him to go home and the bags would be delivered. We had to involve the customer service desk at Delhi airport who were helpful and ensured that we were attended to.

When you pay extra for exit row seats legroom don't sit in the window seat. It has a horizontal bit of door perfect for stretching out your legs (shoes removed of course) but the stewardess will wake you up by shaking your shoulder forbidding you to do this citing a safety issue with the door. There is a sticker on that door bit saying “Do not sit here” something I was not doing. Meal choice was run down to one choice only every meal. The seats on the B777 were painfully narrow painful for me but particularly for the overweight lady being wedged in the chair next to me. Will I fly this airline again - no thank you.

My SYD-AUH flight was operated by Virgin Australia and was an excellent experience that I will not comment on here. The other three flights were operated by Etihad which were fine enough. AUH-GRU and return was on an A340 - the planes felt a little old but there was plenty of space compared to most economy seats I've been in. However AUH-SYD was on a B777 with quite possibly the worst economy long-haul seat I've experienced. The plane was nice and new and the IFE was excellent but the 3-4-3 layout meant the seat width was very narrow and uncomfortable even for a skinny guy like myself. It was hard to walk up and down the aisles to get to the bathrooms due to lack of space - kept bumping into people and I'm glad I wasn't sitting in an aisle seat otherwise I would have been extremely annoyed by this.

Firstly my outgoing journey to BKK was pretty good - I have no complaints other than the usual for me not enough leg room (I am 6ft 3) however I am yet to fly with any carrier that I wouldn't say this about. The return journey was okay initially the flight left BKK on time and arrived in Abu Dhabi as scheduled. We boarded the Abu Dhabi - Manchester flight about 30 minutes late and were removed from the aircraft because of a 'maintenance issue' about 20 minutes after embarking. We were then told we could 'show our boarding pass to any of the restaurants in the departure lounge and we'd be able to get some food and a drink. Attempting this proved impossible I was told I needed a voucher from Etihad and wouldn't get anything unless I did. So a 25 minute queue for the voucher. Back to get some food. Oh the voucher only entitles me to what? A doughnut and a coffee! A 6.5 hr delay and this is all that was offered I was pretty disappointed and felt like this was in contradiction to Etihad's excellent reputation. We were eventually boarded on a flight some 7hrs later and whilst on-board the crew and staff were very attentive and professional.

This segment was in business class (Premium Laurel Class) on the 747-400. We had seats 7H and 7K. Boarding was fast and efficient. The seats were in the lower forward section of the 747 and were lie-flat angled seats. The service and food was very good. We pre-ordered our meals on-line. The IFE had a good selection of choices. This was my first experience with the angled seats and it was comfortable but I would opt for the 180 degree lie flat when given the choice. The flight arrived on time and our connection in Taipei was smooth we were greeted by name and shown where to go for our next flight. Our flight to Hong Kong (HKG) was on an MD-90 in seats 2A and 2C - Business Class. Service and meals were very good as well! Our return was slightly different flying from Bangkok Thailand (BKK) to TPE on an Airbus A330. Our seats (24F and 24G) were in economy on this flight and the service and seats were very good. My only complaint was that our seats were changed within 24 hours of our trip moving us away from friends we were seated next to. This also occurred on our next flight in business class but one person offered to switch seats once we were on the plane. Our flight from TPE to Los Angeles (LAX) was on the 777-300 ER in Royal Laurel Class - their newer designed business class seats - lie flat. We were in seats 5D and 5G aisle seats.

IAD-AUH (A340-600) - flight only 20% full and I had the bulkhead seat with an open seat next to me. Had a great experience with in-flight food entertainment and service. I chalk that up to the empty flight and minimal stress on FA's. Bulkhead seats are normally 75$ per leg but was able to get it during online check-in. Bulkhead had plenty of legroom and you don't have to worry about reclining seats. IFE is slightly smaller and with lower graphics quality. Cons: seats are quite hard halfway through the 12 hr flight my tailbone was so sore I had to sit on a pillow for the rest of trip. Transit AUH - first time at airport and transit in evening was a breeze with minimal lines for transfer/secondary security. I had a short layover so didn't check on the facilities. Food options are limited and expensive. AUH-BKK (777) - completely full flight and boarding process was very chaotic. Basically a complete free for all boarding. They boarded by rows but gate agents were not enforcing it. I will avoid flying on 777 especially with the 3-4-3 set up and the poor seat pitch. Cabin was very hot even though I was just in a T-shirt. FA's did their best scrambling around with the full flight. Seats again were very hard and not comfortable. BKK-AUH (777) - same experience as the inbound flight. Cabin too warm and breakfast food was pretty bad on this flight. By far the worse on the trip. Boarding in BKK still very chaotic. AUH transit with US Customs pre-clearance - 3 hour layover in the early morning and airport was very busy. Secondary security had long lines and had to wait 30 min. Food options is still terrible. US pre clearance at AUH was a mixed bag. No dedicated lines for US citizens. AUH-BKK (A340) - another full flight and a complete reversal in my Etihad experience. FA had difficult time communicating with mostly South Asian customers. Meal service was a zoo - I have never seen so many different special meal requests. There's a 30-40 min lag between special meal service and regular meal service. Special meal customers ended up holding on their meals for 1 hr. Some flyers had to take their own tray back to the FA. Cabin temperature fluctuated a couple times from cold to warm. IAD luggage took forever. Waited for a full 30 min at the carousel from the first bag to my bag. Probably would not fly Etihad economy even with the lowest price. Seat pitch way too small for intl long hauls.

Being a family with small children the main priority for us was obviously to have as smooth a trip with the children as possible. We were recommended Etihad as they advertised to have a nanny onboard and are good with the children. We flew Brisbane to Singapore onward to Abu Dhabi onward to Paris onward to Toulouse in France. The children were not spoken to nor were we introduced to a nanny as per Etihads advertising until the Abu Dhabi to Paris flight. The nanny in this flight was very pleasant. However on the previous flight I had to ask for water twice before it was brought. We are returning to Australia with Etihad unfortunately. Hopefully the service is better. I would not recommend etihad to a family. I would recommend Etihad to an individual as the food was reasonable entertainment was good and the seats are as comfortable as any other airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,3,5,NA,NA,1,0

Airy and spacious cabin ample space and legroom though could have done with a foot rest as the calf support didn't reach as far as your feet. Staff very pleasant on both flights and food and drink excellent and plentiful (particularly on the return flight) with plenty of juice and water runs. Couldn't fault the in-flight entertainment with so many recent films also good documentaries and travel items.

Etihad's economy product is inferior to that of Emirates. Seats small and uncomfortable. IFE not as good. Food however is excellent. Three choice of entrees and the option I chose was very well prepared though a little stingy in portions. FAs pour alcoholic beverages from large bottles in tiny amounts. Wine selection was poor even for economy and their wine bottles were empty by the time they came to me. On the whole however the FAs on the first sector were gems. They provided service from the heart with genuine smiles. But they were horribly inefficient. It took them 4 hours from take off to finish dinner service and turn the lights down. And this was on a 6 hours night flight. An hour before landing they served breakfast wraps (much appreciated) which Emirates does not on similar flights to Dubai. Economy FAs on the flight to Dhaka were functional. Migrant workers from Bangladesh needed to be transported and fed and that is all the FAs achieved. No smiley engagements as in the first segment.

Entertainment was so-so better than some but not up to their competitors standard. Snack after take off was adequate given the time of departure (chicken wrap or pumpkin and fetta) I was just given one and had no idea which it was until biting into it but took a very long time for anything to be served or offered. Breakfast was quite decent although served extremely early before arrival. Service took a long time to complete due to only one crew operating my side of the cabin. There seemed to be a distinct lack of crew throughout the economy cabin. Nothing else was offered between services. Blanket and pillow were good as was amenity pack. What lacks was the seat comfort.

Food and drinks (water) kept coming. Washroom was clean all the way that's pretty good for 21-22 hours. But the reason I may not travel again on Etihad on a long haul flight are the seats very uncomfortable I am not very tall so leg room was adequate but the seats were very hard and not at all good for my back. The armrest on all flights did not have the cushion part sewn on it it was just hard.

Seats were fairly comfortable with sufficient legroom and width (I'm a 5'10 for your reference). IFE selection was nothing special but had a good spread of films and TV shows to keep one entertained for 11 hours. Muslim meal consisted of local Singapore food which was alright. My main complaint would be the lack of beverage service throughout the flight. Attendants came out sporadically offering cups of water. Security and passport control in HEL took 15 mins. AMS departure was delayed for 40 mins. Explanations were only given prior to boarding which I felt was unprofessional. Irritatingly it seemed as if there was no effort to speed up the boarding process to make up for lost time. Flight was operated on a new A321. Felt like a low-cost carrier as there were no amenities whatsoever except for free water and juices on this 2.5 hour flight. CDG-HEL-SIN. HEL sector operated by an A321 with no flight amenities again. Flight departed on time and the connection in HEL was very quick. SIN sector operated on a refurbished A343 and was similar to the outbound flight. However the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to broken ground equipment. Updates were given by the captain which was nice. Food was extremely bland. The muslim meal consisted of the same dish for both dinner and breakfast. Overall the experience was nothing to shout about. Finnair got the job done at a significantly lower price. However the delayed flights on both journeys and the no-frills intra-Europe flights may make me hesitant to fly with them again as they were not that much cheaper.

The slogan on the front of the Embraer E195 jet plane “ yn falch o wasanaethu Cymru proud to serve Wales was a nice touch. The flight duration was due to be 50 minutes but we appeared to be placed in a holding pattern close to Dublin so probably the same flying time as the competing turboprop plane on this route. The aircraft itself was very good spacious relatively quiet comfortable leather seats and a smooth flight considering the weather. This is in contrast to the aircraft used by the competition.

The booking process is confusing and unclear there is a constant feeling you're trying to be tricked into paying for things you don't want. Online check in did not work and seems to be a common recurring problem going by other reviews here I fly with only hand baggage for these short hops so I can arrive later at the airport and walk through without having to queue at a desk - this defeats the point of this if I have to check-in the old-fashioned way. Of course I didn't get a window seat because they had been taken and I didn't want to pay the obscene charge to pre-select. They chose Stansted for this route - this airport is decrepit and dark security is overcrowded and a mess with poor management of queues. Moving on to boarding - the misinformation flyBe give which adds to passengers frustration - we were told we had to be at the gate 45 minutes before the flight this is excessive and pointless. Arriving at the gate the board said it was open - it wasn't with no one about. Then it said they were boarding again it wasn't. Then finally 15 minutes before the depart time said gate was closed - we haven't even boarded. We didn't board until the scheduled depart time. Boarding was on foot in the rain with no bus or sheltered path. Upon boarding it was clear the Dash 8 Q400 aircraft had seen better days cabin looked very tatty and tired and a lot of passengers didn't seem to be aware of the size limitations for cabin baggage boarding took significantly longer than it should have. The seat itself was thin hard and unsupportive and looked very tatty with scratches and frayed bits hanging off. Departed 15 minutes late with no explanation or reason given for the delay.

FlyBe like to pretend they are above the low-cost carriers such as easyJet but they are anything but and this is very poor replacement for the easyJet's flight from/to Gatwick that were ended at the end of March - not only with the odd flight times and use of Stansted but also because of the poor quality of their short-haul product.

The connecting flight from Amsterdam was fine. A tiny curtained off Business section with economy seating with middle seats left vacant. A pleasant dinner good Champagne and on time. From Helsinki to Singapore was one of the old A340s (OH-LQA in this case). First impressions were favourable with the cabin being spacious and clean. We had pre flight drinks and a snack and left on time. Once seated I tried the seat out and it's more of a recliner but seemed ok. Menus drinks and dinner all happened smoothly and quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed my supper. It's a bit of a no frills offering but enjoyable and had nice wines also. IFE is poor. The screens are tiny and the offering is limited and old. Didn't really matter as I wanted to sleep as much as possible and despite the seat being at quite an angle I managed a few good hours. Breakfast was simple but tasty.

We got some rest but the seat is not conducive to sleep. Why on earth any airline serves a meal at midnight defeats me so we declined and tried to get some sleep. On arrival at SIN we had use of Qantas lounge for our ongoing flight with BA codeshare. Overall the flight and lounges for the outgoing sector were fine. The return was awful: Finnair uses Plaza Premium lounge at HK which is poorly equipped uncomfortable old seating and it's a very long walk to the gates. No announcements were made (and we were told this) but the only flight screen info is one which scrolls through the next 24 hrs flights. With no help from the lounge staff we decided to make our way to the gate about 45 mins before departure: a good thing we did since the flight was not showing as boarding as we left the lounge but the extremely long walk to the gate meant that we were some of the last to board. Although the flight was scheduled to be on an A330 with flat bed seats it was an old 340 and sleep was difficult. Staff are pleasant but not particularly proactive. Not sure I'd fly with AY business again unless I was assured of a flat bed. I understand they are upgrading most of the fleet this year.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,3,3,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

Both flights departed on time and arrived slightly early although passengers were held on board for some time at Exeter as passengers boarded the aircraft on an adjacent stand.

flydubai,/airline-reviews/flydubai,flydubai customer review,K Lawrence,United Arab Emirates,2013-10-10,FlyDubai to Colombo September 2013: Their home base Terminal 2 in Dubai in my opinion is unpleasant inconvenient and facilities are lacking. Secondly what's with the 3 hour check-in requirement? The check-in took forever - our agent was really slow. The aircraft are admittedly smallish but then again its a 737 and not a 777 or A380 so its to be expected. Interior was clean and in a good state of repair. The F/As in my opinion had a more natural and genuinely friendly demeanour compared to Emirates' crew. Perhaps because the FlyDubai crew were quite young. They seemed to enjoy their jobs. Legroom was fine for me as I am not that tall. F/A service was adequate and quite prompt. Food purchased from the menu was not bad at all for a low cost airline. Alcohol is overpriced at AED 40 for a whisky. The 737 is obviously not the fastest plane versus the 777 for instance so I found the duration of the trip to be a little more tiresome as a result.

Flight supposed to depart at 8am but as we were about to take-off a medical emergency delayed the plane for almost 2 hours. Even though the flight attendants were apologetic the captain didn't bother once to speak to passengers or tell us what was going on. During the 2 hours delay we were left in the plane with no air-conditioning of any kind. Passengers began to get agitated and tempers frayed. Only after many passengers began to complain loudly that we were allowed to board buses to wait until the situation was dealt with. I have to admit that the flight attendants were professional and were doing their best to deal with a serious situation but shame on the captain for not once bothering to tell us what was being done.

flybe,/airline-reviews/flybe,Flybe customer review,J Blanchard,United Kingdom,2014-07-29,"This review is based on recent experiences on the new BHX-FLR routing using a E190. On all but the last occasion the flight was fine on time and worked well albeit with one aborted approach and a pre advised divert risk. I am aware that FLR is a very marginal airfield due to its Omni directional runway and short length. Sadly most issues that surround flights to and from FLr are due to these issues and organisational challenges at the airport. However the options Flybe take/are given for diverts differ from other airlines drastically. Both BLQ and PSA are the primary divert fields and both are relatively ""open"" in terms of capacity to take the few flights that divert out of FLR. My last experience had me sat on a bus for 4.5 hrs transferring to Milan Malpensa 21/7. This is crazy today my wife and Children are faced with the same challenge. Very poor planning and to always blame the airfield when other carries can and do operate is very poor accept that the E190LR is at the extent of its performance limitations the E175 you have would provide a much greater approval rating as it would achieve its destination far more frequently that the 190 does in my opinion.

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,John Duffus,Thailand,2013-09-02,BKK-HEL-BKK A330 business class flat-bed seats. Three problems with the 10-hour outward flight. When you have to get up around 06.00 for an 09.00 departure the obvious first meal should be breakfast or at the very least brunch. Not so on AY where a full lunch is inexplicably served before 10.00. It then serves a second reduced lunch prior to landing. If the poor lounge served some breakfast foods then perhaps I might understand. But the uncomfortable Louis Tavern has no breakfast food at all! For a long daytime flight a good breakfast is surely a must. Secondly the touch-screen AV selection is poor with almost the worst selection of mostly old movies I have experienced in recent years. Thirdly and least pleasantly the cabin smelt faintly of a toilet throughout most of the flight. I will not take this flight again until meals are more in tune with the time of departure. On the return sector meals were also rather unsatisfactory. Dessert and cheese for dinner each amounted to no more than a couple of mouthfuls. The breakfast scrambled eggs were bland and the croissants served cold. On both flights I found the rather narrow flat bed seats surprisingly uncomfortable. Switching off the AV system a full 25 minutes prior to landing was extremely annoying and seems inexplicable.

In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels. Overall I had a good flight both ways and would recommend Frontier based on this experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,0,5,NA,NA,4,1

I was worried about my flight today after reading all of the negative reviews but I must say that I was pleasantly shocked! This was probably one of the best flights I've experienced flying out of O'Hare airport or other airports for that matter. Our flight even departed a little earlier than planned. It was a pretty early flight so I did sleep the entire way which was very uncomfortable because the seats have little cushion and do not recline. Since I slept throughout my flight it didn't matter to me that there wasn't any entertainment or wifi. Also I like that the cheaper option is to check a bag in. I decided to pay more for a carry on and the process to board and off board is so much faster since many elect the cheaper option to check their bags but also there was plenty room available in the overhead compartments. For the price I paid for the ticket and because I am an anxious flyer pilot skill is more important than the seating or entertainment. The fact that I was able to sleep on a flight which is very rare is important to me. I think Fronteir is exactly what it markets itself as an economy Airbus. Expect to get from point A to point B nothing more. Plan on bringing a pillow and a book to make the flight more comfortable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,1,3,0,2,NA,NA,4,1

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,D Petersen,United States,2015-02-24,This was my first trip with Frontier. We flew from Cleveland to Las Vegas return. I opted for the stretch seats. The flight was delayed slightly on the outbound leg but this was communicated to us before we arrived at the airport. It was really not a problem. The ground staff were friendly and efficient. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The stretch seats were worth every cent of the small supplement payable ($25 per person per leg of the flight). The aircraft was a modern Airbus A320 which was clean and comfortable. The return leg was exactly like the outbound. I will not be giving five stars however. Upon arrival at Cleveland 5.45 am we were directed to a piece of taxiway until a stand could be found for us. The delay amounted to 45 minutes. That is unacceptable at that time of the morning and Frontier and Hopkins need to address it.

IFE is poor in comparison to other major carriers. A330 has lie flat seats but if travelling as a couple avoid the left hand seats as there is less room than in the middle paired seats.

They were on time friendly bathrooms were clean and the flight was comfortable. In September of 2013 I flew from KC to PDX with a stop in Denver.

Of course we didn't have to pay anything extra for the next connecting flight.

garuda-indonesia,/airline-reviews/garuda-indonesia,Garuda Indonesia customer review,A Ahmed,United Kingdom,2015-05-10,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product.

Very disappointed to discover that my seat turned out to be nothing of the sort - it was in fact the very last row on the aircraft right next to the noisy galley and toilets which made it difficult to sleep. Other than that the flight was quite good - a small late-night snack was served and a decent breakfast before landing. There's a rather modest offering of movies/TV shows - OK for a 7 hour flight.

The smart fare also included a a drink and a snack and to be honest I wish they hadn't bothered because it was quite definitely the worst inflight meal I have had in over 40 years of flying. The ""snack"" consisted of a sandwich of turkey in soggy brown bread which was totally inedible a small bottle of water and a tiny Toblerone chocolate.

At least at Cologne Bonn there are seats and toilets at the gates in Manchester we were left standing for over an hour. No information from the airline and no apology - very poor show. Sadly this lack of customer service is my experience with Lufthansa short haul generally (GW are part of Lufthansa) which is why I avoid them for short haul flights these days. On short flights my priority is punctuality and here they are sadly lacking. A319 both ways which I find more comfortable than the 737s but that is the only positive thing I can find to say about the experience. Food and drink on board was pricey and not great quality - nowhere near as good value as Ryanair (never thought I'd write those words!).

hong-kong,/airline-reviews/hong-kong,HK Express customer review,M Galjor,Hong Kong,2015-02-20,"I've done the HKG-HND round-trip on HK Express four times in the last 3 months. I always take UO622 dep HKG 7.10 to go to Japan and UO623 dep HND 1.10am coming back. I used to fly CX to HND but prices have really gone up over the past year. Overall I'd give 3 out of 5 stars for my experience. Prices are of course much cheaper than CX and I appreciate that. 2) Flight attendants are professional courteous and the service is good (not that there are many opportunities to get ""served"" since HKE doesn't offer complementary beverage/food service nor does it offer inflight entertainment). 3) The HKG-HND-HKG flights I've taken have always been on time. 4) Flight times are much more convenient than the CX flights. However 1) Seats are uncomfortable - it's an LCC after all! This doesn't really bother me for the inbound flight which is 3.5 hours but I do end up feeling exhausted after the outbound which is a 4.5 hour redeye. I find the ""sweet seats"" located in the exit aisles a really bad deal - you get the (slightly) extra leg room but your seat has zero recline. 2) Baggage fees: I've noticed that more recently they've started to enforce their baggage rules much more strictly. Hand baggage may not be more than 7.7kg. If you don't sign up for checked in baggage in advance (online when you buy your ticket) you will be charged an arm and a leg at the airport. This happened to me during my last trip and wouldn't have bothered me (rules are rules after all and these fees are part of the LCC business model) had it not taken 1 hour to receive my bags at Hong Kong airport. 3) Long wait for baggage - This last point is apparently an every day occurrence with HKE at least at Hong Kong airport. They are working with a small staff and small planes so your bags will routinely take an hour or so to arrive at Hong Kong airport baggage claim. This is needless to say frustrating though not the biggest deal in the case of UO623 since you have to kill an hour or so after the flight lands anyway (the first Airport Express to Hong Kong station doesn't leave until 5.54am and UO623 lands at around 4.40am). 4) No mileage programme. All in all I will still use Hong Kong Express but due to some of the negative points I listed above only if the price differential between CX and UO is significant enough to be worth it.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,5,0,0,NA,NA,3,1

The flight was a little late leaving but its rare to depart exactly on time. The plane was old and dirty and seats not very comfortable. I am a very tall guy so I must have extra leg room which they were more than happy to arrange - but there were plenty of spare seats so if your on the ball you can grab a whole row and lay across I was not so lucky the seats were quite narrow too. The food was terrible I couldn't eat half of it as its catered for middle-eastern people. Their prices are good and it shows - if you don't care about food and cleanliness then its fine but I wouldn't fly with them again if I had the choice. The staff were friendly but you rarely see them only to give you food and you don't get any free drinks only with a meal.

Self-service check-in quick although not enough personnel to help through the relatively complex system. Bags are weighed and you even self-tag the bags before dropping it off. Potentially efficient but the communication needs to be better. However the extra charges are ridiculous on Hawaiian. Check in per bag at $70 movies at $12 extra legroom seats at $70 again. I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem. Bags in SFO took ages mitigating an on-time arrival. Sorry Hawaiian but serving sub-standard complimentary food does not allow you to rip off passengers with extra charges and poor service.

I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained.

On the long-haul sector from Keflavík to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so!

Bottles of water were given to us on boarding and drinks were served several times during the flight. There was a delay outbound in Iceland amounting to no more than 45 minutes and one inbound to UK again in Iceland but this was due to problems with weather at Heathrow.

They also take cash on-board (this flight Euro or Krone) which I've never experienced on a international or domestic flight before.

On the positive side they are generally punctual and if you fly one of them new A330-300 and A340-600 then the experience is satisfactory however flying on one of their old A340 (there are still quite a few in service) is a truly miserable experience as the seats are uncomfortable and cramped and the entertainment system is limited to a few screens for the whole cabin. Food is generally speaking mediocre and the crew service ranges from indifferent to fairly polite. I find their policy of charging for selecting a seat and food on European routes really mean and I really wish they stopped doing that.

They system would not let me and I had to call Iberia. An unpleasant agent told me that since I had used a ""travel agent"" (actually on line booking) the ""agent"" had to make to selection and pay the fee. From then on it seemed as if every employee was doing the minimum customer service. When we got on a transatlantic flight the on- board entertainment system (seat back TVs) was on. Many people had their own headphones (they clearly knew the routine on Ibearia) and settled down for a movie. I finally got up and went back to a cabin attendant and asked for a headphone. he very rudely told me they would be passing them out and to sit back down. An hour later (honest) they finally passed out earphones. It was that way the entire flight. When we tried to check in online for a flight the evening before in Seville we could never get the internet system to accept our information. We went to the airport early to check in we went to a ticket agent who was very nice and sent us to the proper flight check in counter but there was no one there and several people in line. I went back to the agent and asked if there was a check in agent. He called and said ""I guess they are not working yet.""

This was a repeat of last years trip and some things have improved others have not. Ground handling at LAS is much better: the staff were there early enough to check-in bags in good time. The A330s are nice enough planes still looking fresh and clean. Seat back screens do not offer a great deal without payment but is better than nothing. The food offered is basic and not very much. Flight was on time. HNL-LIH was again on time for the very short hop. The planes used on inter-Island sectors are not impressive but they do the job. Return was straightforward.

icelandair,/airline-reviews/icelandair,Icelandair customer review,S Bryan,United States,2014-08-14,I flew from Dulles to Keflavik round-trip recently and thought this was one of the better airlines that I had flown with. They had good legroom comfortable seats the flight staff was very courteous the flight was smooth overall the plane was in good repair with excellent in-flight entertainment including several really newly release films that I'd wanted to see. I was impressed. Also I loved the slogans on their seat backs and they had really nice overnight blankets that were much fluffier than what you usually get on planes. It was a cushy ride which was good since one flight was an overnighter. The only thing that could have been improved would have been more food selection which was very minimal with just a few options although what they did have looked good and they had a great drink selection on board. Of course a larger plane also would have been a plus since it was just three seats on each side. Otherwise I would take Icelandair again from the US to Iceland over another airline any day.

LAX-HNL segment on an old but immaculate 767-300. Bulkhead row with plenty of legroom and enough room to change a nappy (diaper) on the floor. Hawaiian Airlines is the only US airline to offer complimentary food in all classes on domestic flights - food was quite tasty. The inflight entertainment was average - for $15 you can rent a cumbersome hand-held unit with 12-15 movies 12-15 TV programmes music videos and audio tracks. The $15 is pretty steep but it's better than standard IFE on other US airlines. HNL-ITO and ITO-HNL on B717-200s which have assigned seats and first class cabin. Service very good and beverages ae offered on the 40 minute flights. HNL-LAX segment with the new A330-200. We upgraded to first class for $300 per seat - recliner seats have adjustable legrests and footrests and recline to about 130 degrees. The controls are non-electronic and the legrests are a bit difficult to push back in place. Food service very good. Hawaiian's first class is very good value for flights to the USA but does not compete with Korean Qantas Delta or the Asian airlines on flights to the Pacific Rim.

iberia,/airline-reviews/iberia,Iberia customer review,Harold Bush-Howard,United Kingdom,2014-06-09,Madrid to Bogotá on 29 May in Business. I find the new business class seat claustrophobic. They are very narrow and I felt trapped especially when I put the seat in bed position. The strange thing is that there is a gap of around 12cm between the seat and the wall which could have been used to make the seat more comfortable and wider. The food as I expected was just ok and boring. Iberia should try to make it catering more interesting. 5 star Michelin chef and everything but the food is not worth it. Before landing we were given surprise surprise the usual selection of dry ham and cheese with bread. Come on I know they are very Spanish and Iberia wants to showcase the best of Spain but please offer something else or spruce up the menu a bit.

iberia,/airline-reviews/iberia,Iberia customer review,K Otto,United Kingdom,2014-05-10,Flew from Madrid (MAD) to Santiago de Chile (SCL) with this airline on May 19th 2014 and was highly disappointed by catering options and on-board entertainment and service. Aircraft: Iberia operates the A340-600 with the old color scheme for this route. Flight Duration: 14hr (due to strong headwinds). Return Flight: same aircraft. Class: Economy. Price: GBP 614 for a return flight from FRA with a 2hr stop in MAD. Inflight entertainment: The were no personal monitors. We were sitting quite far from the big screen at the front row. This made watching the 3 movies shown during the flight difficult. Besides there was a lot of image noise and the screen was flattering occasionally. You could really see a grey noise stripe moving from one end of the screen to another all the time. Food and Beverages: Since we left MAD past midnight Iberia thinks it can skip a meal as it expects the passengers to sleep (what else do you want to do on a 14hr flight without any kind of on-board entertainment). Dinner was served 1hr after departure. Whisky or any other liquor (except beer and wine) was not on the trolley. I was told to kindly wait but nothing happened. We were served breakfast consisting of a dry ham sandwich (white bun no lettuce and butter tasted horrible) ca. 1.5h before arrival in SCL. No meals were served in-between which means 10+ hours without food. We got served a small salami sandwich on the way back as a snack though. But in comparison to what I have experienced flying e.g. Asiana Qantas Lufthansa or even US Airways (not my first choice though) this is absolutely unacceptable. Staff service: You had to go to the kitchen to get a glass of water as no drinks were served in-between too. Not sure what the flights attendants were doing between meals but I haven's seen them offering any refreshments or taking care of the 350+ guests between the meals. Seat comfort: Seats were comfortable and I felt I had more legroom (I am 6.3 190cm) than e.g. on an intercontinental US Airways Delta or Qantas flight. Overall: (7/10). (-) Worst-in-class food poor service and no in-flight entertainment.

Check in very smooth luggage drop good. Most annoying was the outdated seating felt like flying business class in 1988. Seat hardly reclining head rest too short the head side rest had no resistance whatsoever on either side so head was just rolling freely. No leg support. Worst about this was when flying at night the seats are about as comfortable as economy seats due to lack of flap reclination and no leg support. Also dirty table top. The food was ok and service adequate but nothing special. The entertainment unit was old fashioned and unresponsive so always jumping back and forth 2 pages instead of one. Another annoying experience is the lounge in Reykjavik for stop over flights. It is before passport control and US gates. In the lounge no one tells you when to leave or how much of a queue there is for passports so I went when boarding started but was far too early at the gate just standing around. The other time I went later but there was enormous queues for passport control so I had to run afterwards to the gate. The whole purpose of business class is comfort but the lounge placement just adds to stress level.

Very impressed with onboard service and found it interesting that very few pax actually opted to take advantage of the on-board meal purchase which enforces my belief that most pax only eat airline meals because they feel they have paid for it so they should eat whatever is offered. Found the customs / immigration at KEF to be friendly and welcoming which was not the case with the security people at KEF who were anything but friendly and welcoming and quite aggressive with pax. Departure of flight from KEF was on-time as was arrival at LHR with luggage waiting on the carousel. LHR-KEF-SEA check-in and boarding and well organized with friendly staff who went out of their way to solve problems with my seating assignment. Overall impression of Icelandair was very good - they will get more of my business if they continue to offer great fares. Highly recommend Icelandair for anyone looking for good value and those who like me who find the nonstop flights from the west coast of Canada/USA too long and like the thought of having a break after seven hours of flying.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

island,/airline-reviews/island,Island Air customer review,O Alcantara,Mexico,2010-01-07,HNL-JHM I dint have many things to expect from this airline. When I first saw the planes in the Honolulu InterIsland Terminal which I can say they take you a while for security I thought it was not bad. And well first thing I notice is that they dont give you seat numbers. And also that the seat doesn't go back  but really for 30 min. flights is not so necessary. My destination was Kapalua and one reason of why should I fly with them again is the altitude the plane flies. Is not so high and it let you see all the islands and oceans. The only beverage they gave me was water but its ok. The punctuality was not perfect we arrived 7 minutes late but for the baggage is very fast. I recommend you this airline. The only thing is that I flew with them is because the other airport in Maui that also goes Hawaiian Airlines is 1 hour by car from my hotel so maybe if I would been to a nearer place of the other airport I have been used Hawaiian Airlines because is about 30 dollars the ticket cheaper I don't think they charge u for baggage Island Air charges you 10 per piece and the aircraft is a little better.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Inability to choose seats before the flight for certain booking codes is one thing but to allow it on one leg of the trip and not another is odd. After purchasing a RT ticket I was able to chose seats for the outbound flight. When I inquired about seats for the return trip I was told that the fare did not allow it. I even offered to pay to be able to select a seat and was told that I would have to pay over $600. $250 of that was a penalty for changing the ticket? Really?

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,T Harvey,Canada,2015-03-19,YVR-OGG - A brand new Boeing 737 plane with a spacious interior look/feel. The staff were professional and courteous and the overall flight experience and passengers mood was calm. The legroom was great due to WestJet putting in new slim seats but these were a bit hard and uncomfortable on your posterior. The other negative aspect was the complete lack of in-flight entertainment system! The reason given was that WestJet is rolling-out a new entertainment system where you can use your smartphones/tablets but this wasn't ready yet. They did however rent tablets with pre-loaded movies which seemed were quickly snapped up and looks like an extra way for them to make cash. It was frustrating that there wasn't even the moving map being displayed on flip-down screens (which didn't appear to be installed on that plane).

Im 6ft 5 and pretty thin so the width of the seat didn't bother me but if you are even slightly overweight I think you would find the seats uncomfortable. Service of staff on JAL is exceptional they are so wonderful happy and willing to help. This was a night flight but I didn't sleep.

Pre - booked seats as well - these and hold baggage were extra of course but then what 'low cost' airline gives them away for free.

It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight.

We stood outside for 40 minutes then we were told to queue at desk 19 (20 and 21 were also being used). The queue never moved so we finally got hold of the jet2 rep who didn't seem to know what the hold up was. There was nobody processing anyone at desk 19. The rep came back after many more passengers had stopped her to find out what was going on she mentioned someone had got on a wrong flight and that was the hold up. We had to join a queue that was actually moving we spent an hour in the queue. Then went on to security which was about 20mins and finally up to the departure lounge where we had just purchased a coffee when we were told we had to board the aircraft.

Excellent legroom both outbound and return flights on time and the online check in service was easy to use and saved us a lot of time in the airport as we were travelling with hand luggage only. The 2nd return trip was taken with my wife and 8 month old son. Outbound flight on the same Titan Airways A320 and once again on time. Online check in was unavailable as we were travelling with an infant but I was still able to pre book my seats and check in was a breeze at both airports and took less than 5 minutes. Once on board our outbound flight we realised that the back of the cabin where we were was mainly rowdy youngsters off to San Antonio and at the front of the plane mainly families. Without us even asking and despite the flight being almost full the attendant told us row 8 had 3 spare seats next to each other and we were welcome to sit there once the seat belt sign was switched off. As soon as the captain allowed passengers to move around the cabin she came straight over and told us we could move down to the front and even helped us with our baggage. The return flight was on a Jet2 Boeing 737-300 and although it was clearly an old aircraft it was clean well maintained and once again on time.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,A Murray,United Kingdom,2008-03-17,LTN-EWR Return. We just flew this airline for the first time and can strongly recommend it. We caught a train (frequent service) to Luton Parkway from central London and were transferred to the Silverjet terminal by complimentary taxi. All relatively straightforward. Check in was the best I have ever experienced- staff take your passport and whilst you sit in the lounge enjoying breakfast they complete the check in procedure. Very stress free. Our outgoing flight was an hour late in departing due to adverse weather conditions but passengers were kept updated and the pilot himself came into the lounge to introduce himself and explain what was happening. This was representative of the whole experience - staff friendly (they ask onboard how you wish to be addressed) and courteous but informal which is a very pleasant departure from other airlines I have been on. Food was better on the outbound leg and the departure lounge in New York is a little small but overall this was one of the best airline experiences I have ever had and despite the inconvenience of leaving from Luton will certainly be using them again.

Check-in and boarding at Luton was incredibly easy and personal and the private terminal was very comfortable and spacious with very nice shower facilities (food not worth mentioning). This makes up for the headache of accessing Luton airport from Central London. Onboard food was below par. The cabin although comfortable and new was nearly empty on this flight. Arrival at the VIP terminal in itself almost makes the entire trip worth it as there is no hassle or waiting in Dubai's notorious passport control queues. However there was some confusion in finding where to go as this is currently the only commercial airline that uses this terminal and Silverjet staffing here was sparse. After wandering into a private waiting area a few of us were ushered upstairs by a non- Silverjet employee to the correct facility. Agents casually take your boarding passes and return them to you as you relax in the very upscale facility. However their Dubai lounge inconveniently lacks shower facilities and the staff is not subtle about rushing you out as they have shift focus to greeting departing passengers going back to Luton.

Although the inbound flight was early and boarding started 45 minutes before the scheduled departure time we still left late due to the fiasco of boarding a full plane. Row numbers for boarding were announced to get the passengers at the back on to the plane first but nobody could here what the Spanish ground staff were saying so everyone just rushed to get on. The size of carry on bags is now becoming a big problem for Jet2 and they need to police this better. At check in we were asked if we wanted to check-in one of our 'wheely' cabin bags for free which we were more than happy to do. But obviously most passenger didn't and it was just chaos!

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,David Ellis,United Kingdom,2007-09-15,LUT-EWR-LUT. Outward journey was thoroughly impressive from start to finish. The car valet service happened without a hitch and check-in was over in a minute. The Luton lounge is spacious and comfortable and the 95% occupancy for the flight seemed to be accommodated easily. Security was a breeze and the private bus service to the plane was efficient. On board staff were friendly and attentive throughout and really seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Food was actually as good as I've ever had on a business class flight and the individual attention given to preparing and plating up the food seemed to make a real difference. Immigration and baggage collection at Newark was efficient and our pre-booked chauffeured limo was pretty much ready and waiting. The return journey didn't start too well because of the overcrowding in the Newark lounge. The flight was again full apart from a few seats and the lounge couldn't handle this. I've heard that a new lounge is due to open soon but Silverjet haven't confirmed this. The Silverjet CEO was actually on the flight so hopefully he'll have realised first-hand how unacceptable the current situation is. Take-off was delayed by about an hour because of air traffic control issues. The service on board didn't seem quite as polished as the outbound flight and the food was only average. Sensibly Silverjet offer a two-course meal on the night flight so that one can get the maximum amount of sleep. As others have commented the seats are far from truly flat but comfort wise they're not bad and we both managed to get some sleep. Breakfast is a sort of on board 'take out' i.e. yohourt smoothie fruit and a choice of cheese and ham stuffed croissant or cream cheese bagel in a bag. Not really my ideal for breakfast but probably better than a ghastly reheated omelette and hash browns and certainly easier for the FAs to dispense 40 minutes before landing. Baggage handling at Luton again let the side down but the car valet service was as efficient as on the outward journey. Overall I'd rate Silverjet very highly; better then MAXjet not quite at the level of EOS but then it's half the price.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,John Oram,NA,2007-06-13,So inadequate were Maxjet's replies to my two e-mails on disrupted seating assignments that I have written to their Customer Services VP an address provided in their onboard literature. Maxjet are offering a dood fare good seat and pretty good food but let themselves down badly on reliability timekeeping and customer service. The comment on the good seat does not apply to 8D/F which they should not be selling as their regular product. My battles on changed seat assignments continued at LAS. It appears that the Reservations department do not fully understand the impact of aircraft changes some of which occur because of Maxjet's flaky reliability. The inbound aircraft was late but still had time to go out on time at 5pm. However they were always chasing the clock when the cabin crew were boarded late perhaps because of the TSA. We didn't push back until 5.15 and then had a 20min taxi. One thing that goes straight out of the window with time constraints is the canape service which I have not seen in a while. I imagine they are loaded so am I to understand that they are simply wasted? Maxjet show an overall time of 10hrs LAS-STN which I think is actually unachievable given the time factors at LAS and flight on two engines. The pilot made a bizarre departure announcement that the forecast weather for London was 54 degrees (F) and must have been reading an actual rather than a forecast. My lobster was unexpected and very good but it would have taken more than an agreeable crustacean to improve my overall impression of Maxjet on my 4th round trip.

Rubbish lolly wrappers under seat in front. Return flight cancellation announced on almost indecipherable loudspeaker only 10 mins before boarding time then flashed up on screen at Boarding Gate. Such late notice (none received by SMS) left many stranded and those with already checked in baggage unable to transfer to another airline in time. We were forced to sit at airport an additional 4 hours to be seated on their next plane. Staff claimed Captain had called in sick. Surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in. To cap it off purported staff shortage on arrival at Tullamarine meant a further delay as cabin crew unable to open doors to allow already disgruntled passengers to disembark. No apologies. Not even an offer of a complimentary tea coffee or water in flight for those affected. Very bad PR. Don't try to speak to Senior Management about your experience or have them contact you - Jetstar claim they have no direct line. First and last time we travel with this airline.

Everyone knows that Christmas week is very busy with long queues at the airport but Jetstar could make it much easier for passengers at Tullamarine by having a dedicated bag drop queue. Then there would be some point to checking in at home. The long queue that I had to join included both people who had already checked in and others who hadn't. After being called out of the queue to catch my plane there was a long wait in the airless dungeon that passes for Jetstar's terminal - then a late gate change which led us back into the Qantas terminal -- and then a long motionless queue with no information. Finally we were able to board around 30 minutes late. Once on the plane the journey was fine. The seat was comfortable and the service was friendly. There was a long wait at Hobart for luggage probably due to the arrival of another Jetstar aircraft minutes before ours. The return journey could not have been more different. Quick efficient check-in and boarding a comfortable seat (I was offered an exit row seat at check-in) and arrival in Melbourne 20 minutes early. However at baggage pick-up we followed the signs to carousel 1 where we waited for a long time before finding out that our luggage was spinning around carousel 4 (with no signs).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,4,0,0,NA,NA,4,1

Yesterday October 13th 2014 I copped another dose of Jetstars incompetence and attitude to its passengers. Supposed flying JQ413 at3pm to Sydney - arrived at 2pm. At 2.30pm an announcement made that the flight was cancelled (with no explanation) and that we were to be bussed 100km to Brisbane to join JQ817 to Sydney which didn't depart until 6.30pm.

KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible. The flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. All in all one of the worst experiences I have had with KLM.

Formerly I have flew the 777-200 with 3x3x3 option and found that very comfortable. The 3x4x3 is not ideal.

Once on board any size or weight of take-on baggage seems acceptable so that we were told to keep our reasonable sized bags around our feet so that other people who had got large bulging bags on board could stow theirs in the overhead lockers. The seat seemed to have a slightly greater pitch than on the Jetstar A321. The flight operated 20 minutes late but was generally a pleasant experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,0,0,NA,NA,4,1

KLM must have the smallest seats granted by law. Flight was on time crew were friendly only one negatives on the flight out the little box proudly claiming Dutch Cheese on the dinner tray was a wedge of processed Melrose. The return flight goes over Lusaka to Harare and then back to Lusaka. While waiting an hour on the plane in Harare the mass cleaning crew come on board you can't use the toilets no drinks are served you feel like you're in the way as you lift your legs for the vacuum cleaner. Emirates also fly the Lusaka / Harare route but at least have the consideration to stop in Lusaka then Harare so the plane is empty for cleaning before setting off again. Premium economy offers little for the extra cost.

Although I'm a Flying Blue member I do travel with other airlines so I think I can assess KLM position to other benchmarks. I am actually quite satisfied with KLM. Service is above average too often it's the passenger being rude. Food is ok not better not worse it's an airplane after all. Personally I think KLM is ahead of many competitors when it comes to online check in and self-service luggage drop-off (at least at their home-base AMS) it's far more advanced and smooth than most airlines. Although my last flight was in a 737 without entertainment I know that their entire long-haul fleet now has proper personal entertainment systems so that's good. They were a bit late on their 747s though. I will use them in the future. It's important to distinguish what you can attribute to an airline and what to an airport or worse your own behavior.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Pleasant flight crew courteous in a mechanical kind of way biscuit tea and coffee were served. Amsterdam to Montreal was on MD-11 which surprised me since I didn't think that they were still in service. Food was adequate crew friendlier than those from Norwich. However after getting over the novelty of MD-11 I think KLM should seriously think of replacing them on such a busy long route as Montreal. The seats are excellent and roomy however this is a long trans-atlantic flight and putting an aircraft with no individual IFE's on it is inexcusable.

For a limited amount (10-20 euro depending of your Flying Blue status) you can get a premium economy seat on the 737's resulting in 4 inch of extra space making the seat very comfortable. If you're lucky you even can get a seat with extra space in economy if business usage is limited and classes shift forward. Seats on the Embraer are fine as well mostly as it is a 2+2 layout. KLM staff are in general very friendly and often call me by name. Drinks service is ok always giving 2 drinks sometimes even an extra round. Snacks unfortunately are a shame often only providing a small bag of cookies. On the morning flights there is sometimes a sandwich but always the same (cheese spread).

Although the configuration was 3-3-3, the seats felt rather cramped due to the premium cabins covering half the aircraft which surprised me. The Asian vegetarian meal I ordered was great and staff efficiency was excellent. Inflight entertainment only featured Korean, Japanese and Chinese films in addition to Hollywood which I felt was rather limited. Would have been better if there were other language films such as Indian on board since KE recently announced its intentions to expand in India. Transit in ICN was hassle free and easy to locate gates with lots of shopping and Korean cultural experiences. ICN to CTS was a brand new A330-300 and felt way more comfortable than the B777-300ER as I heard the premium cabin is one of the smallest in Korean Air.

As this was going to inconvenience me I tried calling them to see if I could reschedule. This is where I saw how abysmal Kulula after sales service is. After listening to 25 minutes of inane drivel (at R2.40 a minute) telling me how wonderful their service is and how all their agents were just waiting to pick up the phone and help me I gave up. Later I contacted the office at George Airport where the response was unhelpful and I was offered a refund. The alternative SAA flight would have at that point cost me R800 more. I wish I had booked SAA from the beginning but foolishly thought it was worth saving some money. That said I understand that flights can be delayed I was notified in advance and when I checked in I was given a R250 voucher to use on a future Kulula booking and the service and flight were satisfactory.

Pet hate number one: all window shades had to be closed and lights turned off during the 10 hour day flight. Uncomfortable seat despite the generous 34"" pitch. Limited IFE choices. Bibimbap is the only meal worth considering. My seat mates' western choices looked very pedestrian. Cabin crew mostly young with very limited English and all service seemed very rushed and chaotic. They did spring immediately whenever people rang the call buttons. Drinks (soft and hard) were half pours in 200ml plastic cups. Overnight ICN to JFK on a much newer 777 was more comfortable. Same level of clumsy but well-intentioned service. Some mediocre entertainment choices but on a newer and more user-friendly system than the 747. Seatbelt sign was turned on at the slightest hint of light chop throughout the flight. Cabin crew stationed permanently at the lavs directing traffic and ensuring they're kept reasonably clean. JFK-ICN on A380. Seats as comfortable as they get for economy class and like the 777 great entertainment hardware but limited choice. More bibimbap. More sips of drinks from small cups. Another day flight with enforced darkness. Quick and simple transfer at ICN. Paid lounge access upstairs for USD22 is a good option and free showers available to all passengers adjacent to the lounge. ICN-SYD back to the old 747. Bibimbap for dinner on departure. Uncomfortable seat. Same service not unfriendly just impersonal and very ""green"". Another pet hate: breakfast was served a good three hours out of Sydney and cleared up with two hours left to go so lights turned off and blinds to remain closed.

LAN's facilities at JFK are way below standard and they can't handle the slightest problem. While there were weather issues on both ends of our trip they did not justify the poor handling of flights by LAN. On the outgoing flight there were 3 planes loads of passengers waiting at one gate at JFK. This is close to 1000 people all expecting to fly out. It appears LAN only has one gate at JFK. Also they seem to be dependent on American Airlines to service their planes. When something goes wrong like the weather American will of course service their own planes first. The counter staff continually lied to everyone about the situation. The only truthful statement they made was that the flights were not cancelled. When our plane finally was ready to board 7 hours late all 1000 people were trying to figure out what flight was boarding because the lighted sign was wrong and still said all flights were on time. Finally someone taped a paper sign over the lighted sign to say what flight was boarding. Our flight was first of 3 and we were 7 hours late. I have no idea how long the other folks waited. On the return flight the Captain proudly announced we landed at JFK on time. However we sat in the plane for 2.5 hours on the tarmac because there were no gates. Finally to avoid being fined (after 3 hours) they unloaded us on the tarmac and bussed us to the terminal. Why didn't they do that 2 hours earlier? I will never fly LAN in the US again. They don't have the facilities and depend on American which itself is another story. Our experience in South America has been much better.

They are obviously aware of this problem because on both journeys the crew moved all passengers (including us) out of rows 6 and 7 into the forward cabin (rows 1 to 5) where we were much more comfortable. However we were in rows 6 and 7 for the short legs from Sydney to Auckland and vice versa where we had to use blankets over our shoulders to keep warm. We greatly enjoyed our flight in the LAN Dreamliner from Buenos Aires to Santiago. It's a much more comfortable plane than the A340. The lounge in Santiago is quite basic. It's narrow and in a basement but offers some chance to relax. The lounges in Buenos Aires and Auckland (Qantas lounge) are far superior.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,5,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

All flights operated on time and the service was friendly and efficient. Pleasant meals and snacks were served. The plane on our first sector was a bit old and tatty inside the others were all fine though the seat on the 5-hr sector from Lima to Havana was rather tight for such a long sector. Check-in boarding and luggage delivery were all efficient and all flights arrived on time or early. The Premium Economy seats are Economy seats with the middle seat left empty. A Business Class meal was served on our international Premium Economy sector. One sour note was the way the entire crew (including the captain and first officer) pushed past their passengers in Havana to get to the front of the immigration queue.

On the day of my flight I was shocked when I discovered that there was a 12 hour delay! After spending hours on the phone I was finally re- routed via Miami and ended up rushing out the door to catch this new flight. I was lucky to end up making it to Lima on time. It's a shame that I spent extra money to have the direct flight but ended up having to make a stressful connection (with a very long layover).

No queues for check-in at Heathrow and a very small 10 minute wait at JFK. Boarding a little messy in Heathrow due to the small number of seats available but this is BAA's problem and not Kuwait's. Hot snacks and a hot meal served on LHR-JFK leg with a hot meal and cooked breakfast with fruit served on JFK-LHR.

Flight from ICN to REP was on a B737 900 longest flight I have done on a 737 just over 5 hours! This stretched 737 is cramped for international medium/long haul work in my opinion.

This one and-a-bit hour flight was due to leave at 1430. Be aware that when you fly on Libyan Arab Airlines you will be bussed to a very distressed 30 year old 727-200. We boarded the plane only half an hour late because of a “security” agent in dark glasses and an Armani- type suit (jacket draped over the shoulders) who laboriously checked documents of all passengers on the 40 degree tarmac. The interior of the plane was so hot probably 50 degrees) that the older passengers were dropping like flies which further delayed the departure by a couple of hours. Sitting beside me fanning himself at high speed (the interior was now like 120 large beserk butterflies) was a flight engineer for LN who explained that there were no spare parts for the Auxiliary Power Unit that provides the AC so that’s why it was hot. I thought that this was not the moment to ask if there could be similar spares shortages for the main engines. People perked up above 10000 feet when they recovered and the cabin crew were not as aggressive as they were on the ground. Your heart goes out to these folks who are on these planes it’s both unpleasant and dangerous work.

Dusseldorf Check-in took less than 5 minutes including waiting in line. The flight between Dusseldorf and Teheran was on time flight attendants very polite and helpful. The food quality is medium as most airlines they seem to save money on food cost. The food quantity is still more than enough. The 3 hour transfer in Teheran is just long enough to stretch the legs and enjoy the voucher to buy some cake or sandwich in the coffee shop. Tax free shopping is limited so it is easier to resist the temptation to spend money - extra bonus is the free Wireless Internet in the terminal. Unfortunately the Iranian internet is censored but normal surfing and email works well. Teheran to Bangkok had about 3 hours delay. The majority of travellers were Iranians and they all stayed calm and nobody complained or started to ask question. The flight was a Boeing 747 and was fully packed. The food quality was the same as in the first leg not premium quality but the quantity is OK. Bangkok to Teheran. I was shocked when I arrived at the check-in at the airport. I have never seen such a long line waiting. Fortunately the passengers with final destination Dusseldorf had a separate check-in desk so had to wait less than 10 mins.

The flight is slightly delayed for about 30 mins waiting for air traffic controller's authorisation for departure. Cabin is clean and seat is only as comfortable as any economy seat can be. Inflight meal: got a pleasant surprise of satay being served to all economy passengers. Although only a very small portion it is a remarkably nice effort. Both lunch and dinner are adequately proportion edible nice. Seated at 80G the flight attendant in charge of that aisle was excellent.

Cannot fault this low cost carrier departed on time fair legroom on way out much better on return with an emergency seat. Snacks on board were reasonable cost though Mango was let down by the airport baggage claim at both ends. By far the worst was Bloemfontein having to wait just short of 45 minutes. Taking into account that the Mango plane was the only plane there and that it was a 2 min walk from the plane to the baggage reclaim I was sorely tempted to walk back to the plane and get the bag off myself. As for Cape Town there were 4 conveyors to pick from but they loaded/mixed the bags on the conveyor that had baggage from another flight hence major confusion.

Found Meridiana staff disinterested in passengers and more concerned with how they were looking in as much as they allowed the passenger sitting outside of me to keep two large bags at her feet which made it almost impossible for me to get out. This happened on our flight to Florence and back to Gatwick where this practise seemed the norm.

Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person.

The plane was immaculately new the staff were lovely and professional but the leg room is so bad. There are other budget airlines out there with much better leg room. All in all a quick 4 hour 50 minute trip down and an okay 5 hours 40 minutes on the way back but I am nearly 6 foot and it is quite trying on a near 6 hour flight with no entertainment and a 3 x 3 layout on a rather long medium haul flight. I like Monarch for the price and flexible flight times and I know they have suffered recently with the economy and cut backs it is a huge shame that Sharm El Sheikh Hurghada and Banjul is not served by bigger planes.

The food is mediocre (breakfast during an 8 hour flight consists of a soggy chicken pasty and no hot drinks). Despite relatively calm flights on all 6 sectors I was offered tea just once due to the seatbelt signs being illuminated for most of the flights on all 6 sectors (which the majority of passengers ignored but the cabin crew ignored their non compliance).

Previous experiences with airline had been mixed. Overall their Business product doesn't have the polish of Emirates or Singapore but is a satisfactory alternative given the price. 777 MEL-KUL A380 KUL-CDG-KUL and then A330 KUL-MEL. 777 is aged but found it very comfortable (more so than the much newer A330). A380 was spacious and seat was good. A330 seemed more cramped than either 777 or A380 and lacked privacy. All flights had good service. Food varied from good to excellent and there was always plenty of it. IFE was a weak spot with not much of any interest to me. Lounges too were mediocre even in KLIA which surprised me being home base.

They had a special offer on pre-booked meals so took advantage of the offer. I wasn't expecting much in quality but was pleasantly surprised how good and tasty the whole meal was and it even included a free Kenco coffee which would have cost us £2.50 anyway so for £7.00 excellent value for money. Cabin crew were very attentive and pretty much refrained from the shouting offers that you get on Jet 2 flights. Return flight was affected by ATC strikes but was reassured to receive a text message from Monarch on the morning of departure advising that our flight was still operating although it may be subject to delay. They pulled out all the stops and we returned 2 hours late. This is the first time I have flown with Monarch for quite a few years and they are definitely a cut above other low cost airlines. I just hope that they expand their destinations from Leeds Bradford even more as Jet 2 and their ancient 'planes are becoming too complacent.

Unpolished and unfriendly on way back. Food terrible; brunch of vegetable fritatta with chicken sausage truly revolting and almost the only meal I haven't been able to eat in my life!

A few days before we were due to fly we received a telephone call to say that the flight had been put to 5.30 pm which we were not very happy about. When we arrived at the airport we were informed at check in that the flight would not be leaving until 7.40 pm. We eventually departed at 8.45 pm 6 hours and 45 minutes after our original time. Most of the other passengers were grumbling and it seemed pretty clear that the original flight of 2pm had been taken off. We finally arrived at our hotel at 2 am local time after setting off from our home at 2 pm the previous day. The seats were so closely packed together that my knees were up against the seat in front we could barely get the trays down in front of us and it was impossible to recline the seats as that would have given no room for the people behind us. To add to this the stewards wheeling the trolleys met right against our seats and were there for about 20 minutes constantly opening the metal doors to get out items and letting the doors bang against our seats.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,2,4,0,NA,NA,2,0

In fact there seemed to be more babies and toddlers in this cabin than elsewhere on the aircraft! Overall the flight was fine which is probably about as much as you can hope for in Y class. Crew were efficient food was adequate although I'd have preferred sandwiches and a piece of fruit in the snack pack rather than peanuts and cookies.

The cabin crew did a really good job but when someone reclines it makes you feel claustrophobic so you need to stand up for a while then there is a problem. For anyone who wants to fly this airline between Hong Kong and KL I would recommend going for one of the earlier services on the A330-300 or the A380 where the seat configuration is more suitable.

I wasn't expecting luxury but when the lady in front of me reclined her seat immediately after take off my journey became very uncomfortable. This wasn't helped by the seat pitch being very small in the first place and the pocket on the seat being bent and broken and digging into my knees for the whole flight. This was a morning flight so there was no need to recline. I would suggest to Monarch if they insist on packing so many people in and having small seat pitches to follow in the steps of EasyJet and have seats that don't recline as unfortunately it seems that many people can't get to grips with good manners and common decency. Just think would you be happy if somebody did that to you! Easy really.

This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines.

Coming home we booked seats at the front with extra legroom. On arrival at Hurghada airport we were all given a letter telling us we were being diverted to Rome as the plane would encounter very strong headwinds and was incapable of holding enough fuel to get us back to the UK.

Then informed by the captain that once we landed in Rome there was a standby crew that had been flown from Gatwick waiting for us - Monarch must have known well in advance this was going to happen.

No information provided about delay to any passengers from Nok air staff about delay or when incoming aircraft likely to arrive - dependant on information on internet instead. Buriram - Bangkok 5/1 worst of the 3. No information about issues until arrive at airport. Told flight cancelled - after much arguing between all passengers and staff offered alternative of flight to Ubon and then minibus back to Buriram with cost of ticket refunded. Originally scheduled to arrive 3.10 arrived Buriram at 11pm instead. Very disappointed with Nok Air this trip not only with issues but with lack of honesty about cause and information on delays being provided in an accurate manner. The issues have arisen due to one of the leased aircraft developing a major fault causing numerous cancellations and knock-on delays but would like to have been told this. Being a big supporter of Nok Air previously I am disappointed by this. Hope they get back to previous standard in future as this is the only flight option to Buriram.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,2,2,1,NA,NA,4,0
nok-air,/airline-reviews/nok-air,Nok Air customer review,James Choochot,United Kingdom,2013-11-29,Online booking and check-in easy to use. Don Muang to Chiang Rai and return on B737-800. Only economy option. No inflight entertainment but soft drinks and small snack served for free. There was an option to purchase other foodstuffs and drinks from the trolley. Quick check-in and luggage collection at both ends. Please note that when booking online you must de-select extra luggage and insurance or these will be charged for. Free 15kgs luggage included. If your trip might involve changes to your itinerary it's well worth paying a few extra baht to buy a flexi ticket. Otherwise you have to buy a new ticket in most cases. On landing you receive a text message thanking you for flying with them and asking you to report any problems or concerns with their service! Certainly we had no such concerns.

nok-air,/airline-reviews/nok-air,Nok Air customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2013-10-09,BFV-DMK. One of three flights a week on a 36 seater Saab from Buriram to Don Muang. No queue for check-in due to very few people in the airport. Slightly dubious the luggage scales were correct given a subsequent Air Asia flight and had to pay 400 bht for a couple of kilos extra luggage - not a big deal given the price of the flights booked (1100 bht all in) but disappointing none the less in hindsight. Other than that an excellent value for money flight which arrived early and had the usual free snack and water provided during the 40 mins in the air.

I flew them all over Asia out of their KL hub for several weeks. I was shocked to receive an e-mail from them notifying me of a major schedule change and cancellation of one leg from my trip just a few days before leaving! Customer service was mediocre over the phone. No compensation given for this huge hassle which caused a very long layover at KLIA. Food was offered even on short flights but it did not taste very good and wasn't presented well. The service onboard was pretty good and attendants were generally very helpful.

One appeared to be leased from PIA and was clearly older than me by quite some way. The biggest problem with the OX service was the toilets - it would appear that they clean them in BKK but not in HKG - perhaps the services are too expensive in HKG. So even when we got on to the plane the toilets were horrible. One steward took the student approach of holding his nose opening the door spraying in a load of deodorant and closing the door again. Nice. We have flown OX before but I don't think we would again. Before they were just endearingly rubbish but they really seem to have gone downhill. Part of the problem is the passengers: no-one seemed to have a clue that you're not supposed to stand up during final approach or that it's rude to recline your chair into someone's face as soon as you sit down or that you should fill in your immigration form before you get the immigration counter or that you should queue to get on and off the plane or that you shouldn't commute with people 10 rows behind you by shouting. As far as your fellow passengers are concerned it's the worst airline I've flown on. I do feel quite sorry for the cabin crew: they really have their work cut out.

We flew with Norwegian as part of a package holiday booked through Monarch. At first we were surprised that we were flying with Norwegian instead of Monarch due to Monarchs flights being full. We were a bit concerned when we found out that the airline was a low cost airline but we were extremely impressed. Our outbound flight was on the 29/8/14. We used there self-service check in and it took no more than two minutes to print our boarding pass and drop our bags off and we were through security and airside within 5 minutes. The flight was 10 minutes delayed but the flight still managed to land so early that our coach wasn't even ready for us. Coming back on the 5/9/14 check-in was a nightmare we were in the middle of the queue for check in and still had to wait over 50 minutes it was only after about 30 minutes that they decided to open another check-in desk taking it up to two. The flight however still managed to board quickly and pushed back 10 minutes early. The aircraft we flew on was fairly new and had Boeings new cabin lighting which was really relaxing and changed colours. Cabin crew were smart professional and friendly and although you had to buy your own drinks and snack on the flight (very expensive but it's how they make their money) the service was very good. The plane had wifi and they use the wifi to display the flight details and flight map rather than on the overhead screens. Inflight entertainment was available on your phone/ipad/laptop for 7 euro but for a part of the flight they had short films playing on the screens such as Tom and Jerry.

However I have to say that the whole experience was as good as economy class air travel gets these days. Norwegian is using the budget airline model for this service so if you have to be realistic in that you will either have to pay for everything or take it yourself (drinks snacks pillows blankets etc.). We did a combination of both. All the staff we dealt with were professional and polite we travelled on the Dreamliner both ways which was comfortable and had no issues with the entertainment systems that others have described. We were delayed on the return leg of the journey however this was not the airlines fault as someone had checked a bag and then not turned up for the flight we had to wait while their bags were removed. My only negative comment is that Norwegian put the time of the return flight back by several hours after we had made our reservations. Although we had a lot of notice of this and were offered the option to cancel the flight we were unable to re-arrange our plans as we had already booked connecting flights etc. As we were travelling with young children this was a real pain.

The food was really good but for the 'snack' the cheese and onion sandwich didn't tempt me (the muffin was tasty though).

Got the call to go to the gate at 3 when we got on the plane we sat on the runway for 2 hours cause they had to wait for fuel. The staff were nice enough on the plane but by that point everyone on the flight was annoyed and irate after being delayed for 9 hours. It was meant to be the Dreamliner but of course it wasn't. Coming back we were delayed by 20 mins which was fine considering what we had entitled on the way there. If you get the Dreamliner it's a really nice plane with comfy seats and plenty leg room but I for one will never be flying with this company again.

Of course I was only notified of the cancellation when I was in a taxi half way to the airport. I paid $1450 for my flight to Chicago due to booking only 5 days in advance. In addition Porter charged me $26 each way for the one bag I checked. On the return flight 0392 on Dec 10 2014 my bag was 1 kilo (2.2 lbs) over the limit. I was told I could remove weight or pay an additional $75 excess bag fee. At the same time the passenger at check in next to me was advised that he should carry on the bag he was going to check because it was below the carry on weight. I removed some items from my bag and went back to check in. The check-in agent advised me that my bag was now 1 kilo under and would I like to put anything back in my bag. What a joke. Absolutely no common sense with respect to the check-in agent. The flight was half empty so weight and balance was not an issue. Flight left about 10 minutes late and after 20 minutes in the air the captain came on the PA system to advise that a latch had come loose on the cargo door and we would be required to return to Chicago. Another 'mechanical' issue I suppose. Flight eventually left one hour later so that we arrived about 2 hours late.

We then spent a lovely weekend on Zanzibar which was completely ruined when it took Precision over 14 hours to fly us home from Zanzibar to Kilimanjaro (a 1 hour flight). The worst however was when they cancelled our flight to Entebbe (where we had connections to Dubai) and did not advise us. When we got to the airport they advised this flight had not been operating for over 3 months yet the airline did not advise us! They rushed us onto another flight via Nairobi but refused to check our luggage through even though we did not have visas for Uganda - all they wanted was to get us out of their way! As expected once we got to Entebbe we had endless problems trying to get our luggage then were advised that our tickets were not issued properly and Emirates would not let us on our flight to Dubai. We were stranded for over 24 hours in Entebbe and neither Precision or Emirates did anything to assist. My advice as a seasoned traveller to Africa and Tanzania.

There was to be a 40 minute stopover at Istanbul which turned out to be 2 1/4 hours. We paid extra for our seats as my wife is disabled and requires an aisle seat and pre-board pre-board apparently means half way through normal boarding! When we eventually got on board we found a Turkish man sitting in my wife's seat and he would not move when my wife said to the flight attendant that he could stay there if he paid her the £30 she had paid for the seat he practically ran to another seat. All the luggage on the plane was offloaded at Istanbul it was then supposedly sorted into two groups one group for those leaving the plane and one for those passengers flying on to Ercan and then the additional luggage of the passengers joining the plane at Istanbul for Ercan.

Coming home was even worse no representative at Ercan 1 1/2 Hours queuing at check in no seats for waiting no disabled assistance. Never again will we fly Pegasus or go through Ercan.

I flew Philippine airlines Jakarta to Manila and Manila to London on July 5 2014. The latter leg is a 14.5 hour flight. Having read some of the reviews on this site I was an exceptionally reluctant flier and in fact protested belatedly at the choice of airline. I will be apologising to my agent for my complaints. The service on the flight was exceptional staff were professional courteous and always helpful in spite of some difficult requests (I chose to anticipate change in time zones by sleeping and eating at all the wrong times). The food was great wine was good cabin and toilets spotless. Although the seats don't recline all the way it is flat bed at a slight angle and perfectly acceptable for sleeping. They have a relatively sparse choice of inflight movies and shows only somewhat compensated for with loan iPads for the flight with additional choices so if are a big consumer of inflight entertainment it may be worth bringing your own especially given the length of the flight. Both flights were on time transfer at Manila faultless if surprisingly personal (escort for most of it) - this in spite of only a 1hour 10 minute layover. Check-in at Jakarta is through a dedicated business class channel which includes immigration. In all a great experience.

But really 20 years ago all the airlines offered a snack lunch free drinks and in a jet. The Toronto Island Airport is a great location but it will be nice when there are some facilities before security to allow people to visit before going through security.

We had less than 45 minutes to clear immigration and security before boarding so we ran up. They then informed us that Philippine airlines does not take credit cards over the phone so we could not have prepaid we had to run down to a money exchange to exchange Thai Baht and then go back to the check in counter. I have never encountered a more disorganized and unfriendly airline. We arrived into Manila and it only got worse. We were ushered into a dirty holding area after presenting our boarding passes at the transit desk and then us and a small group of people traveling to SFO were walked into our terminal where our next flight would depart in 4 hours. We then realized that we were completely trapped for 4 hours between 6-10.30pm in a terminal with no food other than a disgusting hot dog stand that only accepted Philippine quezos.

As soon as I realized the situation I walked up to make my request. They then told me that could only be done 72 hours before! But it cannot be done online because nothing can with this airline.

PAL doesn't have online check in for international flights. Fortunately flight was fairly empty and an early morning flight and check in meant that the airport was not as crowded as usual. Painless going through check in with a full compliment of baggage from the family (wife and 3 kids). Immigration and security was a breeze. Because of the few number of passengers on this 6am flight boarding was easy. In fact the plane was fully loaded a good 20 mins before scheduled push back from the terminal. The good part of the flight ended there. I knew beforehand that there was no personal entertainment on PAL's A330 so I loaded the kids' gadgets with entertainment to keep them occupied for the 3 plus hour flight (an eternity in kids' clocks). What ruined the flight for me was the FAs attitudes of just going through the motions of completing the cabin service. It was rushed and no effort was made to accommodate passengers' requests. My wife's aisle cart ran out of the beef option but mine was stocked with it. When she requested for the beef she was merely told they ran out. I had to point out to the FA in her aisle to get the selection from the other cart. The food was pretty tasty for airline food though. Twice requested for coffee and it never came. No after meal drink run and the FAs were just in the galley chatting away. I recall the time when the saving grace of Philippine Airlines was the friendly and efficient service of the staff. Now they seem to even be losing that.

Negatives were that both flights left around half an hour late with limited announcements and no obvious cause for delays other than the ""late arrival of the incoming flight"" mantra which airlines love bandying about these days. I'm not aware of being late to your last appointment being an acceptable excuse for being late to your next one in any other form of human activity. The other negative is the Qantas approach to pre-booked online seating. The tactic seems to be to open up very few seats in the hope that you will select an emergency exit at extra cost. I am happy so long as I have an aisle seat which took a bit of negotiation both flights and meant sitting next to the rear toilets.

Today I had the misfortune to do GLT-ROK-MKY-TSV-CNS. Both cabin crew yawned all the way. I wanted to apologise for keeping them awake. Their social chatter was their focus. The flight was of course late out of GLT but at every intermediate port there was no effort from flight or ground crews to make up time. If at all possible travel using BNE as a hub instead of the coastal nightmare and use VB for service and efficiency. The days of Qantaslink are surely numbered as VB progressively take them on.

Manual check-in only at Edinburgh as they do not offer online check-in however no queues. Older B737-300 and did not have wifi available. They did have the new slimline leather seats and seat pitch was more than adequate but for those taller than 5'6 it maybe more of an issue. Staff on board were friendly and onboard food available to buy was reasonably priced and looked of good quality. Landed in Stockholm early. Return flight similar to outgoing. Norwegian take part in Arlanda's common check-in kiosk system which allows you to check-in at Stockholm Central Railway Station before catching the Arlanda Express. Baggage allowance is generous and flexible. Landing at Arlanda is a big bonus as is allocation of seats before boarding and the overall service is worth the little bit extra over the competing service offered by Ryanair to Skavsta (which isn't even in Stockholm) - also without the general unpleasantness with that operator.

This is not such a direct criticism of them but seeing as there is no way to add feedback or complaints to their website I hope they read this and act on it. Check in at Dublin was very poor. Sky handling partners had only one person to check in a whole flight (for at least 30 mins until someone else came and helped). This was very frustrating as there is no online check in you have no option but to stand in line and painfully watch the families and groups of travelers slowly check in. Flight was at least an hour delayed. Scheduled departure time 1220 actual 1345. Why do they lie to you at the gate and say expected time 1300 - totally unrealistic. As for the actual flight no travel updates from pilots along the way and not much of an apology for the delayed flight from FA's. As I said though this is the 1st time I have had anything negative to say. As for the previous comment about bags. I actually like the lenient approach to cabin baggage. This allows for me if I have a suitcase (which compared to Ryanair is very affordable especially if you wish to take 2 bags) to carry heavier items in the hold and clothes in a duffel bag on board!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

It's been a few years since I last flew QR so I was interested in seeing whether they'd kept their standards as high as I remembered. Largely I wasn't disappointed and having flown on 777/A330/A340/A380 I got to try out most of their LH types. Cabin crew are still as good aircraft interiors are still pristine (especially on the A380 although understandable as only 6 months old). Hamad International is a great improvement on the old Doha airport for transit. If I were to criticise anything it would be the food. This definitely seems to have deteriorated a bit.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-07-17,I'm putting in a late review for travel Darwin-Sydney and return in early June because I was impressed by their handling of the ash cloud disruptions. Unlike another airline that completely mishandled my bookings Qantas called me regularly rescheduled flights quickly and allowed free changes to connecting flights that I couldn't make because of a problem with a different airline. That's generally the biggest plus about Qantas - their customer service and ground organisation is efficient and problems are generally resolved quickly. Inflight the experience was good with nothing special. Medium-quality food. Service appears to improved drastically compared to a few years ago. Quality individual IFE on the 737 from Darwin-Sydney but the 737 in the opposite direction didn't have individual IFE - which really seems outdated for a 4 hour flight on a major airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

However all this discomfort was easily forgotten on seeing the warm and cheerful welcome we received from the two smart cabin attendants at the doorway. As usual Qatar airways aircraft was spotlessly clean. The 2-4-2 seating of the A332 is ideal for couples who wish to have their space remain uncompromised. The seat pitch of ~32” and width of ~18” is better than many other offerings which give a claustrophobic ‘sardine-can’ambience the cushioning is also more comfortable. The IFE has been upgraded to Touch Screen technology and the availability of Wifi is a further value addition. Service by the cabin staff was as good as ever. Flight deck crew also kept passengers updated on relevant flight parameters. Compared to my previous experience the only aspect that has slipped was the catering. On this sector breakfast and a snack were served I had requested a low-salt diet which was complied with in both instances but the quality of the offerings was very average tasteless and just warm the quantity of the serving has also diminished since my last economy class flight. Doha - Islamabad sector. Due to foggy conditions across parts of the North Indian sub-continent the flight was delayed by some 11 hrs. Though the airlines website stipulates that passengers whose transits exceed 8 hrs would be provided hotel accommodation commensurate with their class of travel they were unable to do so in many a case as the airport hotel had been totally booked they did however provide meal vouchers and make the ‘quiet rooms available to the stranded passengers which I feel did alleviate their plight to some degree.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,J Keep,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,LHR – DOH – MAA return on 21st – 31st December ’14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It’s fair to say that our impression of Qatar’s in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average – all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha – Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we’d been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it’s 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats.

I am a short person so leg room doesn't bother me but it could be a bit restricting for a taller person. The only draw back was I couldn't get the complimentary ipad to work and neither could my travelling companion however having a decent movie to watch compensated for this.

I have been travelling this leg with Qantas for over 15 years and normally travel business class as I did on this occasion. I can tell you that the seats have improved but that is about it. The amenities kit is a waste of money. I do use them normally but compared with the past Qantas could save money and not start to replicate the type of services that they use on jet star. I would also suggest they get back to basics with the menu and ditch Neil Perry. The inflight entertainment range is getting smaller and smaller and if you are a regular traveller like me it starts to become tedious. My loyalty to Qantas once rock solid is I'm afraid no longer.

Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia. However both flights were early and the fares were excellent value even after paying for a change of flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,3,2,NA,NA,5,1

It was the worst trip I have had there and back. The food was very poor we were watching the trays after every meal getting packed away and they were hardly touched so we were not the only ones who thought so the breakfasts were shockingly bad. The flight crew from Dubai were very unprofessional complaining out loud about the airline and their shifts. Qantas advertise on there own page about enjoying a hot chocolate this is only offered once each way from Melbourne to London and Back. No ice creams offered as advertised. The self serve snack bar food is plain and boring offering plain biscuits nuts and small cake bars.

All flights took off a few minutes early and also landed a few minutes early. Given an IPAD for entertainment between Bangkok and Brunei and flight was in an older Airbus 319. Seat was comfortable and service was very good - attentive cabin staff. Had a few hours layover in Brunei and then to Melbourne on older B777. Flight was punctual and the food good. Drinks freely available and plane very lightly loaded - only five in Business Class. Was a bit disappointed that the new 787 was not in operation as seat not so comfortable as a bed.

Full flight owing to the start of the Australian university term. Huge difference from the superior A380 that used to ply this route - seats on the A330-300.were old IFE sets small and mine was not working properly for some reason. Upgrades are needed quickly lest Qantas loses out to other airlines on this route. Supper and breakfast service was ok nothing special. Cabin crew professional throughout. Coffee was atrocious. Arrived in Melbourne on time and bags on the luggage belt within half an hour. All in all decent service but could be much better.

Our only problem was the stopover in Casablanca on the outward flight as the transit lounge facilities are very poor insufficient seating and availability of food and drink was very limited. There are improvements being made at present but in the meantime we would avoid the route via Casablanca and book direct flights both ways. The staff were are all time polite and available.

Decided to fly business as the price was better than others on the same route. In perspective it offered good service for the money. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne is adequate and comfortable. On boarding you are offered a drink (non-alcoholic of course) and hot (very hot) towel. Shortly after take off you are given a menu to mark what you want and then offered a series of magazines etc. The entertainment system worked fine the selection adequate. Meals were huge you could have five courses then snacks also if you wished. The service was excellent going with less in the cabin (business) but coming back it was full and the two people serving were struggling. I asked for a duvet instead of a meal coming back and I was eventually given that when the meal service was complete which was not my aim (I wanted to sleep through service). Anyway it was fine really the price was right and it was a comfortable easy flight. The staff are very nice Brunei airport is small but functional. Arriving our bags were first off which was very nice and on arriving back in Melbourne were given a fast pass but that didn't matter as the plane was the first international that landed.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

In the 24 hour flight you only receive 3 meals and drinks are provided throughout the flight the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I have sat in on any plane I have ever been in. I found the seating so uncomfortable that I could not sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,G Taylor,United Kingdom,2014-10-13,Edinburgh-Doha-Male return. Check completed in under five minutes but surprised no fast track through security Qatar use the No 1 traveller lounge adequate but nothing special. Boarding was quick and staff apologised for small delay whilst a family with young children boarded in front of us. We flew the Dreamliner and had chosen window seats specifically with my partner seated directly behind me. Seat was very comfortable and the general cabin ambience was excellent the cabin layout is 1x2x1. Served a very nice rose champagne after boarding food choice of wines and entertainment all very good. Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in. Had more time to see the new Al Mourjan Lounge this time it's very large good choice of food and lots of seating although at 06.00 it was very busy.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,F Odds,United Kingdom,2014-01-31,"I was pitched into the Qantas flight when my chosen BA flight was cancelled. It seems the Qantas A380s often fly with a lot of spare space. My long flight from Sydney to Dubai was rendered intolerable by a crying infant but the comments that follow concern only the Qantas provision. Cabin crew: brusque and uninterested in passengers. From start to finish all members gave the impression they had a lot of hard work to do. Why is a smile something so difficult to provide? There was no pre-service of aperitifs (even though aperitifs were listed on the menus handed out at the start). The food was excellent: I really enjoyed the taste of all that was offered on both legs of my SYD-LHR trip. Wine appeared to be supplied grudgingly and there was no offer of ""seconds"" of coffee — routine on BA flights. Legroom on the A380 was adequate. The plane was clean. The seats were not comfortable — after a bit their hard pressure on the backs of the thighs became annoying.

The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find – I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,A Kumar,India,2014-01-14,SCL-SYD and SYD-HKG in business. Flight from Santiago to Sydney did not get off to a flying start due to a ridiculous check in system that took 20 minutes at the counter and another 10 minutes waiting in a line for a point to point journey. Unacceptable for business class. Flight was on-time and the Boeing 747 was complete with comfortable fully flat beds which while in a conventional forward layout were incredibly spacious and converted into a full length bed. IFE was AVOD had a good number of options which while not as extensive as some ultra tech savvy carriers like Emirates was wonderfully edited with excellent selections. The food was wonderful with a clear emphasis on fresh food that included a number of options prepared onboard. I loved the flexibility of choosing from an extensive menu at any time instead of the conventional set options at set times. The crew service was mostly exceptionally warm and attentive save for one crew member who seemed totally out of place. SYD-HKG was on an A380 and once again the check in time was far too long although the agent herself was efficient and friendly. Boarding staff greeted me in Hindi. A380 had the same seats and was immaculate. The small lounge area was a nice touch. The catering on this leg was excellent beating the high standards of the previous legs and I can safely say that it was one of the best inflight meals I have had. Crew were friendly attentive relaxed and very efficient. I was overall pleasantly surprised. There are some issues however particularly check in and certain crew and ground members that are marring the work of other staff who are going above and beyond and an airline that is trying to compete with the best in the business and seems to be pretty much up there particularly in terms of product quality. Overall better then BA Swiss Emirates and Qatar. I rate them at par with CX and perhaps just shy of sq.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2014-01-09,Flew First from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai on A380 and was impressed by nearly all aspects of the trip. Check in at Sydney was a little chaotic as the First Class check-in area was overwhelmed by large families of Platinum members using the facility but then having the usual priority immigration and security available to premium travellers I enjoyed the Qantas First Class lounge. An enjoyable spa treatment. The food at the sit down restaurant was one of the best lounge restaurants I have been to. On board service was indeed First Class with staff making sure they knew all passengers by name and able to respond to any queries. The seat itself is comfortable and infinitely adjustable although the controls for it are rather complex and take a little time to get used to. Made up as a bed it is easy to get sleep with adequate privacy and space to sleep on one's side and upright it is good for relaxing eating and working. Inflight pyjamas were better than those provided by other airlines and the amenities kit more useful as well. The massage function is enjoyable although a bit noisy. Quality of food for dining was excellent although it would have been helpful to know that the supper menu either side of the Dubai transit was nearly identical. Large range of food items although I thought the dessert selection was rather poor and the champagne in the lounge was better than that inflight. Inflight entertainment system excellent with a good choice and high quality screen and headphones. Transit at Dubai is pleasant at the enormous Emirates First Class lounge although at the time I travelled the spa was closed and it wasn't entirely clear when the boarding announcement would be. On arrival at London we had the same experience as other travellers and it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive - hardly priority. As an added touch it was good to be able to use the AA Arrivals lounge for a shower and a quick cup of coffee before heading into town. An excellent experience competitive with others but unclear if it is good enough to justify the price premium over business.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,9,5,5,4,5,NA,NA,3,1

Overall experience in seating was not pleasant rather painful experience. 1) Leg room space appears to be one of the smallest of all the planes I have traveled with. This leg room issue is made worse by the passenger in front of you if (s)he pushes the recliner back. With the recliner pushed back there is little space to enjoy the food. No wonder the movie monitor has great viewing tilt angle (top-bottom) as the screen gets so close to your face. 2) There is a rectangular shape power box on the floor between the middle seat and the aisle seat which forces your leg to be tilted while resting. You will need to place your foot at an off angle. (4) Rest room was very small so small that I couldn't even bend over to wash my face. No more Qantas!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,2,1,3,NA,NA,1,0

Mix of aircraft 777-300er and A330-200 outbound returning on A320 and 787. Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand.

First leg was a tired old A330-200 that has clearly seen better days. PTV is older- generation and is not touch-screen. The control buttons were built into the armest making it very difficult to use them. System was very slow and kept crashing. In the end I could not watch a movie. Dinner was a choice of chicken or fish and not bad at all. Drinks were a selection of soft drinks juices and alcoholic drinks. Service was very good. Crew were friendly and dedicated assisting passengers with young children. The second leg DOH-DXB was operated by an A320. Service was very rushed (usual chicken or veggie wrap and water or juice) but on the shorter legs no one cares. Overall a good experience despite the old A330-200s which should get refitted as soon as possible.

As always when Qantas service is good it is unbeatable. Excellent service for the full business cabin from the mature crew especially the CSM.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2015-05-13,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about?

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2015-04-22,"Over the past month I have been on four FR flights. The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow.

I am travelling on this route every week and fly both BA and SAS depending on price and schedule. This morning I was booked on SAS and suffice to say it was not one of their finest moments. The flight was delayed and it turned out to be a two hour-delay before we finally reached London. The staff working onboard today's flight must have been through an unusually rough patch before getting onboard this flight. I have rarely seen a slower and more disengaged team of employees in any line of work. It took almost 45 minutes to dish out a few sandwiches and drinks. Need I say that at that pace the crew did not have the time to clear the trash before landing. Compared to BA and their upgraded cabins I think the SAS Airbus 321 is looking shabby. There is no finer way of putting it. If I am not mistaken this aircraft has not really been revamped since it was put into use about 15 years ago and it shows! I think it is high time for SAS to take some action here. All in all SAS are generally more expensive than BA on this route and I know this after flying every week on this route for a while. However paying more to go with SAS also means that you have to pay extra for food and drinks travel in a run-down cabin and may run into the team I had to endure today. Given that this is probably a very attractive segment for SAS I just do not understand why they provide such a poor-quality product and expect to get away with it.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

We sat 3 in a row and ordered the premium meal. I noticed mine was the biggest portion of 3. One of the portions was noticeably lesser probably about 85% of mine. There was a water point providing basic drinking water or you had the option to purchase bottled water. This is our first time flying with Scoot.

I like the sensor toilet flush wash basin tap and auto water drain - so much more convenient. It is sad that with such an updated and modern plane there was no drinking water point provided and basic drinking water had to be purchased.

Check in at all airports was chaotic specially domestic flights SV has an odd policy of one bag per passenger only to check in I had 2 small carry ons only both together didn't exceed 17 kg however I was allowed to check in only one bag which led to a lot of luggage in the cabin which was chaotic. Aircraft's are a mix of old torn planes and ok however I don't like the leather seats concept looks very old and full of strains. No entertainment at all on all sectors some flights with no refreshment however I was surprised on Dammam-Dubai sector they had a full service which was roughly a 75 minutes flight but full dinner and tea and coffee was served. Cabin crew are ok not very friendly but they were doing their jobs with no enthusiasm but doing it right except for the Asian crew as they are always cheerful not very fond of SV but I have to take it every time I am in KSA due to domestic flights though nothing major to complain about but will never fly it in international long flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,3,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

Despite flying to airports that only the CIA has heard of and advertising the airport for the capital city of Slovenia (it's Bratislava) as Vienna it's very handy. I use it often and I have never had a problem with Ryanair. Even with hidden fees tickets for me seem cheaper than Aer Lingus. The aircraft are clean but still somewhat dark and gloomy and the seats are uncomfortable horrible on a late-night flights or dawn when you try and catch some sleep however still possible.

At the SQ desk I swapped this for a much more logical bed in the ""pay by the hour"" mini hotel in T3. Why wasn't this offered in the first place? Why do I have to ask? Silk Air A320?

Copenhagen airport was very quiet when I got there on Tuesday. SAS is constantly upgrading passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting through the airport to your gate. Their latest development is a self-service Bag Drop. Fairly simple to use. The bag is put on an unmanned luggage conveyer belt which the machine registers and weighs. The passenger then uses a bar reader gun to pick up the details from the luggage tag. The bag is then transported away. Any problems/machine errors are sorted out by a member staff on call. So now all normal pre-flight checks and documentation before security (including passport verification) can be done without staff contact and hopefully without queuing.

My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it. It is still a fairly basic service but not too dissimilar from that offered by other carriers on intra-European routes.

We did pre-order a meal Coolangatta to Singapore which admittedly I will not be doing again - the worst airline meal I have ever had. We learnt our lesson and didn't worry with the on board food service again. I noticed a number of reviewers complained about lengthy check-in queues - perhaps we were lucky but we had no such difficulties. I should mention that between the four of us we did only have 3 small backpacks which were less then 7kg in weight and we checked them in as cabin luggage. On the way home we did arrive at both Bangkok and Singapore airports quite early (around 3.5 hours) due to an early flight from Koh Samui and an overnight in Singapore. So we were the first ones to check in. this worked in our favour as we were for some reason automatically upgraded to the yellow seats on both sectors. they are definitely more comfy and have more leg room then the blue seats. However to be honest we are not big people (average height average build) so the blue seats were fine for us anyway if you were taller or bigger in size it may be more uncomfortable I guess.

Singapore Airlines has been my favorite airline for over 30 years so I am disappointed to write a less than stellar review on this occasion. Flight attendants remain as helpful charming and efficient as ever. Food and wine are excellent down to the after-dinner ice cream. But this old B777 was tired. So much noisier than the A380 we had just been on. After being in premium economy standard economy seats were so tight. Poor tall guy in the seat in front must have found it tough. Even with a free seat in between myself and my wife it was hard getting in and out and a bum in the face is just not a civilised way to travel in my opinion. We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE.

Very speedy meal service had barely started and coffee was offered and that was the only time coffee was offered so went without as there was no room to have a coffee on the small tray as well. Next leg to BKK on an A340. My seat 3H did not work took over an hour to get it down into position close to the lie flat bed (moving a few cm's at a time). Come morning I was overlooked by staff at first for breakfast as I was still lying down. Finally I snapped at a FA and finally got them to understand that the seat was broken. FA Barked at me to get out of seat then she got down under it and did what ever she had to and finally got the seat up. No apologies. Although in previous reviews I would have been happy to recommend due to price this is no longer the case - I expect a seat that works and friendly crew.

As many others have experienced - I had to pay an extra $70 for each person to check in because I did not know you had to check in online. I was traveling out of Switzerland and the Ryanair representatives through Swissair were rude and not helpful at all! We arrived 3 hours early and asked to check in and were told to wait until 2 hours before. 2 hours before we were told we should have already checked in so we had to pay an extra $210 for the 3 of us!

singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,J Lee,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with âstuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen rather than fixing what is patently broken.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,1

SAS has a habit of blocking off a number of seats so the choice can be somewhat limited during internet check-in. I noted a number of unused seats on the plane in rows ahead of us which had not been available. After a 45 minute Bus and Metro journey we arrived at Copenhagen T3. A fairly new terminal used almost exclusively by SAS. We were obliged to register and print out our baggage labels from one of the kiosks before we dropped off our bags in less than two minutes (having noticed that although the L/H side of the terminal had horrendous queues the R/H side had only one or two passengers – SAS really should have staff to direct passengers with bags). Security was reasonably quiet. The A-321 was l full clean and bright and we were offered a free cup of tea or coffee everything else was paid for. Arrived before time at terminal 3 Heathrow border control was fully manned and our luggage came through 5 minutes after.

No one at the airport to talk to only a phone at the help desk and then you could not get through. Eventually did speak to someone who did not explain the reason for the delay and explained that food vouchers would be given out at 20.30. Really poor customer service in my opinion. Hiding behind a telephone. Other families with very young children were told that the children under 5 not entitled to food vouchers. Do under 5s not eat and drink?

The flight to Milan was a Boeing 777-300. Service was again excellent throughout the flight and deserved praise. Food and IFE was great. The return flight from Rome was old model Boeing 777-200ER. The plane although looked new on the outside was old on the inside. IFE screen was poor and far outdated then the one they currently use on their newer models. Though I felt more comfortable in the seats. However I do not know why SIA still doesn't retire this old model. Clearly footrest seats and even the IFE was in a need of repair. Service on this flight was not as great as the previous flight. Request were sometimes miss and food options ran out something i had not experience before with SIA.

The seats on A330 were spacious and comfortable but the table surface is slippery and your meal tray will slide off if you don't hold onto it. This can be prevented by the use of a tablecloth as found in other airlines' business class. The previous passenger's socks were still in the footwell so cabin grooming could use some work. The meal was good but drinks service was infrequent.

For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that.

This was my first Ryanair flight for nearly two years and I'm happy to see that some things have changed for the better. No queue at the bag drop desk. Assigned seating is a nice new addition though boarding leaves much to be desired - flight departed 20 minutes late due the slightly slow boarding process which prompted some passengers to buy overpriced priority boarding from Ryanair staff hanging around the gate. Crew on board were professional and what I've noticed is that they smile and are happy to have friendly banter with passengers now - so that's a really added plus since my last trip! Seats not amazingly comfy but ok for the short flight. Arrived in Porto ahead of arrival time and bags were on the belt almost immediately (this is something good that hasn't changed!).

Paid for hold luggage as I had a laptop bag as well. Reserved seats were welcome. I printed the boarding passes off before hand and arrived in plenty of time. Onboard reasonable bit garish and the selling wasn't too obnoxious given only a 50 min flight. Depart and arrive on time. So overall the experience wasn't too bad but then everything worked ok.

smartwings,/airline-reviews/smartwings,SmartWings customer review,Dave Jaros,NA,2005-11-08,PRG-CDG on Nov-05 departure 6 AM. First experience with this Czech- based low cost carrier. Swift check-in on two counters (hand baggage only) seating allocation (kind plus compared to i.e. Easy) boarding and departure on time plane - a bit worn interior of B735 but spotless. Seat occupancy some 30% pitch rather small (just acceptable for 15 hrs journey) refreshments sold at acceptable prices (sandwich soft drinks tea/coffee - 1 Euro each) nice staff in uniforms no bothering advertisements or lottery. Arrival 10 mins ahead to T3. Return CDG-PRG on Nov-06 plane of same type in better condition departure (on 10:40PM instead of 9:20PM scheduled due to fog in Prague. Were boarded one hour before take off but told lately to wait for clearance with an apology however no free water offered to pax as a courtesy. Being 6 ft/2in tall I have usually no problem even with the low cost / charter pitch but one pax behind me kept stratching her high heeled legs on my armrest and was not reminded by the FA at all (it was my dirty job to ask the pax for manners). Catched up some 20 mins from delay during the flight and landed hard but safely on the invisible foggy PRG airport. Occupancy again very low (40%?) and I wonder how they manage to survive their regular flights into top destinations in favourable slots (better than CSA competitor which is about to swallow them either). Would recommend them to fly whenever possible as a cheap option to classics but be prepared for some delays at the end of the day.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I had been warned by my friend in Prague that Smart Wings has apparently gained a reputation in Czech republic for delays and cancellations but I tok the chance on grounds of price as they undercut even Easyjet. The flight itself was fine professional attendants good information and reasonably priced snacks. However the outbound flight was delayed by 90 minutes (not good on a Friday evening) and the return was suddenly flashed up as being delayed by 3 hours as I queued at PRG for the check in! No information was volunteered the check in staff were not employees of the airline and couldn't explain the delay so i spent a thoroughly dull afternoon in one of the least interesting airports in Europe. Speaking to my Czech friend again she told me that because they are quite new and not part of the CSA (Czech Airlines) ""club"" Smart Wings is basically the first carrier to be bumped down the priority list when problems occur. I hope this will change because there is clearly a growing demand for cost effective travel to what is a delightful city but I am personally going to leave Smart Wings alone for the time being and pay the little bit extra with easyjet CSa or Lufthansa.

Make sure you have booked in any hold luggage on line its much cheaper but you can take 10kg each as hand luggage6 of us so spreading it round saves you a lot of money. Also it amazes me when people cry when they have to pay the £60 if they haven't printed their boarding cards before hand. Why not? I do not have a printer so just pop down to a local library to print them out. Yes Ryanair is a bit like catching a bus and you just sit where there is space but so what flight times are not long haul and I'm sure you can put up with it for a few hours. There is a lot of selling during the flight but again so what. Don't buy anything if you don't want to. Food is a rip off agreed so I have never purchased anything.

I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests.

SAA offers a reasonable product somewhat reminiscent of Western airlines in the 1980s. Mostly that's a good thing: shorter check-in queues and less evidence of penny-pinching than is now widespread no extra charge for emergency exit seats etc. Meals were tasty and substantial. Cabin crew did not see it as their role to distribute non-alcoholic drinks outside of mealtimes - at least bottled water was available. Staff were also abrupt in directing passengers to fold up their blankets and stow bags on a better airline the staff would do this themselves if it was so important. The cabin temperature on the return leg was too warm and the crew was obsessed with (mostly non-existent) turbulence to such an extent that the warning light remained on for almost the entire flight and hot drinks were cancelled for ""safety reasons"".

On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27.

Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages.

Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes.

It got us to our destination 5 hours late I missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time. I called SWA and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for $300 to cover the cost of the car. I was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best.

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,Lee Ho Seok,United States,2013-03-06,CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected.

Our flight was delayed 3 times. After being told that our plane had boarded its last location and was on the way they cancelled our flight. Cue the mass of 300 people storming the desk. With 6 attendants one attendant was handling our flight while the rest took care of their other flights. We waited in line for 3 hours! In the meantime my husband called their 1-800 number and got nowhere. They told us they could not give us a new flight that wasn't Spirit (the next day at 4pm) and no hotel/taxi/food. So we waited. No announcements about progress and no more than one attendant for most of the night. When we finally arrived at the desk the attendant reprimanded us for not getting to the front sooner for an earlier flight-it was our fault that we weren't at the front of the line! I understand that flight cancellations are not the fault of the desk attendants. It was very frustrating that they wouldn't let us know what was going on. We got in line at 7:45 pm and didn't leave the airport until 11.00pm. Rumors were flying about flights and it was confusing.

If they make rules they should enforce them and not rely on Brits to do all the compliance! On three out of four meal services the options shown on the menu card we had been ceremoniously presented with had run out. On one occasion a cabin stewardess made a special effort to try to provide something better than the default. Ordering a drink that came out of a can (eg beer) you did not get the can - just a glass! The safety demonstration was very poor. I was twenty rows back from the cabin crew and they simply seemed to wave their arms around to demonstrate the emergency exits. Terrible lack of rigour. Ironic that we had to make a safety stop at Frankfurt on return to London and the cabin crew we called upon to demonstrate emergency procedures again just before we landed.

Employees were friendly and the plane arrived on time. There was basically no leg room (I'm 6'0 185 lbs) but it's not like my knees were on the seat in front of me. I joined the $9 club and had everybody I booked tickets for split that cost; our trip there and back was a couple hundred less than any other airline I looked at. The complaints about the lack of free food/drinks and high baggage fees are ridiculous to me. There is a reason the base price is so low so understand what you're buying first because I had zero surprises when I showed up at the airport. I wouldn't want to be on a Spirit plane for any kind of international flight (unless I made the seat upgrade) but for a 2-3 hour trip the savings are worth it. This is especially true if you're traveling light. My only legitimate complaint was they lost my bag from Vegas back to Chicago but they shipped it to my house within a few days. I was the only one on the flight who lost his bags and I know losing bags is not an isolated occurrence for just Spirit. I'd give my experience an 8/10 and I would fly Spirit again for a domestic flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,1,1,NA,NA,5,1

Do your homework lower your expectations and enjoy your cheap airfare.

Do your homework and figure out what makes the most sense for your trip and don't assume you'll get anything for free. For 2 of us checking one bag and purchasing our seats was still $150 cheaper than 2 tickets on Delta.

Checked baggage must weigh less than 40 lbs - 10lbs lighter than most airlines. There is no wifi on board. There are no inflight magazines bring a book or buy a magazine. The seats are smaller than normal coach. If you are uncomfortable in coach seats on Delta don't fly Spirit. I'm 5'5' and 6 months pregnant with an aisle seat on a 3 hour flight I was fine.

Sunwing is terrible at communicating delays with their customers. We were unable to obtain info in Cuba as to what was going on the customer care center was not answering. Finally a fellow traveller called Saskatoon to find out what was going on. It was then we learned we would be re-routed - something Sunwing kept denying once we got to the airport in Cuba.

IFE had a good selection of movies with respectable size screens and good audio. FA's were efficient and friendly and came around often. Food presentation was good but taste not so. There was plenty to choose from for drinks albeit the wine selection was limited. Ice cream was served twice during the flight which made up for subpar food quality.

Overnight flight from ORD to GUA in new A320 with seats that barely reclined and were horrible uncomfortable GUA to SJO in older A320 with seats that reclined further. Offered drink before flight from SJO to GUA and a drink with meal on 75 minute flight. After takeoff from GUA it was an hour before we saw an FA appear from behind the curtain then we got a drink dinner drink refill and then they were behind the curtain until landing. The food was fine but the lack of service a disappointment. Perhaps some of the difference had to do with a LACSA crew for the flights from GUA to SJO and a TACA crew for the ORD-GUA flights. Flights on time and no problem with baggage. Our web check in boarding passes worked for the return flight not the flight to GUA not sure why.

An interesting comparison with colleagues who were on the BA flight on the same route and time. Check in quick and easy at Heathrow's now almost deserted Terminal 1 (soon to close for rebuilding) but a long walk to actually embark at Terminal 2. Economy similar to most airlines. TAM give you a little pack containing socks toothbrush etc. which most airlines seem to have stopped. Food OK though they were a little ungenerous with the drinks.

Eventually we were on the ground for 3 hours lost our connection flight and during 3 hours only offered a glass of water from a crew which found more fun in entertaining themselves (and a few passengers) than explaining what was going on.

Spent 8 hours in the airport waiting for the flight. Once we finally were boarded we took off promptly I understood that everyone was tired but it is the flight attendants job to still be courteous and friendly which was not the case.

On the first leg, nice crew, good tasty sandwich and drink, old but good airplane which was clean, priority boarding with infants respected, all-in-all positive experience and would fly with them again. On the return leg, TAP Portugal's Porto ground staff decided to ruin my day. I am a Star Alliance silver member and should have had no issue with luggage. But for some reason they now told me that my two bags were overweight (30 instead of 23 kg) and that I had to pay 50 EUR each supplement to carry them to BRU, even though I had exactly the same amount of luggage going to OPO, this apparently did not matter. They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply. As for the return flight itself, it was just as good as the one coming into OPO. So a real pity, a nice product but ruined by some ground staff in OPO and some very restrictive rules on luggage.

Crew were cold and looked tired. Cabin also showing signs of age with small stains here and there.

Swiss badly let down by the standards at the Thai Royal Orchid lounge at D Concourse. Amongst other matters there are no calls in this lounge which resulted in a wait at the gate before priority boarding of premium cabins.

Pre take-off drinks - champagne juice or water - on time push back full dinner service when airborne (entree choice of three mains - the steak was one of the best cooked and most flavoursome enjoyed aloft - cheese and dessert complemented by a choice of two white wines (Swiss or NZ) and two reds (Australian and French) and a good nights sleep on the flat bed.

Flew out on British Airways and enjoyed the excellent service. On return I lost my British Airways flight. Bought a TAP Portugal return flight from Lisbon. I was initially happy to use TAP ""main Portuguese carrier"" instead of low-cost carriers like Ryanair or Easyjet. TAP Portugal is a low-cost carrier with expensive tickets and lousy service. Flight was delayed 1 hr 20 mins no excuses or proper information given to passengers. Disorganised boarding with unprofessional ladies shouting no apologies from captain or crew there was no inflight entertainment newspaper magazines or wi-fi on the flight to London. Only drinks served for the entire flight. Leg room was very poor. So the return journey had all the hallmarks of a ""no frills"" budget airline.

Boarding in Frankfurt for GRU was chaotic with different groups being called at the same time. Seats onboard have a footrest which folds up meaning if raised it sticks into my shins but when dropped it is too high for me to put my feet on. Departed on time and soon dinner was served. No menu choice - a small salad a roll and a small pasta box. Not really enough for 12 hours. One drink was served then rubbish cleared away lights dimmed for the night and the crew vanished. It was only about 10.30 European time. The only drinks available were glasses of bottled water so if you fancied a nightcap or something else it was hard luck. AVOD is average but there was enough to keep me entertained. Breakfast was a reconstituted ham and gouda panini with some fruit and a tiny polystyrene cup of coffee. Horrible. Swift transfers at GRU with an uneventful flight to Florianopolis on a modern and clean 320.

Another problem was that every time we flew through any slightly unstable air the back of the plane yawed from side to side sufficiently to spill drinks.

Old style head phone sockets but we had taken some adapters we bought for 70p off amazon so again didn't have to pay for films. For me the most important part of flying is safety.

Miserable on the outward flight and to be honest they looked liked they'd had a rough night previous. Thomson flights aren't cheap but the level of service doesn't reflect this.

In both cases placed in upper deck of 747 which was a quiet but pleasant cabin. At BKK it is always a delight to be able to use the Royal Orchid Spa in advance of flying C Class on TG and that proved to be exceptional although the lounges themselves are looking tired. Boarding was reasonably orderly with a warm welcome. The angled lie-flat business class seat was fine for the SYD-BKK afternoon-evening flight as it is comfortable for relaxing reading watching movies and snoozing but found it difficult to get much of a sleep on BKK-SYD between the cabin being too warm and sliding down the seat. Service from cabin crew was friendly and efficient. The meals were adequate although not outstanding. All but one of the main courses and desserts were mediocre but the starters and range of drinks were quite good. Inflight entertainment system had a wide range of movies and reasonable TV and music selections enough to keep me occupied. Only downside was an excessive level of high volume announcements so loud that it is deafening through the headphones. Thai's Business Class is ok but the angled lie-flat seating has had its day and it could do with a bit more effort in quality of catering (certainly the quantity and range of choices were reasonable) which would complement the excellent cabin crew.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,2,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1

We were asked to pack the waste materials into the box containing our food as neatly as possible over the PA system - when they were collected the Stewardess emptied them into a bin bag. The whole of the crew demeanour was unwelcoming and any request was met with a sneer or raised eyebrows.

I choose to fly with Tiger as they are cheap and no frills. However when you purchase your ticket or tickets via the Tiger Airways official website it asks if you would like to choose your seat and some seats with more ""leg room"" cost more. On the seat selection page it shows which seats are empty and which seats are booked. Generally the seats with the added leg room are an extra cost and generally always the first booked. I always skip the seat selection and let Tiger assign me a seat at no extra cost. Now whenever I go to check in at Sydney airport or Coolangatta airport the check in staff often ask me where I would like to sit. So I ask for the seats with extra leg room which are the emergency exit rows and generally I'm assigned a seat with extra leg room despite the fact that I didn't pay anything extra and despite the Tiger Airways website stating that those seats which cost more and were ""booked"". So some poor fools are specifically choosing a certain seat and paying extra on the Tiger airways official website for a seat with extra ""leg room"". Yet I'm not paying anything extra for my seat and I'm offered the choice to sit in a seat which was shown as ""booked"" on the Tiger Airways website.

Upon asking one of the unfriendly staff members I was told that the bag drop counter ""does not work as everything is drowning here in Tegel"". How about sending passengers without a printed boarding pass to one of the other counters to make it work? Many others complained about that and started fights with the extremely unable staff members strangely the bag drop worked perfectly fine on the way back in Las Palmas.

Flight itself was uneventful plane ten years old but maintained poorly. Staff onboard arrogant and alcohol had to be paid. Arrived late in Las Palmas and had to wait for a further hour at the luggage belt for no reason again no staff around. Our transfer driver told us later that TUIfly is known for paying the least of all airlines hence their luggage will be offloaded last. He told us that he had left an hour late as he already knew we would be late. Same thing on the return more than an hour delay.

Both planes were 737-800s but the seating was not identical. On the Dubai-Kiev leg the seating was cramped my knees were knocking the seatback pocket and anyone much taller than me (178 cm / 5'10"") would likely have found it very uncomfortable. The Kiev-Gatwick leg however offered what was clearly roomier seating with minimal knee-seat contact. The latter seating also seemed slightly more frayed; I gained the impression that slightly better legroom was in the older plane. Otherwise there's no getting around the fact that despite being Ukraine's national airline UIA are also a budget airline with no in-flight entertainment and no free food (only limited food options for a cost) on short or medium-haul flights - which includes Dubai-Kiev. If you go into the flight knowing this then the really competitive cost makes UIA worth considering as the flights seem to be punctual staff are professional and transiting at the UIA-dedicated Terminal D at Boryspil is easy fast and painless. If you go into a short- or medium-haul route with UIA expecting full service from a national airline then you'll likely be disappointed. I imagine that the Skytrax 2-star rating reflects the lack of entertainment and limited food options - but judge UIA as a budget airline and they're better than many of their European competitors in the similar price bracket and I've had much worse experiences with full-service North American airlines on (internal) flights of similar length to my individual legs here.

Flight home about the same but the cabin crew were a little more 'in your face' when it came to selling stuff. We didn't buy any on board food as is was too expensive and the flights were only a couple of hours in any case. My only real complaint concerns the lack of leg room; this airline really does 'pack em in' tightly.

Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening.

The Business class configuration is typical of the European short haul flights with the middle seat left empty. Legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over Economy. Aircraft was showing its age and as with all TK flights I have been on the air was stuffy and stale. Flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties. Good meal service for a short flight. There was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks. The FA's did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service. The crews on TK really need to improve their English skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency. As well my experience on all of TK flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the FA's as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings. The flight left late due to congestion at Istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful. Their domestic service is clearly superior to North American and many European carriers and is certainly good value for money. With some attention to cabin service and improved FA performance this airline can easily maintain its status as Europe's best but has a long way to go to compete with Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,4,1,2,3,1,NA,NA,3,1

Dhaka - Istanbul 9 Jan 2014. Istanbul - Geneva 10 Jan 2014. No inflight entertainment on flight from Istanbul to Dhaka or from Dhaka to Istanbul. On January 9 flight from Dhaka to Istanbul was delayed 7 hours due to fog. When the flight finally took off on 9 Jan flight time from Dhaka to Istanbul (non-stop) was 8.5 hours due a ridiculously old plane being used. I was informed in Dhaka on 9 Jan that I would miss my connecting flight to Geneva and would have to travel the next morning and was thus issued a boarding pass for the next day. When we arrived in Istanbul no instructions were given by the cabin crew leaving passengers to figure things out on their own. It took another 2.5 hours for ground staff to issue us hotel vouchers. Some toilets were non-functional on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka on 19 December. All crew members on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka and back appeared to be Turkish and spoke very basic English. Plus points: Staff of Turkish airlines in Dhaka were most professional and courteous and did their best to attend to the needs of passengers. Food was decent. Overall - a very lousy experience. There is a major difference in the quality of service (old planes no in-flight entertainment rude/unprofessional service) on the flight to/from Dhaka-Istanbul compared to flights to/from Istanbul-Geneva.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small.

About 30 minutes into the wait they opened up the main door and with temps outside around zero the F cabin quickly became a freezer. I could actually see the breath of the pax in 4A. The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The “sausage” that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles. Service was not rude for the most part but below economy standards on any Asian carrier. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of dishwater coffee. When the woman seated next to me asked what the squid sushi was the FA replied (with a smile to be fair) “Don't ask me I don't make it.”The shoulder harness that F pax are required to wear on takeoff and landing was extremely uncomfortable.

Cannot believe that US airways does not have inflight entertainment come on it's prehistoric! My other slight annoyance was that when I enquired if I could catch an earlier flight (checked in very early) I was told that would be $75 - my flight was full but the earlier one was less full...just appears to be cheap especially as my luggage caught the earlier flight (and I thought airlines tried to avoid unaccompanied luggage!).,NA,NA,First Class,NA,6,4,4,3,1,NA,NA,3,0

Our most recent disaster was trying to get home to KC from San Antonio. First flight delayed putting us in Houston an hour after our connection was to leave. Had to call to find another flight since they offered no alternate options. Once in Houston the flight out was delayed twice due to ""awaiting aircraft"" a third delay due to ""crew availability"" and at 10pm was finally cancelled conveniently due to ""weather.""

CVG-ORD flight was alright. Small aircraft not much of a problem as it was a short trip. It all started once we reached Chicago. After landing we waited in the aircraft for more than an hour. I reached my gate and asked the United staff about my plane. They clearly said that it was on time. So I go eat and come back and my flight is cancelled! I asked the same staff member again and she says I have to contact customer service. They tell me that there is another flight in 2 hours and they will transfer me. Told there are only middle seats in the middle row left! Th4 flight was delayed by an hour again and I was sure I would miss my connecting flight. Onboard the seat was very narrow no leg room and me being a vegetarian my special meal did not get transferred onto this flight. The staff were rude no smiles and hated being even asked for water. The entertainment was the worst I have seen! 4 channels 4 fixed movies one on each and they all start at the same time. Absolutely no value for money. As we finally after 8 hours land in London I had just 25 mins to go from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4 to catch my next flight so ran throughout no option and was one of the last people to catch the plane.

Even though there were hardly any people in line I was ignored standing first in the wrong line then once directed to another line was ignored by the agent there until finally another approached and proceeded to get my baggage tag. The flights themselves were fairly uneventful and the inflight staff were much more friendly. The seating was however not comfortable nor was there any kind of seatback entertainment system like on other airlines.

This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers. My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge. And served and cleaned up over 100 passengers within the 45 minutes. It takes that long to get one drink sometimes with United.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,2,3,1,3,NA,NA,3,0

Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means.

Now that I've flown at a peak time I've seen what cost-cutting at check-in does. There was a queue for the small number of self-check-in kiosks (at least one was broken) then you can't drop your own bag like at Qantas so the queue for the measly 4-5 bag drop counters (they kept closing them due to baggage system problems) stretched to the terminal door. There were 5 proper check-in counters so some people took a punt on those being faster than kiosk + bag drop. 30 minutes to check-in should not be expected for a domestic flight (Qantas will take 5 minutes even at peak times).

Helpful check in staff who gave me the seat I wanted. No problems with a slightly overweight bag (problem coming from International Business to Domestic Economy as far as weight is concerned).

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,Michael Little,Australia,2014-09-01,Melbourne - Perth and return on A330s in Business. Two very enjoyable flights up to international business standard on a domestic service. The VA lounges were comfortable the seat on board was very nice to sit in and the service in both directions was excellent. Both flights arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Only two small complaints: the menu was the same in both directions. From Melbourne I was transferring to an international service in Perth (having a South African Airways codeshare flight on VA). VA needs clearer and more prominent signage to help passengers find the Business Class international check-in counter.

First time using a full service airline domestically after mostly using EasyJet for couple of years and this Little Red offshoot of VS didn't disappoint. Aer Lingus should given a massive pat of the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic. Flights were on time and inflight service was more than one could ask for a short-haul domestic flight with friendly and attentive staff. I was delayed inbound back from Edinburgh but that was due to a security scare at that Airport and I was notified with plenty of time via email and text and allowed me time spend a few more hours with friends in Edinburgh. The one Achilles heel is Heathrow I haven't used Heathrow in 16 years - and I have to say it didn't leave me want to back in a hurry unfriendly and poor management of queues for security - for Britain's premier air gateway it is shambolic particularly when you see the improvements that have been made at Gatwick. Virgin should be proud of the service they are delivering here though I am using them again in January on this domestic route and will be sad to see this end in September 2015. Great service and excellent value - highly recommended.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1
virgin-america,/airline-reviews/virgin-america,Virgin America customer review,A Skidmore,United Kingdom,2012-07-15,MCO-SFO 7/11/12. Not sure what I was expecting from this flight I guess being English I expect a 5+ hr flight to be treated as long haul and the service to match. Surprised when I saw they were using an A320 on this route by the end of this flight I struggled to straighten out. If you're over 6 feet tall I'd recommend paying for additional leg-room. Other than the leg room the seats were comfortable and the interior of the plane was very trendy. Mood lighting and condensation keeping the cabin relaxed with music whilst boarding gave a relaxing ambience. Entertainment system was impressive with a large range of on demand TV and movies (albeit at a charge). Being able to use the entertainment system throughout taxi take off and landing is a nice sensible approach. WiFi is pretty good and fast seems a little overpriced but it is a very fast service compared to other airlines carrying this feature. Main disappointment was that nowhere on my reservation did it mention there was no meal or snack provided during the flight so having boarded hungry I only managed to last 3 hours before purchasing a meal. Meals come as a large snack box which is very competitively priced at 7 dollars. Free soft drinks is a nice touch but alcohol is overpriced and being able to order drinks on demand from your seat is also handy when you're settled. Generally cabin crew were friendly and the pilot giving his announcement stood in the cabin adds to the edgy nature of end airline. Dressed down uniforms and a relaxed approach is a little different to other airlines but I think Virgin have found a good balance. All in all I would use them again but I wish they'd make a few of the inflight charges more obvious prior to ticket purchase. And 5 hours is a bit too long to be in such a small seat!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

The staff at SGN was nice though I had no idea why he was so slow in re-checking for my information as I had checked-in online previously. By the way they dedicated a counter for check-in online passengers but it was unhelpful. And worse the staffs at HAN check-in counters were rude like I was begging them something. VN used A330 and B777 for my flights which were good a bit comfortable. The stewardess' English was terrible though. Food was so disappointed to me with a cold thick sandwich.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Tung,United Kingdom,2014-12-04,London Gatwick to Cancun return in VS economy. First time with this airline. Check in at both airports were easy and stress free. I purchased “seat plus” on the way out so had to use the check in counter. There was no queue in Gatwick. On the way back I did online check in so just needed to print out the boarding pass then proceed to bag drop. The airplane was a refurbed B744. It has a nice interior. Seat was comfortable and was better than I expected. However pitch and width were tight if the passenger in front reclines. The entertainment is up to date although the choice of movies / TV not as good as other airlines. The on demand system with a touch screen will keep you busy throughout a long journey. Personally I still prefer the touch screen but with a remote/console so that you don’t feel the person behind you is constantly “pushing” your seat back. Food onboard was a weak point. It was a nice touch to be given a menu but the food quality was poor. On the way out I pre ordered low fat meal but was served normal food. I noticed the crew who said they would try to see what they could do but then disappeared entirely. There was no sandwich or drink in the galley so in my case it was a 10 hour journey without food. On the returning I was served normal food again and I had to remind the crew that I’d pre-ordered special meal – that didn't seem normal in my experience where all other airlines will give passenger their special meals before others so they don't get confused. Breakfast was also poor – an orange juice a yoghurt and a very dry croissant. Service was overall friendly but not as professional as other airlines. Toilets weren't cleaned and some were out of order. Overall an acceptable flight experience but I will still choose BA over Virgin.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,2,2,4,NA,NA,3,0

We had plenty of time to get from Rockhampton to Brisbane for our connecting flight to Bangkok. The afternoon before our planned flight Virgin sent a TEXT message stating our flight was changed with no further details provided. When I called Virgin I discovered they had placed us on a much much later flight meaning we would miss our flight to Bangkok by several hours. Virgin made no attempt to rectify this issue. I then had to drive 8 hours to Brisbane and was initially told I would not receive a refund! After over 2 weeks the airline finally contacted me back and told me I was lucky to receive a refund and it would take up to 12 weeks to process this. It has been over 3 weeks since the flight was cancelled (by Virgin) and I am still yet to receive a refund for this flight.

Plenty of legroom although the 2 heights that the footrest sits at doesn't make it overly comfortable the seat width difference is definitely noticeable vs domestic economy. Amenities bag comes with socks eye mask toothbrush/paste hand cream tissues and a pen (which is more than I can say for SQ business). Headphones provided are noise blocking - and they definitely work. Every meal had tomato and cheese in it which was not only a little disappointing but seriously lacking in originality the chicken was nice and tender though once I scraped the tomato off! Breakfast (scrambled eggs) was so/so the bacon the only redeeming factor in a pretty lacklustre meal. Inflight entertainment (RED) didn't have a massive choice.

Announcements were very difficult to decipher whether it was the actual system or the persons making the announcements (whether from flight deck or cabin) were very quiet. Return flight was okay food was surprisingly good however breakfast was a lot to be desired - choice and quantity. Announcements were much clearer and better to understand. Was very annoyed at the cabin crew who decided to do the duty free run after the lights were out. Trying to sleep whilst all you can hear is the banter of someone buying perfume is not very good in my opinion. Some cabin crew didn't seem to be very alert to some important things such as reclined seats in the rows in front when preparing to depart. Had to discreetly point this out.

Flew PVG-LHR on one of the A340-600 in 60K (G-VWEB). I'm 5"" 8' so not the largest person in the world and yet my knees were being poked the entire flight by the pocket from the seat in front of me. Padding on the seat was pretty much non-existent resulting in a rather numb behind after a short time into the flight. Also it's worth noting that it seems seats in A and K mostly have something under them for the in-flight entertainment system. This meant I had even less space to stretch if needed due to that being under the seat in front of me. The headrest was incapable of keeping the position of the wings that are on it collapsing the second you put your head against it. If the person in the seat in front puts their seat back it makes the experience even more claustrophobic - not to mention making it hard to use the screen for the in-flight entertainment. Not that that matters as the screen quality is so bad you won't want to use it anyway. Then there is the food - it's tasteless overcooked and there's not a lot of quantity to it. At least they came around at reasonable times with it and offered drinks fairly often during the flight.

Good points were the service and friendliness of staff and the food was actually quite good.

No bottles of water were served but staff were happy to provide re-fills or sealed 100ml tubs. Flight time was supposed to be 6.5 hours but we were forced to circle Bali airport for another hour due to traffic congestion. In Flight Entertainment wasn't available. I thought this was very poor. No blankets available either. Virgin is using a domestic plane (B737-800) which is designed for short 2-3 hour flights for an international flight. Plane was very cramped and hardly any leg room for someone of my height (1.8 m). The layout was 3 seats each side with two toilets at the back for economy which is not enough when the plane was full.

My second complaint is how uncomfortable the seats are now! I'm a 5'4"" woman who is not overweight and the seats are so narrow that I find it difficult to get comfortable at all. Sitting beside someone with any normal width to their shoulders has us touching each other and I feel I need to keep my arms as close in as possible - making for a very uncomfortable situation. The seat in front has been moved so that it's difficult to read a magazine at times because it presses up against the seat in front. Flying WJ is now like flying Air Transat or other charter company flights. I also find now with the odd exception the inflight crew to be disinterested and not very friendly.

The fact that his colleague approved it was no excuse; he was the supervisor and has the power to overrule everybody. Requests to speak to his supervisor were rejected. On return flight from Eindhoven following day same trolley goes through same inspection and is again accepted without slightest hesitation.

At the gate we were again charged for carry on bags in spite of having receipts for payment.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,R Brown,United Kingdom,2013-11-05,Flew LHR-JFK return mid October with Virgin premium economy. I've used Virgin a bit over the last few years in Upper but this was my first experience of the premium economy cabin. As a bit of a caveat absolutely love some of the upper class gripes ultimately this is a unique product with the herringbone seating for heavens sake do your research before flying guys if you like regular business seating use someone else! Outbound on slightly tired 747 (Tinkerbell) cabin crew however very good food good and entertainment also had a decent amount of choices even if the screens themselves were slightly behind the times. Return flight delayed almost 2 hours after having arrived at the airport early anyway this wasn't ideal. Spoke to Virgin ground staff who immediately moved me to the earlier flight without charge - fantastic service. Return was on an a340-600 (Miss Behavin') and although I have my reservations this felt a slightly enhanced overall product with a better partition between premium and regular economy including separate toilets. Food and entertainment much the same again which was good. Didn't fancy the cooked breakfast option before landing so they brought a yoghurt fruit and warmed pastry item all of which were perfect. Overall for what was a 7hr outbound and 6hr return flight premium economy felt adequate. Seats wide and comfortable with a decent amount of recline. In my opinion not worth the large % increase to upper on this route unless of course using air miles to bridge the gap. Will be travelling the same route in a couple of months and will be glad to use Virgin Atlantic again.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

When flying Wizz you are truly on a budget airline but it works and you get what you pay for. We carefully read the luggage rules in advance and avoided paying extra that some of our colleague pax had to do.

The flights where dirt cheap at £300 for 3 people with 1 bag and reserved seats. Flight WW206 16/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft:TF-WOW. Check in opened at 16.10 for the 19.40 flight. It was quick and there where 3 check in staff. The flight was nearly full today which shows they are doing well. We have reserved seats which we did get and they did acknowledge that when we booked we had the 12kg hand luggage allowance. Boarding opened at 18.40 for the 19.40 flight and we went immediately to the gate. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen causing delays. It was painful and needs to be improved lot be like the procedure at KEF. We pushed back at 20.00 (late) and we were off at 20.15. The flight was good with comfy seats with recline. The buy on board was cheap in comparison with Ryanair and the crew where professional but chatty (a good balance). We landed at 23.10 in a blizzard. KEF was unprepared and we had to wait for 2 0mins to attach the jetway. Baggage was also slow but this wasn't wow's fault. Good flight but poor ground services all in all. Flight WW201 20/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft TF-WOW. Check in opened at 04.45 for all the morning flights (06.50-07.00-07.15). (Ours was at 07.00). Check in was quick and there were 5 staff for 3 flights which was OK. Our flight was also again nearly full. KEF airport is a good airport in terms of departures. We went to the gate at 06.00 and the gate area opened at 06.20. Boarding began at 06.30 and they just let everyone one which was easier. This time the plane was bang on time for pushback at 07.00 and was up at 07.07. The flight was yet again good with a cheap buy on board and yet again a drinks round and a tea or coffee round which is good in comparison with easy jet. The plane landed at 09.40 (15mins early) and we were off at 09.50 baggage handling however needs to be faster. No entertainment was available.

Check in opened 3hours and 30 mins before and a new hand luggage allowance has been out in place meaning passengers where getting nervous if the there bags would be fine. Wow air fail to provide online check in making it less of an attractive option. On today's flight wow air where 20mins late arriving and boarding was chaotic. They boarded in rows but nobody listened. We took off 35 mins late and the inflight experience was the same as easyjet. We saw the northern lights which was a plus but doesn't affect the airline's performance. The flight landed 20mins late in a blizzard but the pilot did a good job and landed smoothly. The crew where chatty but professional. Once arriving in KEF the jetway failed to attach on several attempts and we waited for 30mins before we could get off. Even worse we had to wait for another 30mins for our luggage meaning we left KEF at 00.25 instead of 23.30 not good. WOW AIR need improvement to its ground services before I can recommend it.

The upper class seats convert to beds which use the back of the seat as their basis - very hard and uncomfortable!

yemenia,/airline-reviews/yemenia,Yemenia customer review,Sahar Choudhury,NA,2008-05-30,The return tickets London to Bangladesh were cheap so I chose to try them out. Both the economy and First class seats are shabby. London-Yemen flight was less than half full on an Airbus 310. In flight entertainment was abysmal with the same film shown on both outward and inward flights. There is no personal in-flight entertainment system everyone shares the same overhead screen. Sana'a airport transit lounge lets the airline down. There were over 200 people in the lounge with only 3 filthy cubicles for men and none of them had a working flush or toilet paper and all of them were overflowing with excrement (I have photos). There was no soap either. The 5 hour transit wait was unpleasant. Sanaa to Bangladesh flight was full. The aircraft was infested with flies and it was hard to eat. Food isn't great but its ok for the price. There are no snacks even if you ask. No extra milk for tea either except the powder sachet that you get once with your main meal. Reconfirming the flights in Bangladesh was erratic. Local agent asked I present my passport and ticket in person and present a copy of my visa (I was told by UK travel agents I only needed to phone in order to reconfirm)! In the end I argued with him and sent him a copy of my ticket and passport by fax. Return journey from Bangladesh to Sana'a was the same on Flight IY0873 and the first class seat I was in (seat 2E) was very shabby and only slightly larger than economy but did have good legroom. The footrests were broken and there were flies buzzing around. Trasit at Sanaa to London was done in the bus and boarding cards handed out while the bus was moving to the transit lounge where more people got on. The official took all our passports and disappeared for a while. He then left all our passports with a fellow passenger and jumped off the bus. We had to frantically grab our passports because of the risk of theft. Sanaa to London flight had same food and flies and the stewardess explained that the flies were around because of the dates in Yemen. We requested she spray insecticide and she said she would try but it never happened. 20 minutes before landing at Heathrow she sprayed insecticide but that was because of UK rules. Verdict - Flight schedule was super crew dont go the extra mile. I will travel with them again if the fare is cheap and I am the only traveller otherwise I will give them a miss.

When it was almost time to board I was surprise that no one went through security. Looked at the monitor, nothing special. Look at the AF app and I saw that the plane which was suppose to leave in fact went back to Paris due to a technical problem. No announcement and when I met the ground staff they told me they could not say anything, that's why we had no announcement. Half an hour later, the flight was cancelled and it was the last flight of the day. Hop chartered a bus to drive us to Toulouse 130 miles south, a bus with no air conditioning and we had a heatwave in France. Of course not a bottle of water, not a voucher to get a sandwich. Hop in Brive was suppose to book the flight between Toulouse and Paris and of course, they did not. We had the chance to board the last flight to Paris at 9.10 pm.

I had a big delay once (5+ hours) but normally it leaves on time or with minor delays. I never checked in luggage therefore I can't review that part. I also never eat/drink on board so I don't understand the complaints of many about that. It is an airline not a restaurant! Eat at the aiport if you must!

allegiant-air,/airline-reviews/allegiant-air,Allegiant Air customer review,Jeffrey Kapostasy,United States,2014-08-05,Allegiant flew me from Youngstown to Punta Gorda and back again safely and close to on time. If this is all you require from your trip Allegiant should be fine if you expect more well you are barking up the wrong cockpit. Allegiant clearly spells out charges on their website I am baffled when people go and book their ticket on Allegiant yet are angered for getting exactly what was promised! If you want creature comforts Allegiant is not the fuselage for you. I flew with my father from Youngstown OH to Punta Gorda Florida. The flight was on time on the way down and about 20 minutes late coming back. Flying on Allegiant - both in terms of ambience and clientele - is much closer than taking a Greyhound than to flying say Delta. The MD-80s look pretty on the outside but inside are spartan and old. Creature comfort is merely a theory: The seats are thin and don't recline and forget any kind of magazine: Please see the seat pocket in front of you for the safety information card and a booklet full of advertisements. One benefit of flying Allegiant is the airports Allegiant services which are smaller and while they might not be centrally located the wait and service and overall calm is far superior to the bigger airports. The time it took me to walk into Punta Gorda airport check in get through TSA then flop down into a seat at the gate? Literally 5 minutes. When you fly Allegiant you are taking a calculated risk: You are hoping that your flight doesn't get cancelled for whatever reason because unlike the big carriers Allegiant can't put you on another flight: they only operate one flight per day to each destination - at least in the smaller cities - and they don't work with other airlines. So if your flight is cancelled you won't get to your destination until the next day most likely. That is the risk you take in exchange for Allegiant's low fares.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,3,0,0,NA,NA,5,1

The following day I checked in at Lion Air kiosk in the airport paid the fees and got my boarding pass. It is evidently cheaper than the infamous low-cost carrier Air Asia in some routes. Also worth noting that being a low cost carrier in KUL Lion Air - unlike Air Asia and several others - remains a few (if not the only one) of its kind to land in KLIA satellite terminal (NOT LCCT) means it is accessible more conveniently from KL City Centre.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,1

The 747 like most of their crew is well passed its sell by date. The business cabin is tired and worn IFE below standard seats are ok but nothing great. My biggest gripe were the crew on the second leg. We were in upper deck and found them quite inattentive and everything felt like a hassle but the best was to come. My wife and I had a sleep after dinner when we woke 2 hours before arrival we decided to have a drink. I pressed the call bell and ordered a baileys and a glass of wine. I was first told that the bar had closed which was nonsense after I complained they sent down a supervisor where a long argument presumed in which they basically told myself and my wife we were too intoxicated to have anymore drink! The way they spoke to us was both condescending and humiliating and after all of this on clearly seeing we were nowhere near intoxicated they served us another drink. As a seasoned traveler I have never been spoken to like this before. We flew American in Business on the way to MIA and in stark contrast the business cabin was excellent on the new 777-300 and the crew were only too happy to serve you. BA really need to have a look at themselves your crew by large seem to have an attitude problem see the paying passenger as an inconvenience rather they a valued customer. With such choice from Dubai I will never travel BA again. If you want to pay thousands for a worn out badly designed seat to be insulted by crew who will go out of there way not to serve you book BA otherwise do yourself a favour and go with an airline that doesn't employ over unionised staff that take pleasure in being rude to passengers.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,3,1,2,2,NA,NA,2,0

Check-in closes 10 minutes before departure which means that half the passengers were cramming at the check- in desks in the last minute. Free seating onboard the plane resulted in more cramming after the security because everyone wants a good seat. It was a real circus!

I found the Smartwings plane to have terrible leg room. I'm average height and my knees were brushing against the seat in front.

Much to everybody's surprise there was a plane at the gate 5 minutes later. Upon boarding the plane our flight attendants showed their true colors and lack of professionalism of Allegiant Airline. They made light of the life preserver located under the seat in the event that ""the flight turns into a cruise"". That is not only an extremely unprofessional comment but it certainly did not sit well with an already anxious flyer. For our returning trip we arrived two hours ahead of our scheduled departure as instructed. When we attempted to check our bag we were kicked out of line along with everyone else on our flight because Allegiant could not ""handle"" us at that time.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,A Janda,United States,2014-05-12,"I paid for a Spirit Airlines ticket but my flight was cancelled the day of. The excuse given was bad weather for the incoming plane. Ironically we checked other airlines none of the others had cancelled incoming flights. Furthermore my flight had few seats sold which I thought was very interesting and concerning. The flight was cancelled and the very few customers who had bought tickets were delayed from the morning to the afternoon. The problem is for people with connecting flights. This airline should not be called a ""no frills"" airline but a ""non caring"" airline. When a consumer buys a ticket there's a trust that the flight will be honored. People who were stranded weren't put up in a hotel. The resounding feeling from those on the flight was that they won't fly Spirit again. Once again there are critical time sensitive reasons for travel. Once an airline breaks the customers' trust it is hard to regain.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,5,0

Very popular route for Koreans to take a weekend trip! Excellent price for such a short flight (one hour and 45 minutes maximum). We experienced a weather delay of one hour due to random snow at KIX. As we were on the last flight out of Seoul we were scheduled to arrive at KIX the minute the last bus was scheduled to depart for Osaka. I want to say that Peach told the bus to wait for the plane. We were the only ones in the Peach terminal (T2) when we arrived and there was still a bus waiting on us 20 minutes behind schedule! The seats were a little tight and I'm 5'11"" (180cm) but they're nothing unusual for an LCC. They offered snacks drinks and shopping onboard which a lot of people bought. We just bought a water (small mini Evian bottle). They take both currencies and cards which is convenient. The flight attendants were friendly although very serious about bags under seats and phones turned off. The only odd thing was that they didn't actually speak Korean (just Japanese and English minimal pre-recorded Korean) and the flights were about 96% Korean 3.95% Japanese and 0.05% foreigner.

A really good flight in an A330 with the now excellent flat beds and space. The food wine and the service were excellent with a 30 minute early arrival at JNB. The starboard seats are the ones to go for as they are single. The only criticism I have - a Swiss IA responsibility though the service is subcontracted - is that in the business lounge there is free wi-fi but only for 60 consecutive minutes. After that there is a charge. As I had a 5hr wait this was very inconvenient. Surely having pitched up a business class fare they could at least emulate many high street coffee shops and provide unlimited wi-fi without charge. it's not a big charge in the context of the fare more a matter of principle.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1

Heading up our company in this region I wanted to try out the highly advertised Dreamliner to and from New York. Traveling to NY from CPH was fantastic. I had booked Premium class. Going to NY I enjoyed the great seats and also quite good service. Norwegian had the return flight operated by ""Titan Airways"" a budget carrier from the UK. With an all coach seating arrangement. Norwegian did not inform us despite their website saying that if a different plane is used the customer will get informed prior to the flight. The check in people at JFK said this other plane had also premium seats. So do did the gate crew. All lies. One of my fellow travelers noticed that on his reservation document from 1 week before the trip it already said ""Titan Airways operated"" meaning that Norwegian already knew before the outbound trip that the return flight would not be the Dreamliner. Norwegian however sold us Premium tickets for both Outbound and inbound flight. I have traveled a lot throughout my career but have never seen airline just advertising one product but selling another without telling the customer. Not at the time of buying nor at the time of check-in. Besides the fact that the premium class customers had to travel unexpectedly in a very tight coach seat they now also need to go through the hassle of claiming money back.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,T Fosgate,United Kingdom,2015-03-30,"There are two reasons why I would never fly with Qatar airways again: 1) Their apparent policy regarding delayed flights. I spent 13 hours at Kathmandu airport this weekend waiting for a flight back to London via Doha. Weather may be beyond their control but how they respond to it is not. They were the last of the airlines to be able to land and filled the first flights in with passengers on later scheduled flights in priority to ourselves who had waited the longest. Consequently our 12.30pm flight finally got away at 9.30pm when they appeared to find an extra plane under the sofa . Not a great disaster in the scheme of things but if I have a choice of an airline that makes an attempt to get those who have waited the longest away first then I will take it. 2) Comfort: The seats appear to be ergonomically designed for maximum discomfort. I am a 5ft 5"" guy who weights 8 stone and I had problems I can't imagine what it must be like if you are taller and wider. After about 2 hours in to a 7 hours flight I was really struggling.

I've have been traveling VA when I go to PNG because I have no other choice. My experiences with them say they are always looking for ways to improve. The food choice is not as good bland sandwiches however the pies are only served on certain flights. AUD and NZD currency are both used and credit/visa card facilities are available. Beverages such as tea coffee and water are free. I'd recommend paying for food in advance as they have choices for you and they would serve you first before others who would purchase their food onboard. I don't find the food expensive but that's my opinion others opinions may differ. Entertainment is always good during my flights. Their movies and shows etc are always updated however no entertainment between BNE-POM. I find boarding flights in NZ takes so long however boarding flights from BNE-POM are always quicker and vice versa. I once cause the flight from POM-BNE to delay 20mins and as a result my connecting flight was delayed as well. I was then escorted to my next gate by ground staff. VA has lovely friendly and attentive staff. I find the planes between NZ- AUST are older and planes between AUST-PNG are nicer and newer. You can pretty much change seats during flights if you want to. The airline is very informative and take-off and landing have always been excellent!

I purchased their max. checked baggage allowance of 40Kg (wouldn't let me buy more) although I thought she might be slightly over since basically every other airline allows two fifty lb bags to be checked they cap it at two 44 lb bags. She was 4 kg total over at check in and they told her she would need to pay $25 per kg. I told her to start dumping things in front of the check in desk.

The usually short refuelling stop in NRT became an overnight 17 hr delay due to Engine problems. Singapore Airlines held us on the plane for over 4 hrs and insisted on serving us the inflight dinner rather than let the passengers disembark. The hotel provided for Economy class was (Nikko Narita) was rather on the run-down side. First and Business where hosted at the local Hilton and another hotel (Did not catch the name). We had a connection to MDC the next morning in Singapore which we missed. That connection only flies every other day so that we had to stay two days in Singapore over Christmas rather than on our vacation. The biggest problem was that no-one on the phone or the ground staff in NRT could provide us with a new itinerary to our destination. To add insult to injury the first phone representative insisted that my flight had taken off as planned even though I had called almost 3 hrs after the delay started. The second one was even worse in first refusing to help at all as he claimed I had deviated from my booked LAX-SIN itinerary. It was only after some complaining that he finally realized that NRT is indeed on the route. Not that he had any further information to offer after that other than saying I would get more information in Singapore. Once finally in Singapore the representative at the gate who was supposed to have our onward information did not and had us wait for another length of time at the transfer desk in Singapore. There finally I was handed the boarding passes to our final destination and hotel vouchers. I am Executive Platinum with American Airlines and have seen my fair share of breakdowns and delays. However without fail an AA representative on the phone has been able to give me my new route/times within minutes of the official announcement of the delay. Onboard service on Singapore Airlines is certainly better than on AA.

porter-airlines,/airline-reviews/porter-airlines,Porter Airlines customer review,J Middleton,United States,2012-07-19,First time flying Porter Chicago Midway to Quebec City via Toronto round trip. Bottom line: excellent. Arrived in Toronto and was a bit confused on how to transfer to the connection. Coming into Canada from USA one retrieves checked bag (even though checked through) and goes through Canadian customs. Once through customers one takes it upstairs to connecting flight bag transfer where it is scanned and sent on its way to the connecting flight. On the return to the USA this step is not necessary since USA passport control and customs is done at the USA destination airport in my case Midway in Chicago - which was very fast. I echo the comments of others pleased with on board services. The only thing that would make Porter even better from my point of view would be to add on board wi-fi. One additional suggestion I would add is to always check in at the Porter service desk once you get in your lounge (they have a USA bound lounge and a domestic Canadian destination lounge). For web check in travelers which I was one there is an added security step that they need to do. I had thought this was done in Quebec city but apparently they had missed that.

I asked the flight attendant if she could say something to them and she responded that she couldn't really do anything. She murmured something about finding me another seat and never returned. I later found out the flight was not full and my seat could have easily been changed. My seat wasn't aligned properly so I had to place my feet on either side of the seat in front of me which was uncomfortable. The seats didn't have individual TVs which isn't such a big deal. Unfortunately the American-made inflight movie was only available dubbed in Spanish. I asked the flight attendant which channel was the English channel because I could not find it after scrolling through all of the options. She vaguely muttered that it should be available and said she would go ask and once again didn't return. This flight cost me about the same as most others I have taken on this route but the customer service was abysmal. Equally expensive flight for worse experience. I will be avoiding Air Europa in the future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,1,3,3,NA,NA,2,0

Cheapness is probably the only thing going for them. The boarding at PER descended into a scrum devoid of any order and the PER-SIN flight was 1+ hour late. Seating onboard was fine. The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot.

They made me remove stuff from my bag and finally they lost my bag. Staff at Portland responsible for baggage claim was impossible.

No problems at all with online ticketing using a foreign Debit Card. Prices can vary quite a lot from day to day and I've never managed to get one of their so-called very cheap GO Fares. Changes can be expensive and I usually do those at their ticket office in NAIA-3. This terminal is by far the best in MNL. Check-in is efficient in MNL (though less so in BKK) and pre-paying for excess baggage (over 15kg) is now available when you book. Excellent on-time reliability on all flights. For some reason they do run the cabin temperature very cold on the A320 and this can be uncomfortable on a 3 hr+ flight. I've no problem paying for a snack and a drink if the ticket price is significantly cheaper than the competition which it is. No in-flight movies so bring a book. Good value for money on a safe and reliable airline and I'll continue to use Cebu Pacific.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Business class service enroute was very professional and pleasant too, with a substantial hot lunch with meat loaf as a main course as a surprise option on this 1155 departure. A cold dish was also offered. The meal came with salad, dessert and cheeses too. The only let down was a mediocre and inexpensive supermarket brand as the only white wine on offer.

HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax – they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That’s the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world – not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname “Nightmare-liner”: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft’s business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR’s A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA’s. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR’s problem.

We were in MEL for 1.45 hours to fuel up and pick up/drop passengers off. The second leg was 15 hours to Dubai from Melbourne but with the great in flight entertainment systems and comfy seats the time flew past quickly. Early morning arrival into Dubai at 5.20am then for a 5 hour wait to catch flight EK763 which was a Boeing 777-300ER. Great flight until we hit severe turbulence over the middle of Africa. We dropped a couple of feet which was scary but the EK staff kept us calm and served us refreshments after the turbulence had past. Just before we were about to descend into Johannesburg we were diverted to Durban due to bad weather in JNB. We were in Durban for 2 hours but we weren't allowed off the plane.

What a total nightmare! I would urge anyone thinking of using Phuket Airlines to go with a reputable carrier and to avoid flying with them. Phuket Airlines in my opinion are a total shambles. Once we had landed back at Bangkok Airport there was no organisation no explanations just total chaos. None of the staff had a clue what was going on and how to handle the situation. We heard stories from other passengers about problems they had experienced on the way out as well mechanical problems very long delays etc. They are just not equiped to deal with big international flights. The reason they are so cheap is because they are so crap! The planes are very old and have definitely seen better days. Don't risk it pay the extra to fly with a decent airline is my advice you will feel safer and more confident and you will get much better service. We spent out £400 on a new return ticket as we were not prepared to fly back with them to London the following day. 13 hours is a long time to sit and worry whether their old plane will make it or not.

I am 6'3"" and it is all but physically impossible for me to sit in the seats. Think it was a 757. I have never been so horribly uncomfortable on a flight and surely it is bordering on dangerous for Thomas Cook to sell these seats without some form of warning that tall people can't fit in them. Had such a warning been available I would have paid for the extra room (as I had to do on the return flight) but this was not pointed out at any point and as I don't fly package very often I did not expect it to be this bad. It is unsafe for me and those around me and also makes it difficult for the air crew to move up and down with their trolleys selling overpriced drinks and other tat. I don't expect lavish comfort on a package flight but I don't expect unsafe and ridiculously cramped conditions either. They seriously need to warn people about this before something bad happens. At least print it in the brochures or flag it up at time of booking so that you are at least offered an option.

I have no complaints about the flight itself. We were delayed due to necessary de-icing but the captain and flight attendants kept us informed and we were grateful to arrive at our final destination only a couple hours late. My only complaint would be that they don't know how to seat people we were in a group of 4 (2 couples) and they seated us all over the plane in middle seats between people who were traveling alone. We weren't allowed to pick our seats or change them so that even couples could sit together.

After boarding at Heathrow the entire A380 stayed on the tarmac for 4 hours due to a failure to lodge the flight authorisation form with Heathrow. This delay means that after a 13hr flight to KL we missed our connecting to Sydney. No one on the plane was able to assist passengers that needed connecting flight and upon arrival at KL no one helped with the transfer counter either. Ground staff were incredibly rude unhelpful and tried to refuse us food vouchers. They simply handed us a computer printout and told us to go to Cathy Pacific counter for a boarding pass. Turns out they stuck us on a flight from KL to Hong Kong then to Sydney. That flight was full and we were sent back to line up again with Malaysia Airlines. This happened twice more and it was 4 hours standing at the transfer counter before we were put on a flight to Singapore then Sydney.

thomas-cook-airlines,/airline-reviews/thomas-cook-airlines,Thomas Cook Airlines customer review,Glenn Brown,United Kingdom,2013-10-20,Flew from Gatwick to Antalya on 10th October. Flight due to leave at 9.30am - was delayed till 4.30pm. Reason given for delay was a technical issue with the plane. A painful 9 hours in Gatwick for all passengers - given that most would have arrived at 7.30am for check in. Food vouchers were given out - if you happened to hear about it. Returning after a good holiday on October 17th we experience another set of delays. The 5.15pm flight from Antlaya did not leave until 10.30pm. The reason for delay was the incoming flight was struck by lightning during a torrential storm and had to be diverted to another airport for landing - before coming back to Antalya. So I was OK with this - and happy to be finally on my way. Only for the announcement on the plane that we were going to have a stop in Vienna ! - to pick up a replacement set of cabin crew - as the existing crew would have worked over their hours and could not per regulations fly with us to London. Thomas Cook lost all credibility here by not telling us this info before we boarded the plane (so passengers had a chance to advise anyone meeting them at Gatwick of the change in arrival time) - and also they lied to passengers by saying we would only be on the ground at Vienna for 5 minutes as the replacement crew would be waiting for us. This was not the case - we were on the ground at Vienna for 1hr 20 minutes (in the plane) waiting for the replacement crew to arrive from London. Finally we get underway with another painful 2 hours at Gatwick - arriving at 3.45am - much later than our scheduled 7.50pm arrival. Thomas Cook lose all credibility by their dishonesty and lack of clear information on flight delays. Just be upfront and give the facts when you know them - don't dress things up to save face. I also question the large number of flight delays they have - as evidenced by the comments of other passengers. Why does this airline have so many technical issues with their aircraft? It means if you book with Thomas Cook you have to factor in long delays to your trip. Otherwise book elsewhere.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,4,4,4,3,NA,NA,3,0

The middle seat in a row fields down into a table but the seats don't recline any further than in Economy.

Flight attendants were all women who were polite and smiling they did their best to make it a pleasurable flight. Toilets were clean. The headphones were broken and I had to ask for new ones. We landed on time. It took 15 minutes till the plane could park and then another 30 minutes to get off because as the captain informed us there was a long line at immigration and we would have to wait for them to give us the go ahead. Inside Terminal 7 there was a huge line it took 2.5 hours to finally reach an officer. This was by far the most annoying and tiring experience I have had. To land at 10.45pm and get out at 2am is just too much. I will now choose an airline that lands in a terminal which can handle large numbers of passengers more effectively.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,4,2,2,NA,NA,3,1
copa-airlines,/airline-reviews/copa-airlines,Copa Airlines customer review,J Borschow,Puerto Rico,2014-04-14,"Flight 142 PTY-SJU 4/13/2014. A partially owned subsidiary of United manages to charge high fares while providing substandard service. I've flown COPA on half a dozen South American itineraries out of San Juan and it is almost predictable that something untoward will happen. We are used to the indifferent personnel inedible meals second rate ""business"" lounge business-class seats that don't recline and baggage that ""misses"" perfectly legal connections. So we should not have been surprised about our experience on our scheduled flight from Panama City to San Juan yesterday. We were denied boarding due to ""overbooking"" - on a coach leg of an otherwise business class itinerary (there were no business seats available when we booked). The rationale offered by the gate agent (we made the reservation more than a month ago) - you should have known when you couldn't get your seat assignments on line that you were on an overbooked flight! After considerable discussions around the unacceptability of spending a 24 hour period in Panama City we were booked on a supposedly unavailable evening flight to San Juan. So after an additional seven hour layover at the mundane Panama airport cum duty free strip mall we were on our way. Oh and the gate agent upgraded a single seat for each of two bumped couples. The trip was otherwise uneventful. The meal was as expected poor both in business and economy. Bottom line COPA was a better airline before United bought Continental. Despite convenient schedules and relatively new equipment from a passenger experience point of view it does not deserve a three star rating.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,3,2,0,NA,NA,2,0

We were 1.5 hours late taking off. They said it was because they were waiting for people to get through customs but why should we reward people for being late and punish the people who left on time to get through customs. Rouge's website states you only need to be there 90 minutes before your flight this is wrong you need to be there at least 2-2.5 hours before to get through customs. Arriving late in Phoenix they had us waiting at the wrong carrousel for our luggage and never did tell us. Onboard entertainment is non existent you have to bring your own. The TV and movies on the Rouge app are so old you cannot find anything to watch. On return flight we were 30 min late leaving. Arrival back in Toronto we waited for over 1 hour to get our luggage.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,R Chase,United States,2014-08-06,Norwegian did it to us also. Our flight was DY7091 Copenhagen to LAX aboard the Dreamliner on August 2nd. We also never received a text or phone call about the delay. Upon arriving at the airport and checking in we were given vouchers to eat to make up for the 5 hour delay. No one ever told us about the plane change. We proceeded to board a Euro Atlantic plane which we just assumed was maybe a sister company (Not the case). Our flight was the most miserable flight. This plane was old dirty and even had ashtrays. We sat in seats that had white stuff sprayed all over from the previous flight and cups on the floor. One of the sinks in a bathroom was broken and another bathroom was completely out of service. The inflight entertainment or TV's did not work for most of the seats. The ones that did work had grainy and rolling pictures or no audio. My arm rest was broken and kept pinching me. You could not get a pillow or blanket. The overhead lights and remotes were hit and miss if they worked. This plane had no wifi staff that were clueless missing and just plain lazy. They did provide 2 meals with a drink. The food was ok no drinks were offered between the meals that were served 1 hour 30 mins after take off and before landing. My kids were bored and had no entertainment but me for 11 hours as their DS died while being used in the airport during the delay. This was a horrible flight for an adult but worse for a family with kids. Warning it looks like this is a common practice for Norwegian if you can get your money back try to or take a different flight completely. This is an unacceptable chartered plane Norwegian has leased to deal with the Dreamliner problem and they have been doing this to passengers for months.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,2,1,3,1,NA,NA,1,0

I was pleasantly surprised with the efficiency of operations of this airline. All flights left on time or within 10 minutes of it. Comfortable flights but food from ADD seems to include very spicy main meals. Other legs had very good food. One criticism - the ADD-LHR flight only leaves ADD at 01.35 and they then insist on serving dinner (at 03.00). We then got a muffin and tea before landing at LHR. It would have been better to let us go straight to sleep after take off and then give us something more substantial for breakfast.

The seats were the most comfortable we have flown in and my husband who always suffers leg problems when flying had no issues at all both ways. The flight attendants really set the standards in their service and were top of their game throughout the flights. Even at the airport I had left my medications box on the plane but they still managed to find me and return it. TVs attached to every seat were very tech savvy and could be controlled by touching the screens. One stopover at Seoul and Asiana put us up at a luxury hotel for a night.

There seemed to be great leg room and the food was really good especially comparing it to the food I ate while in China which was a very low standard much to my disappointment. There was a good choice on the inflight entertainment but don't travel at night as the Chinese nationals on this flight kept up the talking and noise through out the wee hours of the morning making sleep impossible something I have not found travelling to other countries. They sprayed the flight on the way back into Sydney with some sort of insect spray which is something I have not encountered before but maybe this happens on all airlines from China?

Fortunately I have family to spend time with away from the airport - some passengers were at the airport 14 hours! I initially arrived at the airport at 6 AM to check my luggage and then returned again 4 hours before actual departure - because it wasn't certain when the plane would arrive from MPLS to unload/reload. What made the passengers most angry and frustrated was the fact there were no SunCountry agents at the desk. The delays were not posted on the electronic posting so no one had a clue what was going on. One passenger finally called Minneapolis Reservations and requested that an agent come to the desk in Las Vegas and update passengers as to what was going on - this didn't happen until 1 hour prior to boarding.

It was much better than I expected - but I think that was probably mostly because I was in Premium Economy. The regular seating section really looked cramped and passengers there did not look happy. The good: great flight crew. Yes they are young and yes they wear funny outfits (the hats are ridiculous!). But they were all really friendly helpful and attentive and I saw no evidence of lack of knowledge. The seat was very comfortable - not business class but definitely much roomier than even 'normal' economy. On time take off and landing frequent drink service and decent food (for an airline). The bad: the Premium seats seem to be anchored by some mechanism that completely blocks the under-seat space. That meant there was no room for my shoulder bag - which I have successfully placed under seats in much smaller aircraft.

The flight I took on March 9th with 2 other friends was the worst. We all took what would be acceptable as carryon's. Not realizing that the size you consider as a carryon is a lunch box. Arriving at the security gate the person there told my other 2 travelers that both their bags were not considered carry-on's and had to go to the desk to pay for them. That same lady told me that mine was acceptable to carry on the plane. I waited for them and they were told that if I had purchased the carry-on bag online the fee would have been $30.00. Not doing that they were charged $45.00. When I arrived at the gate to board I was stopped and told I had to pay for my bag. After telling them of my experience at the security gate they were quite rude and didn't care. Now because I didn't pay on-line or at the security gate I was told the fee was $100. Again insane for a duffle bag that could actually fit under my seat! We not only paid $190 more for luggage going but we paid online another $90 coming back. We went from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas and back for a total of $1003.00 for 3 of us. I could have gone US Airways for under $900. The plane was uncomfortable very cramped and dirty.

On the plane we were told that the flight crew was not to blame for this delay that Sunwing is responsible for not scheduling our pick up from Cancun.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,Richard Lau,Canada,2014-08-26,I will definitely not fly with Air Canada again. Had a previous bad experience with them and thought maybe give them another chance. Wife and I flew out of Paris from CDG. Boarded aircraft along with other 398 passengers and waited for over an hour for the plane to depart. No apologies nor explanations other than a brief P.A. about waiting for one late baggage. Plane arrived at Montreal one hour late and all passengers were not allowed to disembark due to some medical problem with one single person with another further delay of 20 minutes or so. We rushed to baggage claim to retrieve the check-ins then to an Air Canada connections kiosk. The clerk was extremely slow and seemed unsure how to process the transfer and became irritated when told that we were in a hurry to catch the 4 pm connector in 45 mins. She eventually told us that she would be placing us on a 8 pm connector instead.

Old and worn out plane for both flights. No personal entertainment screen which is terrible considering it's a 13 hour flight. Food is OK but the portions are way too small. The only thing that could have redeemed this airline was if their cabin crews are friendly and hospitable enough - but they aren't. There were Malaysian passengers who were requesting the vegetarian meal but they did not request it online / before the flight. Ideally an airline should be prepared for such situations. It was very disappointing how the cabin crew handled such thing. Makes me wonder what kind of training they undergo. They should learn a lot from Singapore airlines crew.

I was mighty glad to have the exit row window seat on my outbound flight - even so I felt squished in like a sardine and had to keep my left arm folded over so as to keep the intimacy between myself and the poor man squished in/overflowing from the middle seat next to me from becoming completely indecent for 5+ hours. I checked in online for my inbound flight the night before but it was only when I got to the airport yesterday to check my bag that I discovered I no longer had preferred seating. In Air Canada's defence they advised that they had changed aircraft and the people that had bulkhead seats were given the exit row seats. So where did that leave me? In a middle/centre seat. Right beside the seat I had paid for. The fairly generous 4-star rating of the AC Rouge staff below was for the flight attendants only who were pleasant. Air Canada's motto should be ""We take the Service out of Customer Service"". Ground staff were completely nonchalant about the fact that I no longer had the seat I paid for.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,Richard Moller,Canada,2014-09-24,Flying from Kingston Ontario to London Heathrow is a tiring trip at the best of times delays at the start when a plane needs additional time and maintenance to be flightworthy only makes it worse. Paying extra to get a seat with extra legroom is worth it although the seats are getting threadbare and any padding that may have been there no longer shields you from the frame of the chair this is especially true on their smaller aircraft flying into Kingston. Due to maintenance issues the entertainment system on the Toronto to Heathrow leg had to be completely rebooted mid-flight making it unusable for about an hour. Luggage handling was slow and bags marked “Priority” were some of the last ones off. Since they are the only airline that flies out of Kingston it used to be worth the extra 30% on fairs for flights going outside of North America to fly Air Canada for the convenience but with chronic scheduling problems because of aged aircraft it is becoming less so.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,4,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

Flight from Brisbane to Dubai (13 hrs) I recalled them coming around with water 4x.

Even the lowest of the low-budget airlines provide a better service than Alitalia. 3 weeks before I traveled I broke my foot I called to see if I could get assistance getting on and off the plane. The agent told me ""no you have to request that at the time of booking"". I was in a cast and had a cane I figured someone would help me from the airline. I was wrong again. Not getting on board not in seat selection not exiting the plane in Rome down a huge staircase that dropped us out in the middle of the tarmac. I had to beg a steward to help me which he did grudgingly. The return was easier. When I told the staff member at check in I was at the gate for early boarding because of a broken foot she asked ""Did you ask for assistance?"" I said no because I couldn't get any on my way here I assumed it would be the same on the return she just said ""oh"" and let me board. Again no help offered. On both flights the food was awful. Chewy greasy macaroni on the way over. A block of chicken nugget on the way home. On the one time they passed by with a beverage cart I asked for tea with sugar the steward said ""you already have sugar"". When I insisted I didn't he said well you do. And that was it. No sugar. After that if you wanted something to drink you had to get up and beg for it. I felt like I was interrupting their own private party in the back. The most startling incident though was when the stewardess slammed my window shade shut about 4 hours into the 9 hour flight. I raised it again and said I preferred to keep it up. The stewardess slammed it shut and hissed it was their policy to keep the windows shut!

wizz-air,/airline-reviews/wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2013-07-21,LTN-OTP / TSR-LTN. LTN-OTP on new A320. However Wizz Air urgently needs to restructure their boarding system at Luton people were pushing and shoving and there was a lot of confusion and mis-communication as to where we were supposed to line up. I think Wizz Air would benefit from establishing a seat allocated boarding system like Easyjet as this would put an end to the 'free for all' pushing and shoving issue. If you travel through Luton there are delays to almost every flight there are far too many Wizz Air flights leaving and arriving at the same time and as such this airport cannot cope with the huge surge in early morning traffic. Cabin crew were helpful as always. As usual there is now very little seat pitch on their latest A320's so you might want to consider paying for an extra leg room seat as there is virtually no room for your legs. TSR-LTN: Flew back to Luton on a new A320 as on outboard flight. The way boarding was handled in Timisoara was noticeably better than we experienced in Luton. Departure was on time and like before the crew were excellent. All in all Wizz Air is a good low cost airline much better than the likes of Ryanair and we will definitely continue to fly with them on our future trips to Romania. It's a real shame that they have chosen London Luton Airport as their main UK base I seriously hope that they will consider flying from Stansted Airport in future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,0,0,NA,NA,4,1

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,James williams,United Kingdom,2014-10-20,I flew one way MCO-LGW 6th October the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations British Airways has lost a customer for life. I requested assistance due to illness which I couldn't have at Orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait? When boarding they wouldn't let me board without checking with three people just because I was young and didn't appear to need assistance. After this I could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldn't even ask if I was ok. The drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. The meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. The 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. Why do they need to be chilled? Room temp would make them a bit better. The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. The IFE screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both Virgin and Thomson on this route. When I got to Gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance - if you don't look old then you shouldn't need assistance.

Hainan Airlines met that requirement and so off I went. The Hainan leg stateside and back was the 787 to Chicago and back from Seattle. Overall the service was quite good. A few people have cited a limited English speaking cabin crew which I will agree with but I am travelling on their airline so I won't complain about that besides it was good enough back from Seattle was very good. The food was good in both directions offering Asian Western and vegetarian meals but not quite up to the standard of other carriers. The lounge access was my biggest complaint Terminal 2 in Beijing is quite old and the lounge is very basic with limited food choice and beverage. The wifi was very weak also. In Seattle they use the Cascade Club Lounge (extremely limited in selection quite disappointing really) in the A concourse and it's a bit of a trek to the S gates via the little subway but a shuttle is provided (if the driver can be found!) if you don't want to walk to the train. In flight entertainment was sufficient but the ""new releases"" were quite far from that however the selection was good enough for a total of 23 hours of travel in both directions. The 787 itself is a nice comfortable aircraft and Hainans Business Class lie flat seat was quite comfortable and the duvet very nice. The pillow could have been bigger however. Overall I will certainly fly with them again as the value for money for Business Class was very good.",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,3,3,NA,NA,5,1

No personal TV screen system so not sure why they had those annoying boxes under almost all seats. There are a few tiny screens above the seats but unless you sit close to these screens you will not be able to see anything and the movies were dubbed into Chinese with English subtitles so anyone that do not understand Chinese would not stand a chance reading the subtitles.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2014-10-12,HKG-DXB-VIE and the same in return using A340 B777 and A380 aircraft. Three out of four sectors were fine: Excellent service and very clean and quiet aircraft. Big disappointment was in Business Class on the A380 due to one main factor: the fact that there is a fully serviced lounge bar area at the rear of Business Class. This sounds rather special until we realised that loud mouthed yobbos can stay in there for the entire journey (in this case Dubai to Hong Kong) and walking up and down the aisles with their drinks and abusing staff for not being fed lunch on time (even though they were all in the bar) and so on. I had to move further to the front of the aircraft to avoid the noise coming from this bar lounge area. This made for a very unpleasant experience and I could understand why some staff were very sad and quiet in going about their duties. Perhaps Emirates should seriously consider getting rid of this little so-called luxury as the concept seems to have backfired badly. The A380 flight was otherwise remarkably smooth partly due I suspect to the design of the aircraft but also the route take for this sector. Food and service on the remaining flights was superb but I could not recommend Business Class on the A380 for the problem of the bar-lounge section.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,0

We managed to get extra legroom seats (row 12) as my husband is 6 ft. 5 and they were fine. Boarding was fairly structured and the food (an evening meal - I chose the veggie option - stuffed peppers) was pretty good - hot and tasty with a snack just before landing for breakfast. I didn't expect much from the IFE from the reviews and wasn't bothered anyway. Some parts of the cabin were a bit frayed around the edges but no real complaints. Crew were fairly attentive. Both internal flights were also fine - a short hop between Nairobi and Mombassa and vice versa - the first left early the second a few minutes late. On both there was time for a snack and a drink with good crew service. Flying back on 13th from Nairobi to Heathrow was fine too - left on time but no extra legroom seats this time so a bit cramped for my husband. IFE was very poor - his seatback TV didn't work and mine was hit and miss. Again no complaints about food. Boarding this time was a bit more chaotic and JKIA is a horrible airport - cramped chaotic and poor flight information. Luggage all arrived with no problems too.

The seat is fair for economy when you recline the bottom part of the seat it slides forward so you somewhat lay down. However there isn't a footrest. The width and recline is reasonable. I sat in the upper deck and I like that there is a compartment on the side therefore you have more legroom. You also get a very tiny pillow and surprisingly a nice blanket. The inflight meal is what you would expect for economy. You will have two choices. Flight attendants were the worst I have encountered.

On one leg shortly after takeoff the crew distributed promising looking menu cards but this was just a tease since no food materialised until almost 5 hours into a 6 hour flight. The purser spent the flight in and out of the understair workstation adjacent to my seat on the A380 slamming the door each time. When the food did arrive it was poor. On another leg the food was served in the first couple of hours and was very enjoyable being salmon and mashed potatoes. They seemed quite happy to bring the odd glass of wine throughout all the flights. On one leg we were bussed to the aircraft at Dubai which was strangely parked in a very remote part of the airfield. All those gates at Dubai and we end up having a 20 minute bus ride and climbing steps to the aircraft. The customer service at Gatwick was very poor.

We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door.

We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare.

Air Canada charges full AC fares - provides no fare discount to fly Rouge but the experience in every way is to fly a discount airline - but at full AC fare which will ultimately negatively impact their bottom line - despite timing and routing options. The fact that AC flights can be bumped to Rouge makes me hesitant to book AC again - if I pay for a transatlantic business class - a pod - I don't want to be crammed in a small seat -3 per section!

So they re-routed another flight and changed the direction of the flight and the stops although still ending up in Seattle where we were headed. So instead of leaving around 11am we left more like at 4pm. At our first stop in Wrangel some people got on. Then some more. Then a few more. After a while the crew started counting passengers. Then did it again. And again. Then they started asking names as well as counting. Then did that again. And again. And again. As far as I could tell they never found any trouble and never made anyone leave the plane. Then they said we were overweight and had to unload some fuel. After that they started counting and naming again. When I asked if they be serving dinner since it was now after 4 and we wouldn't get to Seattle until after at least 9 pm they said they had 4 wraps on board to sell. The CSA then came on the plane and yelled at me for delaying the plane! For asking if we'd get fed! More than an hour after that harangue we left.

jet2-com,/airline-reviews/jet2-com,Jet2.com customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,NCL-TFS-NCL. Booked as part of a decent package deal for some last minute winter sun. We've often flown with Jet2 in the past and have often found them excellent and this was no exception. Their flights were very well timed so we weren't arriving into Tenerife at some god-awful time of night. The pre-flight add-ons weren't horrendously expensive and the website easy to navigate. We printed boarding passes at home which meant check in was a breeze. You can both outward and return well in advance but most passengers appear not to do this for reasons which are beyond me clearly preferring a lengthy check in queue rather than the (no queue) fast bag drop. Boarded and departed on time. Onboard warmly welcomed both directions by friendly experienced crew. The seats are not like sitting on a cloud but at 6ft tall they were fine even for me for 4.5 hrs. The additional god-send is the inability to recline which made the whole thing very bearable. We pre-booked hot food both ways which was very good and filled a gap. Bags waiting on carousel in Tenerife. Return much the same with zero queue at bag drop lovely staff and on time departure. The only slight snag was a 40 minute wait for bags in Newcastle. Overall Jet2 is a great company that is a clear example of company able to operate a low cost model while caring about its customers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1

Outward was no problem at all. Allocated seating stops the stupid free-for- all crush and instantly makes the whole thing better than Ryanair. Coming back we arrived quite early and were told that the plane had been substituted for a smaller aircraft hence they were looking for people to bump onto the Lufthansa LHR flight. That'd probably be better for some people but we specifically needed to get back to STN. Fortunately they got enough people to change and we got checked through OK. However no-one told most passengers that their seat reservations were no longer valid (it was a completely different seat layout!) and so there was some frustration on boarding.

London to Istanbul was slightly late but no problem as I was using the Servisair lounge adjacent to the gate. All other flights on time. The long layover each way at Istanbul's modern Sabiha Gökçen (SAW) airport was the worst part especially as neither of the lounges accepted Priority Pass but helpful staff at Gloria Jean's Coffees allowed me to plug my laptop into their power and there was wireless available. Hilarious safety video featuring children – a great idea because you just have to watch it. Planes modern and clean.

I had the misfortune of sitting directly behind a couple who's two babies screamed incessantly for the vast majority of the flight. The cabin crew showed about as much interest in shutting them up as the parents did. As a result a long flight made seemingly longer due to the constant racket and lack of sleep. I flew business on the way out and the attitude of the cabin crew was pretty lax. Once they'd handed the food out they were not to be seen again until breakfast was served. The return leg in which I flew economy wasn't much better in terms of the attitude of the cabin crew. The only way I've been able to guarantee a non-veg meal is to request it when booking-in online.

When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child. When we land in Philadelphia we go directly to the gate so that there will be no worries of us missing our flight. The time comes when we should be starting to load the plane and my husband goes and asks when will be boarding and they inform him the gate has changed which they had not announced. Us along with most of the people sitting around us run to the new gate. When we arrive they there is a delay because they have to bring in a new plane once the new plane arrives they have to clean it after an hour they tell us there are problems with the plane. We wait again and they announce the pilot has run out of time and they need to bring in another. Our 6 pm flight ends up leaving at 11.30 pm. When they do start to board the plane the lady starts yelling at everyone to hurry up like we were the reason for the plane being so late. The return flight comes around and I am thinking surely this time things will be better - wrong. We look at our tickets to see if by any chance we will have someone to sit with my son on any of the flights No. Then I notice that on one of the flights I do not have a seat number. I go to the counter and ask what does this mean and I am told I have to check at that airport when I arrive. I ask does this mean I will not be on the flights? Oh no you will be.

On return we were bussed to the aircraft this time a 757-200 which must have seen service in the Far East as the second language on the passenger warning signs was either Chinese or Japanese.

Overall the journey was ok. Outbound we were in economy cabin on the upper deck of the A380 and we were lucky enough to get seated in the rows of two seats which were comfortable enough. I'm 6.1"" and my travel companion is 6.3"" and in terms of leg room for us there was not a lot. There is also a foot rest fitted to the back of the seat in front which when raised digs in to your shins. When it's lowered you can stretch your legs out over it but it then digs in to your calf muscles. It's poor design and it does affect comfort somewhat but not to the point of distraction. There were plenty of entertainment options available. Both my partner and I had issues with the IFE on the outbound leg which lasted about 30 minutes but the steward was able to re-boot the system for us eventually. The food was good and plentiful and the service was also excellent. The crew were constantly passing through the cabin handing out water and juice and other drinks were available during the flight from the back of the plane. The flights to and from Bali were on a 777-200 and both were fine. One thing to note we were served curry on the flight to DPS and it was hot. Sinagpore may need to tone down the chilli a little. Return leg from SIN-LHR was on 777-300 and at boarding it didn't look like it would be a full flight. We were in the forward economy cabin and this filled up and most seats were taken.

First time in 4 years with Delta and I have to say I was impressed. The seat on the 767 out of LHR was fine (and I am a big chap) with good leg room. Flight attendants were professional if not a little unsmiling. Food service was good and drinks complimentary. The IFE was good with a good selection. The internal flight down to MCO was delayed an hour due to bad weather but we made up some time during the flight.

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,Tracy Hooper,United States,2015-02-11,I have only flown this airline once (RT) and will never fly them again. Both times the flight was delayed once by 1/2 hour and once by 2.5 hours. They actually had the nerve to post 'on time' on the electronic board along with the rescheduled departure time. When I questioned the 'on time' the customer service agent said they hadn't yet updated the sign. Um then why does it say 11.30 instead of 9.35? Unfortunately it wasn't until I made my reservation that I noticed a review (1/2 stars) that they are consistently delayed. If you are needing to get somewhere especially if you have a connection I strongly advise you avoid Frontier and if you must pay a little extra for an airline that cares about their customers getting to where they want to go relatively on time.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Legroom was sufficient and flight attendants managed to a conduct a beverage service on a full flight despite a flight time of only 39 minutes. Connection at DFW was seamless. Flight to LGA on a 737-800 had the seat next to me empty which provided a more comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very young which was surprising.

Flight from Tokyo was pretty good. From Moscow there are no direct gates so you have to take a bus to board the plane. Waited 10 minutes inside the bus while it was right under the plane already. Another one and a half hour inside the plane before they drive us back to the airport and gave us 400RUB (gets you a coffee). Overall the flight was late by almost 6 hours on a 4 hours route. From Tel Aviv the flight was late by about half an hour. Upon landing had to board the bus again. It drove for about 20 minutes to the terminal. My bags didn't arrive to Tokyo (because the connection was too short).

About 1pm she became extremely hungry and we could not settle her. I asked if there was something I could buy because our baby was hungry. Told me no and that I should have packed something. She wouldn't even give us the breakfast they served because it was old so bringing something on board with us would not have been great either. I asked another who gave us a fruit cup but that didn't last long. Eventually given cheese and crackers which settled our baby. 5.5 hours is a long time for a child especially a baby.

The A380 is easily the quietest and nicest airplane to fly on. Staff and service were near faultless on both legs (Melbourne to Dubai and then Dubai to London). They were attentive knowledgeable and efficient. The meals were pretty good in general. I had a rack of lamb for dinner with some quality wine. What I'm not happy with though are the Business Class seats. They are very ordinary indeed and there are much better offerings available from many other airlines. The seats are ageing lack storage space and seem to have functions that no longer work - at least my seat was like this. Wobbly armrest and a TV that wouldn't lock down in place. The footrest is particularly uncomfortable as in its folded position it sits ""proud"" of the rest of the seat. The tray table was unsteady and made for some interesting balancing acts for food and drinks. There is very limited space to put drinks on the narrow shared arm rest between seats with not enough room for two drinks to sit side by side. If you have a window seat you don't have direct access to the aisle and end up having to leap over the person next to you if they have their seat extended for sleeping. Even with the new ""mattress"" to put on top of the seat for sleeping the seat is still hard and you end up with sore hips / back after a short period of lying down.

I had a connecting flight in Denver to Lincoln Nebraska. Fortunately I had a 3 hour layover in Denver which gave me plenty of time to walk from one end of the airport to the other for a connecting flight and believe me when I say it is a long haul. If anyone has a short time span to get to a connecting flight I suggest they arrange for a cart. Passenger space on United is cramped. I sat beside a big guy and had to lean well over into the aisle in order for both of us to be able to sit in the side by side seats. My return from Lincoln to SFO was a nightmare. I arrived in Lincoln got my boarding pass and when I looked at the pass and compared the time on it to the departure time listed on the board I noticed that departure was at least one hour later - which meant that I would miss my connecting flight in Denver. When I pointed this out to someone in the airport departure gate area they told me to get on the red phone to see if an alternate connection could be arranged. Once the plane finally arrived and I boarded there was still a good possibility that I would miss my revised connecting flight in Denver. I got on one of the cars that transport passengers from one gate to another arrived 15 minutes before the connecting flight was scheduled to depart and found that it also had arrived late and was just disembarking. This of course delayed the scheduled departure time of that flight. Finally to my relief I boarded the flight from Denver to SFO only to sit on tarmac for over an hour due to lightning thunder and rain.

The flight from Goa to Doha was an A321 which did not have fully lie flats seats but recliner type seats which were ok considering the flight was short and lasted only for about 3.5 hours. The service on the flight was excellent and staff addressed you by name. The food was good but it was more in the continental style. The premium lounge in Doha was superb with an excellent spread and nice ambience. The shower areas were great. The flight from Doha to JFK was a Boeing 777-300 ER which had fully lie flat seats and were really comfortable. The AVOD system was good. Service provided by staff was again excellent and they made an extra effort to make you comfortable. Pyjamas sets were provided plus Salvatore Ferragmo pouches. Food was good but again of continental style rather the Middle Eastern style which was my preference. The luggage arrived before economy class and we were out clearing immigration in no time. On the return flight from JFK airport the American Airlines lounge called the Admirals lounge was pathetic you could only get one coke water or beer per person. You could have a few cookies some fruit and some salty titbits as complimentary everything else you had to pay for. The return flight was very similar to outbound flight and same great service was provided with similar amenities.

Qantas flight attendants are some of the most attentive and professional I have come across. The amenity kit was nice and included what one would expect. The printed menu was a bit too casual and three were left for me which was a bit confusing because they were all different. It took me a while to realise (small letters which I find hard to read) that two were from the previous Sydney to Santiago and Santiago to Rio legs (on 11 June the Rio service was a special for the World Cup). Qantas certainly are well above the average and are different in many ways from other airlines. They try to be so different that they do not have a sign for the Business or First classes check in areas in Australia but instead there is just one in black that says Service. This is annoying and idiotic.

Took the Premium Economy class flight to and from Auckland and I loved it. The seats are spacious and comfortable and it definitely felt much better than a red-eye flight on Economy. The complimentary bottle of water is a great touch because you do tend to get very dehydrated on a flight and having the bottle meant you didn't have to ask for a glass of water from the attendants every 10 minutes or so. The pillow provided is big and soft and very comfortable whether to hug or to prop against your back. The USB and power outlet though not uncommon anymore are still very much appreciated. I'm not sure if this feature exists in other airlines or if it's even a plausible concept but it may be great if a passenger can play his/her own media via a USB device eg. movies on a thumb drive or the sort. On the flight to Auckland there were just a handful of people in the Premium Economy cabin so service was impeccable and thoughtful right from the start. The attendants even came around mid-flight to make sure everything was okay for me. On my return it was a fully- booked flight so the attendants really had their work cut out for them.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,Jillian Nichols,Canada,2014-09-14,"I flew from Winnipeg to Cancun with Rouge in August. My husband and I took 23 guests on our wedding vacation. From the get-go our entire wedding party had an awful experience. The flight from Toronto: in the beginning we were frustrated that we didn't get certain things that were promised to us when we booked our wedding through Air Canada Vacations. We were supposed to receive a complimentary upgrade which we did not (to make matters more frustrating there was another wedding party on the same flight of which the bride and groom were upgraded). They were also supposed to hang my dress on the plane and when my mom asked they said there was no room. While this on its own was frustrating the flight was delayed by about an hour. We were told to stay in our seats with our seatbelts fastened this entire time. We were travelling with our 9 month old daughter. When I got up to get her formula out of the overhead bin about halfway through this wait I was rudely scolded by the flight attendant and told to sit down. She slammed the bin shut. Everything else about the experience is just how most people say - seats are jam packed with virtually no leg room there is absolutely no in-flight entertainment and they only offer juice water and pop (everything else you need to pay for). If I thought the flight there was bad I don't even know what to call the flight home. After boarding the plane in Cancun we sat on the tarmac for three hours while they tried to sort out mechanical issues. Again travelling with a baby this was a complete nightmare. During the entire wait we were offered water twice. Eventually they told us we would be staying in Cancun. We disembarked and they put us in a small holding area with no air conditioning. We waited here for another three hours without being offered any food or drink. When passengers started to get testy they walked us through the airport to immigration. We waited and waited while all 200+ passengers went back through immigration and security. When we finally got outside and hopped on shuttles the Air Canada Rep said ""the hotel is all-inclusive - go eat drink."" When we got to the hotel they told us that Air Canada had not in fact paid for all-inclusive. We were only entitled to a meal and two non-alcoholic beverages. While this wasn't a huge deal it just demonstrates the disorganization and lies that were the theme of our entire day. I will never travel with Air Canada Rouge again. The next morning at the airport only some of our wedding guests were given connecting flights through to Winnipeg. Once we arrived in Toronto we were sent home on three separate flights. On our flight there were six guests. Three were offered a complimentary food item ""for their trouble"". Apparently the rest of us (including the bride and groom) were not on the ""list"". All in all Air Canada Rouge turned our wedding vacation into a complete nightmare.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

One World Mileage Redemption Award through AA. JFK check-in was excellent and CX uses the BA First Class Lounge that has room for improvement to be more like LHR T5. Boarding was not well organized but First Class on board was outstanding as always though the menu selections aren't quite as good as a few years ago. The wines and other beverage choices were excellent. Hong Kong's CX Wing First Class Lounge was excellent and their Cabanas are great for rest and showering/bathing. The non-stop flight from HKG to CMB had the new Business Class seats while the flight back from CMB to HKG had Regional Business Class seats due to a one hour stop in BKK therefore not considered long haul. The new Business Class seat (was also on the plane from HKG-JFK) is very well designed with much storage space though the cushion is not the softest and there is an awkward angled step in the foot well floor just in front of the footrest. Meal service was good and the staff was efficient while most were friendly and helpful. All the planes were clean and the toilets were maintained well throughout the flights. I used the UL Serendib Lounge in CMB due to my OW Emerald Tier status knowing that the Araliya Lounge used by most airlines is very average.

Puts the US carriers to shame. Got onboard and realized I was seated adjacent to a mother and her 3 young daughters in the second small cabin of business class and imagined there was going to be a lot of family chit-chatting so asked the purser if there was a window seat in the first larger business cabin available. She found a family member of a CX staff travelling on a pass and asked her to switch seats with me. I then used the lavatory and returned to my seat with a wad of tissue. This was noted by a flight attendant who arrived at my seat with an entire box of tissue for my use throughout the flight. That was thoughtful. Food was excellent particularly the hamburger from the mid-flight snack menu. I asked to have the first meal served 'express' with everything (appetizer entree dessert etc) on the tray delivered asap after take-off as I was really tired and wanted to just eat fast and sleep. This was no problem and done as requested. Seat comfort good - lots of storage space. Selection of movies and very good. Flight on time. Flight attendants couldn't have been nicer - polite obliging.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Singh,United Kingdom,2015-01-11,Los Angeles - Heathrow - Los Angeles over the holidays. Club world is a perfectly fine business product. Staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. Food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. Portion sizes not huge but I don't need the calories anyway. Plenty of drinks offered. An unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if I was ok and if I would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. In terms of product this is not a million miles away from United business (both even have backwards-facing seats). However the BA cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. United's intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. Just like with the 747 the upstairs on the A380 has side storage which is useful. The upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). But downstairs is light and roomy. On return on Dec 29 I was delayed at the gate at Heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated. These company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in Club and behaved appallingly for 11 hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the A380 from every crew member that passed. They acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. Upshot? As long as BA doesn't stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you you'll enjoy club world on the A380.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

The seats were old and most of the individual lights were missing as was ours. My seat's footrest would not raise fully my wife's would not fully retract so sleep was not a serious option. The entertainment system did not work so we were given ipads. The earphones were not compatible with these so the sound was inaudible. The Business class toilets did not work from the outset so these had been barred from use. My overhead reading light and the hostess call button part of the entertainment system controls did not work as the cord was fractured. Obtaining the hostess was only by walking into the cabin between business and economy. So for 12 hours: No sleep no video with sound no light for reading and no hostess to assist me attending the economy toilet during a period of severe turbulence.

Fortunately ground staff in VIE were more helpful particularly during boarding with small children. Onboard the newly refurbished 777 legroom was reasonable however by fitting 10 seats across in a 3-4-3 configuration seat width was seriously reduced. This must have been one of the least comfortable seats I've been on even compared to short haul United domestic flights. Cabin crew were again inconsistent.

Though there is apparently a business option on this route it is very difficult to see the benefit and indeed as the usual entry to the cabin is at the rear a seat at the back is preferable for many. Though the flight is just over an hour a reasonable box meal is served comprising a fresh sandwich (tuna on this flight) fruit a biscuit and a drink. In addition tea and coffee are served by the friendly crew. Coupled to this the check in process whilst entirely manual is reasonably swift Vientiane airport is small but pleasant and bags were delivered quite swiftly on arrival in Hanoi. My wife is not keen on small aircraft and said she would rather not fly this type of aircraft again; I on the other hand certainly would and can recommend Lao Airlines (who also have some jet ATR 72s in a fleet and no Russian antiques) to anyone.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Checked in very early and upgraded to Main Cabin Select. Upgrade includes a checked bag a free head set and unlimited food drinks and movies on demand onboard. The extra leg space was a God send / see previous review. Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat. Crews on both flights did not tidy up the restrooms which were always in great demand.

Wait time to check in and board was minimal. Business lounge was nicely refurbished and expanded since the last time I visited in April. I was greeted personally once on board by one of the cabin crew which I thought was a nice touch. Food was decent for coach and drink runs were abundant. The cons to the flight was that the 772 used to fly this route is seriously starting to show its age. AVOD carried a wide enough selection of films but was not the most state of the art touch screen ones you find on newer planes. Baggage was already on the carousel by the time I cleared immigration but it didn't mean much as I was met by a colossal line to clear customs due to the poor facilities at LA airport.

First of all the price is substantially lower than other carriers. Ticket agents and flight attendants were professional and friendly. It as of now is the only non-stop from LA to Scandinavia. People who are quibbling about the add-on prices for baggage food etc. need to consider that this is an improved feature for all travelers. We used to all have to pay for two pieces of luggage free food and alcohol whether we wanted it or not. Now starving college students and budget-minded travelers have a choice and can go to Europe. They can buy a sandwich and bottle of water in the terminal and fly non-stop to Copenhagen for a little over $500 round-trip. That is the fare that two of my relatives obtained who are flying tonight to Copenhagen. That is an amazing fare! If you want food and alcohol and blankets and earphones you have a choice! Choice is good for everyone. By the way nothing is free. You either pay for it with a higher overall fare or you pay for it piecemeal.

SEA-OGG and back and was severely harassed for trying to use my common Graco infant car seat to keep my baby safe in flight (the airline approval sticker was partially ripped off however you could clearly see it was airline approved). Once they finally said I could use it I was not allowed to use the car seat correctly (rear-facing) as they said it would not allow the person in front of it to recline their seat. Never mind that there were very many empty seats on this flight they could have moved this person to including the empty seat next to him if it had bothered him. Then was harassed because they assumed I had not purchased a seat for my infant when in fact I had and was required to show my tickets to them. Again despite having at least 8 empty seats within four rows of the seat I was in - it was a very empty flight.

Outbound flight was one hour late due to late departure from Cambodia but boarding was swift and the aircraft which had been on the ground for only 30 minutes or so was spotless. Meal supplied was spicy noodles with chicken and it was very good. Return from Phuket was spot on time and boarding was OK. Meal served again surprising how the cabin crew can manage to service a full plane in such a short time. Seats on both planes were OK with acceptable legroom. Cabin crew were excellent and food quality good. Perhaps the management of Bangkok Airways could be persuaded to work their magic on some European low cost airlines? Would definitely recommend this airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,1,NA,NA,5,1
cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2012-10-11,BKK-MNL-BKK. Check-in in both BKK and MNL was efficient. NAIA-3 very quick. I usually buy the 20kg Baggage Allowance just to avoid the hassle. Both flights were on time even late in the day but arrival into BKK was delayed because the pilot parked incorrectly and had to be pushed back to the correct position... Cabin Service was fine but the flights were quieter than usual I think because many passengers (me included) are flying Tiger from Clark to BKK because in some cases it's half the price of Cebu Pacific who are not significantly cheaper than Philippine Airlines on some routes. I've been looking at prices over the next few months and Cebu Pacific need to be more competitive if they want to fill their planes like they did a few years back.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

It was the last flight of a day when a flight had been cancelled earlier and seating was overbooked. I was assigned a middle seat. One of the flaws of their intra-Europe flights is that you cannot ever book your seat in advance and I paid for my ticket 8 months in advance! Previously I was served a meal on this short flight but not this one. We were only given a small dry sandwich and a cup of water (no second drinks service). The flight attendant in charge seemed to care less about anyone in the ""premium cabin"". Air France make no effort to distinguish the intra-Europe premium economy experience apart from you being seated near the front. The late night flight to HND on a newly refurbished 777-200 was actually quite nice. The crew were very accommodating and the toilets were clean throughout. The premium economy seat was OK but you cannot get any sleep in them as many have said. The entertainment system is updated with touch screens though I couldn't find much to watch. I ordered a special Lentore meal in advance and it was delicious. The standard pre-arrival breakfast was dreadful. No food offered between meal times during the 11+ hour flight. The only good thing about being in premium economy is knowing you're not squeezed into economy. Overall not a very positive experience for me this journey.",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,6,3,4,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

The snack served each way on this 3.5 hour flight was perhaps the most environmentally unfriendly food service I've seen: a large plastic tray wrapped in plastic containing a very small packet of a couple of small crackers another packet (plastic wrapped) with a small cake and a small toil-wrapped cube of cheese). Much more plastic than used to be used when the airline served hot foil-wrapped ham and cheese sandwiches. A child became ill on the flight when we landed people started to disembark then were told to re-board the plane until a health official came on board.

Just before landing a muffin was offered with tea or coffee. This seems that the airline is cutting cost on their food. The crew seemed to be friendly and attentive. The transfer of passengers from the plane in Abu Dhabi to the main arrival hall in a bus is very uncomfortable because in sweltering heat it is hard to walk up to the bus especially for the elderly.

We had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of £240. When we boarded the aircraft (Boeing 747-400) the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. The 'yin and yang' seat configuration didn't work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. The seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. My IFE did not work on the return flight. The in-flight food was above average but not outstanding. Check-in at Mumbai for the return flight was very slow. We were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all.

On board IFE had a decent selection touchscreen not very responsive though. They served dinner and breakfast in the morning. Honestly both were quite good. Staff were smiling even during breakfast in which they surely looked tired but they kept a professional attitude. They gave us a pillow and a blanket (which were acceptable) and the headset (terrible sadly). During the flight water was distributed frequently and you could also serve yourself in the galley for some snacks or some juice and the staff was gald to help. The recline is not bad at all but the pitch is really lacking sadly. No mood lighting also (which would have been a nice touch). Capt spoke frequently to the cabin also because of some sustained turbulence we had that interrupted breakfast: he assured everything was alright but we were unlucky as some strong tail winds shook us for a good part of an hour on the Atlantic. After we landed it was a mad rush to the connection with Air Dolomiti to Verona: FRA is quite huge and we only had an hour or so.

The meal was edible by airline standards which isn't saying a whole lot. My biggest problem with the whole flight was the general total air of non interest from the cabin crew!

Please either use newer planes with IFE flights 3+ hours or give out ipads Q streaming as is done on the 767. Flight back was on the new VH-XZO with IFE and the food was a lot better and with choice this time. What a difference it was like flying a completely different airline.

Seats Ok but they have design problem with the button for service which is located on the arm rest. Seats are quite narrow and result is that me and other larger people were always accidentally hitting the button which annoyed the flight attendants and passengers no end. Catering was very disappointing. We pre-ordered wraps for lunch and these came with a drink. Wraps were as tasty as cardboard and drink was choice of coke or green jasmine tea in a can. We did not want either drink and asked if we could have water replacement. Completely surprising answer was that this was not possible with pre- ordered meals. We then thought we would buy something alcoholic - beer was warm so we decided on the wine. Decided on a white and then discovered that this was also warm. These are small things that could easily be handled with a bit more attention to detail and some flexibility by staff to keep passengers happy.

Airline hotline took the booking, but declined to take down my FF (told me to look for my partner airline, basically it is not their responsibility). Check-in directions were confusing at PVG (went to the wrong international flight counter) and check-in staff wasn't that helpful. Plane was new, but service left much to be desired.

thomas-cook-airlines,/airline-reviews/thomas-cook-airlines,Thomas Cook Airlines customer review,B Glover,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,Manchester to Cancun 18/12/14. We flew from Manchester to Cancun with Thomas Cook and against these other poor reviews it was a faultless flight. I've come to the conclusion that people only review if they have an unpleasant experience. I advise anyone reading this to fly with Thomas Cook long haul. It's a comfortable and friendly airline: Check in - no queues with many desks open and ready. Boarding - very fast and organised immediately onto plane. Plane interior - We flew on the new refurbished A330. The cabin was a 2-4-2 configuration and at the back a 2-3-2 configuration. Seats were comfortable and reclined slightly. There was a large amount of leg room and overhead lockers also. We flew economy but in premier economy at the front there was a 2-3-2 configuration. There was no significant difference. Slightly larger seats with a pillow and amenity kit but not much benefit in upgrading. Inflight entertainment - absolutely fantastic entertainment. Touch screen 8 inch screen on the back of each seat. Economy came with 5 films and around 100 different music albums which was fantastic ranging from pop to country all free. if you paid £4 you gained 20 films and 30 TV shows which most people did. Films could be paused forwarded etc. There was also a USB port and headphone plug in. There was games and a map saying how far you had left and time at destination etc. As well as immigration details and Thomas Cook videos. Staff - Cabin crew were all very friendly. Food - Cooked by James Martin and I did not eat but others said it was average. We received lunch and afternoon tea. Toilets - were more roomy than usual and fairly clean. I highly advise flying long haul with Thomas Cook. It had no delay great service and entertainment. The journey back was a different story. The seats were squashed dirty and impossible to sleep on. unless I was flying on the new refurbished cabins I would not fly with Thomas Cook. The new A330's are flawless but the old ones are disgusting. There was no entertainment and the cabin was old.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

I would pay more for my flight just to get a nutritious filling meal. It seems like they actually go out of their way to find the most unappetizing cheap food possible. They also showed current movies good for viewers of any age and gave a free set of headphones on the way to our destination (you must keep them for the return flight).

We were then picked up by buses and driven to the Sheraton for an enjoyable 3 hour nap before returning to PVR. The reason provided is the Mexican authorities would not give permission to depart PVR as the airport closes at midnight.

A competitor cancelled by misstake our return leg out of Liverpool to Basle and the ground staff was not helpful at all (to say it in a polite manner). What a difference at the VLM ticket counter. The woman knew our situation and offered us a reasonably priced ticket to LCY from where we could continue our journey. As we booked last minute and security checks etc. took longer we got denied boarding at the gate as the flight would have left late if it waited for us to be bussed to the aircraft. Received free lounge acces in Liverpool (A special offer at the moment) and free rebooking to the next flight. Friendly FAs served candies upon boarding and free food and drinks during the short flight. Of course it was somewhat like a cold hamburger but more important is the way they treat you. You might pay a bit more but you get treated as a human being. Arrival in LCY was smooth and in the terminal within minutes. Called their London office a couple of days ago for a copy of the electronic ticket. We need that to reclaim the money from their orange competitor. This request was handled promptly and with no problems! Their Fokker 50s are ok for the routes they use. All in all reminds me of what Crossair used to be years ago.

Despite arriving early there was a long queue at check in. As is usually the case at Casablanca there was much shouting and arm waving during the process with the police called to moderate one argument which looked to be heading towards a fight. Eventually got to the front of the queue to be told that the flight was overbooked and they had no seat for me. I was given a boarding pass for the direct flight to London at 3pm the next day. I explained that I did not want to spend another night away from home and that I would like to transfer to any other flight to Europe. I was told there were no seats available. I was given a slip of paper to take to the cashier to claim 1500 Dirhams compensation. The cashier refused to pay offering only an upgrade to business class for my next flight. I spent some time at the ticket office trying to get another ticket to anywhere but was told that the ticket office could not issue tickets and that I had to queue up at a check in desk to ask if there was space on a flight. I did this twice which took until after lunch.

singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,A Moffatt,Australia,2014-05-16,"I was very disappointed by the Singapore Airlines business class travel experienced recently. My partner and I flew from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines three sectors on the A380 and one on a B777. Surprisingly the B777 provided the more comfortable experience despite the lack of a fully flat bed. The seats on the A380 are extremely wide (which was the initial draw card and the reason for spending $1500 more than for Cathay Pacific) but you have to sit in them diagonally to reach the foot rest - this was comfortable for about 5 minutes. The beds in the fully flat position are quite comfortable but unlike other business class seats there is no smooth transition from sitting to lying - you are required to 'make' the bed. When in the bed position there is no comfortable backrest to allow you to sit comfortably - hence the large number of business travellers seen sitting cross-legged in bed throughout the flight! Furthermore the seats are leather but are very worn sometimes damaged and the headrests do not stay in position. There are no individual amenities kits (just an eye mask and some slippers) - a selection of items are available in the toilet cubicles. There are no pyjamas as on some other airlines. The service was highly variable. The worst sector by far was from Singapore to Heathrow. The staff were anything but attentive the bathrooms were unclean and food was dreadful. Garlic bread was cold and rock hard and the ""Book the Cook"" proved to be extremely disappointing. The lobster thermidore was a complete let-down and looked nothing like the pictures posted online by the airline and other travellers. The nut-encrusted veal was unfortunately the toughest and coldest piece of meal I have had on a flight and the ""crust"" was more like a soggy coating. That said the meals that were not pre-ordered were generally of very high quality. The entertainment system was excellent. Having previous travelled in Business Class with Qantas and Cathay Pacific I would not hesitate to return to these two in preference to Singapore Airlines in future.",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,4,2,3,4,5,NA,NA,2,0

Return trip was considerable better. I sat at 1A on the 737 and although the food was bland the cabin crew managed to top up my glass several times. The KUL lounge was full and seemed relatively pointless given that there were more comfortable seats outside. It was hard to get a drink. After finally getting onto the A380 we had to wait an hour after some confusion over the cargo which meant we missed our slot. The pre-ordered food was great and I had finally worked out that the flat-bed seat of most comfortable when it not quite flat. One of the stewards told me they had recently been modified but was not quite sure how. I managed several hours sleep and awoke to a pleasant breakfast.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,McGuire Jack,United States,2014-05-01,MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it.

I was unable to put my head at the correct height on the head rest for any support as I am too short to reach it. I couldn't lean against the window (even though I had my own pillow and a special neck support collar) as there was a gap which my pillow would fall through. The return flight was even worse starting with check in at the airport. If you haven't done web check-in which isn't always possible while on holiday you have to wait in line while those people who have take their baggage to the agents. They had 3 lines one for priority one for web check-in and one for everyone else. There were 4 desk agents dealing with passengers. The flight was a red-eye and I was prepared for the blasting cold air but my husband had to borrow my scarf to cover his face and head because he was freezing.

The food was pretty good I had the fish option which consisted of Baked Salmon with black pepper sauce lima beans and carrots and spinach mashed potatoes. On the side was a warm bun with butter and a chicken salad. There was also a haagen-dazz ice cream for dessert. As this was a 16 hour flight we were offered a second meal in which I got the chicken with rice option that came with a peach yoghurt cake topped with honey toasted oatmeal a fruit salad and once again a warm bun with butter. The seats were fairly comfortable and I was very thankful not to be on a flight with the old fixed shell seats. The AVOD at my seat was horrible. It would not respond to my touch at all or would take more than 5 minutes. I alerted the cabin crew they told me that I had to take it slow. After showing them that it didn't work they went back to the galley apparently ""reset"" the AVOD and told me to try again. They ignored me after that.

At Denver they shuffled us back and forth between customer service and the boarding gate finally they ended up booking us on a flight to Oahu then Hawaiian Airlines to Kona.

Our return flight was not any better. We arrived at the airport early and was told they had a flight leaving shortly and room on it. With our Kona bound experience we thought it may be a good idea to have more time. Before we boarded they had hydraulic problems and the flight was delayed. We were told our tickets were gone for our originally booked flight. So we waited and for once we made it in time for our connecting flight to Denver until we boarded the plane and the starter went out on the plane they brought it back in fixed it but not before we missed our connecting flight from Denver to Omaha. By now we were wondering if this was normal for United? At Denver again we were shuffled around until they finally found a flight into Omaha for us. Our flight experience with United was well below satisfactory levels. The maintenance issues should be a concern for United. I wonder what their Preventative Maintenance plan looks like if they have one at all and or if they should reconsider their Union as paperwork should not take that long.

Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you.

Travelled on the London - Manila - London sectors several times from early December 2013 and was generally happy with the 777 comfort. However my recent journey from Manila to London was terrible. Evidently Philippine Airlines started using 15 year old A340 planes on the route in early August that appears to be part of the problem - slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality Middle Eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the in-seat media system - understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. Very basic food compared to alternative carriers. Philippine Airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for $500 which is then $500 less than a business ticket purchased online. Advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full - presumably passengers took the $500 check in upgrade. Philippine Airlines need to decide whether it wants to be a budget or premium player in the airline business.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Egli Olivier,Switzerland,2014-01-08,Flew Zurich-Doha-Bangkok in coach. What I experienced was not surprising but rather confirmed the different things I had read about them: first off the planes are almost brand new and in excellent shape. The inflight system especially on the Dreamliner is worth its name. The seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size (I am 176cm). The flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. Communication is excellent. But service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. On both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. No smiles no communication. Secondly: the food! While the chicken on the way from Zurich to Doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from Doha was simply inedible. Layover in Doha is something to be avoided. The transfer ride is tiring the terminal is awful and the food court easily the worst. All over a decent experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,2,2,4,NA,NA,4,1

Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure.

All from Houston to ATL KC and Tampa. Yes they do charge $10 to pick your seat and the seats are rather uncomfortable when you compare pricing you will find that after you have checked 1 bag per person and have paid the random fees most airlines charge you they come out a lot cheaper. I recommend you print your passes before you get to the airport as they charge for every little thing if you need anything. My first flight the flight attendants were excellent they had a very funny safety presentation. That flight I flew in the base seats and it was rather uncomfortable. After my ATL flight I decided to upgrade to the big seats up front. They were very comfortable and very roomy. They are worth it. My flight to KC was delayed 2 hours. I joined the $9 fare club which paid for itself the first flight as I save an average of $40 per flight on tickets and luggage. I will say that there is merit to some of the bad reviews above but if you want or need to fly cheap Spirit is a quality airline and as I said before I read before I buy and Spirit has an average airline fleet age of 4.5 years which is 10 years less than the more popular airline. They do allow you to move seats next to your party after take off if you don't get seated next to your party. I booked my latest flight to Tampa for 8 people a week ago 2 weeks before travel and for 8 people 5 in the big chairs and 3 in the small seats it was around $1100.,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,5,1

Now for the negatives: service a bit slow during dining was forgotten for about 45 min while others were served then finally when given food salad course was skipped and remaining courses were incomplete (no bread had to ask for utensils etc).

On a short sector Manila/Hong Kong I found the seat uncomfortably hard and actually found my back aching. How can they have padded the seat so sparsely? Secondly the seat does offer some recline and an opportunity to snooze although not quite enough especially if one is tall. I'm short 5'8"" and my feet were bumping the apparatus in front of me that housed the next seats. Truly 2"" more of leg room would have been very good and one wonders why Cathay made the pitch so tight. Thirdly the seat has no foot rest - a true failing. How did this happen? In all Cathay's service is good and attentive but the seat in the new regional business class needs a respectable amount of padding 2"" more pitch and a place to rest one's feet when reclined!",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,1,5,2,5,NA,NA,5,1
united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,A Miller,United States,2014-03-26,First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage. The movie selection available was also decent. Food was okay for the first two meals and the third was disgusting.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,2,2,1,4,NA,NA,2,0

The outbound flight arrived on time seat comfort was very good and there was a very frendly and competent cabin crew at work. The return flight arrived about 25 minutes late (rush hour at TXL) but the standards of comfort and cabin crew were equally good. But the overall feeling was not very inviting and quite annoying because both flights (Airbus A321) were more or less full. There were lots of business travellers with huge carry on luggage lots of heavy jackets because of winter time and yes boarding and deboarding an Airbus A321 through only one door takes a long time. But I am not going to blame Swiss for that elsewhere I would have had the same experience. I paid EUR 180 for the ticket which is a good fare from my point of view. I will definitely consider Swiss again. Zurich airport is very efficient and passenger friendly while it is good that Berlin TXL is going to be replaced.

Check in was simple and efficient in both directions and travelling through Brunei Airport was a joy. Small quiet no ridiculous long distances to navigate and not daunting in any way. I also prefer having two stops (3 x 7hr legs) between the UK and Australia as being in the air for 14 hours on the now standard 1x7 + 1x14 hour leg is nothing short of horrific.

The food was excellent although I did expect breakfast to be served a bit earlier on when flying from SIN-BNE. I was slightly disappointed with the Inflight Entertainment system. It was not as good as British Airways simply because there was not as much choice. On the return journey it seemed like I had watched everything twice over. However I rather liked how the system did not turn off when the plane was beginning it's descent as it often does with other airlines.

We had the seats immediately behind the seats near the emergency exit. The couple who sat in the seats in front were 'big'. The lady who sat immediately next to the emergency exit had some difficulty fitting her 'bulk' into the seat and she must have had an uncomfortable flight because much of her bulk spilled over to her partner who was just as bulky - both although around 5.6/7 in height were easily in the 20 plus stone class. She could only get her seat belt on with the assistance of her husband. There is no way these individuals should have been given flights in that location and before you say why didn't I say something all this was done in full view of the steward - he must have seen that the couple would have been unable to assist in an emergency and their physical bulk would have impeded any emergency exit from the aircraft.

I had already paid 30 Euros for my piece of Luggage at time of booking so after paying and having requested wheelchair assistance on my original booking I was told to sit on a bench and wait. Eventually I was taken the departure gate only to be told after waiting 1/2 an hour and asking that the plane was 45 minutes late and would be leaving from a different gate. When we finally boarded - I did have priority boarding but that didn't seem to matter I had to walk across the tarmac to the plane and with much difficulty walk up the steps to the aircraft with my small carry on (I was not offered any assistance) to the last row.

sas-scandinavian-airlines,/airline-reviews/sas-scandinavian-airlines,SAS Scandinavian customer review,Gustafsson Magnus,Sweden,2014-09-19,I travelled on September 19 from Barcelona Spain to Oslo Norway on SK4686 (13.20-16.40). I had made reservations in SAS Plus (former Business Class) and was seated on 2F. The aircraft used on this service was a Boeing 737-800W. The general impression though travelling in SAS Plus is that of a low-cost airline. The generally very good impression of SAS cabin staff was missing on this flight no spirit and nothing extra. It seemed to just be another ordinary day on duty without any enthusiasm and lack of special attention to the passengers. There are no longer any free middle-seat in SAS Business Class (now named SAS Plus). This particular flight was fully booked in SAS Plus so the comfort was not good. When boarding the aircraft in Barcelona it was extremely hot in the cabin no air-condition were available until slightly before pushback from the gate. This particular aircraft did not have a SAS interior (different seats colour panels etc). The seat pitch was very limited but the seats were however much more comfortable than SAS ordinary seats. The in-flight service started about 25 minutes after departure with the choice of a cold sandwich salad or a hot vegetarian pizza-slice all meals served in a paper box. I choose the salad which on this flight was a chicken salad. To my opinion the salad was not tasteful and tasted like all the other salads that SAS offers on intra-European flights - definitely a much lower quality than to be expected by a Star Alliance member. After an additional 15-20 minutes drinks were served i.e. no good timing or thought-through service. Pre-dinner drinks after the meal strange? After an additional 3-5 minutes coffee and tea was served without even being able to take two sips of my pre-meal drink. I travel with SAS quite a lot but unfortunately I must admit that the quality of the product offered is not good and can not be compared what the other Star Alliance members offer. I'm on the verge to no longer recommend SAS Scandinavian Airlines.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,3,2,2,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,A Snyder,United States,2014-07-01,"We planned a trip from Pittsburgh Airport to Memphis Airport (supposed to be a 4hr 45min trip). We were traveling with a 3 yr old. We arrived at Pittsburgh Airport with our flight scheduled to leave at 6.30pm when checking in they said that our flight was delayed due to bad weather and offered to move us to a flight leaving at 4.45pm we agreed and actually made it in time to board. Once it was our turn to board we were told our boarding passes were not valid and had to get out of line to go back to the lady at the boarding counter to receive new boarding tickets. We finally boarded the plane and eventually made it to our first lay-over at Chicago Airport. Ended up waiting at this airport for almost 5 hrs for our plane to arrive. Yet again when trying to board we handed the lady our boarding passes and she scanned them and was told they were invalid. Again we had to get out of line and wait until we were cleared by whomever she called about the matter. After finally getting on the plane we waited an additional 20 minutes for a passenger who for some reason or another was late. Finally we landed at Memphis Airport at 11.15pm an hour behind schedule and thank goodness our rental car place was kind enough to wait 20+ minutes after they closed at 11pm so we could get our rental we had reserved. I was hoping our flight home would be less eventful not so lucky! We arrived at Memphis Airport and things went smoothly (I had high hopes after this) we arrived at Orlando FL airport. Once we arrived at Orlando airport things went downhill. We almost immediately found out that our 4.15 flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to ""weather"" and wouldn't be leaving until 6.45 pm. After trying to figure out a plan we called customer service at Southwest and was told that she didn't know why we were told that our flight was delayed due to weather in fact it had to make an emergency landing in Baltimore due to mechanical issues. 6 long hours later we finally took off around 7pm and arrived at Pittsburgh Airport 5 hrs behind schedule at 11.40pm.

Another highly positive aspect of flying with Swiss airline is that you get plenty of leg space (compared to other airlines) and the seats are very comfortable even on short distance routes which shows that Swiss airline is one of the few airlines these days which doesn't compromise quality.

In terms of inflight service I found it to be more than acceptable. Seat backs were a bit hard but overall 13+ hours in their seats did not feel unbearable at all. IFE was good but the outdated screens could do with an overhaul (777-200). I found the service to be good. The flight attendants were always visible and very attentive. They keep you well stocked up with food and drink during the flights. Yes attendants can be quite terse at times but this was mainly due to passengers ignoring the command to put their seatbelts on during times of turbulence. Elected to upgrade to Economy Comfort on EZE-AMS return leg in order to attempt up get some sleep and to be one of the first to disembark the plane due to a short connection time (45 minutes) and it was worth it.

The queues at Melbourne and Sydney terminal 2 are notoriously long and while we all stand there waiting with people stressing and Jetstar staff running up and down the line calling passengers to counters for 'called flights' the adjacent Qantas check in counters (especially the dedicated Qantas Club ones) are empty with staff having lovely personal chats. Why doesn't Qantas Group either use these under utilised counters and check Qantas Club members in or create a dedicated Jetstar queue for these premium passengers instead of constantly annoying us by making us wait for ages. Surely it wouldn't cost too much to implement and would be a fantastic customer service to an already pretty good airline. Just because it's a 'low cost' doesn't mean premium passengers should be treated in a low cost fashion.

I'm 6'5"" my eldest son is 6'6"" and my wife is 6'1"" but we couldn't pre book the extra leg room seats as we had children with us - fair enough. However the seats were very very cramped for us we literally couldn't move. The row in front was the extra leg room seats and was empty so once the flight was airborne we asked if a couple of us could sit in them. Guess what we were told to pay for them if we wanted to move despite having already paid for pre booking our seats and I would suggest being unsafely jammed in our seats. So as I wouldn't pay again we sat like sardines looking at empty spacious seats in front of us all the way. There was nothing available without paying. No water no headphones etc. What I found most unbelievable was that when the cabin was cold and people asked for blankets they were told to buy them at £5 each as part of the ""comfort pack"".

I had 2 experience with Precision recently flying return between Nairobi (NBO) and Kilimanjaro (JRO). Our first leg between NBO and JRO was fine departed and arrived on time and fair service onboard with a cold drink served and a pack of cashew nuts. 2nd leg JRO-NBO was a real problem. Arrived at 8.30am for our 10.55am flight was told our flight was cancelled and put on 3pm flight. No apology and treated it as a matter of fact. It wouldn't be as much problem if we didn't have a connecting flight to catch in Nairobi to Dubai at 4.40pm. So what was an easy connection with more than 4 hours to spare originally arriving NBO at 12pm became 4pm leaving 40mins to catch our connecting flight. Apart from the extra 4 hours spent at JRO which had nothing much to offer we had to stress about whether we could catch our connect flight to Dubai (and later the Maldives). They didn't have the courtesy to contact us beforehand in which case we could alter our subsequent flights. No explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled. While we were there there were a few passengers showing up with news of their flight to Zanzibar being cancelled as well so it appears this is not rare occurrence. Once again avoid if possible but if you must fly try to pick a busier slot so it won't be cancelled.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,3,2,3,0,NA,NA,2,0

Onboard there was NO catering apart from a ridiculously overpriced buy on board selection and free tea and coffee.

The 737 is a wonderful aircraft but when you stuff it full of people one can only conclude that corporate greed trumps creature comfort.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,K Mapstone,United States,2014-09-06,I decided to fly Spirit in spite of negative publicity regarding baggage and other fee extortion because the times worked the best. I did not have a problem with my baggage because I was diligent about adhering to the size and weight restrictions. Unfortunately my flights were delayed both ways (one due to flight crew not showing up and the other due to weather). This was the least legroom between seats that I have ever experienced on any flight. Not to mention I had two people sitting next to me on the first flight who both were way too big for their seats making it impossible to get up to go to the restroom during the flight. It would make sense for the flight crew to manage these situations because it is unsafe and unreasonably uncomfortable. The flight back was equally miserable. The elderly father and his son sitting next to me were also first time Spirit flyers and we spent most of the flight discussing how we would never fly Spirit again since they had similar bad experiences. There were two empty rows in front of us and the son - very tall - sitting next to me asked the flight attendant if he could move into one of them. The flight attendant said he had to wait until the plane was in the air and then two very rude women were allowed to take seats in those rows about 30 seconds later (before the plane even moved from the gate). The woman who took the row of seats directly in front of us weighed approximately 350 lbs and spent the flight lying across all three seats snoring loudly while we sat in our sardine accommodations behind her. I knew not to expect frills but flying Spirit reminded me of an airborne Greyhound bus filled with the people of Walmart. Now that I have experienced it I know that it's worth it to change my schedule and pay whatever it takes to fly another airline. I realize that Spirit is one of the most profitable US based airlines with more than enough people to market this low-end service to; however I would strongly encourage my friends to pursue other options for their air travel. Most people I know care about service and would be equally disgusted by the Spirit experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Once in the air leg space and distance between seats was unacceptable for an international flight with no air conditioning. Air crew made the flight even more miserable with all of them being miserable. On the return flight everything turned into a nightmare arriving in Lisbon flight had been delayed to 8.00 pm rather than our 1pm departure. Given food vouchers and told we would have a hotel upon arrival in Toronto. Once at the gate our flight changed to 11pm departure then back to 8. Finally departed at 11.30pm from Lisbon. The crew were very nice and helpful during the flight. Our connecting flight carrier Westjet had clearly seen this with SATA in the past of connections not being met because of lateness the Westjet check in staff member in Pearson said it was a common sight.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Jacob Korsgaard,Switzerland,2015-07-24,"Was travelling two adults and two kids with seating fixed at the time of booking the tickets (and seat numbers specified on the tickets). When doing the online check in, we realized that Cathay Pacific had decided to change our seating. Of course they did not have the courtesy to inform us up about this to give us the chance to cancel the tickets and travel with another airline. So, Cathay Pacific had decided to split our family up. 1 adult is seated with 2 kids and 1 adult is seated somewhere completely different - 21 rows apart, to be precise. We found this out after normal office hours and then discovered a that Cathay Pacific only has reservations desks (as opposed to customer services desks) that you can call. Could not get their international 24 hour number to Work. Tried their Hong Kong number but after spending 15 minutes on hold I hung up. Next morning called the local reservation office in Zurich. Sorry sir, can't help with seat assignment it is a different system but you can do it yourself online (had already explained that we tried this but there were no 4 free seats together or near each other) or ask at the chek-in at the airport. As any family reading this can probably imagine, we arrived completely tired to our holiday after the long flight after plenty hassle of shuffling 2 small children back and forth in the cabin between mummy and daddy at mean times, toilet times, crying times etc. Now, we will see about the return flight after which we shall never set foot on Cathay Pacific again.",NA,FamilyLeisure,Economy,Zurich to Hong Kong,1,2,1,2,NA,1,NA,1,0

No line check-in at T3 handled by Air Canada. Lounge No 1 is OK but champagne is £8. Boarded on time and took my seat which is one of those dreaded ""angled lie-flat"" contraptions that can't really be reclined to it's full stretch for fear of sliding off onto the floor. Luckily MEA's flights to Europe and the Gulf are only 3h to 4h. Also the controls only offer certain positions (sleep meal partial recline takeoff etc) as opposed to individual controls for the backrest the footrest etc - you can't customise the position. Food was OK very old fashioned - chicken with rice beef with vegetables etc - nothing distinctly Lebanese. Service came with a scowl - I really tried to get a smile out of any of the crew but they really didn't want to be there. After the meal was complete they spent the rest of the flight in the galley not even an arrivals drink service just a hot towel on descent. Entertainment on demand was pretty good about a dozen western movies and half a dozen Arabic movies. Bags arrived quickly at Beirut and formalities were a breeze. The return flight was identical (including the absence of good humour) although it should be added that considering it's MEA's hometown airport Beirut's check-in area is very dingy and the business class lines are hard to find.

I was charged €40 to have my boarding pass printed at the airport (something easyjet don't do) as there was no option for electronic ticket or self service check in. I could have printed it myself before flying of course but I was travelling when I booked the flight so thought getting from the airport would be my easiest option. Then before boarding the plane, which was a complete disorganised mess, I was told my hand luggage was too big and would have to pay €70. I knew for a fact it was within the correct measurements stated on their website and even had a tape measure with me. Funnily enough it didn't fit into their little box you use to test if it's the right size but I knew it was within the correct measurements so suggested I take out my tape measure and show them. This shut the woman up as she obviously knew the test box wasn't true to he size of the overhead lockers. Eventually, after a lot of attitude from staff I got through with my bag. Like easyjet they only allow one bag, no matter how small the second is, but they were much more strict in enforcing this than easyjet.

Flight back was the exact opposite - 1) spent too long waiting for a delayed flight in the very poor Garuda Business lounge in Denpasar airport. Massively overcrowded and poor facilities. 2) Gate was changed without notice from one close to where we were to Gate 9 at the other end of the airport. Wasn't even announced in the Bus Lounge. 3) after significant hassle with a pram and a 2 year old we eventually reached the Gate to find boarding had commenced (again no announcement). 4) at the Business lane gave the attendant our documentation. He did process that quickly but immediately let other passengers through (both Business and Economy). We were trying to get the stroller checked into the hold pacify a crying toddler at 11.30 at night and get our hand luggage together. People were allowed to almost trample us! Has to very loudly object in order to get some understanding and a bit of consideration. 5) Flight staff were poor did not circulate for drinks meals were poor. 6) on the overnight flight despite valiant attempts none of us managed to get the seat into a comfortable sleeping position.

Shockingly neither of my flights were delayed from LAX to Honolulu. If you're a low maintenance person then this airline is for you. You get what you pay for no reclining seats no complimentary beverages ($2 for a can of ginger ale not bad in my opinion) no inflight entertainment you have to pay for any extra features and to check in your bags. The staff was very friendly. We even landed 20 minutes early coming back to LAX since everyone on the flight checked in early. The only reason why I took this flight was because it was $400 cheaper than the next flight.

Travelled with 2 children aged 5 years and 1.8 years. When we tried to utilize online check in we were unable to do so. Contacted AT and were told that since there were 2 infants on the same booking (we were flying with other family members with infants) system and AT policy dictates that passengers must check in at the counter. Seems very strange as allowing people with children and infants would be better served with online check-in! AT lost my spouse's booking even though we had more then ample proof of payments and booking. We were told to contact AT customer service. We were told that AT just went through a system upgrade. To me it appears that a system downgrade occurred. Spoke with the supervisor who reluctantly contacted AT and resolved the issue. Check in time - just under 1 hour. Flight TS561 PUJ to YYZ due to the system upgrade check-in took over 1.75 hours (a lot of other customers were also complaining) at the end of which we were told that AT could not honour seat selection for 7 people in our party. Spoke with AT staff and asked for a reason and I was told that AT would be using a different plane. I asked and was advised that plane used would be Airbus 300-310 same plane we took from TO. When I asked the person for further clarification he indicated that each 310 has a different configuration. I asked whether 310 had rows 7 and 8 where we had booked our seats and the individual could not answer. Traveling with 2 infants and 3 children and checking in taking 1.75 hours and AT not allowing passengers to check in online if they have 2 infants is a prime example of an oxymoron.

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,M Chaney,United States,2013-12-17,I bought a classic plus ticket so that I wouldn't have to pay at check in. However if you check in online you still must wait in line (this was in Seattle and OKC) because there is no curbside drop off. You are better off using the kiosk to check in at the airport because you will receive priority for baggage check. They are severely understaffed and use outdated computers and communication systems so everything is super slow for check in. At OKC two of the 3 kiosks weren't working. Of the 4 flight attendant crews that I experienced on this trip one crew was awful and one crew was great. it had been a while since I had flown on Frontier and I'm with other reviewers when I say never again.

My husband and I are not enormous people and we literally could have used a lubricant to 'squeeze' into our seats! We made sure we had the bulkhead seats for extra leg room as hubby is 6 foot 3 inches tall but unfortunately this meant the seats were minuscule. Most uncomfortable 31 hours ever spent on an airline. Staff were inattentive and we watched a single mum struggle to get her meal eaten with no help from the cabin staff at all. Other passengers had to assist her! The cleanliness of the cabin left a lot to be desired. On our return journey we upgraded to premium economy but were place right beside the toilets! The cabin staff allowed economy passengers as well as premium economy passengers to use them so there was a constant stream of noise all night long! All together a very disappointing trip with Virgin Atlantic! I would not recommend them to anyone!

Seats are installed based on the airline requests.

Told they couldn't move us despite there being empty seats in business class. After a great deal of fuss we were moved forward. What a mistake - should have stayed in economy where the seats at least had a bit of padding and the service must have been better. No food served to anyone in business class but I assume you could have asked for it. Drinks offered once by a hostess that had difficulty with English so a red wine became a straight whiskey.

airbaltic,/airline-reviews/airbaltic,airBaltic customer review,W Wynants,Belgium,2015-01-14,I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,0,0,NA,NA,2,0

Seat comfortable, however controls difficult to work out. Food just okay. While respecting another country’s stance on alcohol, I think when one has paid a lot of money for the fare then some respect could be shown for cultural preferences ie wine with dinner. I found the one hour stopover in Dubai very annoying. Passengers must leave the plane, walk a long distance to the transit lounge, then go through security and then get back on the same plane again. bI was sound asleep when we arrived in Dubai and never settled again after this. Flight attendants were excellent but it’s a shame they couldn’t offer more ie better meals and wine.

Fairly quick and efficient check-in. Hassle free boarding and greeted pleasantly onboard. However the flights to and back were ruined by the seat comfort. As a very seasoned and regular passenger on scheduled flights throughout the world the TC 757-300 aircraft had the most unpleasant uncomfortable seats that I have ever had the misfortune of using. I am around 6ft and my knees were jammed against the seat in front. The seats were very thin and offered little support. The tray table was higher than I am used to and around 2/3 of the standard size. When the mediocre food arrived it was a struggle to find room to eat. Clearly Thomas Cook believe that they have found a 'winning formula' to cram the maximum seating into the aircraft. They have lost my future custom and I am actively ensuring that I don't recommend them to anyone else.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,1,4,3,1,NA,NA,4,0

tam-airlines,/airline-reviews/tam-airlines,TAM Airlines customer review,Kevin Donegan,Germany,2012-11-14,MAD-GRU-BSB. BSB-GRU-FRA-TXL (last segment on LH). Generally a good experience. Madrid to Sao Paulo on A330 clean seat comfort average. On-board service good but old LCD screens on the IFE leave a lot to be desired. Sao Paulo to Frankfurt was on a B777 in a 3-4-3 configuration which I thought would be very tight because of other customer comments here but are actually fine and I am a fairly big guy. Seat recline very comfortable for Economy class and IFE was above average. A321s on BSB-GRU segments were clean and pleasant. All flights on time. Transfers at Sao Paulo are confusing but I recommend a minimum 2-hour connection arriving in Sao Paulo if you are connecting to an onward flight because of delays at immigration baggage pickup and drop off and a confusing airport (on first visit). Several colleagues missed connecting flights in Sao Paulo arriving on AF and KLM with a 90-minute connection and had to spend the night. Language skills at the airport are poor if you don't speak Portuguese. Two TAM airline staff in Sao Paulo insisted they could not check me in and issue a boarding pass for my LH connection in Europe even though the whole trip was on a TAM ticket. I was later able to do this at the TAM automated machines in Sao Paulo.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,4,4,NA,NA,3,1

Last night I went onto their website and I entered my reservation number (wanted to see if I have a supper on flight or not) only to find out that the seat reservations that I had (purposely reserved early to get a good seats) was completely discarded. The company decided to use a smaller plane from a 747 to an Airbus and because of this I now no longer have my seats available to me. I now had no choice but to recontact the company myself only to have them advise me that I have to choose seats over the wing - the only ones left. They never contacted me and I can only imagine what sort of impact this would of had on me if I had found this out on the day of my departure. My group reservation would have been scattered through out the plane. I am aware that the seating is not guaranteed  but come on!

Remains a solid product with a friendly professional crew. Seats: comfortable enough suggest centre aisle. Good duvet and real feather pillow so able to get some sleep. Meals: excellent quality for airline food and adequate portions and complementing wines. Movies: Did JFK-JNB-JFK in the same month so I was hard pressed by the end of March but it is a good on demand system. Value for money: SAA has monopoly on the routes to South America from SA so they can and do charge what they like. Worst Part: SAA continues to use low grade cheap instant coffee in Business class which is not acceptable when so much attention has been paid to other aspects of the product. Additionally JNB-EZE is day time flying during comparatively 'normal' hours either side of the south Atlantic yet SAA insists on blacking out the cabin with all window shades down. 11 hours is too long to sit in artificial blackout especially since I have never been in SA226/7 when Business class is more than half empty.

Having lived in London for the last 11 years I was on a flight moving back to New Zealand permanently. Flew with Singapore Airlines on SQ317 from London to Singapore and had excellent service the whole way. The flight attendants were friendly food was served quickly and was delicious trays were removed quickly and we were constantly provided refreshments. At the beginning of the flight my sister was having problems with her entertainment console so the attendant offered to re-boot the system. it was done immediately and they checked after a couple of minutes that it was working. It happened a couple of times during the flights so the attendant gave her a voucher to use towards a duty free item which was a very kind gesture. However our onwards flight from Singapore to Auckland was extremely disappointing and one of the worst long haul flights I have been on. Most of the flight attendants were very friendly (I did hear one tell a traveller that they couldn't fix their console as they were about to serve food which seemed very unhelpful) however their service was extremely lacking. Shortly after taking off we discovered that our entertainment consoles were not working properly but either continually freezing or losing sound. We pressed the buzzer for a flight attendant but after waiting 10 mins and watching them walk past us a couple of times we had to ask them in person for assistance. Rather than offer to re-boot the consoles as Singapore Airlines had done we were informed that they had been aware of the problem in Singapore but were unable to fix it until they got to Auckland. For a passenger on a 9 hour flight who has already travelled on a 12 hour flight just beforehand this was very disappointing news. We were both transferred to other seats (seated separately) however the cabin was so cold further forward that I ended up returning to my original seat. The service and quality of the food was also very disappointing. The chicken dinner we were served was very salty and the breakfast omelette was rubbery. The chicken sausage accompanying it was inedible. The attendants were also extremely slow with clearing the trays in comparison to Singapore Airlines. My sister is has Gold airpoints status so we had priority labels on our luggage however we were one of the last to get our luggage upon arrival in Auckland.

hawaiian-airlines,/airline-reviews/hawaiian-airlines,Hawaiian Airlines customer review,Robert Main,Australia,2011-04-14,HNL-SYD on B767-300ER. I bought a discount Economy ticket but was able to upgrade at the gate to Business Class for $400. It was well worth it. HA Business Class seat is an old style business class seat not a reclining flat bed. Nevertheless with the spacious pitch and large foot rest it was comfortable for dozing. IFE is a portable media player which was fine since no one was seated next to me. It wasn't stable there. The movie selection was not first run but it was adequate for a ten hour flight. There was no power outlet in the seat for my laptop. The food and service were excellent. The meal was a selection of three dishes from an assortment and were delicious. The wine selection was ok but the mixed drinks were fun as you would expect in Hawaii. Most importantly the service was exceptional friendly and helpful,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,James Tinning,Austria,2013-09-12,Perth WA to London LHR on 8 August. I have never felt so well looked after onboard any airline. Despite the length of this journey (22 hours) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perth - Doha leg was onboard a B777-200LR a very comfortable aircraft. The IFE was brilliant and I was well entertained by (literally) 100s of movies games and television shows. The cabin was ambient with a lovely mood-lighting system. The connection at Doha International was smooth and took me just 1hr and 30 minutes to be onboard my London-bound flight coming from the 777. Doha is a very pleasant airport and a much newer one is on the way. The London leg was onboard B787 and had a very comfortable arrangement (as do all Qatar Aircraft) with Thales IFE. Again wonderful entertainment. The food was wonderful at all parts of the journey and various meals are provided with generous portions. The cabin crew were so professional and smart very friendly.

Journey started with online check-in and a bag drop at Malaga airport. The queue was not orderly and the staff did not police the queue very well at all. The check-in agent who dealt with me seemed indifferent and did not make eye contact with me which was rather rude. Boarding the flight took quite a long time as the flight was full. Far too much hand luggage had been allowed aboard the flight. The cabin crew were not very friendly nor welcoming at all. There was considerable turbulence during this flight and the crew did little to allay the fears and concerns of some of the passengers. A small snack was served as well as a drink. At the end of the flight an overheard monitor displayed the route taken for a few minutes only. There was no goodbye from the crew at the end of the flight.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,R West,United Kingdom,2014-12-18,Had 3 flights to/from Gatwick - to/from Faro Larnaca Lanzarote over the past 3 months. The Faro flight was very uncomfortable as it was so hot and stuffy - and you cant escape it but after talking to a helpful person in Norway I was assured the other 2 flights would be properly air conditioned which they were. Always prefer airlines where you can adjust seats and that was the case re Lanzarote. The short films would be better if we had headphones and could listen too (or simply listen to music). The free wifi just about allows for emails to be received or sent but you need a well charged device to take full advantage of wifi (or provide a charging point). Slightly confusing in regards to 'flight mode' regulations as clearly it only works if your device is not in flight mode! This is the one airline however where the food and drink options are too limited and lack 'healthy' choices or good veg options - (Easyjet are best for food/drink). Unlike any of the other airlines we have to remember to bring own snacks etc. Finally no hassle with hand baggage which used to be a pre-flight concern with extra stress when flying with Ryanair or Thomas Cook. Easyjet has the best and clearest policy here 'if it fits it is free'!. One tip for all airlines - boarding should start with those seated at the back so front passengers do not hold up others when storing hand luggage. Ratings apply to last flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,2,2,NA,NA,5,1

I was on a scheduled connection home from TLV via Istanbul with a one hour connection time. By the time the aircraft parked offloaded passengers and we cleared security in the transfer lounge I arrived at the gate 10 min before he next departure time only to be told that the flight had closed and I couldn't board.

Without any warning or explanation my flight from Bali via Shanghai to Toronto was delayed by two days and I was told I would have a 24 hour layover in Shanghai at my own expense (technically I would not be permitted to leave the airport without a visa). When I tried to speak to a representative in Bali I was informed that China Eastern does not have representatives in the country - only ticket agents. The website does not provide a customer service email (which is a fairly unique approach) and when I finally got through to an English speaking China Eastern office operating out of Vancouver (from my hotel in Bali) I was informed that I needed to speak with the Shanghai office. Finally when I got to Shanghai nobody from China Eastern was in the least bit interested in either explaining what happened.

The customer service was excellent polite and helpful. If you want food and beverages you pay extra and they are a little overpriced but I can survive without a coffee for 55 minutes. The planes are fine for short haul basic leather seats and the plane was clean and tidy. The main thing that lets them down as with most regional airlines is the booking service. The constant extras added for credit cards baggage choosing a seat etc. You also cannot make a reservation for 2 people leaving but returning at different times. You have to make 2 bookings with 2 booking fees and 2 lots of credit card fees. Also the baggage allowance is 20kg. Most international flights allow you23kg so using FlyBe as a connecting airline they sting you for you larger suitcase.

air-china,/airline-reviews/air-china,Air China customer review,M Jeannie,Canada,2015-01-14,Flew YEG-YVR-PEK-BKK return. Flight from YEG-YVR return was on Air Canada. Travel from YVR-BKK return was on Air China. Seats for YVR-PEK return was selected at booking time however when confirming flight info of trip at later date no seats assigned as there was a change in aircraft - this resulted in having seats in less desirable area of the aircraft. Confirmation was obtained regarding return flight info for departure time and seat assignment. The outgoing flight to Bangkok was on schedule. In cabin service was fair - they did not go out of their way to offer water or snacks on a 13+ hour flight - passengers had to serve themselves the majority of the time. Meals offered were edible. Return flight from Bangkok was a complete nightmare. Arrived at Bangkok airport at 4am for a 6.10 am scheduled flight to Beijing - no listing of flight - it took over an hour to find someone who eventually advised us that the flight had been rescheduled to 1.50 am that morning and that we missed our flight. Advised that we would have to deal with Air China rep who will show up around 11.45 am to check in passengers for a 2.20 pm flight. Attempts were made to make contact with Air China in North America and Beijing - no success 7+ hours later the ticket wicket opens however no Air China rep shows up until numerous requests were made. Another hour goes by before boarding passes are issued for BKK-PEK. Required to fly standby for the remainder of the trip which resulted in an overnight stay in Beijing. Attempt to obtain boarding passes for PEK-PVR and was advised we missed our flight>had to explain the whole scenario again - after 45 min boarding passes were issued and advised we have no seats from YVR-YEG and will probably have to overnight again. Client service provided in YVR was excellent ticket agent met us at the gate upon arrival and ushered us through customs and to the Air Canada kiosk for the issuance of the final boarding pass to YEG. I will definitely not fly with Air China again It is not worth the frustration I had to encounter trying to rectify a situation that resulted from them changing departure time without advising their clients.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,S Hopkins,United Kingdom,2012-09-03,I thought that I was booking a budget airline and accept all that entails however as the final cost once all the 'extras' such as luggage were added I finally paid over 2500 for my families seats and may as well have gone on a better airline. The plane was clean and it took off and arrived on time. If you are travelling on a weekend break for 2 adults then I imagine it wouldn't be a problem just so long as you read all the small print and adhere to them very carefully however with 4 small children and no way to book a seat it was extremely stressful. I do not understand what they gain by using this system! Would go as far as to say that it is immoral that knowing that you cannot take drinks on board they do not supply water and a small bottle of water is £3! Staff were miserable and openly complained about other passengers whilst stood next to me. They enforce the rules when it suits them. They told a lady that she had to put her cardigan in the overhead lockers but the woman next to me had a handbag on her lap.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,F Gong,Australia,2014-04-30,On 15th Sept 2013 we four people from Australia after visiting beautiful Paris went to Paris Beauvais airport to catch 9:20 am flight (FR9632) to Rome. All were checked in online the night before in the Hotel we stayed. However boarding passes were not printed out as per instruction in the email from the airline. a mistake was made by us. At the check-in counter we were told EURO 70 per person would be charged if no boarding pass was presented. We could not believe it in the first instance but later were confirmed by his duty manager. We do not believe that EURO 70 for printing a boarding pass is justifiable by any standard. It is in fact more than the airfare itself and more than the fee for an extra luggage (EURO 60). While we accept the error we made the punishment was well beyond anyone's imagination hence it is not reasonable and not justifiable. We felt like being robbed on highway with no way to escape. And we still do. We must point out that the check-in gentleman was kind enough to show us a self-serving Internet kiosk/access point where printing was available. Unfortunately after tried on two computers with loss of a total of EURO 20 worth of coins and notes we went back to the counter and tried to request for printing at a fair and reasonable cost. The second complaint is about the way in which the duty manager a lady handled our request for help. She was arrogant in our view. Having heard of our explanation she showed no sympathy but said it was the company policy and we either pay or do not fly today. The fact that we could not print out the passes at the computer kiosk did not bother her at all because it was someone else's equipment hence nothing to do with her.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,0,NA,NA,NA,1,0

syrianair,/airline-reviews/syrianair,SyrianAir customer review,T Lloyd,United Kingdom,2009-11-25,I tried to arrange a group trip with SyrianAir from London to Aleppo via Damascus and back. Initially all was fine until they cancelled the first leg of the journey to Damascus a week prior to us leaving. The next flight was 2 days later but there was no immediate plane to Aleppo once we had arrived at Damascus which meant we would have to take a bus up instead a journey we weren't too keen on. While friendly the staff are fairly useless and I sat for MANY hours trying to sort things out. We changed the flights to stay the same number of days but decided to go to Aleppo at the tail end of the trip under our own steam and the fly Allepo to London (again via Damascus) on the same ticket. Unfortunately the staff didn't really get the 'group' concept and kept issuing tickets for the wrong dates for different members of the group. It took too many visits to their offices in Baker Street to finally get everyone on the same flights at the same time. The flight to Syria was fine (late) and we managed to get up to Aleppo ourselves but the day before we were to fly out again we went into the Syrian air offices to confirm everything was ok. IT WAS NOT. They had cancelled the flight to Damascus without informing any of us and we had to arrange a midnight bus from Aleppo to Damascus Airport to make the correct flight back to London.

I wasn't aware VA was a 'budget' airline and 700 bucks constituted 'budget' tickets but clearly they did. Booked through WebJet some sort of cock up led to us being charged $260 to take a couple of bags onboard. Upon trying to pre-pay luggage for the return trip advised this was completely impossible by VA. However went to the airport on the return leg expecting another huge bill and baggage checked in without a murmur! Go figure. On the plus side no delays and got us there and back just fine. Don't much like budget airlines however with stupid complex booking tiers and inflexible attitude especially not for a 4hr flight so doubt I'd ever use VA again unless forced to.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

For example dim sum excellent but a beef rib meal was inedible. One small downside was the service of drinks. Despite an extensive drinks menu we were only offered a pre-meal drink on one occasion.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Ian Solomon,Australia,2014-10-08,Having flown First or Business class long-haul from east-coast Australia to north Africa the Middle-East and Spain three times as well as trans-Pacific to North America twice in 11 months I consider I am well qualified to say that both Emirates' First and Business on their A380s simply don't cut it. From the time my wife and I checked in at Brisbane there was simply nothing to make us feel special. plane seating is okay but no better than Etihad and the onboard shower more a time-filling novelty. A flight is not just the time on board. The lounge in Brisbane is dull and sparse and as it is shared with at least 84 traveling Business plus whatever FF card-holders are in economy not surprisingly very crowded and noisy. There is nothing to make the $23000 expended on First Class deliver any kind of special or exclusive feel. Onboard the outbound leg the cabin crew were obviously tired and disinterested. To land in Dubai and have to be off-loaded via stairs in the desert-heat and put on a bus for a 15 minute 5 kilometre lap of the on-going massive airport expansion project only to have to then walk scurry elevator and shuttle-pod back to almost where we started taking over an hour from landing to lounge. Lucky we're fit and speedy as it is a physical challenge after the 15 hours on board. The cabin crew on to Barcelona was a complete contrast to the tired Brisbane-Dubai crew with attentive service. Arrival in Spain was slick and via an air bridge. Departure however was a different story with the crowded lounge and nothing to eat except ham sandwiches crisps and a platter of limp stale pastries. The crew and onboard service were fine and the airbridge arrival in Dubai on time. The return Dubai to Brisbane was the final straw that at this stage has turned me off Emirates possibly forever. The chauffeur failed to arrive at our hotel. On arrival at the First check-in nobody could care less about out the chauffeur not showing up. First check-in promptly spat out the boarding passes and told us to get moving as it was a 20 minute walk to the gate. We managed to find a small First lounge just past the gate and had time for a quick refres. At gate 23 there was no separate priority boarding for First or Business passengers. All 520 passengers were jostling and pushing to get through one small door. Emirates boarding was farcical and sums up what Emirates have become. Once onboard staff did their jobs providing good attention all the way to Brisbane. First offers cabin service pretty much on demand however one thing I have never noticed previously in First was the constant clattering of cutlery and crockery. There are no socks at all and earplugs have to be requested. We also found the cabin hot and noisy and despite repeated requests by us and other passengers in First it remained uncomfortably hot. In conclusion I won't choose Emirates again.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,2,4,2,5,5,NA,NA,1,0

Attendants simply could not be bothered greeting passengers as they walked into the cabins (with one crossing her arms at the back of the cabin although she did turn out to be quite friendly). However service was friendly and attentive with smart use of torches to avoid disturbing passenger's sleep during the night flight. The medium size dinner and small size breakfast did leave me wanting for a little more food - although the crew happily gave me a banana on request. Inflight entertainment options were solid although screen was very small. Baggage was instantly available on the belt at MEL.

The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times.

Seats a little small. Friendly helpful service. Easy check in. The flight back was quite turbulent due to a storm and winds but the crew kept us informed all the time. Very good value for money.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Davide Greco,Italy,2013-12-11,Flew ORD-MIA last week onboard AA1252. First remark: I got a reward ticket using my AAdvantage points and I must say that contrary to what happens with many other carriers a free ticket with AA is really a free ticket as I paid only 2USD for taxes and that's something I really appreciate. Flying AA is a very basic experience though: plane was a B767-300 freshly re-painted but about 20 years old even if the seat comfort is okay for a 3hour flight. No entertainment just scattered small screens and no meal provided for free just drinks. Having to pay USD 25 for checking your bag is something I really do not understand but it is a general policy of US carriers. Crew professional and quite friendly and a very talkative captain. Left and arrived on time with no mechanical problems happened as in the 50% of the AA flights I had flown in the past (total-10) so no complaints at all this time and I will consider to fly with them again for domestic flights in the future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,3,2,2,NA,NA,5,0

There was no in seat entertainment option but the aircraft is an older 310 so to be expected and since it was a red eye flight most people slept after the meal anyway..

SYD-AKL was on the new 787 Dreamliner. Was excellent for the short trip although had to move to Economy for take off and landing due to no seat belt extension onboard. The IFE is new and much quicker to respond than the older style. It is more an app-style interface which was easier to use and less clunky. AKL-LAX was same reliable service from Air NZ. Helpful efficient mature staff with excellent food and comfortable seat/bed. Amenity pack is cheap and nasty compared with days past and no pyjamas compared with other airlines at the same or cheaper price point. Lounge in Auckland is good but always crowded lounge in Sydney is worn and needs a furniture update but still perfectly fine to kill the hours before your flight. Lounge staff in LAX are not up to the usual Air NZ standard but the drink selection is good the air- conditioning is cold and the food selection though limited is enough to satisfy for a snack. The showers were not up to the standard of lounges such as Virgin Atlantic and even Swiss International but ok to freshen up before the flight. The 777-300 packs a lot of people into Business class and the staff do seem to take longer than previously. The 767 seats in business are absolutely abysmal and even with the best will in the world I find it impossible to say anything good about them. Overall Air NZ is a very good airline with good staff great food and innovative product. The sooner they lose their 767 business seat the better though. Also if you're planning onward travel in USA do it yourself. There are so many better options available than the alliance offered by Air NZ with United.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1

Signs were bad to start with when the check in area at Tullamarine was shambolic with enormous queues and no bag drop operating. Eventually made it to the downstairs departure lounge and queued at the allocated gate only to find at the last minute that the gate had changed with no announcement which left about 50 passengers scrambling through the terminal to catch the flight. With the doors shut plane then sat at the departure gate for 25 minutes with no advice or announcements about the reason for the delay and how it would effect our arrival time. When the flight finally departed about a third of the in flight snack menu was unavailable and the attendants were unable to accept foreign currency despite us receiving an unsolicited email from Jetstar 2 days earlier explaining that foreign currencies were accepted on this flight. With a budget airline like Jetstar the customer needs to have budget expectations but its no excuse for the airline not misinform passengers and stuff them around.

I have traveled this route 4 times over the past four years and the same entree has been served. I wrote to the airline about this but obviously to no avail. Food-wise things do generally improve on the other legs but in general the quality is going down. AVOD was superb with great sound and picture quality.

At Singapore Changi Airport the counter will only open 2 hours before departure therefore no need to arrive earlier than that. Unlike some low-cost airlines seat is allocated at check-in time. Both flights depart on-time. The seat is comfortable. No service it is nothing more than a bus that can fly.

Flight to Honolulu had no problems or issues at all it was on time and everything went smoothly at the airport. Follow their luggage guidelines and check in online and you won't have any problems. Flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas was delayed 4 hours 15 minutes but they did give each person in my family $16 in food vouchers to use at the airport the problem was because of the delay we missed our shuttle from the Las Vegas airport to the parking garage where our car was. When I asked an Allegiant employee for some suggestions she just said I would have to get a taxi. When I checked in online 24 hours in advance for our flight home I was able to check everybody in except for myself (we had 10 people total). I tried to check myself in online a few hours later and it worked fine I just didn't get to sit by my family during the flight. There is no inflight movie so bring something to do. The seats are super small and there is not much room. No food or drink not even water is given unless you pay for it with visa only no cash. We got extremely affordable flights to Hawaii and otherwise would not have been able to go if it weren't for price Allegiant offered.

saudi-arabian-airlines,/airline-reviews/saudi-arabian-airlines,Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review,P Burke,Canada,2011-06-08,My first experience with Saudi Arabian Airlines and most likely my last. From the initial boarding a male flight attendant was rude and condescending to passengers. Once seated in assigned seat the aircraft was not full allowing myself and another passenger to share the four centre row seats. However before take off a flight attendant repositioned the passengers in front of us into our row stating the row was reserved. Although not pleased I thought that they had good reason perhaps a passenger who needed to lay down due to age or medical condition. However once inflight it became painfully obvious why the row had been vacated. The cabin crew actually arrived with blankets and pillows and throughout the entire flight from Dulles to Riyadh took turns sleeping. It was shocking that paying customers were placed in this position so the attendants could sleep! The food was good and adequate throughout the flight. The in flight entertainment initially appeared to be on par with other airlines however the movies ended 1.5 hr into the flight not to resume and no explanation as to why. I was very disappointed with the level of professionalism extended by the cabin crew in particular the male attendants.

As someone who is traveling almost every week airline performance is important. Perhaps it's the perfect case scenario but for all the reasons that came to be I am left having paid full fare for a 5 hour flight from Toronto only to get to the plane to find everything I had come to expect missing. I'll give Air Canada credit as I was very much aware that this was a ""operated by rouge"" badging which was very predominantly displayed throughout the purchase process. At the time I paid no attention to it as the price I was paying was exactly the same as all previous tickets purchased to this destination (I travel at least once a year to this destination to attend conferences). There is no entertainment screens no USB power no power outlets cramped seating. All of which I may be perfectly ok with if it was it on its own. The fact that they are combined is making this unbearable. Do I have an iPad? Yes is it charged enough to use for 5 hours? Absolutely not. As a businessman I've been on my devices all day and look forward to a flight without having to look at work or its related devices. None of my devices including my phone I'm typing this on is on a position to be used for extended periods of time by the end of the day. This is ignoring the fact I like to land at destination with a full charge! I spent extra money for a business class seat on the return expecting to be on the red eye and landing at 7 am to drive straight to the office. Seeing what a ""business class seat"" looked like simply same as economy with an empty ""for your convenience"" empty seat in the middle is useless. I will not get to sleep properly unwind relax and be ready for a full day of business when I land. Instead I had to cancel some meetings and move my flight up to ensure that I can land with enough time to get a proper nights rest before my next day begins. Unfortunately I will be replacing all my flights in which Rouge operates and as soon as I identify an airline which can accommodate the destinations I require from YYZ I will be dropping Air Canada altogether.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,4,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

I have never been so cramped on a plane - I'm only 5'5"" and my knees touched the back of the next chair when it was reclined - I couldn't lift my purse from under the seat in front (and bags bigger then a purse will not fit under the seat). My husband is 5'10 and couldn't fit his legs in front of him so had to encroach on my space. The person to my left was over 6' and also encroached on my space - claustrophobic. The first thing the flight attendant said to me as I reached my seat was ""do you like the legroom"" and laughed. One of the bathrooms was out of order for the flight. There are no movies unless you purchase a tablet for $10. We didn't try any of the purchased food so can't comment about it. Added to all this - originally we booked a 2 hour layover back from Mexico in Toronto to have time make it through customs and having to go through security again before connecting flights (sadly happens at TO airport)- our ""itinerary"" change to a rouge flight lowered this to not much more than an hour.

The stewardess spent much of of the trip trying to trouble shoot problems with access to the system. Most people gave up and spent 10 hours with nothing to watch. That makes for a very long flight and makes the assumption that everyone is travelling with such a mobile device and wants to watch tv on their phone screen. This is not good customer service for such long flights. Also unless you had accessed the app before your flight it would not run movies or TV shows. Despite over an hour delay taking off in Venice to Toronto no Air Canada rep bother to advise travellers to download it in advance from the Venice airport internet service.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,D Collard,Canada,2014-07-03,Vancouver-Munich-Geneva (4 June 2014) and return (16 June 2014). Flights on time; luggage delivered promptly; cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several juice and water runs on the long-haul flights. YVR-MUC and return: A330-300 with 2+4+2 seat layout. Two proper meals served the usual chicken or stuffed pasta as the mains (and for overnight flight YVR-MUC an omelette as the second meal). The main problem with A330 and A340 aircraft generally is poor seat design in economy. Window seats leave a 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage wasting space and very uncomfortable for anyone trying to lean against the fuselage to sleep. The two outboard seats (window plus aisle) are supported by two central stanchions that rob passengers of foot space. No standard carry-on bag will fit under the seats in front and more foot space is taken up by entertainment boxes. YVR-MUC flight had these problems. However MUC-YVR return flight had a new A330 interior with far better seat design: it still left the 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage but the two supporting stanchions were at the very ends of the pair of seats leaving proper foot space and enough room that two full-sized carry-on bags could be placed under the seats in front if desired. AVOD offered a vast array of films music and television programs (even binge-watching programs like the complete first season of the US House of Cards). MUC-GVA and return: E195 with 2+2 layout with seats more comfortable than on an A330. Even a sandwiches-and-drinks service for these one-hour flights.

I also asked them for an aisle seat because the website would not let me choose a seat. They told me that this cannot be done because I had a United ticket. Only at United they told me they cannot influence the seats because it is an Austrian flight - Catch 22. The plane was new the food ok the crew are nice but not offering top service. They told us that they ran out of wine at the dinner serving but then had it again. If you watched a movie and there was an announcement you had to take the earphones off in order to hear it because the announcement was only in the cabin loudspeakers but not in the entertainment system. On arrival in Vienna we had to take buses to the terminal which I found quite strange for such a large plane - I have never experienced this in an intercontinental flight to major destinations.

Pack 125 people in to an area designed for 50 people - standing room only. I hate flying this route but its the best connection to get home. My biggest complaint has to do with the temperature on the plane it is always way to hot to be comfortable. I always ask them to turn down the heat in the cabin but it hardly changes. What could AC do better? Start by asking for feed back from its customers hand out customer review cards to be collected at the end of a flight. Change the menu to higher quality food.

klm-royal-dutch-airlines,/airline-reviews/klm-royal-dutch-airlines,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,J Ray,United Kingdom,2014-05-10,KWI-DMM-AMS-MME Economy Comfort. I have worked in the Gulf for almost 3 years now and have only recently started flying with KLM. I generally use Saudia and have sometimes flown with Air France but I wish I'd decided to try KLM sooner. The caring and friendly service on board is great and the in-flight product is proving to be reliably good. Upgrading to Economy Comfort is definitely worthwhile. Seats 11D and 11G on the A330-200 to Kuwait and Dammam offer amazingly generous legroom. The catering service is the same as standard Economy but the options are interesting and have tasted appetizing. KLM also offers wine and beers once flights have departed Kuwaiti and Saudi airspace and these have been enjoyable. Movies on demand include current releases and the newer aircraft have decent sized seatback TV screens. There is no amenity pack - not even a simple pair of eyeshades and a toothbrush - on the overnight sector. This would make a nice difference when you are leaving the Gulf around midnight and landing at Schiphol at 6 in the morning. The in-flight management of services by the Purser was very polished and as previous reviewers have noted KLM seems to offer a solid choice. I took a connecting flight with KLM Cityhopper to Durham Tees Valley and the service was similarly friendly and professional on a Fokker 70 with two by three seating and the option of extra legroom. Bags were checked from Kuwait right through to Durham and the amenities at Schiphol whilst in transit were high quality. It is worth checking the schedule as some KLM Gulf destinations involve double hops and the order of these will vary from day to day. A flight from Dammam may stop at Kuwait before Amsterdam or call at Dammam en-route from Kuwait. If you board at the first call or leave at the second this will add a good ninety minutes to your journey whilst the aircraft is refuelled and cleaned. Passengers travelling onwards do not have to leave the plane and you can stretch your legs on board before additional passengers take their seats but travelling on the previous or the following day might remove the need for this inconvenience. Fares especially the least flexible economy fares have been very reasonable indeed in relation to the overall quality provided.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Booked ahead and they were not the cheapest so I was expecting an overall pleasant experience based on most reviews here. What we got were new comfortable aircraft with a great pitch but that was about it. Connecting in Muscat is in hordes at a way outdated airport. Service on both flights was ok to downright rude crews who did the minimum only. MUC to MCT disorganised and it took them 2.5 hours for the meal service on a not even 6 hour flight.

Not many people fly to Baku and there is never anyone working there. The Pegasus agents are always nice and say they will call them for me.

Have travelled on this route numerous times and always been happy with the experience but was very disappointed with my flight on Thurs. Check in - Bag drop desk manned by member of staff who had started that day told luggage too heavy and tried to charge £120 excess baggage despite both cases being under allowance printed on our boarding card obviously not trained very well. Had to get Supervisor to sort out. Boarding at gate 300 at Manchester always means a delay when using the remote stands why don't they start the process a few minutes earlier. Gate again staffed by obviously new staff very disorganised and checking of ticket against passport lax to say the least which is concerning. On board for almost 90 mins before take off as two people checked in bags and not turned up at gate so quite rightly bags had to be found and removed. Surely however given it took an hour to find the bags the people must of turned up by then surely common sense should prevail and if people found and bags not let the people fly. I did wonder given no checks were made on board to double check if the people had boarded in the confusion at the gate if this was just an excuse as I know this flight has departed over an hour late every week for the past five weeks. Can't wait for my trip later in the summer on the same flight to see if the same people don't turn up again. Flight ok this was one of the older A321's with new seating which was not comfortable. Our return flight was put back two hours a few weeks before we came away from 8pm to 10pm no discount offered however given it changed from an evening flight to a night flight and I notice that on time performance of this flight is poor to say the least.

The service and the crews are always friendly and willing to fulfil every need. They did come through the cabin every 20 minutes offering a selection of drinks from a tablet to not disturb the passengers sleeping. Onboard even in Economy nearly every drink is included and so you'll never regret choosing Lufthansa! The only drawback is the inflight entertainment system installed on the A380's and 747-8's the new RAVE system they refit onto the A330/A340 fleet is great but sadly it isn't available upon delivery of the aircraft as manufacturers don't install this system. But though the selection of movies in different languages is great the only bad thing about the system on A380 and 747-8 is the screens are responding extremely slow and they are quite small due to a lot plastic surroundings. And the flight information is insufficient as the system doesn't show altitude speed (ground and air) flight heading wind speed and direction and such stuff.

Got decent service when awake but the third flight with being peak season was fully booked and a nightmare - it is practically impossible to get a drink even though the staff are really friendly as they are so busy. The fuel stop is a nightmare and the flights shouldn't really be sold as direct because they're not. Check in at Gatwick is okay but at Bangkok allow 2 hours at peak season - very disorganised which leaves no time to go to duty free.

The cabin manager and a couple of the staff in the business cabin were excellent but were let down by a couple of their colleagues who looked like they were just going through the motions. One of these was an older member of the team who just didn't seem to have the friendly disposition and level of service you would expect when travelling in a premium cabin. The positives were the food and wine which was excellent. The negatives were the bed and the IFE in my seat went unserviceable fortunately there was a vacant seat so I was able to move over to that! When it did work the bed was of a good quality and the IFE had a good screen and wide variety of choice.

The departure and return times are ridiculous that is if you want a direct flight. The departure time is at 21.50 while the return time is at 00.30. Not wanting to return at that time I arranged to switch times and take a later flight in return only to discover that any later flights required a stop over which adds hours onto your travel time. Meanwhile there are more than one direct flight to other cities. Calgary springs to mind where there is one trip at 08.00 and the next around 10.00 or 11.00. A few years ago when I returned from Mexico again having to stop in Calgary many of our companions were immediately able to get on connecting flights while those going to Winnipeg had to wait until the next day which added to our costs.

Lousy is the best description I can come up with. Both outward flight from London and Return flight from Mumbai lounges were shared and were poor at best. Third entertainment. My seat 11A had a non functioning screen! It was locked in a position in which nothing could be viewed. The cabin crew apologised but obviously could do nothing about it. Meal choices. Very limited. And finally cabin comfort. The cabin is laid out in herring bone fashion the fold flat bed does not accommodate a 1.85 meter man. the décor is old fashioned in beige and brown. Shame on you Jet.

Flight was okay overall but it was not without its unpleasant moments. One of the lavatories at the back of the plane was out. As a result quite a large line formed after the food service. While I normally do not use the front lavatories as I know those are for Business or First class I assumed given the circumstances it was justified. What followed was a very ugly scene with the flight attendant who accused me of lying about the lavatory being out of order. We argued for quite some time as well as while she called to confirm. Only then would she let me use the restroom. I didn't appreciate being treated like a small child.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,D Van Hove,United States,2014-12-10,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average?

Given the terrible state of that country's economy I think the airline does a very creditable job. They can't compete against the likes of BA with the resources at their disposal but I found the flight crews to be very pleasant and attentive. They try hard to please and do their best at all times. I do find the temperature in the aircraft to be a bit on the warm side but it does at least prepare you for the heat of Zimbabwe which can be a surprise when you exit the arrivals hall. Checking in at LGW is reasonably smooth given that most returning Zimbabweans want to take far more on the plane than their allowance. Checking in at HRE has improved since the construction of the new terminal and the Air Zim staff are pleasant and efficient. What I do find as a shocking contrast is the unfailing hostility shown by the various gov't officials one encounters at HRE both arriving and departing. The Zim Gov't must make special efforts to recruit unpleasant staff to deal with British Citizens as it's quite obvious we're singled out for the maximum delays questions customs searches etc. Being unwelcome in the country is made very clear by the Immigration and Customs officials; completely the opposite of the attitude of most of the population.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Flight was to Stockholm with a transfer at Riga and first leg was delayed for an hour. Staff had no idea why but our Air Baltic connection could have waited as there were about 20 of us on the same route.

Got into Stockholm 4 hours later than planned. The lesson to be learnt here is never take such a short flight with a transfer and avoid the last flight of the day from the carrier to your chosen destination as small delays during the day build up to a big one in the end otherwise everything was fine.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,0,3,1,0,NA,NA,3,0

Outward flight with Little Red was as with my previous flights outstanding. The Little Red service exceeds what is expected of a short domestic flight and the crew clearly take pride in delivering the product. Another exemplary flight with the short haul branch. This was my first experience with long-haul Virgin. The outward flight to Newark was comfortable and I found leg room to be sufficient. It was perhaps a bit tight at the shoulders but I was in fairness seated towards the back of the A330's cabin where the cabin begins to narrow. In flight entertainment offered an excellent choice of movies including many that were nominated for Oscars. The crew were polite and friendly not exceptional but gave no cause for complaint. The food (chicken something or other) looked a bit pathetic and the chicken was a bit tough but actually tasted OK otherwise. The sandwich box was a tasty way to round off the flight. Ground staff at all airports went above expectations and were particularly helpful on arrival at Newark. I returned on a 747 from JFK. I had paid extra to select my seat choosing the upstairs economy cabin for the novelty value. Unfortunately my flight was remarkably quiet and they closed the upstairs cabin re-allocating me to the rear of the plane. The ground staff at JFK were not particularly helpful at first in addressing this although eventually offered me an exit row seat which was more than comfortable and although I wasn't offered a window seat (which I would have preferred) the offer to upgrade my seat was certainly welcome compensation. The flight was very lightly loaded and I had very few people around me. The beef stew for dinner was again not particularly appealing to look at but actually tasted very nice. The Gü puddings were absolutely delicious. The IFE broke down and was unusable but we were offered tablet devices and compensation for this - the issue was dealt with well. I managed some sleep on this overnight flight - the complimentary amenities kit helped a lot! I awoke to find I'd missed the breakfast service but the crew had kindly left me a tasty breakfast box without disturbing me which was very thoughtful. As for the final Little Red flight back to Scotland - again excellent. It is clear that the Little Red staff take a great deal of pride in offering what I judge to be the finest short-haul economy product in the skies. The Virgin product is pretty standard and although they promote excellent service certainly for the Economy product it only shows in small areas such as the nice puddings and some little touches here and there. It's certainly not a bad product but not quite the ""rock star"" service that they sell to us. I'd certainly use them again long haul although probably will not be able to with the domestic flights being withdrawn in due course.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Jackie Craig,Italy,2014-07-15,I flew with British Airways with my mother from Paphos to Manchester. She had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. I was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. Then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! I think this is total disregard for passenger welfare.

Air Canada has labelled it as a ""leisure"" airline which is code for poor service cramped seating space and price gouging. The number of ""Air Canada"" flight routes are rapidly dwindling with the carrier moving routes to Rouge service. Last week I flew Toronto return to Tampa. The seating pitch is cramped. The passenger next to me continually had their head in my lap while trying to access their under seat storage. When the passenger in front fully reclined their seat I briefly thought about offering them money to return their seat back so that I could have a few more inches of space. The entertainment system is not well thought out. Passengers on both my flights were not using headphones to watch their devices. Volume levels were on high to compete with the jet noise and their hearing aids. With the in-flight entertainment system headphones are required to access the entertainment sound. None of the flight attendants addressed the lack of headphone use issue but instead preferred to ignore it. The entertainment selection on the Rouge app is not appealing. Very sad is that the cost to fly Rouge in May was more than 40% higher than to fly Air Canada less than a year ago with the same advance booking time. I will not fly Rouge again.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,2,1,NA,NA,1,0

Poor selection of wine (hard to believe that the most popular wine in America - Chardonnay is not on flights to/from USA). Poorly stocked beverages every CPX flight I've been on has run out of various beers and soft drinks. Meal marginal. Overcooked beef. The service is bizarre. They are incredibly friendly and seem to be sincerely sorry as they apologize over and over throughout the flight for the various shortcomings.

The stop over in Dubai and Bandar were fine and due to departure time broke up the flight nicely so that an evening departure would lead to a morning arrival. The Dreamliner was actually quite loud but was more like a white noise than anything intrusive. The 3x3x3 configuration is very good and most solo travellers did not have someone sitting next to them which is a plus for long haul comfort the load factor must have been around 66% for all legs of my flight. The air quality was excellent although the seats were not particularly comfortable. I did ask for blankets to make my own lumbar support and this help a lot. Despite this I felt more refreshed after 24+ hours travelling than I have done travelling only 3 hours in Europe. I am only 5'9"" but I was able to stretch my legs out under the seat in front (without intruding on the person in front so this is a plus). The cabin crew were polite and non-intrusive (which is a good thing in my book since often I like to sleep without announcements etc) but they were also good fun - I had a chat with them in the galley and had a little Malay lesson. The food was hit and miss and probably had more to do with on the ground caterers in different counties. On the LHR to Dubai section the food was good. Dubai to Bandar it was very poor. Bandar to Melbourne was an excellent curry that was flavourful and not greasy.

Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less.

It markets itself as a low cost no frills airline. It was certainly no frills but definitely not low cost. We flew the week before September school holidays and the airfares were very expensive. Overall I would describe the experience as mediocre. We were in economy and walking through business class I would not pay the extra for what looked like a sub par business class offering. The seats were okay but what you would expect on a domestic flight not a long haul international flight. It was a night flight so people were wanting to try and sleep. In the row behind us were four off duty Qantas flight attendants who proceeded to drink to excess talk extremely loudly and swear constantly disturbing other passengers for at least four hours. The flight attendants on our flight took about 5 hours to finally tell them to quieten down. I was astounded that they thought it was okay to disturb other passengers for hours on end. Appalling behaviour that should have been pulled up sooner. Inflight entertainment is non existent on back of seats which is ridiculous. You can rent Ipads for $18 which were woeful. The limited range of movies seemed to be geared towards the male audience. Even the lifestyle section was a selection of cars and music shows. They really need to take a good look at this very limited and poor offering. We heard many fellow passengers complaining about the Ipad content also. Food was either pre booked and very expensive meals or snacks you could buy on board. Take your own food on board would be my advice.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,A Brown,Australia,2014-10-01,"I found four things seriously wrong with Qantas First Class. 1) The ""Chauffeur Drive"" service. Arriving in Sydney at 6.30am having booked a car I was surprised to be told (after finally locating the tiny unmarked desk) that there was a 15-20 minute wait until a car was available. Why? How? A car was booked. It should have been there end of story. Also in the car before my the previous flight (Sydney-London) I was delighted to receive an expletive-laden tirade across the driver's radio - apparently from one of his colleagues having a bad day. That is not ""first class"". 2) Baggage. Qantas advertises that First Class bags will be ""among the first"" to be delivered off the plane. On arrival in Sydney mine were among the last (both turning up on the carousel a full 50 minutes after landing; I do not remember the timing in London). 3) The breakfast. Scrambled eggs were dry.

However, we were pleasantly surprised! Our outbound flight left about 15 minutes late, but no big deal. The aircraft was clean and appeared new. The staff were helpful and friendly. As far as seat comfort goes, I found the seats to be typical of most airlines. There were family friendly in-flight movies but the headsets cost $4 each. Our return flight actually left a few minutes early and arrived back home 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Again, the staff were very helpful and friendly. Sodas, juices, water, coffee/tea, and wine were served at no charge. Beer and mixed drinks were offered for an additional charge. Snacks were offered at an additional charge. They also served a hot bistro pastry at no charge that was only so-so but hey, this is airline food not a 4 star restaurant. We did not choose the elite service but they do board elite passengers first, from a separate line and they are seated first at the front the aircraft. Would I fly Sunwing again?

Unless I have got a lot bigger the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and designed so that when the person in front reclines you have hardly any room. The food was average too. Then I had only one hour to change at Doha and had to literally run to get my connecting flight to Dubai as the airport is quite big. Exhausting. On the way back the check in lady at Dubai told me the flight was quiet (it wasn't) and again the seats were really cramped so much so my leg ached.

With RBA business you get a fast pass for immigration and security scanning which makes it much faster. RBA uses the Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne which is small but feels large the food coffee and drink selection is pretty good for a small lounge but the quality is very high. Onboard the plane the service was fast when I got onboard the flight crew was fast to come up to me with a drink (non-alcoholic as RBA is a dry airline) and welcome me by name. The RBA Boeing 787 is an amazing aircraft you really notice the larger windows and the way they tint is amazing. The business class seats on RBA are excellent fully recline large seat and a large touch screen TV. The only down fall of the flight was the main meal it was over cooked beef that was reheated like always on planes but the company who cooks it didn't look like they tested it very well in the air.

Iberia had me travel 12hrs at night with my baby in my arms even though I had booked a bassinet 3 months ahead. According to the staff this was due to a change of equipment. They did not warn me at anytime before embarking. They did not offer anything (not even an extra pillow) and made no effort to improve our comfort under the excuse that the flight was overbooked. When I suggested they disembark me and reschedule me on a flight in which I could have a bassinet they made no effort to check on which flight I could actually travel and threatened me to call authorities if I did not make my mind immediately despite their inability to provide basic information.

We had read all of the bad reviews but decided to take our chances and try it because the price (even with all the add ons) was cheaper than other airlines and it was a non-stop flight. If you do your homework and educate yourself on all of their add on costs there shouldn't be any surprises. The only thing I hadn't read about was their weight limit. It's 40 lbs. per checked bag or 80 lbs. total for 2 bags for Spirit and 50 lbs. per bag for other airlines. We each checked a suitcase and a set of golf clubs and the combined weight of the 2 bags for each of us was a little over 80 lbs. but they allowed a little wiggle room and didn't charge us extra which we appreciated. The flights were on time and the planes were clean. We opted to pay $25 each way for exit row seats so we had plenty of legroom but I did notice that the regular seats were quite close with little legroom. My only complaint was that the seats didn't have much padding and didn't recline. I would have no reason based on my first experience not to fly with this airline again. My advice to those contemplating flying Spirit would be to read and understand all of their policies then there won't be any surprises.,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,1,5,1,1,NA,NA,4,1

As part of the booking I paid for the ability to book our seats. Once I had the booking reference I went onto flythomascook website to book the seats. However it would not let me do it without charging me extra. I therefore had to ring the customer services line to sort it out. The boarding arrangements at Manchester Airport were chaotic to say the least. The boarding gate was next to the Emirates A380 and both flights were boarding at the same time with the inevitable crush. When it came to time to board the announcement for boarding by row number was not heard by 95% of the passengers resulting in everyone going to the gate. In fact the announcement was for the back few rows but no-one could hear it. A number of people were therefore refused boarding because it was not their row but others outside the announced rows were allowed on. None of the announcements could be heard by those waiting for the flight. I have never been on a more cramped flight (both outbound and inbound). Leg room was impossible. Food on both flights was disgraceful easily the worst in-flight food I have ever tasted. I am not sure how James Martin would react to having his name used for such poor food. As a diabetic I order diabetic meals for myself for both flights. On the return flight my meal tray was 75% white rice a little bit of beef and three small green beans.

Using the smart price ""class"" (level) my wife and myself had comfortable seats and legroom for this trip of 1h10min. The snack box offered and its contents are just poor the only reason for paying the surcharge called ""smart price"" is preselected seating and one piece of checked in luggage. The general quality of service is acceptable - friendly crew efficient service clean planes plus the feeling of safety/security you buy in a plane of the Lufthansa group.

Breakfast of very good quality. Very friendly flight attendants on all flight but especially impressed by crew from HKG to HEL. After waking up approx 5 hours out of HKG for a brief toilet visit flight attendant immediately asked I would like dinner or some sandwiches as I had missed my dinner. Only negative aspect would be the business class seating on the European segments on the E190. Same seat and pitch as in economy and as I was seated in row 1 a very unstable tray table.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,H Monk,United Kingdom,2014-09-14,I flew Manchester to Sanford with Thomson on TOM144 outbound (August 23rd) and TOM155 inbound (September 6th). Both flights were on the Dreamliner. We were impressed from the outset. Bag drop and security were quick and efficient and the flight boarded on time and took off on time. We were pleasantly surprised when the captain announced that the flight would take only 8 hours! The crew were fantastic the flight smooth and hardly any turbulence other than having the seatbelt signs on for ten minutes just prior to entering the Florida area due to some clear-air turbulence though it was something and nothing. The inflight entertainment kept me my hubby and two daughters aged 10 and 12 occupied throughout without any boredom and the flight passed by quickly. On the return flight we again took off on time from a small and basic Sanford and the flight time was 7.5 hours. Again very smooth flight and efficient crew (except for one rather cheeky announcement from the head stewardess about adults not setting an example to their kids by standing when the seatbelt signs were still illuminated after landing) She had a fair point but made in in rather the wrong way! The only real problem was unavoidable we had to make a go around on landing (on time) at Manchester due to low mist on the runway which the captain kept us well informed about which resulted in sitting on the tarmac for fifteen minutes as by the time another plane was in our gate but this was a minor hitch rather a go around than a dangerous landing!

When I checked in for my Option Plus booking I was informed that they couldn't find my booking. After consulting with a supervisor they found my booking and then casually informed me that the flight was 9 hours delayed. The ground crew were incredibly unsympathetic (I was travelling for urgent business reasons) and couldn't be bothered to stop taking phone calls and chatting despite having a distraught passenger right in front of them.

Nice seats but there is not enough legroom (I am 1.90m tall). Nice food (dinner breakfast snack) good drink selection (many alcoholic drink are not free of charge in eco class). Nice crew. Considering that is Condor low cost carrier (I paid a Zagreb-Lima ticket 404€) I shouldnt complain so much about poor legroom a little bit disabled entertainment programme (you have to pay to watch movies) etc. I dont like that when you buy a ticket they put extra cost for paying with a credit card they should involve that cost in the price of ticket. Also I think that the stop in S.Domingo should be no longer then 1.30h. Staying in the middle of the night on almost empty airport is so boring.

They never informed me of it at all (later I found out it was because I had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent. People who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently). So I phoned their representatives (who were still active in London). The agent who took my call was very helpful though - she rescheduled my flight without issues with BA via Frankfurt. She had also assured me that I could check my bags straight through from Heathrow to Windhoek. Of course this ended up not being the case. The lady at the BA counter at Heathrow knew of no such cooperation with Air Namibia. She said I had to re-check the bags in at Frankfurt. I didn't mind though. Otherwise my flights were on time and I got to Windhoek without any other hassle. The return journey was flawless - bags checked through all the way to Heathrow from Windhoek via Frankfurt.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,R Jones,United Kingdom,2013-10-22,Flew back to London Luton from Dalaman in Turkey. The problem was not with the flight itself but the way Thomson uses Dalaman airport. They land about 9 aircraft within minutes of each other and they all (attempt!) to take off again within minutes of each other and the Airport simply cannot cope. The problem arises with the aircraft using remote parking spots on the airport apron. Passengers for these are shunted off into the suffocating basement of the terminal where there are about six gates with nowhere near enough room to accommodate passengers. So you get families with young children sitting on the floor and being treated like cattle. It's human nature - certainly amongst the British - to start forming queues which bear no relationship to the order in which the flights depart. One gate was being used for two different flights. There were no announcements from the departure gate staff even though some flights were delayed without any reference to it on the screens. Such confusion can lead to panic and stress situations - what a way to treat your customers! When we eventually got in a bus - the driver had no idea which aircraft he was supposed to decant us to - he had a choice of nine! When we eventually departed an hour late and after such a stressful boarding process there was not a hint of an apology from the Captain. Mind you he couldn't even remember the name of his Cabin Supervisor. All in all - pretty shambolic.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,4,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

At first it was announced that the flight was delayed due to TSA requirements. Then it was announced the delay was due to scheduling problems. Boarding commenced shortly after the missing flight attendant arrived. The economy cabin was very cramped. The seat was simply uncomfortable even for a 5 hour flight. The seat was hard and narrow with poor leg room. The IFE system had a decent variety but required a fee (so make sure you have your credit card on hand) though on a full service airline this should be complimentary. Refreshments were served. Breakfast was served shortly after but consisted of a disgusting breakfast burrito and sugary bun with no other options. No complimentary refreshments were available for the remaining 3.5 hours of the flight. The flight attendants were well mannered but unprofessional.

Staff generally friendly and professional and planes are clean. At JFK no separate check in for Premium and I had to drag my bag over to a bag-drop area after check in. At the gate they had priority boarding for children and Premium albeit a bit disorganized. Older A340 which they have wet-leased from HiFly out of Portugal (original interior of old Emirates). There was a small first class section and a large business class section. After take off I was allowed to move up to an empty first class seat which was lay-flat but not all that comfortable. Business class seats are comfortable very padded and with a good recline and foot rest but there is no lay-flat or even close. Inflight entertainment system is disengaged so do not expect anything. The food thrown at you is deplorable. Actually worse than what you get in economy on long- haul! Return today from Oslo not so good. Of course no Premium check in and here not even priority boarding. The leg rest of my seat wasn't working and it turns out Norwegian had known about it for a long time. Food again the same. After they throw that food package in front of you and clearly states that you only get one alcoholic drink you don't see them again before a basic coffee service.

I had a good window seat with direct aisle access and fortunately the cabin was not particularly busy so the toilet did not cause any disturbance. I find the seat very comfortable for eating lounging and sleeping although a mattress topper would make sleeping even more comfortable. The half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your phone charging but of course this has to become the table when a meal service starts so it is a shame there isn't a separate table. The inflight entertainment is excellent I do not understand any criticism of this as the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of films and TV. The catering however continues to be poor with BA. While the menu sounds great and dishes generally look good they often fall down when you actually eat them. As this was an overnight flight the meals were designed lighter and the champagne and canapés starter sounded perfect they were however 3 limp tasteless bite sized things. This to me is BA's weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering in order to compete with other airlines.

Needed to take essential medical equipment (CPAP) - medical advice is to carry as hand luggage although not needed during flight. (Can't risk it being broken delayed or lost). Never had a problem with any airline taking this in the cabin as well as usual hand luggage previously - including the well known budget airlines. However Jet2 say that this bag has to be included in the hand luggage allowance and they say squash the medical equipment in a hand luggage bag or pay for a hold bag to put your usual hand luggage allowance in. I really would prefer not to have the need for this equipment in the first place but I think it is quite appalling that Jet2 's stance serves to increase the cost of a flight through this. It is very unlikely I will use Jet2 again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,0

The worst part was the attitude of the ground staff which was very rude and discourteous. Whenever they were requested for any information about the reasons of delaying they will not give any proper answer and instead of showing any empathy towards passengers  they were rude and showing attitude. One lady among the ground staff even started passing nasty remarks and made fun of the waiting passengers.

Flight from GOT-LHR was alright even though the flatbread they served was inedible. Transferred through T5 quick and easy. Must say that Heathrow gets better and better for every time you visit! The long haul flight on BA's A380 was excellent. I was sat on the upper deck which is a huge privilege since the seats are 2-4-2 also I was sat in a window seat which made it all even better since they've installed lockers next to the seats where you can put your stuff. The staff was excellent (and also very good looking) and the food was better than I could've imagined for an economy route.

None the less it was a night flight so I just went to sleep. Now on the return flight is where it went all downhill. I arrived at the airport an hour and a half before the flight 30 minutes before takeoff they announce it is cancelled due to crew and they had no other flights to put me on. Their only offer was to reschedule my flight for the next flight out at 6am or get a refund. I asked for the refund so that I could book a flight on Jetblue.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2015-07-27,"LGW-CUN-LGW. Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.",Boeing 747-400,FamilyLeisure,Economy,LGW to CUN,7,4,5,3,3,4,NA,4,1

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Venning Andrew,Australia,2015-01-11,Very similar review to a recent Australian traveller. Flew MEL-LGW via SGN. A330 on first leg to Ho Chi Minh City. Had breakfast in the Qantas business lounge in Melbourne prior to departure. That was nothing to write home about but better much better than waiting in the terminal. Boarded and departed on time. Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Hostesses were smiley polite and attentive. Lunch was served soon after takeoff and was enjoyable. Wines/spirits were topped up regularly. Arrived on time at Ho Chi Minh City for an eight hour layover (too long). Because we were travelling in business we were met at the transfer desk had a one day visa organised and were then taken on a tour of the city in a nice car (air-conditioned thankfully as it was so humid there). What an eye- opener that that journey was! There are 10000000 scooters in Ho Chi Minh City and we saw most of them on that 10 km journey. It was organised chaos. We enjoyed a free dinner in the Catina Hotel which was very nice and we were then taken on a walking tour to see the highlights of the city. We were then put in a car and returned to the airport where we were met by the same tour company representative who had our visa papers stamped (unbelievable bureaucracy in Vietnam) and we spent a couple of hours in Vietnam Airlines lounge. We were not hungry but enjoyed the whisky and soft drinks. The flight to London Gatwick left SGN a half hour late due to the late arrival of the incoming flight. This flight was on an older Boeing 777. We were dog-tired by then and fell asleep very soon after takeoff. We were served an adequate breakfast an hour or so before landing at Gatwick. The IFE doesn't work so they hand out Ipads but we slept. The seats were comfortable with plenty of legroom. Summary: At over half the price of the likes of Singapore Qantas Emirates etc. Vietnam Airlines represents very good value. My only negative is that the connections at SGN were too long despite being given the free city tour hotel meal a sleep in a hotel room on the return journey etc. Would go with them every time at the price I paid.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants.

The food was the best I have had on an airline. All flight attendants were cheerful and courteous. The only complaint is that at Dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm. I do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time. I say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs!

No light no music no monitor not even the attendant call button. I was told they could somehow reboot the system associated with my seat shortly after takeoff. After a couple attempts to reboot and two hours trying to get the crew's focus on the matter I was finally told that they would not be able to get the electronics of my seat working. They offered me magazines which is completely useless considering they dim the cabin lights and I had no light of my own which worked. So I got to sit in the dark and 11 hours of flight going out of my mind with boredom. What makes it worse is knowing that this airline would not have known that my electrionoc were not functioning properly before the flight boarded. Not only did it limit me on my ability to view the safety video before the flight started but it also brings into question why the systems did not work in the first place.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2015-05-11,A day before my return to LHR from BKK I received an email from Qatar offering me a good deal for an upgrade to Business Class which I took up. They were meant to start check-in process at BKK airport at 5 pm but did not do so till 5.20. Check in staff was excellent and efficient. I was offered a drink after boarding but not a hot or cold towel. The person next to me was offered both. I opted for a middle seat in order to have aisle access; configuration of 777 is 2-2-2. The seats are indeed very comfortable but there is not much privacy. I was rather disappointed again with the food. I was expecting a lot more. It was all nicely presented and the FAs do go out of their way to make one's journey enjoyable but I do not think the food was as good as people claim and I have had much better food on Cathay and BA in Business. The food from Doha to LHR was even less interesting. And on this leg on an A340-600 the seat was much smaller and with even less privacy. The person next to me almost damaged my glasses which I had put on the little shared area between the seats. The business lounge at Doha is superb but again the food was a let down. My option salmon was not available from the a la carte menu. I had a lamb which was hard and very salty. The buffet stuff looked like something from my local Waitrose and was simple. The snack area was far more interesting. They prepare whatever you want. Lovely. There are many areas in the lounge including a large business room next to which there is an area hardly anyone uses. The so-called 'quiet area' was anything but quiet: people snoring breaking winds pulling trolleys talking etc. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and in no way one can have a good nap there. I do not understand why they cannot put stuff like in the BA's cabanas at T5 with blankets.

My partner and I booked a package with Virgin holidays to New York from London Heathrow. We booked with Virgin specifically because of the reputation and quality assurance it gave us and didn't mind paying the extra for that added security. Having just returned I can say that while I am thankful we arrived safely each way the experience was nothing special and was actually comparable to a budget airline. Leg room is not great and we both had problems with our entertainment systems on each flight. Food was ok at best on the way out but was terrible on the return (and my expectations of the food were by no means high). The organisation of the return flight was a sham people being moved into other people's seats which caused a domino effect of problems with one young single traveller being asked to move three times to accommodate others. The most disappointing part for me was the poor attitude of the staff particularly on the return leg. A simple request for a soft drink left me feeling that I had very much caused an inconvenience and left me feeling reluctant to make any further requests. Our experience has been poor and regretfully I will not choose to fly with Virgin again. Our best experience for long haul flights to date has been with New Zealand Airways (London to LA).

My past experience has been satisfactory the steward aboard our Nice to Dubai flight on 20 SEP made sure we knew the aircraft features and helped with our carry-on bag at the bottom of the stairs on our arrival in Dubai. The state of the Business washroom on 22 SEP was unsatisfactory. I followed a staff member who had just used the washroom and found the litter container full and overflowing toilet paper on the floor and the toilet bowl very dirty.

Travelling with an infant on this route is difficult but Asiana made it much easier with attentive service good food for the baby bassinets and good food for us. IFE excellent with programming on demand. First time going to TAS that we did not have to use a bus to get to the terminal. We had to gate check our stroller but at the Tashkent airport you need to pick it up at the baggage claim so we had to carry our baby until then which if you are familiar with the speed (or lack thereof) of the customs officials at TAS you know that it is not a small feat. The return was nice in business but even though we gate checked the stroller at TAS and told them we needed it at ICN they sent it through to the baggage claim. Luckily the ICN staff were wonderful and retrieved it for us quickly. Return was in the new Quadra business lie-flat seats which were comfortable for us but I can see how they might be too narrow for people with a larger build. Also strangely enough the business class bassinets are more narrow compared to the economy class ones. Nice amenity kit with L'Occitane products excellent food and service.

Flight Attendants spoke perfect English and were nice and helpful. I slept for 3 hours woke up just in time for breakfast. We were late because of the whole air conditioner incident and almost missed our connection to Rome. The plane was an A321. Flight was uneventful and was not particularly good or bad.

Flew the A300-200 from Doha to Manchester (UK) business class and this plane is really showing its age now. Seats are not that comfortable for a 7 hr flight and again the food was only just adequate.

A smooth flight operated by 737-800NG with comfortable seats nice and smiling crew members and on time departure and arrival. Price was 50% lower than SQ and this is why I chose Garuda. On the minus side: they ran out of chicken when they got to my row so I did not have lunch (I cannot eat seafood): the hostess was very apologetic and try to get me something else even though at the end it was not possible but I did not starve during a 1.5 hr trip. In Jakarta the plane was parked at a remote stand forcing us to have a rather long bus ride. On the plus side: check-in at Changi was a breeze as was going through immigration and customs in Soekarno-Hatta and seat pitch and softness is above average for economy. I have to mention that I had troubles when trying to buy the ticket in their website as the page got frozen when processing the payment: and after trying several times I had to give up and purchase it through an agency at a higher price.

Service was professional friendly and somewhat quick to the point of being a little hurried. The NZ wines and meal was excellent. The seat is great especially when I managed to get a 60 min nap in prior to landing. You can't beat the privacy but it comes at a cost of being social when traveling with a partner.

The lunch was good on the way out and felt like good value for money compared to Zurich Airport but the breakfast on the return was not so good (powdered instant coffee) and was expensive and of a lower quality compared to Riga Airport. Ordering in advance gives you a much larger selection but isn't really cheaper as far as I could see. On-time on the way out 25 mins late on the way in due to bad weather in ZRH but I didn't feel this was really explained. Nice staff.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,Phil Tucker,United Kingdom,2015-06-16,"What a mixed bag. I had been so keen to fly on the Dreamliner and actually tweaked our plans to go out and back from LA on this plane. Due to money constraints, this is our first economy flight as a family. Many years ago I flew with Virgin on business to Vegas in economy and vowed never again. The flight out was fine. It is a really good aircraft. Seems generally, really spacious. Plenty of room in the overhead lockers. We fluked bulkhead seats going out and these were good with decent leg room. The seat is a new design and very slim. Quite hard though for 11 hours. Due to not having a table on the seat in front the table folded out from the armrest along with the TV. This meant the seats were really, really narrow. I am a normal sized bloke and this seat was narrower than on any two or three hour hop in Europe with budget airlines. There was a small amount of recline and this did help comfort a little. The food was as you expect it to be. Edible calories. The service was reasonable although very noticeabley different than in premium cabins. Very rushed. The flight home was terrible. I had paid for extra legroom seats and found myself next to the toilets getting stood on and kicked pretty much all night. Virgin should not under any circumstances sell these seats as some kind of benefit. If anything they should give them to people they don't want to fly with them again. The plane itself had lovely big windows which helped the general atmosphere and we did really feel a bit better due to the improved air / humidity etc. Due to the cabin being a 3+3+3 the aisles were really tight. Passing through the PE cabin I was also quite surprised at how cramped the seats looked. All in all, I would not be keen to do this again. If this is the future of flying then I am afraid that we shall be flying less long haul. We are going to Australia next year and there is no way in the world that I will be flying Virgin for this. I think it is time to change my allegiances and to try other airlines for long haul.",B787-900 Dreamliner,FamilyLeisure,Economy,LAX to LHR,5,2,2,2,4,3,NA,3,0
etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,C Sridhara,United States,2015-05-18,San Francisco (SFO) to Bangalore (BLR) via Abu Dhabi (AUH). Price was reasonably low. Etihad maintained regular communication about my travel and allowed me to upgrade to Business class. I skipped that offer and decided to travel in economy class. The day before travel I did online check-in and printed my boarding pass. On the day of travel all I had to do was to drop my bags. I thought it was a simple process of dropping them off. No Etihad agent checks the cabin bag for its size and weight and it can not exceed even 1/2 pound. There was no delay in the flight. There was a 10 minute delay. However passengers were greeted by crew members and they helped me to place the cabin luggage. They were cordial and helpful. We were given a hot towel upon arrival as well as the meal menu card. Crew were very cordial and willing to help. After serving the food they ensured the blinds were closed and there was no service for next couple of hours unless called by passengers. There were some empty seats and I was quick to use them up. I was surprised when the crew handed over my special meals to my changed seat. Flight arrived at Abu Dhabi an hour earlier than scheduled and hence we got an extra hour to browse through airport shops. My next flight was in 2.5 hours. What I noticed is that no compliance to ADA rules for Seniors and others who requires wheelchair access to rest rooms or showers. Passengers have to climb three steps to use the rest rooms. The rest rooms at the airport were not clean. Maybe that's the standard AUH airport maintains. I boarded my next flight to Bangalore (BLR) and it was a smooth ride with a different set of crew and services of crew was excellent.

FlyNas is the low cost carrier of Saudi Arabia and recently added intercontinental services and enhanced cabins to its range of domestic and regional routes. I flew from London Gatwick to Jeddah with a connecting flight to Riyadh. The aircraft had been full on arrival at London but the passenger load was very light returning to Jeddah. As a result the level of service was terrific with a high ratio of crew to customers on board a very clean and smart A330-200. Business passengers can use Fast Track at Gatwick and have access to the Aspire Lounge. The seats are angled lie flat and very comfortable for a six hour sector with large pillows provided. The on board entertainment was supplemented by iPads with new release movies pre-loaded. Fares on FlyNas are lower than the full service flag carriers when booked well in advance and this was reflected in the meals which were average served in economy size foil trays with none of the fuss or flourishes of the five star Gulf airlines. This was fine for the price paid. Saudi carriers do not serve alcohol but there was a good range of soft drinks. An afternoon tea was also served not long before landing. The Saudi experience apart from the customary reading and blessing at the beginning of the flight did not really begin until King Abdulaziz Airport because the aircraft and entire crew is Portuguese hired from HiFly. They worked very effectively in both English and Arabic and were hard-working and friendly. The connecting FlyNas flight to Riyadh was a very typical low-cost service on board an A321 fairly tight for space full to the brim with purchases available from the trolley. Seating is allocated and there is the option to buy extra leg room or a larger seat at the front of the cabin but flights between the main cities in Saudi Arabia are not longer than a couple of hours so a standard seat was fine.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
bmi-british-midland-international,/airline-reviews/bmi-british-midland-international,bmi British Midland Airways customer review,O Bello,United Kingdom,2011-07-29,London to Freetown. I have made it to diamond club gold status as I have started flying more frequently on this route. In the past 6 months I have noticed lots of positive changes mainly due to many complaints from the regulars on this route. Check-in was very busy but the supervisor apologised and opened an extra desk and checked me in. He offered to upgrade me as the flight was oversold. The lounge was very busy and I only had time to grab a quick bite to eat but was disappointed that there was no champagne. The aircraft cabin had a new smell to it and was bright and spotless and had smart brown leather seats. The crew were attentive and made conversation with people in business class. The food was in small portions but tasty. Overall a very pleasant flight and hope my return trip in economy isn't too painful after being spoilt in business class on this trip.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Flight took off late by the time meals were served there were no options left however later they brought us a meal not sure how and why that was not available earlier. Inflight entertainment was not working. Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong flight was ok. Return to Melbourne from Hong Kong via Ho Chi Minh we were the third to check-in. When I asked if our seats were together we were just brushed away. We boarded only to find out we had the very last seats facing the toilets. After take-off everyone's meals are served and we are the last once again. The senior flight attendant apologised and got us business class meals. Our final leg was Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. Boarded to realise my husband and myself were separated for the trip. The young man sitting next to my husband offered to swap with me.

The SYD- AUH leg being 2/3rds of the flight was definitely worth the extra money - particularly the extra backrest angle and legroom was a huge improvement over standard economy.

A real shock to go back to standard economy which is very standard with Etihad their service is rubbish food a joke entertainment system poor - it really was like going back 10 years.

On the morning of 22nd February we boarded the flight in Dubai at the correct time despite their being some fog in which cleared by approximately 10.30am. We were held on the plane for over 7.5 hours and then had our flight cancelled and were disembarked. Told that once we left the plane an Emirates attendant would be waiting to show us where to go. After we left the plane we went through the airport doors to be offered two options 'arrivals' or 'transfers' and no-one had any idea where to go and no help was available. We saw a few Emirates staff around and when we went to them asking for assistance they just shrugged their shoulders and said we had to queue up at the desk. We queued for 2 hours and when we finally got to the front we were told that no information was available and that we had to come back in 20 minutes! We asked about hotel accommodation and was told that all hotels were booked. The lack of communication was terrible no announcements made no apologies. Finally after an exhaustive night and at about 4am Sunday we were told that everyone would not be able to fly until Monday. This debacle carried on until about 5.30am when we were told that we were going to fly after all at 11am Sunday. The journey took approximately 42 hours which should have been a four hour flight.

Air Algerie need to improve if their star rating and credibility with other operators is to be upped. My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,J Teoh,Australia,2014-11-20,SYD-LHR-SYD in Business Class. SYD-KUL-SYD on A330-300 and KUL-LHR-KUL on A380. All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the A330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the A380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. MAS now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their A330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for MAS would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money. I would not hesitate to fly with them.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Our flight was delayed 7 hours until 1:15 am because the airline did not have staff to fly the plane. That is not acceptable. I have 3 children under 7 so it was quite miserable to sit there 7 hours well into the night with them and then finally get to our destination at 3:30 am and then have to pick up a rental car. I think what made me the most mad was when Spirit still charged for snacks after we waited 7 hours for them.

Fast track security was very nice lounge was OK with lots of available seats and a decent selection of drinks and snacks. Boarding was a little chaotic because of the attitude of the passengers that didn't respected the boarding sequence. The cabin was in good condition and clean and FAs were friendly and attentive inflight service was not generous but enough for a short flight it is advisable to eat at the lounge given that you only get a tiny sandwich with some cheese onboard.

At first it looked like there was adequate space in seat but then seat in front of me was fully reclined for 9 hours squashing me into my seat unable to use tray table or watch the IFE.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Patrick Bellot,United States,2014-04-16,Orange County-SFO Round Trip - April 2014. Be aware: paying extra for an Economy Plus gives you the privilege to board last (group 5). On a full plane it means that the overhead bins will be full when you embark and you will be deny boarding with your carry-ons. They will be checked at the gate of the aircraft. It happened to us on both legs of this trip even though our carry-ons were undersized and we had only one per person other than my wife's purse and my computer shoulder bag. But for our surcharge we had a free half glass of water served by stern attendants. What a bargain! Too bad Virgin America no longer flies out of SNA. I really miss them.

Is anyone responsible for checking it during the flight? I have very low expectations of food on airplanes but these meals were worst I've ever had. What really has made me decide to never fly Lufthansa again is this: I paid extra to reserve seats in the first row of economy which has a partition in front of you instead of a row of seats and more leg room. When we checked in for our return flight we were told those seats were not available. I was told by customer service that paying extra to reserve a seat gives you no guarantee or rights to those seats and my request for a refund was denied.

This service has impressed me a lot as Garuda Indonesia has been committed to constantly give better service for their passengers even in this special occasion. Cabin crew are also very friendly and smiley they always give the nice greetings and service for all passengers. The only con I had might be the check-in system on CGK as the system migration has not been fully adopted the check-in was late and the ground staff were not really standby during the process.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,Russell Ng,Malaysia,2015-03-20,I am a frequent customer of MAS. I have noticed that there are some improvements and also down falls. Their improvement is that they changed all their aircraft to new ones. The down falls are that the new seats are really tight (especially on the 737) Food portion decreased tremendously (even on the A380 routes) in-flight entertainment was fine but compared with other airlines its considered less and their hard products aren't really much to be impressed about. Their cabin crew are friendly but they can definitely do better. But the price is really good so i have no complaints about that.

They came round twice each with drinks and food in the course of a thirteen hour flight. The food was right on the line as regards quality and quantity with very limited choice. The seat seemed to be the minimum size and was quite hard. The second-worst seat I have experienced as regards comfort.

Not enough leg space and the head support wings were not adjustable vertically which meant anyone shorter than 5 feet 8 inches could not use them.

On top of which I could pay only by credit card for a drink. Considering I was a Indian tourist the likelihood of me doing this was very low.

In London we were already told there would be a 1 hour delay and that the Cabin Crew would advise on the connection. Just before landing we enquired again and were told to seek ground crew in the airport for advice at the transfer desk. The transfer desk issued us with a voucher to make calls to sort out our problems ourselves. The voucher was insufficient and the desk operator kept cutting us off. There were no announcements for passengers about connecting flights there was no explanation for the delay nor an apology. Basically no one cares.

Catering pluses are the fresh orange juice and warm meal which most other airlines now forgo can't speak about the inflight entertainment because I never use it.

This is the only Star Alliance airline where this happens to me I've checked with colleagues and they all have the same problem especially on code-share tickets.

Couldn't do advance check in on this route meaning we had to queue for half an hour. We booked the seat allocation meal and baggage bundle and this was honoured. I was annoyed about the way that Thomas Cook try to charge for everything on long haul I don't think it's too much to expect checked baggage included and a meal. They only give 5 kg hand baggage. Moreover the checked baggage is pretty expensive given that they only give you 20 kg. Onboard it was sad to see how tatty it was. The leather on the seats is cracked ripped and generally worn. My seat had a metal bar just under the foam that was really uncomfortable. Leg room was pretty good and I'm 6ft and this is about the most positive thing I can say about the interior. Meals were small and of average quality certainly not worth the cost. Free drinks given with the meal only. Tea or coffee or juice. If you want water the cabin crew have to go back to the galley to get it. The crew were good though it was a shame that they spent so long on the tannoy system trying to sell things like drinks duty free head phones comfort packs bingo cards etc. Not much peace to be had in the first 3 hours of the flight. Entertainment was good given the quality of the airline. Not on demand but 8 channels of films dramas documentaries kids TV etc. On the way out we could look through cameras in the front and bottom of the plane during take off and landing. Not available on the way back.

alitalia,/airline-reviews/alitalia,Alitalia customer review,J Manning,Canada,2014-10-20,October 10th from Rome to Toronto. We did not choose to fly this airline as we had bought tickets from British Airways however due to flight delays British Airways arranged for us to fly on Alitalia for the first leg of our trip. We were told incorrect information regarding seat availability and flight details from the Alitalia representative upon check-in and boarding the plane was a largely unorganized process which took well over one hour to complete. The plane was older (tube televisions down the center of the plane instead of seat-back screens) the cleanliness of the seats was sub-par and the sink in the toilet was clogged for the duration of the trip. For the first half of the flight the service on board was mediocre but acceptable however once dinner was served the service became non-existent. For 4 to 5 hours (on a 9 hour flight) the flight attendants hung out at the back of the plane and were deliberately ignoring the call button. If any passengers wanted a drink they were required to walk to the back of the plane and pour it themselves all while the flight attendants sat around talking and completely ignoring anything outside of their conversation. This expectation of self service is very inconvenient when someone with anything but an aisle seat would like a glass of water. I also wondered what passengers who require mobility assistance do in this situation? Flight attendants ignoring their passengers for half of an international flight is completely unacceptable. I will not be flying Alitalia in future.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,1,3,1,2,3,NA,NA,1,0
air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,Dela Santa Corazon,United States,2014-09-01,Our Air Canada flight to Barcelona August 8 and our return from Madrid August 21 were saddled with cancellations delays and very poor customer service. As the 8.50 flight was getting closer to departure time on the night of August 8 passengers were first told that the aircraft had not arrived while the crew had come in. Then we were told that there was no part and it was best to wait and be safe than sorry. By 10.30 additional staff came in and said that the part had arrived. After an hour of waiting close to midnight we learned there was no crew to fly and the flight was cancelled. The station manager came in with security and more staff. The manager said that all hotels in downtown Montreal were full booked thus no hotel for us. He however guaranteed that we would be flying the next day to Barcelona and that we could retrieve our luggage and AC staff will make sure that we are comfortable. There was not a single staff member around after customs so passengers who decided to sleep in the airport went around looking for benches and chairs to sleep on. Vouchers of course were handed over but in the beginning my sister and I were told of the following: no food will be served on the flight but would be available for purchase no re-routing to catch our tour and AC was not responsible if we missed our tour. All these actions on the part of Air Canada were well orchestrated and any questions from passengers was met with Security ready to handle any raising of voices. Our Air Canada saga however did not end in Barcelona. On the way back August 21 from Madrid again the 1.30 pm flight was moved to 3.00 pm. It was not difficult to figure out again the cause for delay. As more fresh looking passengers came in to join the 3 pm flight it was clear the delay was done to combine the 1 pm and 3 pm passengers. The delay caused us to miss the connecting flight in Toronto for Montreal our final destination. When we asked Air Canada customer service if we could take an earlier flight to Montreal we were told that our luggage had been checked in for the 10.30 flight to Montreal. We could not say anything to customer service only to find out that our luggage did not arrive in Montreal in spite of the nearly 3 hour window to load our luggage. As someone enticed to fly Air Canada's direct flight to Barcelona from Montreal this airline gave its passengers a sing song routine when all passengers like me wanted to know what is really happening with our flights. Air Canada should never forget that we paid the fare they asked for be it from a travel agent or online.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,3,3,2,NA,NA,1,0

airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,T Saldanha,Australia,2011-07-15,I cannot recommend this airline highly enough. It sets a new standard for budget airlines. I normally fly Melb-KL KL-Mum & back about twice a year and I find their service extremely consistent. The one trip that to me exemplified their high level of customer service is a trip I took between KL & Chiang Mai. I arrived for an afternoon flight to be told they had rescheduled the flight to the morning and had sent me an email notification (which I hadn't seen as i was travelling). I fully expected to be delayed to the next day. However customer service after a 20 min wait told me they could route me via Bangkok however the time gap in switching over to the domestic flight in Bangkok was only 1hr which was a concern. On the aircraft i briefed the air hostess who told me the captain had radioed ahead. On disembarking the same hostess told me they had located my baggage which was at the entrance to the bus to the terminal. The staff at the entrance to the bus told me a security guy would pick me up at the terminal & walk me through customs & security. The guy picked me up walked me through and checked me into the domestic terminal - all this was accomplished in the span of 45 mins. I have never been so impressed with an airline budget or otherwise. This level of customer service is unheard of.,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

I managed to get the emergency exit which made the flight quite comfortable. Happy to get a warm meal not used to that for a similar flight in Europe anymore. Cabin crew just did their job no smiles. I was shocked at the lack of safety checks both at takeoff and landing. The gentleman next to me had a large bag blocking the emergency exit. None of the crew members noticed despite one FA reminding us to read the evacuation instructions they just didn't even look. The same for seatbelts before landing. They did walk down the aisle but didn't bother to look. I've never seen this before. Finally by the end of the flight I went to the rear toilet and took my rubbish to the galley.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Chia Ty,Singapore,2014-06-23,21/6/14 EK354 DXB-SIN. Boarding not by zones this time and some confusion occurred at the gate. Middle aged aircraft by EK's standards 4.4 years old well maintained interior but my seat pocket had a bit of uncleared rubbish. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Due to this passengers kept pressing call buttons to ask for drinks. Snack service 1h15m after take off and drinks another 30m later. Breakfast was 3h before landing. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies same as DXB-CDG. This time the sandwich was rock hard and the cookies weren't as good they were soft and weren't baked enough. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach (Same as DXB-CDG) and fried noodles with siewmai. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff but was more bland this time creamed spinach bad this time. There were also fewer potato wedges and they were soggy. Fruits were fresh. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was good on this flight. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around twice after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. Landing was smoothest of 4 legs. After landing during disembarkation I requested to a cabin crew to allow me up to business and first class to have a look. She asked the chief stewardess and got a nod. She then enthusiastically showed me around the upper deck and I was amazed at how luxurious it was. I thanked her profusely after that. Good service from her.

I usually pre-order a special meal but I decided to chance the standard meal. I had a chicken in sauce main course with couscous. I got a nice roll with a good sized wedge of packaged brie a large thick slice of packaged pineapple and a really tasty good sized chunk of brownie for dessert. 1.5-2 hours before landing we got our second meal. I got pieces of seasoned chicken with potatoes and a sauce. There was lemon tart for dessert along with another bread roll and package of cream cheese. The entire flight was enjoyable.

Great ticketing service from SATA office in Toronto. Great price. Great check in experience at YYZ. Full meal service on a 5 hour flight. Old but reasonably comfortable Airbus. Lousy inflight entertainment. But after that there were some real customer service issues. The inbound flight arriving in Toronto was almost 3 hours late but passengers were informed of outbound delay only when they arrived at the airport. Automated e mail advice system was useless because it lagged actual airport announcements. Once on board there were no announcements about PDL connecting flight arrangements food was inedible and the inflight staff was indifferent to say the least. They virtually threw the inedible meal at passengers and retreated to the back of the plane to avoid passengers. The big glass of wine served was a nice touch.

Explained to the cabin crew our concerns again told it is our fault that we did not pre-book. As my 3 year old would not sit by herself (understandably) the cabin crew made two passengers (who had paid for their seats) to move out of their seat to accommodate my wife and 3 year old. They did this by 'threatening' the passengers that if they did not move they would delay the flight from leaving. Luckily the couple were very kind and obliged. When I spoke to the attendant his behaviour was rude and arrogant again blaming my family for not booking the seats in advance. Even though outbound we were allocated seats together as legal requirement for children to sit with parents. Thomson staff completely ignored our concerns.

In my opinion this is where UAL need to put more thought into what is offered. In view of the time of day prior to 10.00 a full breakfast or brunch rather than a lunch might have been a better catering option? The service from flight attendants was efficient although some of them appeared to be a bit tired looking. Small touches such as addressing passengers by name were absent on this flight. This was done on the inbound UA36 EWR-EDI 8 Jan 15 in comparison. The flight arrived at EWR around 35minutes ahead of schedule this was partly due to an on board medical emergency situation.

The 737-800 was in good condition and the flight departed on time. Seat back video screens worked satisfactorily but choice of movies and shoes much more limited than the market leaders. Drinks run before dinner. Alcohol served but limited selection. The hot dinner was tasty but only indian veg and non veg options were offered in economy. Strangely no more drinks were offered during dinner. Coffee and tea came round later. The crew were rather robotic and did not go the extra mile. Comfortable seat although had an exit seat.

I will never understand the purpose of the head piece which makes your head protrude forward even more unless you are more than 2 meters tall. I felt very uncomfortable and tired.

The only positive comment about the experience is that Aeromexico allows access to the Air France lounge at SFO. Everything else about the flight was a complete disappointment. Check in at SFO was slow and disorganized. Equipment looked very tired not well maintained and dirty. IFE was an antique. Old school seats with minimal space. Worst part of the flight was the service provided by the FA. She barely spoke to passengers during the 3.5 hour flight. There was only one beverage service no nuts no peanuts nothing served with drink. Lunch including dessert came on one tray served from a dirty looking trolley. Aeromexico catering is a complete joke. Tiny salads of tough lettuce leaves cooked to death chicken cutlet that was like the sole of a shoe dried up carrots an insipid soggy little tartlet with Cool Whip. After lunch the galley curtains were drawn and the FA disappeared for 2+ hours until landing. Not one pass through the cabin to offer of a drink water nothing.

It has only two aircrafts (the 757-200 and the 757-200C) which have no form of entertainment onboard the cabin crew only speak Nepali Hindi and very little or no English. And they know no other language which is quite important considering most tourists are from Japan and France who will definitely have a lot to complain about. Being Nepali I have had to fly this airline thrice and all the flights turned out to be as bad as the last one. The airline personnel in Delhi for RNAC is the worst I've ever come across as well.

Even the remark that I travel on First Class did nothing. The lady in the lounge claimed that the United Passes I got from Chase were falsified! They were not as UA customer service later confirmed.

There were no foot-rest (which is standard even in many Economy Classes around the world - for example on Turkish Airlines). The United First Class Seat was at least 30 years old with a sealed armrest ashtray. The food was horrible and cold and a stewardess did not know the difference between white wine and champagne. The Video system on my seat had no audio. The much touted ""Wi-Fi” did not work - I could not connect. I conveyed to UAL that they should not use such equipment on long-haul flights.

Travelled in 'Economy' within the ‘extra leg room seats’ section of the cabin. E-Boarding passes for both sectors were generated at the Thomson Shop where the booking had been made. Baggage drop-off was fast. New security at EDI now is now fully operational and was efficient at the time of the process. Following an airport lounge visit (part of the package deal) there was little activity on arrival at the gate. About 20 minutes prior to the expected boarding time an announcement was made that due to an operational issue the flight was going to be operating late. Further delay messages were passed however the reason was not. I can only assume that Swissport TOMs agent at EDI are restricted or very guarded on what information passengers should be told about. Boarding 90 minutes later than scheduled was satisfactory. On board the GLA based Captain and crew apologised for delay crew transport from GLA / EDI which was delayed en-route due to snow on the motorway was the reason! The flight in a B757-200 was fine in my opinion the purchase of extra leg room about 15.25cm / 6 inches more than TOM standard’is worth it on a 4hour 30 minute flight. The crew were friendly and efficient and worked hard in providing the usual on-board sales as no refreshments are included in the basic price. The flight made up some lost time and arrived just over 1 hour late. The return flight departed on time. Again on this sector the GLA based crew worked hard at providing on board sales. The hustle and bustle of this throughout the flight does make any attempted rest difficult in an aisle seat. From observation and this does make me a little concerned a number of passengers failed to comply or just ignored the ‘fasten seat belt signs’ when they were illuminated by the flight crew. The cabin crew should perhaps have been a bit more forceful in ensuring that this requirement was observed at all times. The flight arrived into EDI 20 minutes ahead of schedule.

us-airways,/airline-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,John van Dalen,United States,2013-10-22,PHL-PBI was the last leg on my first-class round trip to and from PSP. I had boarded USAir in Palm Springs that morning and flew to Phoenix. So far so good. Then I flew Phoenix to Philadelphia. That's where it all fell apart. I was stranded at Philadelphia airport by US Airways when their last flight of the day departed early leaving 3 connecting passengers abandoned. Dealing with the brick wall that is the US Airways customer service staff my treatment was shameful disrespectful and costly. USAir refused to rebook me because my reservation had been made via United Airlines. United told me that since my reservation was a First Class Mileage Award the first compatible seat they could rebook me on was next Monday (5 days hence)! Consequently I had to put myself up at the Sheraton in Philadelphia for the night and pay $508 to buy a one-way ticket from PHL-PBI. Adding insult to expensive injury the flight I was supposed to take was first-class non-stop. This one-way rip-off ticket was in coach and had a layover in Charlotte. On just this website alone and going back only about 8 weeks I have encountered reviews of no less than a dozen passengers who have been stranded or treated miserably in Philadelphia by USAir. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is my belief that when an airline accepts your ticket to get from point A to point B that it assumes its share of responsibility for getting their passengers to their destination. I had already flown 2 out of the 3 legs of my flight that day. Departing early and stranding three connecting passengers is unconscionable.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,NA,3,1,3,1,NA,NA,1,0

The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice.

Excellent food and drinks and very good IFE but monitors not that large. Not wild about the seat configuration. I was traveling with my husband and no way for two passengers to sit together.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2014-11-20,IAD-DOH-KWI business class on Nov 9. At check in IAD I asked the agent if there were any infants seated in the first economy bulkhead as I was in the last row of business class. He said there were two infants booked on the flight but both were located at the back of the aircraft. An infant which screamed for the first two hours of the flight was located right behind me. At check in there was an empty seat in the first business cabin that I would have happily taken had I known an infant was seated behind me. Onboard I called the Chief Purser and complained to her. She agreed that the check-in agent should have told me and was going to follow up. At check in there is no reason why the web-check in baggage drop only counter should be closed before the entire check-in counter closes. I ended up behind a huge family traveling in economy with mountains of bags who checked in at the business counter and haggled endlessly over excess baggage charges causing me to wait about 15 minutes to check in - all the while the web check-in counter was unattended. I had a delicious lamb entree from IAD-DOH although the piece of meat was the size of a silver dollar. New lounge in DOH is pretty nice. I had a shower which was available as soon as I asked. Well equipped lounge with lots of dining options and very spread out. DOH-KWI was on the new 787. The interior of the cabin is cool with great ambient lighting and seat comfortable.

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Suhail Shafi,United States,2014-10-22,New Delhi to Srinagar and back. While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there. Despite its financial difficulties their inflight product has improved markedly over the years and their Star Alliance membership and modern hub in Delhi makes them attractive to fly with both on short haul and long haul flights. My expectations were low but I was more than satisfied and I would consider flying with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,3,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

There was no lumbar support and the seat back was really hard. There was also no foot rest. In addition amenity kits and menus were not given out to us. What's worse was that when we boarded the flight not every seat had blankets and pillows on them and they were only available upon request and the entire process of passengers settling down into their seats was extremely chaotic as several passengers started requesting blankets and pillows from the cabin crew during pushback and the cabin crew were hurrying back and forth just to hand them the blankets and pillows. The food portions were also pretty small and I was still famished even after the meal service. The cutlery provided was also made of cheap plastic and not metal unlike on some other airlines. We were also not served tea or coffee throughout the flight. The cabin crew were in a rush to collect the meal trays from the passengers and when the pilot came on the speaker and requested for the cabin crew to take their seats for landing they did not even conduct a safety check for us such as making sure our seat belts were fastened window shades were lifted and hand carry items were placed under the seat in front of us.

The entertainment system was solid but had a poor selection compared to the United flight I took on my way to Europe with about 3X the selection.

UA 55 Paris-Newark April 18 2015. After United bought Continental everything went downhill. Flights were delayed or cancelled they routinely have mechanical problems with their planes their flight crews have gotten worse and worse to the point that they often are just plain abusive their overseas business class is terrible and their ground crews are incompetent dishonest and often nasty. Unfortunately they have so many direct routes that you are stuck either flying United or taking another airline with a stop midway through your flight. If you have frequent flier miles with them good luck. You can almost never use your miles when you want to travel over the holidays or they charge some exorbitant number of miles. And now your miles will expire if you don't continue to fly with these people. United Airlines is a nightmare.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,2,1,2,2,NA,NA,1,0

Philadelphia Airport seems to come in for a lot of stick on this forum but you can only speak as you find and my wife and I found it a very pleasant improvement to the likes of JFK MIA and LAX as regards transfers. More space and less like a cattle market. Paid to go in the US Club which was very pleasant and well worth twenty odd dollars. Only waited 5 mins to clear immigration which is far less than anywhere else we've encountered in the States. As for US Airways well we've now been on all of the ""big four"" in the last couple of years (first time with US) and to be honest I really cannot see any difference in any of them. In all four in economy space is getting tighter and tighter and food/drink on offer is getting less and less and poorer and poorer quality. But if people want low fares then there's the rub I guess. At least US run modern planes (A-330 200's) on this route with Emb 175 on the domestic sector far better than poky CRJ's etc. The Airbus is far better than the triple sevens or the ancient 747s or 767s used by some and at least if you are travelling as a couple you just get two seats and don't have to share. AVOD in all seats which is better than many. Overall still miles behind people like Air New Zealand but they are only of any use if you want somewhere out West. In short as long as you don't expect luxury from any of these American giants you won't be disappointed.

Constant wine refills were also done. Fruit cookies and chips were also distributed as snacks. For Breakfast asked for chicken but was served the Omelette with sausage. No complaints as it was perfect! Arrived into SIN early. SIN-NRT gate said closed but they were letting pax check in. Seemed like boarding took forever. Took off on time in A380.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,C Chapman,United States,2014-06-04,LAS-ICN-MNL-ICN-LAS. The flight left late Friday night which is great as it allowed me to work all day and still eat dinner and head to the airport for my flight. The aircraft was fairly new or at least it seemed new. The interior was clean and spacious. What I liked was that there is a channel that allows you to get a pilots view of takeoff or you can see underneath the aircraft while taking off. This channel does not stay on the entire flight but it is a pretty cool thing to see. During the flight they gave us a little travel kit with eye cover and slippers a toothbrush a a little thing of toothpaste. I know this is pretty common but it's a nice touch. On the Vegas-Seoul flight I had the Korean meal. They have a selection of Korean beers. The inflight entertainment has many options in English/Korean and Japanese. I was able to watch some pretty new movies. Each seat also had a USB outlet to keep your phone or tablet charged during the flight. I had this on all 4 legs but I guess is only on certain flights. I found the crew very friendly and full of smiles they are quick to assist if you need help or just want a drink. They come through the cabin frequently with water/OJ or juice and are pleasant to talk with if you aren't shy with them. My only complaint is this it's not Korean's fault as I also had this issue on ANA and EVA but the 777 is not designed with an overhead seat vent so I always get very hot and sweat on these flights as it's controlled centrally within each area of the cabin. Throw in 12 hours in the same seat and it can get pretty uncomfortable All in all I'd say a good experience on a high quality airline.

The same poor quality seats. We asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane. The reason we were given was that the plane came in over night and all blankets and pillows were used!

I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard.

Return flight had an aisle seat with a spare beside me and was able to get some sleep which I usually don't do well whilst in an upright seat laid back. Economy seats on VA 777's are one of the better seats around. However there is always room for improvement on any airline seat. Flight attendants were very attentive and ready to give you a smile.

Terminal too small it has to hold arriving and departing passengers at the same time so you may not have anywhere to even sit. Terminal at Luton quite crowded not always easy to find a seat. A disappointing experience if you have paid the full flexi fare price. If you have got a saver ticket then fair value.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,S Rose,Australia,2014-05-17,Ballina-Melbourne on A320. Paid about $100 or so for a one way ticket which I purchased on Qantas website . Baggage allowance was 20kg and there was no detail on the QF website about incremental charges for excess baggage. Travelled with two bags which totaled 35 kg - ie: 15 kg over the allowance and the equivalent of a second bag. Jetstar charged me $300 for the excess luggage which was three times the price of the ticket and about ten times the price of what most global airlines charge for a second bag. Qantas should be reprimanded for selling Jetstar tickets and not informing customers about these usurious charges and Jetstar should be faulted for outright price gouging which doesn't remotely reflect the incremental cost of carrying the bag. Qantas customer service people in Melbourne washed their hands of the problem saying it is a Jetstar issue (even though JQ is owned by QF and the ticket was bought on the QF website). Jetstar employees in Melbourne were unsympathetic said I should've known read the policies etc. One even suggested they should be charging more and didn't think $500-1000 was out of line. This airline is completely out of control and I vow never to reward either company with my business again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

No further explanation offered. No beverages offered. If you got up to ask for water they did oblige by giving you one small glass. 6.45pm - herded like animals and packed like sardines onto a stationary bus on the tarmac. When asked what was happening and where we were going we were told ""nowhere. you can not stand on the tarmac so you must sit on the bus and wait while we do final checks onboard. The buses were over-packed and we were locked inside while staff and drivers disappeared. 7.15pm - finally start to re-board passengers. We decide not to get back onto an aircraft that has electrical failures. We demanded our luggage and a full refund. The ground staff obliged however sent us wondering around the airport unescorted in search of the duty manager. This whole process took until 8pm.

jin-air,/airline-reviews/jin-air,Jin Air customer review,L Nagel,Netherlands,2013-12-17,LJ001 on 15 December 2013 travelling from ICN to BKK. This is supposed to be a budget airline. Indeed there were no TV's on board and the second meal (the first was something in between a full meal and a snack) had to be paid for. Otherwise great service from this airline. I for one never had an airline where the staff were walking up and down the aisle with drinks so often just waiting for a chance to serve you. Just before landing staff turned on the music and started a dance/exercise which they invited you to join in with so you could stretch and get your blood flowing. Finally if you really miss your TV for just a few dollars you can rent one of those handheld playstations. All in all for me a great experience and I would certainly recommend this airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

Arrived at airport 3 hours before our international flight - they said we were on standby because we didn't book our seats online 30 hours previous. We were on holiday and received no conditions when we booked about having to confirm online. We had connections so they probably had to put us on the flight but assured us we would be well compensated if they couldn't get us on the flight. These people were so rude and arrogant. They did put us on the flight (the one we booked and paid for 8 months out) and then somehow felt we should have been extremely grateful!

Both meal services offered different dishes which were still hot when they arrived - food was very nice. I am 6ft 3in so was surprised by the leg room. My only gripe would be that when completing online check-in my travel companion and I were separated and I had to pay to have us seated together.

KWI-LHR-EDI-LHR-KWI: booked World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) but upgraded to Club World (Business Class) on the outward trip. An excellent experience: as always the cabin crew make the difference. On all sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful. Food was excellent (chicken or pasta seem to be a thing of the past - I was not offered either) nicely presented and for me in sufficient quantity. Water/orange juice runs on a regular basis washrooms clean and tidy and well-stocked A wide range of entertainment on the KWI-LHR sector (it kept me entertained for a 6-hour flight and because I flew out in April and back in May the selection had changed on the return flight). Smooth flights (the 747's on the KWI-LHR sector although old were well- maintained and everything worked - I really enjoy flying the ""Queen of the Skies"") and plenty of information from the flight deck. Slight delay outbound at Kuwait because of a technical problem but it was resolved: all other sectors were on time. I travelled on a Sunday in both directions so no delays in connections at Heathrow although I had built in sufficient time between flights to allow for delays when I booked my ticket. All in all four excellent flights - BA seem to have improved immensely since I last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason I use BA in preference to the carriers from the Middle East especially as Terminal 5 at Heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience).",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

The departure experience was horrendous with huge queues. Despite joining the queue about 2 hours before the departure time we were eventually rescued and fast tracked to security. We had no time at all to view shops before boarding. On the return the aircrew had apparently very little food left and by the time they got to us we were only able to purchase 1 bag of crisps even the last kitkat having been sold. Having expected to at least get a roll this was unacceptable. In retrospect we could have purchased something in the airport but never expected to have to do this. The aircrew were being harassed by others in the same situation explaining the demand on the outward bound flight had been unprecedented. This was not very convincing. To add insult to injury on my later visit to the toilet I witnessed a crew member unwrapping and consuming a hot bacon roll. It's ok for some! The crew later announced proudly that everything on the duty free was available. My partner said that even if she had wanted something she certainly would not have purchased it.

My colleagues on the 7:20 flight didn’t take off until 10:30.

It would be unfair to name this person but she did not smile once during the flight and was stern and just so unfriendly. There were no pre take off sweets. I do not understand how anyone can say VLM’s food is good you get offered half a brown sandwich in a plastic wrapper or fruit not even both and no plate.

First flight delayed out of MSP for 25 minutes. Ok that's understandable. But when we arrive in Philadelphia we are told we will have a short wait until our gate is cleared. This turns into a very long wait and we are on a tight connection. We ask the flight attendant if she could please contact our next flight and ask them to wait. She rudely says no and then offers no further response. When we finally deplaned we asked the agent at the gate if she could please contact our flight. All she did was give us directions on getting to the B concourse. After a sprint to the gate we barely make it on the final boarding call. Thankfully the flight to London was only 25% occupied at most and we were able to stretch out. The flight to DUS was with British Airways and went smoothly except for a slight 10 minutes delay. On the return flight our flight was cancelled with no reason given. We were lucky we checked early and immediately called customer service. They said they couldn't put us on another flight for about 3 hours until they finally caved in and put us on a flight departing in a few hours with Air Berlin meaning we got no sleep.

Aircraft for this service was a Boeing 737-700W and I was seated on 9A in SAS Plus. There is no longer any free middle seat as opposed to the previous Business Class but I was fortunate enough that the flight was not fully booked so I had a whole seat row for myself and the legroom was typical standard intra European economy class but not Business Class standard. No in- flight entertainment system are installed on SAS Boeing 737s but the in-flight SAS magazine is however worth reading but should to my opinion be published more often. As a frequent traveller you keep reading the same magazine over and over again since there is no other in-flight entertainment system available. On this particular flight the cabin looked quite new tidy and clean. The comfort of the seats are slightly better than offered by other Star Alliance partners (except Austrian Airlines upgraded Fokker 70/100 seats and interior) on intra European flights but can not be compared to the very comfortable and cosy seats in the just retired SAS MD-80s. Upgrade of the cabins of the SAS 737s are generally soon needed. I do hope that SAS do its best to find comfortable seats and not just slim cheap and lightweight seats as the rest of the tar Alliance partners unfortunately have done. The right selection of new seats can make a huge change in travelling experience. The food and how it was presented is very far from the previous Business Class. A cold chicken salad was offered served out of a paper box. No bread was served with the meal but relatively good wine was offered and quiet some variety of cold and hot drinks. To my opinion the standard of food and how it is presented are much lower compared to intra European services by other full-service airlines independent of airline alliance affiliation.

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,Michalis Kapsalis,Greece,2015-03-04,I booked to Abu Dhabi Business. One month before departure they informed me that my returned flight was canceled because Aegean had canceled all Abu Dhabi flights after November. I asked for a replacement ticket with their partner Etihad but they told me they can't do that. So they gave me some money back and made me buy another return ticket for 300 euros. The business class has little to do with business class. Apart from the food it looks like economy class. The only difference is that there is a reclined table at the middle seat shared by the two side passengers. No personal entertainment system either just newspapers. I have noticed that many routes are operated by Aegean only seasonally so beware they may cancel your flight anytime if they see that they have not many reservations. Overall definitely a budget airline nothing more.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,3,2,4,3,0,NA,NA,2,0
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,L Barron,United States,2014-10-22,I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

Only 15kg of baggage are allowed and no inflight- service is provided. The flight from Crete to Germany was on-time but it seemed the aircraft cleaners did a very poor job.

southwest-airlines,/airline-reviews/southwest-airlines,Southwest Airlines customer review,Adam Floridia,United States,2012-07-19,After a five hour delay (understandable because it was weather related) we finally boarded our plane to San Francisco via Chicago. It wasn't until Chicago that they told us that our leg to San Francisco was canceled and the plane was now traveling to Los Angeles. Being stranded in Chicago with a five month old is not my idea of a vacation. On the return trip we got routed to Minneapolis (again weather). However when we did get to Chicago we were told we now had to switch planes for the final leg back to CT. We specifically booked flights with no plane change because that is a hassle with an infant. My family will never fly Southwest again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,0
air-china,/airline-reviews/air-china,Air China customer review,A Kupferman,France,2012-05-29,Paris to Beijing in business class on a 777-300 and return from Shanghai to Paris in business class on A340. Seating on the 777 is excellent with new seats large TV screens and a 2-2-2 configuration. On the A340 the configuration was the same but there were older seats smaller TV screens though I cannot complain about seating. On both legs staff were friendly and attentive. What is disappointing was the quality of the meals. I have seldom tasted such bland food and the presentation was horrible. Before take-off only orange juice and water were served. Wines (good selection of French wines) were excellent but must have been very expensive because there was no second serving nor were liquors offered at the end of the meal. Another drawback was the total absence of reading materials in English or in French except a few China Daily newspapers. A large proportion of the offered movies were oldies. If you are not interested in food if you bring your own reading materials Air China is a good option as it is cheap and not too many people fly it so you have plenty of space.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,4,4,4,1,2,NA,NA,4,1

Each time has been a very pleasant experience.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,Kari Alguire,Canada,2014-05-15,LAS-YYC. I never brought my iPad and it would not have mattered due to the fact that the system didn't function. I was travelling on my own on this trip but had I had my children it would have been even worse. We travel quite frequently but only have 1 iPad so I guess we will have to rent them now for the rest of the family. I also see we can't use them for the first 20 mins or the last 20 mins either. Why bother to watch a movie on a 2-3 hr flight as you would never get to see it all. No more place to charge devices either. Air Canada had a pretty good thing going and now it has taken a turn for the worse again. Whom ever thought up Rouge was obviously not the sharpest knife in the drawer. These types of major changes should have been piloted properly and reviews taken seriously. Very disappointed!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0
united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,James Vanoni,United States,2014-07-29,My wife and I flew from San Diego to Paris France. On the return trip the video on the plane was inoperative and we flew 10 hours with no movies or sound. The second leg from Washington to San Diego had no video screens available on the plane and the power plug under our seat did not charge our electronic device so we could not watch a movie we had downloaded as we used up our battery on the previous flight from Paris. To top it off one of our bags didn't arrive with the rest of our luggage and hasn't turned up a day later. Needless to say the airlines should have compensated us for the lack of video service during an international flight. The missing luggage might turn up hopefully! The crew were excellent.

delta-air-lines,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,David Pumputis,United States,2014-08-11,Took a flight from Phoenix AZ to Rochester NY with a plane change in Minneapolis MN. I arrived at Minneapolis 40 minutes between flights so plenty of time then we were told that there will be a delay because of mechanical issues and had to wait for a new plane. While we were waiting at the next gate we found out that plane was also delayed for mechanical issues. The replacement plane finally arrived 2 hours later we boarded and were just about to back out of the gate when the captain announced that we will be delayed for mechanical issues. I arrived 2.5 hours later from my scheduled arrival time. The return trip wasn't any better the plane arrived 2 hours late. I arrived in Atlanta as my connecting flight was taking off. That was the last flight out of Atlanta until the next morning. I got my ticket no problem but when I asked about a hotel. They would only give me a coupon for a reduced rate. I felt I shouldn't have to pay for something g that wasn't my fault. So I got to spend 12+ hours in the terminal. Never flying Delta again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0
icelandair,/airline-reviews/icelandair,Icelandair customer review,Michelle Hanko,United States,2014-05-21,"My husband and I had reservations to travel to the UK on 10 May. When we arrived at the Icelandair check-in booth about three hours in advance of the flight we were told that the flight had been cancelled because of the Icelandair pilot's strike. The staff made no effort to call us and tell us this. They told us (nothing in writing) that we had seats on a BA flight leaving the next day at 1030 at night. This turned out not to be true and we ended up flying to London via BA in ""stand by coach"" mode instead of the business class seats we had paid for. The whole process repeated when it was time to leave - when we arrived at Heathrow on 19 May the Icelandair folks told us the flight had been delayed. By an hour. Then again. Finally it was obvious that the flight was not going to happen so they put a group of us (about 30) on a BA flight for the trip home about 5 hours after the schedule flight. No one told us why the flight had been cancelled so I can only presume that it was another strike. After the crew behind the Icelandair counter told us they were putting us on another airline they gathered us up and said they would take us to where we could reclaim our checked bags. As the lead Icelandair agent led us through the airport we were delayed by the passport reader for about 30 seconds and when we reached the othe side she had disappeared with about 5 of the people she was leading. We never saw her or caught up to her again and neither did the passengers behind us in the line. We were entirely on our own negotiating the UK border lines and finding the correct baggage carousol not to mention trying to find ""Terminal 5"" that can only be reached by train. At no point during this whole evolution did any Icelandair employee in the airports offer apologies or try to give us more than the most minimal assistance. They did not waste any effort smiling at us or trying to help out. They treated us like we were nothing more than a tremendous annoyance to them. I will never fly Icelandair again.",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,0,2,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

Seats were uncomfortable material very lose and faded. NBO-EBB was a brand new Embraer 190 excellent comfort leather seats steak and cheese roll much better same on the return leg but got a continental breakfast.

Shortly before arrival at Cairo my wife advised the cabin attendant and was told to wait on the plane for a lift. After waiting some time we along with two other people were told the lift had come and gone. The crew told us it had been recalled and would arrive shortly. It turned up about an hour later. It then went to another flight before depositing us at the terminal some ž hours after arrival. At this point we should have been met by our tour representative who would have our visas. We found out the visas had been purchased for all our group of 39 but could not find the representative. After some time we purchased new visas and the wheelchair attendant set off at high speed for the plane which had been considerably delayed. On the return the arrangements for a chair worked well at Aswan and the lift was there at Cairo but it deposited us in the terminal at the bottom of several flights of stairs and no assistance.

Checked with Icelandair via e-mail if I could take 3x32 kg per person as other airlines flying this route allow. Got a reply saying I was correct and that I could take 3x32kg per person. I have just checked in with Icelandair at Dulles airport and told that unless I paid $262 for two bags they would not check us in. They insist that my allowance is only 2x32kg per person. I showed them my e-mail which clearly states that I was allowed 3 bags only to be told that the Icelandair representative had made a mistake. I am now in the Air France lounge shared with Icelandair. There is nowhere to sit with minimal refreshments. How they can call this a business lounge I don't know. The whole idea as others have said in flying Business Class.

I came with high expectations and fond memories of flights I took with Cathay Pacific around 5 years ago but was in for a shock. Seated on seat 59C (exit aisle) the seat when reclined designed in such a way that it pushes your head down. The 'Asian vegetarian meal' was some stale disgusting tasting bread with some cheap margarine one piece of lettuce and a tiny piece of boiled zucchini. Tea was super strong and a sickly sweet Thai made apple concentrate juice was given. Worst of all the water was like nothing I ever experienced anywhere let alone on an airline. It smelt like highly chlorinated swimming pool water and I flushed it down the toilet. Cabin crew were efficient in a typically Chinese way but completely under motivated. They looked exhausted from what I suspect is a heavy load of flights. No immigration cards were given the inflight magazine is a joke and the plane heating system seemed noisier than usual (though I may be biased due to the overall experience). A world class airline? I don't think so!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,4,1,2,NA,NA,3,0
