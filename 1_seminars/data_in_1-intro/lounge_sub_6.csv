aer-lingus,/lounge-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus Gold Circle Business Class Lounge - Dublin Airport,Patrick Jordan,Ireland,2011-09-13,The new lounge spans two floors with views of the apron A water feaTUre dominates one wall.

aer-lingus,/lounge-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus Gold Circle Business Class Lounge - London Heathrow Airport,J Russell,NA,2010-05-01,I'm sitting in the lounge a bit incredulous that I paid for access to this. I paid for it because I had a lot of time to kill and it seemed a good way to pass the day. What a gloomy awful lounge. I found this page because I was looking to see if maybe I'd missed something because it seems there is no free WiFi. Completely insane. I thought this was for business travellers? The girl at the desk looked me up and down when I walked in too so apparently despite having a lounge that looks like a 3rd grade classroom without the fun stuff on the walls (or windows) they have a problem with how people dress? I'm neatly attired but I'm flying today so I am absolutely not wearing a suit. Anyway the long and short of it is that the lounge is unfriendly no amenities no toilets no natural light can't really see myself bothering with it again.,AER LINGUS GOLD CIRCLE BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,London Heathrow Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,1,1,3,2,2,0,0,2,0

The main attraction of this lounge is that it is beside boarding gates. This evening I noticed the red wine bottle was empty. I asked the attendant to replace it but she wasn't able to open the new bottle. I can understand a bottle of wine being used but to have a staff member unable to open another is beyond belief.

Door understaffed & young man at desk very obviously nicer to male clients than myself as a solo middle aged woman. Lounge is poorly set up rather like a bus station where toomany travellers require seats for their bags & coats. Food selection is the worst I've seen in a lounge. Drinks selection is better but they sure do not hurry to put out the bubbly. The latest empty has been sitting on a counter for a half hour now.

Calgary has always been a large and crowded one. They have just done some renovations and while it looks much better (and the staff are invariably courteous and helpful) there is one down-side. There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down. I only had a 35 minute change of planes and could not get anything for the first 15minutes - waited at the bar got my wine drank half and had to leave.

We went out of our way to fly Air Canada back home from Europe. Had a 6-hour layover in Montreal which was nice. Easy access to the lounge staff speaks English and French (and possibly some other languages) quite fluently. Food in the lounge was not up to par (about 900 ml of cold pasta salad and some other similarly sized items were available for everybody). I went downstairs to the Burger King.

The lounge is nice and tidy and rather seldom overcrowded. The variety of drinks and food is good. Normally you will find both hot and cold food that is very tasteful. The seats in the lounge are not especially comfortable. The free WiFi is always troublesome and I have never managed to connect but the are free computers and Internet cables available. Nevertheless the WiFi should be improved or the instructions to be made clearer on how to connect. In the central area of the lounge there is a TV showing CNN. The volume should be adjusted to be just slightly higher since it is very difficult to hear anything if you are not sitting 1 metre or closer to the TV.

avianca,/lounge-reviews/avianca,Avianca (swiss) Business Class Lounge Customer - New York JFK Airport,D Ruckel,United States,2014-11-19,I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swissair logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swissair evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swissair lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic. Since this is supposed to be about the lounge I have seen one or two glorious lounges and this pales in comparison.,AVIANCA (SWISS) BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,New York JFK Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,0
avianca,/lounge-reviews/avianca,Avianca El Dorado Business Class Lounge Customer - Bogota Airport,M Chia,Australia,2013-11-15,After being deprived of a lounge in Santiago I was hoping to be compensated by the new lounge in Bogota. But I was rather disappointed. First the directions given by the checkin agent was go straight after security. Unfortunately there was a T-junction where the sign board had an arrow pointing UP. I asked a staff but the directions was confusing. Having heard that it was past the food court I look for this sign reach a dead end a construction area. So I backtracked and saw the food court UPSTAIRS. Going into the lift I pressed 2 the floor the agent told me. It didn't move. I try 3 and it moves. Actually the lounge is no longer after the food court but to the side especially if you take the lift. Next I looked for the toilet. I could see the female toilet but not the male one. I walked to the other end - still no toilet. Backtracked all the way to exit still no toilet. You see the male toilet is beyond the ladies but it is not visible from this direction or that. And there are no signs to overcome this. Then I went for the food. The spread was astonishingly poor. Many plates of ham and cheese. Some salad and juices. That's it for food. (I hadn't checked the alcoholic section.) I gathered some food and look for the cutlery. Not obvious again. After going around i found forks and knives but no spoon. I asked the cleaning lady and she obliged. Huge traffic during lunch time is no excuse Then I go the work area. Plugged in my video camera to recharge. Power light doesn't come on. I jiggled here and there. Still no power. So I waited for another table to be vacant. And there's power. So my verdict. Great potential. Lots of shortcomings which can be easily rectified. I hope Avianca realises that most people only use the lounge once.

My excitement at being allowed into this hallowed space was short lived. It looked congested and untidy. The service for anything from a full meal to a glass of water is waiter only. Empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables. As I had only recently eaten on the inbound flight I did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private. I moved to sit 'outside' on the balcony overlooking the departures area as it felt less claustrophobic. After waiting 10 minutes for a coffee I quickly drank it and went to the First/Gold lounge which had a more comfortable and relaxing ambience.,BRITISH AIRWAYS CONCORDE LOUNGE REVIEW,London Heathrow Airport,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,4,4,4,4,2,0

Visited twice in the last 2 weeks and I'd say that this lounge is below average. No outside view of any kind. Boarding notifications shouted by staff. Stir fries and rice offered during meal time but not delicious and attractive at all. Some salad sandwiches dessert and other snacks available. Soft drinks plenty with some beer and wine. Used plates collected from time to time. Washrooms were clean. Biggest complaint is the wifi - uses public wifi which is extremely slow.

Warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge. The main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables. Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language.

The way they speak to people is loud and embarrassing it really is time Continental taught these desk staff that customer service should not be discourteous or humiliating.

Lounge is small and cramped - staff poorly trained and clearly have no natural customer service flair. Restaurant booths were full when we were there - staff were unhelpful and no booking system meaning you need to go back over and again to find space (in the end we went to the Gordon Ramsey opposite the lounge). Orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the 'terrace'. Carpets stained and the whole room looking tired. Elmis spa has no dedicated area for First in fact we couldn't get in - as priority is 'first come' rather than First then Business.

Travelling to the gate (G12) involved using a shuttle/train so it is worth giving yourself plenty of time. Lounge very spacious. Newspapers available but no English language magazines.

These are hotel-style rooms with day bed TV and music and a private bath. Had champagne and lunch delivered to the room so very nice. Then I discovered that the room only had one temperature - freezing cold Also the rooms back up to what may be a kitchen with constant banging of doors and other loud noises. Not very much chance of getting a rest here. Finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times. Restaurant food choices are rather uninspired and presentation not of the highest standard. Service can be inconsistent.

They do not offer much in the way of food but not bad if your flight is delayed. There is free wifi in all the lounges and even computer use for those not traveling with their own. The one I entered in terminal E at ATL was really not good. It was the old style (not renovated like many are now) quite large but very crowded. There were numerous children in there! Staff behind the bar were unprofessional and talking about inter-lounge politics and not attentive to staff and the bathrooms were dirty and locks didn't lock properly.

What a dump! Very small with old worn out couches. No Television or newspapers disgusting food and coffee no departure information screen and staff who are friendly but unable to know how to mix a simple drink. There are also no showers or change rooms and the toilets are outside of the lounge and shared by all of the business lounges. Definitely one of the worst Oneworld lounges I have used anywhere. But it does match with the rest of CDG airport which is also poorly designed badly maintained and very user unfriendly.,MALAYSIA AIRLINES (ICARE) BUSINESS CLASS GOLDEN LOUNGE REVIEW,Paris CDG Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,1,2,2,1,1,3,2,0

There is a first class lounge apparently at the ""satellite"" wherever that is but you won't be told about it in the main terminal unless you ask even if you are eligible. There is a definite don't care attitude in this place and as others have commented the showers and toilets are usable but not great.

The shower was delightful and had heated granite floors rainforest shower heads Occitane toiletries etc. There was an extensive breakfast buffet with hot items like scrambled eggs pancakes waffles etc and fired eggs could be ordered too.

Given most really long hauls like to Australia leave very late one would expect an option to eat before boarding. Well you can have snacks but that is about it. The other thing about this lounge and the business class lounge is finding them. They are on the 5th floor but given entry through immigration at the tom Bradley terminal is a bit like entering the corridors of an underground prison the narrow corridors and lack of signage give little indication of where to go for anything. Incredibly on the 3rd floor which is the departure level there is a completely new world of shops and glitz so why can't Qantas get with the new Tom Bradley theme. The other thing is the very good BA/Qantas premium check in area is gone. Now if want to check in early because your hotel has thrown you out it is an all in check in affair which despite the sign saying business/ first class means nothing. For those of you have tried to understand the psyche of the US travel who wants to pay nothing for the airfare but then argue at check in for a first class seat delays can be considerable.,"QANTAS ""ONEWORLD"" FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW",Los Angeles Lax Airport,First Class,NA,NA,3,3,5,4,2,3,3,4,0

As much as I loved the old premium terminal there were times when it would be so crowded it was impossible to get a seat but that was often due to passengers taking up a table and three chairs for the coats bags or newspapers no such problem now as there is a range of different types of chair and sofas spread around the bottom floor in different areas. The design is exceptional with a very nice water feature. At the time I' usually there the lounge tends to be quite busy when I arrive but after a few hours its almost empty. As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours. Later I tried one of the work stations so I could use the USB charging unit each of the stations has a small bag of snacks and a bottle of water.

From there you can deposit heavy bags in the cloak room use (rather dated) computers in the business centre go to the game room or go to the First or Business Class lounge.

Past the dining area are huge sitting areas for more passengers who just want to relax. All seats are singles though so don't expect to be able to lie down anywhere. There are showers in the restrooms but there are no toilets and sinks in the private shower rooms. This means that one must groom and finish up in the public area of the restroom which is a bit odd.

The bar had a good choice of wines and non alcoholic drinks. Good wifi although had a couple of attempts at logging in. Staff service only mediocre as they did not bother to see who was there and kept pestering everybody in the lounge (a total of less than 10 passengers) more than once about missing passengers on some SIA flights. The place was rather claustrophobic without windows and did not have the general airy feeling that was usual at Changi.

swiss-international-air-lines,/lounge-reviews/swiss-international-air-lines,Swiss Int'l Air Lines Business Class Lounge - New York JFK Airport,D Ruckel,United States,2014-11-19,I used the lounge as an Avianca customer. I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swiss logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swiss evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swiss lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic. Since this is supposed to be about the lounge I have seen one or two glorious lounges and this pales in comparison.,SWISS INT'L AIR LINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,New York JFK Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,0

united-airlines,/lounge-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines Red Carpet Club Lounge,J Warner,United States,2013-12-23,I have flown on United for several years now (in excess of 2M miles) and was a 1K for most of that time. This year I will not renew my lounge membership. Even post-merger the lounges are not well maintained people working the desk in larger airports are not consistently friendly or engaging and with the charging of alcohol that use to be included in membership (don't call it complimentary) it is just not worth it. A few weeks ago I flew Global-First to Sydney and was looking forward to the “First Class” lounge. Reception personnel more interested in chatting amongst themselves and no one in the actual club area to help. The food in this SFO “exclusive” first class lounge had the opportunity to be exceptional but most of the serving dishes were empty. When travelling I almost always look for the alternative carriers’ lounge for a better experience.

The offerings were limited to a bowl of apples one flavor of yogurt cereal and a handful of shriveled miniature bagels that looked like they'd been recycled from the previous day. Juice was available only upon request at the bar (tips appreciated). Although the club provides wi-fi service it was not working when I was there.

turkish-airlines,/lounge-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines Business Class Lounge - Istanbul Ataturk Airport,J Anastos,United States,2013-04-24,I was looking forward to visiting this lounge but my experience was bad. We arrived at 6am from a long Hong Kong flight and had about 90 minutes to rest before the next leg. The lounge was crowded and there were no seats! We wanted coffee and just to relax but there was no place to sit we wandered around for almost 20 minutes before finally grabbing an open seat. All the lockers were also full so nowhere to stash our carryon bags we had to lug them around the lounge too. And to make matters worse the showers were all full for an entire hour. We felt like we were at the Grand Bazaar pushing and shoving our way just to find a seat and a cup of coffee. In a word it was stressful not relaxing at all.,TURKISH AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,1,4,4,4,1,4,4,0

Not crowded but very 'busy'. The hot food surprisingly for me and very strange for foreign visitors was pea soup! That was all - and some weird croutons. Uninspiring salad bar with no 'wow' factor whatsoever and three types of freshly-made sandwiches - ham and cheese chicken prawn with rose-marie sauce. All of them sorry to say utterly tasteless! The good news is thank goodness the excellent wines available and Champagne (for that you have to ask an over-worked but smiling waitress who will eventually bring it to where you are sitting) Usual premium spirits selection with mixers. Toilets (men) were frankly a bit grubby and dated and a tad smelly - not good enough! More like a traditional English pub on a Saturday night. Overall very underwhelmed with the whole experience and compared with other business class lounges at Heathrow and overseas in Middle East down at the bottom of the list - desperately needs upgrading to bring in line with competitors.,BRITISH AIRWAYS TERRACES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,London Gatwick Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,3,5,2,2,4,3,0

Incheon is a huge airport and so the lounge is necessarily huge too although it is cleverly set up is two areas separated by the lift shafts toilets etc. Comfortable chairs everywhere but largely lined up as if in a waiting room. Fantastic views from massive glass onto the tarmac apron. The catering was astonishing in its pausity. One unrermakable red and one unknown (and don't care too) white no bubbles of any sort a couple of self-serve draft beers water came in juice pouch things reminiscent of 1990s economy class meal trays. There was a non-descript pumpkin soup without bread a couple of unappetising salads a couple of pot noodle things (self-serve) a couple of juices and thats about your lot. Empty glasses and plates hung around for a long time including a beer mug on a table that was there when we wrrived and was still there when we left 2 hours later. Toilets were roomy and clean a must-visit to have a play with the electric flush bidet and warm air arrangement. Wifi free without the need of a password and was quick enough for the few emails and bit of browning I did.

I recommend arriving early as access can be denied when the lounge hits peak capacity. There can be a lengthy queue to enter at times as there is only one person manning the reception desk and she must record your details manually as you enter. Food and beverage amenities are adequate. There is no television but there are 3 PC terminals. WiFi coverage is a bit confusing as most pax needing access needed staff assistance to log in.

I was offered a fresh coffee (very good) by one of the girls and told that when the chef returned from his break that he would prepare us some breakfast. This he did. We were offered a plain omelette or some 'fresh' frittata. We opted for the frittata. Two small slices each with no accompaniment. Very disappointing and not worth the money we had paid.

There are actually 2 AA lounges in the same terminal one is on the top floor. I utilized both because the gate for my flight changed and they offered me the opportunity to go to the lounge closer to the gate. Both of these lounges are good and you can choose which one you use. Really it depends on what you're after. The one on the top floor gave me great personal service when I arrived and when they noted the length of my last flight they offered me use of the shower. I didn't have to wait they had plenty available. This lounge had self serve bar with a decent (though not extensive) amount of options or you could use drink coupons at their attended bar to order cocktails. The attended bar was a little lonely looking and didn't look well stocked but I'm not positive. The lower level lounge also had great customer service the front desk person greeted me nicely and assisted me with updates about my delayed flight changed my seats etc. They didn't seem to have a self-service bar but the attended bar over here was lively and had a very sweet older bartender who called every customer ""mi amor"". She was so sweet. When my plane unexpectedly began to board after many delays she quickly got me a drink so I'd have time to finish it and she got me bottles of water to take on the plane. Computers were set up next to the bar area and had high top chairs making it comfortable to have a drink while checking your email. I don't think this lounge had showers but since I'd already showered at the first lounge I didn't go looking for it either. Only gripe was that despite it being around dinner time they didn't have food options except a few limited things to purchase.

(now under dispute for a refund). Ironically we were flying KLM and ran into a rather rude KLM staffer who was flogging $35 passes to all & sundry in the check-in area. Said our DC cards would not get us in. (yes they do that lounge desk girl not withstanding). That being said the guest rate for Diner's is only usd$28 or about cad$30.

Seating comfortable in groups of 4 chairs but a bit boring in layout - nice views out across runway etc. Staff very polite and obliging and will bring you drink or food to your table. Selection of foods a bit limited and would expect more in a nice F class lounge - drinks etc okay though. Shower rooms and relaxing area but found to be rather basic and short on normal F class lounge amenities.

I was there for one minute and felt like cattle in a market. Literally no seats available and an extremely small space to manoeuvre.

Not too impressed on the first visit very little food on offer a few crackers two types of rather solid or stale bread cheese and a type of ham. This was before one of VA's sleeper flights we were warned at check in that a hot meal would not be served to us as we were located at the front on the upper class cabin how you are supposed to exist on this baffles me. The drinks are pretty poor as well only two white wines on offer tasted both - in my opinion undrinkable went for the 'champagne' a californian sparkling wine. did manage one glass but resisted going back for another. The staff pointed out that there was only one diet coke left they would not have any more until Monday (this was Thursday afternoon). In all the lounge was very crowded by the time the flight was called. If part of upper class fares are to cover the lounge then this is not good value.

At that time it was the best South America lounge and was used by Star Alliance (Lufthansa United and of course Varig). It was an outstanding lounge with separated areas for first class and business class showers smoke room plenty of reading materials excellent beverages and high quality food. In 2008 Varig went out of business and GOL acquires Varig routes mileage program and VIP lounges. Strangely as GOL uses the Terminal 1 they continued using these lounge in Terminal 2 so it is impossible to board a GOL flight and use its own lounge. The lounge is used by a lot of airlines (Lufthansa United US Airways Diners Club card menbers among others).

Plenty of salad options and quiche or soup but plates are a bit on the small side. Alcoholic drinks available on a self-service basis but it appeared a glass of fizz was available if you asked for it (I saw it being carried out to people). The big drawback about this lounge is that it doesn't have enough power points. The only ones I could find were situated next to seats right round the L shaped lounge to the left. Also it's not clear to passengers where the toilets are if you miss them on the way in. Loads of people are left wandering aimlessly around the computer area only to have walk back all the way round to the entry/exit. Signs? The coffee is still excellent from the machine - why it's so foul onboard Club Europe is anyone's guess. My only other moan is that unless you're a frequent flyer from LGW it's not clear how far the gate is from the lounge. No map on the mobile app nor anything in the Highlife magazine.

I have used this lounge on several occasions earlier in the day when it is sparkling clean with plenty of food and drinks choices.

qatar-airways,/lounge-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways Business Class Lounge,ANDREW WARD,NA,2007-03-11,Used business lounge in Qatar's new premium terminal in transit between London and Singapore and return. First point - coach from plane drops people at normal (old) terminal first - I thought there would be a separate coach for business class - we nearly got off at the wrong terminal as the information given is not that clear. New terminal is very impressive visually and well maintained. Reading material limited (on way back through early in the morning there wasn't any at all.) Would prefer a self service bar for wine/beers etc - there was a somewhat limited range of wines in the fridges available and no menus/drinks lists. Didn't look for or use PC so can't comment on Internet access. No announcements made staff wander round giving flight information and you can be sat some way away from screens giving flight info. Staff friendly enough but didn't volunteer any assistance. Given limited time available didn't have time to eat but there seemed to be a good variety of hot food available. Overall a very nice lounge but with a few minor improvements could be even better.,QATAR AIRWAYS BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,NA,Business Class,NA,NA,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,0

Seating is not not that plentiful or fantastic either. The complimentary food on offer are small muffins pretzels and apples which coffee orange or cranberry juice. Drinks must be purchased but they do give you 2 drink vouchers which is 1 extra to what you get at other Admirals Lounge in other airports.

The best you can do is hug one of the little chairs in the front room and use earplugs.

A very tranquil and peaceful area British Airways has made sure there are almost too many staff members so that while food is prepared the lounge is cleaned etc. there are also staff available to help with anything you need. When dinner is available the quality and choice of food is fantastic and there is a wide selection of snacks available upon request when in search of something lighter. The wifi works well and there are also 3 computers in the back. A small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax. The only negative to this lounge is that the spa/shower rooms are not in the Lou ge so to take a shower I had to walk across the terminal and into the Business class lounge but it's a small terminal so it's not that bad.

air-france,/lounge-reviews/air-france,Air France (skyteam) Business Class Lounge - Frankfurt Main Airport,J Ho,United States,2013-07-07,Kind of a fail. This lounge is dated worn and desperately needs air conditioning. The leather chairs are worn and dirty. The wi-fi is slower than the general free Frankfurt Airport wi-fi and just outside the lounge is a long hallway with recliners for regular passengers to lounge in comfort. The only places to sit in the lounge for lounge customers are upright chairs. Additionally there are no bathrooms within the lounge and if you need those facilities you are directed to leave the lounge and go down the hall to use public bathrooms. Given all of this I'm not really sure why you would choose to come in to this lounge unless you would like to eat some of the simple packaged cookies or the cheese that is sitting out in warm temperatures. Very little in the way of hard liquor. No red wine on display and a single white wine in the refrigerator. There was a sparkling wine in an ice bucket that was untouched. I found this whole wine selection to be odd. Air France needs to spend a little effort at improving this lounge in my opinion.,AIR FRANCE (SKYTEAM) BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Frankfurt Main Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,2,3,2,2,0,2,2,0

qatar-airways,/lounge-reviews/qatar-airways,"Qatar Airways ""al Mourjan"" Business Class Lounge - Doha Airport",M Clarke,Saudi Arabia,2015-02-21,First things first - to go to the loo when you arrive (not an uncommon destination I think) you have to go up a long ramp and then down another long ramp diagonally opposite then double back on yourself and walk another 30/40 feet; this is bonkers. Every time I arrive here I try a different seat - there is not a single comfortable seat in the place; there are a couple of nice leather sofas that look really nice but I've never been able to get near them because they're always 'full'. There are weird modern seats (very 60s - they look great) that are too low and you have to virtually lie in them or odd seats (that are at least higher) with big 'conservatory type' surrounds but they really aren't that comfortable. Then there are the seats beside the very fancy looking computer monitors that are at a completely unrealistic angle for use but although these seats look vaguely comfortable it's like sitting in a corridor. There isn't a scrap of carpet anywhere that I can see. There's what looks like a nice restaurant about a quarter of a mile away (seems like with the up and down ramps) and several tea and coffee stations and then at the opposite end to the restaurant is a deli. The old Ppremium terminal at Doha was lovely - nice people would pass by and ask if you'd like a sandwich and bring it to you with a glass of something. This place is absolutely crawling with really lovely helpful staff but they don't seem to actually do anything. Worst of all there is NO SPA free or otherwise unless you check into a hotel no hairdresser either. For a lounge purporting to be world class this is way off I think. I would happily pay for a massage and a shampoo any day of the week but there's nothing. I spoke to a member of staff this evening and was bemoaning the fact that you have to zigzag all over the place to get anywhere and that I loved the old lounge and she said she couldn't count the number of people who had said that. I love Qatar Airways but this lounge is a bit of a fail for me - a great shame because I spend about 4 hours here every couple of months.,"QATAR AIRWAYS ""AL MOURJAN"" BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW",Doha Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,1,5,4,4,4,4,5,0

We tried both Sky Clubs on the B Concourse. We spent most of our time in the lounge near B25. The place was packed but we did find two chairs. The place was packed with people many of whom were yapping on their cellphones. A fair number of families some with babies who were shrieking and children who used the lounge like a gym. The snack offerings were minimal some veggies cookies pretzels etc. The espresso machine took too long to dispense a simple cup of regular coffee (no airpots).

royal-jordanian-airlines,/lounge-reviews/royal-jordanian-airlines,"Royal Jordanian Airlines Business Class ""crown"" Lounge - Amman Queen Alia Airport",I Dror,NA,2009-01-20,Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. Newly built (open for about 4 months at the time) large and boasting high-end features such as bedrooms along with high-end features one can expect to find in a flagship lounge. We had a long transfer at AMM (originally scheduled for 12 hours which ended out being 19 hours due to RJ technical problems) so were looking forward to a good lounge to make the wait less taxing. The first glitch occurred when staff at the counter attempted to deny us entry to the lounge saying that we should only come to the lounge 2-3hrs before our flight. When we pointed out to them the complete absurdity of this request given that we were on transit between two RJ flights and that this goes against the Oneworld regulations the matter was settled. However this was a poor welcome if we ever saw one. The so called bedrooms are a paid service at $50 for the first four hours then $20 per hour. Fair enough though a bit pricey for a long stay (and a bit cheeky to price the first segment at 4 hours when they try to deny entry only 2 hours before the flight). We had a look at a room which included a double bed shower and a cupboard (some 25 sqm I would say). We went to confirm that we wanted the room (was traveling with my wife pregnant of 6 months at the time) and were told that the rooms are considered single rooms and under no circumstances can be let out to more than one person. Again I stress that the room clearly had a double bed but we failed to get anywhere with this and were told that this is a clear order from “senior RJ management”. Why RJ went to the trouble of building and designing such rooms is questionable given this policy but at least this should be clearly flagged on their website when they talk of this so that other couples do not plan to book this service and make alternative arrangements. The lounge offers quiet rooms with some 6-7 armchairs in a relatively dark and quiet area adjacent to the bedrooms. However we found these very uncomfortable to attempt to sleep on and ended up leaving the lounge to a nearby hotel to get some sleep. In the morning there was a nice yet modest buffet (cold items only). In the evening there were three hot dishes. None too appealing but ok to snack if hungry. A separate staffed bar in a separate corner with less options that one finds in most other large lounges but large enough to cover basic requests. Infrastructure impressive and clearly RJ invested a lot in creating the lounge. However it is a bad sign that only 4 months after opening there are already issues with core features. For example there are some 12 individual sofas with personalized TV screens and high-end headsets. When we tried to use them we found the volume level unbearably loud. We tried another station. Same thing. When we asked the RJ staff we were told that all the TVs were like this and there is nothing to be done except to hold the headsets some 50cm away from the ears. Personally I find this pathetic and a miserable design/execution of a key feature of a lounge. I could go on but I think the message is clear - Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. My gut feeling is that with time as the new furniture and excitement wears down this will rapidly become a B-rated lounge at best.,"ROYAL JORDANIAN AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS ""CROWN"" LOUNGE REVIEW",Amman Queen Alia Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I looked around for a bar and finding nothing but a few oddments on a makeshift bar area asked a staff member for help. To my great surprise I was told there was no wine no gin and precious little of anything else! The staff member was curt and unhelpful to the point of being rude walking away while I asked the questions - after six weeks in a country of courteous people this discourtesy astounded me. My husband asked a senior staff member if we could have a glass of wine and was told that the airline was having difficulty getting alcohol through customs. A further problem was that the announcements in the lounge were virtually inaudible so keeping an eye on the departure board was essential.

Reasonably comfortable place with good views over airport. What seems somewhat mean and petty is that on checking in to the lounge you are given a voucher for just one alcoholic beverage. From a European perspective this is strange - especially since at AA Admirals Lounge in Heathrow there's an open bar. Most customers in this situation in my experience do not come into these lounges to drink the bar dry - but the option of a second drink without paying more would be nice - especially after buying an expensive business class ticket. On my way back to London through DFW used the smaller British Airways lounge and they have no one drink voucher policy. It's a pity AA do this - as their service from LHR to DFW is a great business class product in the air in the new 777 ER - probably best transatlantic.,AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,NA,Business Class,NA,NA,4,5,5,2,2,4,5,4,1

Food and beverages on a par with existing buffet-style business lounges which are very good. Good business area and nice childrens area. Where this lounge really fails is the SiX Senses Spa which is shambolic. I have just queued for 65 minutes for a shower. They had no waitlist so you had to just grab a seat and wait (could not nip out to get food). They had a booking system for spa treatments but the earliest slot was over two hours later so most people could not avail of this. I use their First lounge normally as Gold Elite so the experience going through Abu Dhabi today is significantly worse than before. Lot of unhappy people here.

Very disappointing. All the newspapers were in Arabic and no magazines. Warm soft drinks stacked on a table and loud children everywhere. There are two rooms one with a nice view of the runways that was jam packed and another which is rather grim that was also pretty full. The floors are tile and echo sounds horribly. Some sandwiches and finger foods and a kettle with hot water. No television or flight monitors in room number two. The staff were indifferent and uninterested in the passengers. Frankly waiting in the main terminal in the food court area offered more options for food/beverages and was just as comfortable as the lounge.

I was publicly humiliated with his loud out burst for what I thought to be a small crime! The staff member was rude arrogant and had zero customer service skills I would like to name and shame but feel this would lower me to his level. On our quick exit I did point out to him that I had seen numerous other clients taking stock from the lounge but this observation was ignored.

american-airlines,/lounge-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines Admirals Club Lounge - Toronto Pearson Airport,Scott Bingham,United States,2012-01-23,The Admirals Club is not really a first class lounge. It's only offered to first class passengers if you're traveling overseas. I was traveling first class Toronto to Chicago to San Jose - and they wouldn't let me enter. Out of curiosity I bought a 24 hour pass for $50 to see what was so special about this lounge. One would expect an airlines flagship lounge service to be very nice. The Admiral Lounge only offers crackers and cookies and there is no self-service bar. If you want anything more you have to pay for it. The bar is tended and they only offer cheap drinks and poor quality wine and beer. You have to pay for anything that actually tastes good. From the outside the doors leading to the lounges looks like heaven awaits on the other side. Don't be fooled. Amongst other things the staff is too preoccupied with their own personal concerns talking amongst themselves - usually about some negative aspect of their job.

continental-airlines,/lounge-reviews/continental-airlines,Continental Airlines Business Class (servisair) Lounge - Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,A Thorne,United Kingdom,2011-06-07,A substandard lounge. Most importantly for me the lounge only provides access to the Free Terminal Internet rather than a dedicated service. This service does not allow access to corporate networks so I could not synchronize my email before the flight. Further the service was so slow I could not even access my personal Gmail. I left my hotel this morning anticipating that I would pick up breakfast in the lounge. The breakfast options were Crisps and a dry biscuit bread - below expectation and below the competitive benchmark. The only newspapers available were a Jewish / Israeli weekly in English and only other Hebrew and Middle Eastern publications. Nothing in English German or Dutch. It was peak hour yet half the lounge was closed off creating a shortage of seating. For tea there was no milk available just powdered creamer. There was one hot food facility available. it was empty and appeared to be out of use.

The club is larger than I expected, and even at 7:30 AM, there was ample and comfortable seating. The large windows look out onto a busy tarmac, so there were interesting views.
