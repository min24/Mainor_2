Clean cabin comfortable seats (always cramped in CRJ) efficient and attractive cabin crew announcements made in Slovenian and pretty good English and German. Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly.

However, check-in staff were friendly and quickly got through the line. A full flight so boarding was a tad chaotic moreso due to passengers not obeying the gate announcements. The flight closed up 25 mins after scheduled takeoff time (8.35pm) and consequently the pilot informed us we missed our slot and could not be airborne until 9.50pm Luckily, the situation improved and we took off at 9.30pm arriving in Dublin only 15 mins behind schedule.

I got the 22.15 flight from Heathrow to Athens on the 13th and then the 09.15 flight to Chania on the 14th. At Heathrow the flight was over-subscribed so they were offering people a large sum of money a night in a hotel and the flight the following day - I wish they would have asked me! Then they were asking people to (voluntarily) check their hand luggage into the hold - so I offered because of the long wait I had at ATH! The flight was smooth the hot meal was served early on into the flight and we landed slightly early. The only criticisms I have is that the seats are a little hard and the cabin was stiflingly hot and very bright! Great to have a free meal though. On arrival at Athens at 03.40 I collected my hand luggage and checked into an airport lounge before my flight to Chania - which was well worth the Â£20! Flight to Chania was a bit poorly organised but landed on time. Return flights were also very good and a mercifully shorter stop over in Athens!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,4,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

I booked tickets several weeks in advance and got a good value flight. The website was clear with what one needed to pay extra. With the flight only an hour, I didn't want to pay extra for premium economy seats that would've guaranteed a more comfortable flight for a tall person like me (2m). Yet, I hoped that if the flight wasn't fully booked the staff would be flexible and allow me to sit in an exit row. Years of flying have continued to confirm to me that if you want service and flexibility, go with the ""legacy"" airlines, as opposed to the ""low-cost"" ones where you have to pay for everything. Once again, I politely asked and the Aer Lingus staff happily obliged - on both trips. As such, I was very pleased for the quality I got on this short-haul flight within the UK. I've not flown Aer Lingus long-haul, so I can't comment, but based on this experience I would be ready to try Aer Lingus transatlantically if they offered a good price and connection.",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy,LHR to BHD,9,4,5,NA,NA,4,NA,4,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,R Williams,United States,2015-05-10,I traveled from Munich to Boston in early January 2015. The experience at Munich airport was very poor particularly the passport control line which was 45 minutes of unrestrained and uncontrolled pushing and shoving. Probably not Aer Lingus' fault but still a poor start. I had paid for a business class ticket over the internet. Did not find out until getting on the plane that the first part of the trip (Munich to Dublin) was economy as there are no business class seats on the plane. Typical economy experience. The actual business class portion of the trip (Dublin to Boston) was excellent. However the fare (which looked reasonable initially) in retrospect seemed far too high given that 3 hours of the 9 hour trip were actually not business class. I had a medical issue that caused me to book the business class ticket so I was really horrified at the unexpected 3 hours in economy which I had bought the business class ticket specifically to avoid.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,4,4,0,NA,NA,3,0

The other male crew member was 'too busy' to bring an infant lap belt once the doors had closed and I was offered neither a drink or a meal.

In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience. I think the airlines greatest weakness is its Moscow hub. The trans-atlantic schedules require long layovers.

Inflight entertainment was nothing special. It was only the inflight map. The cabin crew and the service were very good we had a sandwich which was bigger than some other airlines with a choice of complimentary drinks for both legs.

Food service on this flight was much better than on my previous flights with Aeromexico in Clase Premier. Cabin crew were excellent and very professional. The purser knew each of the business class passenger's last names (there were 16 of us) and she was always around to see if she was needed. I fell asleep and she left me a drink and peanuts for when I woke up. Aeromexico staff is usually just OK - they are efficient but are cold and tend to disappear into the galley afterwards.

I saw one lady bring on a case large shopper and two large plastic bags! I had checked in a bag and placed a duty free bag in the overhead bin asked to remove it and place it at my feet so a passenger could place a large case in there - flatly refused.

The legroom on business class required my wife to climb over the center console to get out of her seat.

aerosur,/airline-reviews/aerosur,Aerosur customer review,K Beard,NA,2009-08-23,Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled.

Inbound flight is a redeye.

We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF.

aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,J Fox,Ireland,2013-11-04,JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop. Great job all round.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,Nick Serpell,United Kingdom,2013-11-04,DUB-ORD and return. Both flights on Airbus 330-300. Seating seemed tight in both width and legroom compared with other airlines we have used. We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer. Overall it was as good as economy gets on European airlines although not anything like as good as the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Would fly with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Separate check-in for business class disturbed by allowing economy class pax using the biz-class check-in counter. However correct check in though a bit stressful as the airport and particularly the flight to Moscow was crowded. Flight HAN-SVO overbooked and roughly 20 of 34 seats in business were economy pax being upgraded to business. FA managed to accommodate all additional pax. Access to lounges in HAN SVO and VIE went smoothly. Invitation cards issues at check in and at transfer desk in SVO. In SVO you are free to choose which of 4-5 Aeroflot lounges you want access to. FA staff polite at a first glance a bit too firm and not truly kind. Seats are good. The lie flat on A330-300 is a bit angled but sleep-able. Food present in good quantities and good though not sophisticated. Drinks are good. Champagne/juice offered 2-3 times at take-off. Disappointment is that after departure and until you get any drink they go and take orders which complicate things and the serving of the first drinks happens only 1.5-2 hours after departure. No drink wagons everything is brought by hand to individuals. Food is good a bit tasteless 3 options. Refills or modifications are made possible. FA-English skills very poor. Entertainment acceptable but earphones are collected an hour prior to landing. Altogether a bit rough and robust service but no major faults apart for very slow 1st service on board.

Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved.

All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard. All in all I would very highly recommend Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel to anyone.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

There was only one check-in agent for the entire flight. Venice Marco Polo airport is a nightmare to depart from as there are very few security desks and lots of flights. Queue for security was appalling and stretched out of the departure building! I stood in line for almost 2 hours and saw several flights between different groups of passengers from various countries. Small children and elderly people were very upset. As I stood in line my name was called for final boarding. I only just made it to the gate and saw that 3 other passengers were denied boarding. I was bussed out to the flight alone on a transfer bus. Flight was pretty full and departure delayed 45 mins - not the fault of Aer Lingus though. The seats were fine if cramped.

aeroflot-russian-airlines,/airline-reviews/aeroflot-russian-airlines,Aeroflot Russian Airlines customer review,Andy Williams,Spain,2011-07-31,Aeroflot are not a bad airline though I do feel that for the most part it's fleet and it's service offerings are several years behind those of the competition. I flew Barcelona - Moscow and was swayed by the price. The first leg was in a fairly new airbus A319 with comfortable seats and a clean interior. The only thing of note was the general demeanour of the crew who did nothing to make me feel welcome and were almost hostile in their dealing with the passengers. The pre-flight safety demonstration was multi-language and clear and I found most of the crew spoke English with no problem. In flight refreshments offered were a variety of fruit juices only. Alcoholic drinks are not available though after almost pleading I did get a diet coke. The meal was among the worst I have tasted in my many years of flying. The second leg Moscow-Shanghai was a real eye opener. The Aeroflot website shows that this flight is operated using one of its newer A330 aircraft with in seat entertainment but checking the entertainment listings I found that they been updated for 4 months. Not important of course but an indication of the haphazard approach to service. When I actually boarded I found that the flight is actually operated by (and has always been) by one of the airlines older Boeing 767 aircraft. Aeroflot Boeing 767's are much older than the rest of their fleet and come with little in the way of comfort or amenities. None of our seats or others around us would recline more than 2 or 3 cms. Walking up and down it was clear that no seats offered any noticeable ability to recline. They also had no adjustable headrests. All in all it was a very uncomfortable 11 hour flight. Added to the discomfort was the fact that there was no personal entertainment offered. The aircraft used the old system of large screens placed above the seats around every 10 rows. There were movies played - in Russian often with English subtitles however the quality of the screens and the placement made it an unpleasant experience. Once again the refreshments and food were very disappointing. The omelette breakfast was the only edible thing I had all other food was very poor. The staff on this second flight were more attentive than those previously. My return journey was merely a reverse of the outbound - equally as uncomfortable and equally poor food. The only significant difference was that I had coffee poured over me by one of the cabin crew who gave me a towel to dry my now soaking trousers but still failed to apologize or help in any other way and finally they lost my luggage and once located failed to get it to me for almost a week.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0

It's a different story on their internal and regional flights. I booked on-line for the short hop return from Bishkek to Almaty. It seemed like a good idea at the time but proved to be a disaster. The airline changed their schedule without informing me their records apparently said that they had ""tried to contact me"" - I'm not even sure how. I turned up at the airport and waited for 5 hours assuming that it had simply been delayed for that time only to find out that they had moved me not to that flight but to one 20 hours earlier. The Air Astana agent acted as though he hadn't seen an e-ticket before claimed I hadn't paid for the outward journey or maybe hadn't paid at all - really any excuse to not allow me onto the plane. I had no alternative but to go back to Bishkek and travel overland the next day - all at my own expense of course. The return flight had been similarly moved but a local agent helped me out to properly arrange that one and got a refund for the outward journey. I complained to Air Astana as my non-arrival had seriously thrown out the plans of my hosts in Almaty not just mine. No answer. I complained again only to receive a fob off reply that they regretted this but they weren't going to do anything further about it and hoped that I would fly with them again: I doubt that very much.

Even with Altitude status - so I can get a bullhead seat - the direct flight has appalling seat width and recline. Adding in extra economy rows so a few ""Premium Economy"" seats (is that a joke AC? ) can be jammed into this flying nightmare makes the matter worse. The 3-4-3 seats per row is a fine example of pure greed. Even the new business configuration is dire - what was wrong with the pods? I much prefer them to this arrangement.  My advice: take a connecting flight on a different plane type with a sensible seat configuration. Inflight meals, entertainment and staff are usual AC standards - nothing special but getting better.

The following day our 6 hours flight to Paris by itself was OK with various standards. Aircraft (777-300) with a clean cabin without decoration the blue colour of seats being the only colour. The seats were standard without footrests. A good VOD system with recent movies especially for French speaking passengers. This is for the good side but when you see the fancy earphones handed over you will regret not to have yours with you. The weak side starts with no newspapers or magazines available. Cabin crew obviously well trained and working efficiently. I am sorry that uniforms are so plain. No efforts from attendants to look like attendants and participate to the dream of flying like many other airlines. Meals were frankly just edible. A small salad where I am still looking for dressing chicken with bulgur (totally bland) and a so-called chocolate cake retaining from chocolate only the colour! A standard rate for the table wine offered graciously and for the rolls quite correct for an airline. A bad rate for the low quality plastic cutlery. It seems North American carriers do like plastic very much. Before landing we had a slice of cake (good) with hot drinks served in a tumbler. All in all we were expecting more from an Airline claiming to be for the 5th time the best airline in North America.

Lots of water juice and ice cream between meals. Lunch better than many offerings in other airlines' economy cabins. Wine quality well above average. Air Canada seem to have finally fixed their often faulty IFE system. Plenty of music and film choices though latest film selections could have been better. The downside?

air-berlin,/airline-reviews/air-berlin,Air Berlin customer review,N Werner,Switzerland,2010-07-26,ZRH-TXL-ZRH. Flight was â¬ 199 incl and much cheaper than Swiss. Online Check-in efficient and was at the gate quite quickly. Air Berlin use the B gates at ZRH which are easy to get to but once you are there you cannot do much as there are only 2-3 shops. Boarding is also by bus which is rather inconvenient. TXL is probably the cutest airport I have seen. It is so tiny and efficient for an airport. The distance between the gate and exit is probably not more than 30m. Flight to TXL was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and flight back to ZRH was delayed due to ATC regulations. Inflight service is rather simple with free drinks and a choice of crackers or a chocolate bar. Service to TXL was friendly and efficient but the return flight had a very arrogant male FA on board which spoilt the experience.

No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger.

Overall experience was positive with genuinely helpful and kind cabin crew on all legs decent IFE selection and all flights arriving on time even after one was delayed so they could find a bigger plane to accommodate a previous cancellation! All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious.

Not enough staff around to deal with self check-in problems and only 2 check in desks available - the queue was long and slow! On board in Economy seat pitch and leg room was pretty good for 2 adults and 1 child. Everything else distinctly average. Return leg Vancouver to LHR Premium Economy: Self check in worked fine but bag drop slow and everyone in the same queue with not one AC rep on the airport floor in sight. Seats in Premium OK. Flight delayed for around an hour due to them being unable to get the door closed. Inflight service really poor - food was absolutely dire and meal of choice had run out even before we'd left the ground. Flight attendants completely lacking in attentiveness - no rubbish collection despite me having a nice tidy little bag full of bits which I deliberately left in sight. Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed.

TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment.

air-china,/airline-reviews/air-china,Air China customer review,G Chris,United Kingdom,2015-04-16,LHR-PEK r/t in First Class. Used miles for this trip as CA First was 75000 vs 100000 for VS Upper Class to PVG. Overall it was OK. As a Star Alliance carrier we used United First lounge at LHR T2. 777 was clean/new bed and pyjamas comfortable amenity kit akin to US carriers' international Business class. Food was pretty average (JAL economy on subsequent flight was better tasting) wine list ok but limited whisky etc. I avoided the instant coffee. Cabin nice and quiet only 4 pax in First both ways. Glad we weren't in fully-crammed Business class. Staff on LHR-PEK were decent but hard to get a smile return from PEK-LHR food was much better and FAs much friendlier. As others have noted IFE is on-demand but somewhat limited English options. I know it's Air China but they should take a page from other Asian airlines e.g. JAL who have tons of international film/TV options. First Class lounge in Beijing is pretty poor: self-serve bar but no ice or lemon etc so don't even bother trying to make a gin & tonic just pour yourself a glass of warm white Chinese wine and whimper in a corner. Beijing Capital Airport is a beautiful Norman Foster building but don't ever transit internationally in Beijing. Unlike pretty much every airport on Earth you have to go through Chinese immigration just for connecting flights (it's a separate queue but still). We had a full two hour connection and spent nearly 1h45m just waiting to get the passport stamp to then go straight back through security. Incredibly inefficient and infuriating. No special/fast track for First class and no staff seemed to care that the delays were making everyone miss their long-haul connections. On balance CA First is slightly better than BA Club but below VS Upper Class. However for 25k fewer miles than VS to Asia it felt like a fair trade.

A nightmare that even embarrasses the flight crew to apologise for it. I am a 100K Aeroplan member and this dreadful experience led me to avoid Air Canada since. With other airlines upgrading their already superior products one is left to wonder why Air Canada has chosen to downgrade theirs. I can only imagine the plight in economy where an extra seat has been jammed into each row. On a positive note I have discovered the advantages offered by the competition - of which there is plenty.

The new AC high density 777-300 on the YVR-LHR route is awful In business the Pods are gone. The seat pitch is much reduced. The seat is poorly constructed and difficult to change position. The table is bizarre - spring loaded and very difficult to put back. The lie flat is not comfortable and has no privacy. You have to climb over the aisle passenger to get out. This is a serious serious downgrade and I cant see how they can compete against CX on the HKG route or BA to LHR. In economy its 3-4-3 which looked awful. Premium economy is 2-4-2. the centre rows look very cramped. I should add that the lounge at LHR is the SAS lounge which has very limited range of food/drinks.

I got a half-priced business class deal this time so I tried it. Overall: I think it really did not mean much unless you are saving up miles with them.

No friendly name calls like United (they don't even greet you by name) and they skipped me for drinks and hand towels because I took a nap.

FAs were wonderful - a senior crew - very welcoming helpful and chatty. Likewise the pilot was great fully informing and updating passengers of a slight delay due to a technical glitch and later alerting us to a great view of the southern tip of Greenland when we flew over it. After an equally long flight from Mumbai in the rather cramped seating on a Swiss A330 this flight was a spacious delight. Food was OK AVOD was good with a wide selection of movies music and TV shows. The FA selling duty free items undertook the extra effort to locate what I wanted to buy when he could not find it on the cart. Not a commonly expressed sentiment but the crew on this Air Canada flight went above and beyond the call in providing a level of service seldom encountered in the economy cabin!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

It is cheap and that explains everything bad service bad food old planes and non existent IFE. There was no inflight entertainment between PEK and DEL. Soon after the meal they shove a wrapped sandwich in your hand as a snack for later on. Air China did it to us twice and it is a common practice as we found out from other people that they cancel or delay a flight and pile up passengers in one plane. The result is chaos in PEK. I fly frequently and my experience was the worst. First time I flew with them because of price and second time because I had to book a seat very late and could not find another airline. Regarding food I do not think that Air China realises that there are people of other cultures fly with them. Same is true about hotels in Beijing.

I know flights are going to be delayed especially into and out of Beijing but the airlines need to be straight with us about what was happening.

Not even a bag of peanuts offered on a 4.5 hour flight free water offered hourly however. I have no objection personally to flying 'cattle class' when I have paid accordingly. This is outright highway robbery at over $300. one way on what I thought was a 'legacy' carrier. The cabin was overheated with no apparent way to improve the temperature or comfort level. Two lavs at rear of cabin appeared insufficient given the projected passenger load. The staff appeared eager but inept in so many ways.

A man with a flag rounded up all the MEL pax and herded us to the baggage claim area then to immigration. Bit of a queue there. So after about a 750m walk arrived back at the same gate same plane.

Was interested to see how this new airline looks up close and was surprised at how awful the FA uniforms look in person. The colours are not flattering to any skin or hair colour the bowler hats are ridiculous and they just look downright cheap. The skinny hairbands don't help either. The FA's are very young and void of personality they have no senior co-workers to emulate and it shows. They look lost. They hardly spoke to the passengers and I heard one passenger comment as we left the aircraft that was the quietest flight crew they ever experienced. The aircraft is bare bones the bulkhead doesn't even go up to the ceiling so you are constantly looking into the galley. The seating is so tight a 29 inch pitch it should be illegal in the name of safety. Got off the flight and on to an Air Canada mainline flight to Vancouver. What a difference! The FA's may be older but they look experienced professional and confident and seem to be enjoying their jobs. I guess it's true you get what you pay for and Rouge is paying peanuts to these kids.

Air Canada's inflight entertainment is the best I have encountered. The service staff were young and correct. The only part of this AC experience that was poor as it has been on other trips is the check-in procedure. It was chaotic with most passengers not certain which queue to join (Check-in Bag Drop Ticketing Self-Check-in) even after they checked themselves in. AC needs to fix this.

Chose them because they had a good name did not realise it was not Air Canada and secondly price. Really good price for this time of year. The cabin crew were young I like their trendy uniform. I think the return journey crew were better than the outbound only because going they were asked questions about travel connections and should the passenger pick up their luggage or would it be transferred they did not know the answer. Also I think the return journey at night is easier for the crew because people sleep. I found the crew very attentive and very friendly they did not forgot requests from passengers. The downside of the flight - no duty free I did not realise this on my outward journey. The inflight entertainment I had read you could purchase a tablet for $10 which I did on my outward journey - the tablet kept freezing whilst I watched a film. I think it took me 3 hrs to watch the film. Other passengers also had problems. I did not purchase the tablet on the return journey but the same thing happened but they made an announcement that they rebuffed the machine and I think that did work but they didn't do this on the outward journey. The food was ok although I am not a fan of airline food and would of preferred a salad or a sandwich. These days it is hard for crew with food requirements there were a lot of different diets and it was not made easy when the passengers moved seats but they handled it very well. I would definitely travel with this airline again. My seats were fine I had leg room. Yes it is no frills but not everyone can afford luxury travel and also don't always rely on bad reviews.

Leg room is ok but I found the seat was getting uncomfortable after a few hours. Other aspects left me wondering how this airline is classed as a 4 star airline. Check-in was quick but with no smiles. Even one of the staff at the gate was almost rude about the darkened spectacles I have to wear. On board one of the cabin attendants shrugged her shoulders when I asked for a blanket their was only a pillow on my seat and she was chewing gum whilst handing out breakfast. At least I did get a blanket after asking one of the other crew members. No hot or cold towels only one drink at a time show how this airline skimps on the things others provide as a norm. The food is poor as well. My special meal was provided but it was tasteless. 'Continental breakfast' comprised a small muffin and a small container of fruit - insufficient for a flight of 9 hours duration. The AVOD was ok with a wide choice available.

No real place to put it with the exception that it came with a cover and you could sort of hang it from the seat back in front of you where in other airlines the entertainment was supposed to go. Two problems with this. 1) the earphone cable has to stretch over the tray and if you're using that for a drink or food the risk of knocking something off of that with the earphone cable rises sharply and of more concern 2) if the plane hits some unexpected turbulence all of a sudden you've got iPads flying everywhere - at least far more than you would on an AC flt.

The short haul aircraft was suitable for the length of flight but the long haul was pretty primitive! Old looking plane some bleached flickering unviewable screens dotted about for those that speak Spanish! The food was completely inedible! I'm not overly picky when it comes to airline food but outgoing was a rubbery pesto pasta with a sickly synthetic mousse type thing for pudding and coming back was a burnt chewy dollop of ground beef with hard rice! There was a little cake square that looked nice but unfortunately was dry as a bone! There was a lot of food wastage. Even the fruit juices taste like the cheapest juice money can buy. Flying direct with Virgin is more than worth the couple of hundred pounds extra to be honest! The Madrid to Gatwick leg was delayed due to a broken down aircraft plus offloading luggage of some no-shows so all in all that was our first and last connecting flight!

The planes are dated there is no space between you and the seat in front. The seats were so uncomfortable. The staff acted as though passengers were an inconvenience. On a 10.5 hour flight the so called 'all inclusive' food and drink meant you were given one small plastic cup with your meal then 7 hours later a disgusting pie thing. I asked for water as soon as I got on and was told to wait for 2 hours. Perhaps Cuba Direct were at fault by telling me that it was similar to a long haul Virgin flight.

The plane was an extremely old 767 and besides the refurbished carpet and seats everything inside was old and run- down. The overhead compartment are probably from the 1990s as I forgot the last time I saw limited luggage space like that. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable with no entertainment whatsoever (there is the option to rent an iPad for a fee). The flight was a red-eye of around 5hrs but half the time the cabin lights were on as the crew came around trying to sell food. This was very disruptive to rest and added to the general discomfort of the flight experience. The crew were young and ""hip"" looking and I must say they were friendly. However they seemed inexperienced and newly hired. There was a passenger who lay on her seat and stretched her legs into the aisle throughout the flight. This was during take off and landing and none of the crew said anything about having the arm rest down or the fact that her legs were obstructing the aisle. I am sure this violates various national and international safety regulations and the crew did not seem to mind.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,C Chan,Singapore,2015-05-06,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,5,1,4,5,NA,NA,3,0

air-india,/airline-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,Suhail Shafi,United States,2014-10-22,New Delhi to Srinagar and back. While in the past I have had reservations about flying Air India I found their overall performance better than I had previously anticipated and expected. There are two newer perks with flying Air India. The first is the new Terminal 3 at New Delhi which is modern efficient and clean a huge improvement over the previous Delhi airport. Flying in an out is a breeze with the newer terminal offering a large selection of amenities. The second is the membership of Air India with the Star Alliance making earning frequent flier points possible. The DEL-SXR sector was served by an older A320 - comfortable seats in one class configuration with no special amenities in an older layout. Service consisted of hot beverages with biscuits - not exemplary but adequate for a short flight. Srinagar had been affected by floods at the time of my departure so the Air India staff graciously allowed us to leave the city three days before our scheduled departure. The plane was a A330 with modern seats offering excellent legroom with tasty refreshments. The aircraft sported a modern looking interior with restrooms under the main cabin - something I had not seen before - with no inflight entertainment but perfectly adequate for a short flight. Air India may be one of the more underrated airlines out there.

No IFE. FAs spoke reasonable English and were friendly. No safety demonstration and the overhead bins were just overhead shelves.

Due to the air conditioning the cabin was full of fog. There was a lot of condensation. No food for 1.5 hours flight to Pyong Yang. Check in at Pyong Yang was easy because there were not many flights at all. Departure and arrival are sharing same hall. One room for everything but very efficient.

In both cases the crew did the job professionally although the service in economy is limited to a drink and some biscuits. On return was upgraded to ""Premium"" which is not much different (same seat) but includes a decent cold light meal and Champagne.

At Chennai airport for an A320 flight they had only 3 operating check-in counters whilst planes from other airlines had 5-6 counters. This led to long delays and lengthy queues. The Air India ground staff at New Delhi airport seemed to be helpful in helping the passengers getting to their connecting flights. The Dreamliner for the Delhi - Sydney leg seemed to be a good one. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to 3 stewards reporting sick at the last moment and they had to bring in replacement crew. The announcements were spotty and not easily forthcoming. The food served was tiny in portion with only one round of drinks offered for a 12.5 hour journey. The IFE was limited but worked. The toilets didn't have any amenities for a long-haul flight.

Booked 9 months in advance to get a good price for the peak season and felt it was good value because everything was perfectly fine with the Dreamliner (seat pitch cleanliness meals staff service with a sense of humour at times good on-time performance IFE). The domestic sector was served by an older single-class A320 which was far inferior to the Dreamliner but the staff were good both ways and served hot meals during the 2 1/2 hr flight. Cannot fault Air India in any way and loved the Bollywood films onboard the 787. However the transit arrangements at Delhi International Airport are a nightmare which easily bring the spirits down after a good flight. Air India management should work closely with the authorities to make transit arrangements flexible because their European flights (LHR CDG FRA) as well as Melbourne/Sydney seem to depart within an hour.

Got a very good deal back in May which was only Â£100 more than my usual Etihad economy trip in economy for the dates. There were some good points to the trip but several bad points to mention. All flights on time except last leg back to Heathrow that was compensated though by my bag being first off. Lounge quality was varied which I'll review separately. LHR-Delhi on B777 - very good seat for sleeping (slept probably 7 hours) though privacy lacking. Good choice of drink selection but food for business class very poor in both presentation and quality. No amenity kits on board for overnight flight. Entertainment on demand but western choice limited with only 3 recent films. Delhi-BKK. Poor all around for a 4 hour flight except the seats were wide and drink choice good again (malt scotch whisky). As noted before chicken or veg should not be the default option for business class and the quality of both was poor even for airline food. No immigration forms on board and fast track vouchers only offered on landing after numerous requests from passengers. Entertainment system on the A321 from the 1990's - no on demand and a choice of 5 channels 1 English. Ended up watching an Indian cop movie. BKK-Delhi - more of the same but breakfast of better quality. Delhi - BKK - although late best of all the legs with attentive cabin crew calls answered on request for drinks a good quality meal this time. Still could see the cost cutting with the amenity kit in business class being a cheap pair of flight socks and eye mask. No explanation given either of 90 minute delay.

Food outbound to BKK was good with good wine and cheese. On the return journey back from Bangkok the food was poor with some type of very fatty meat as a main course that I (and my wife) could not eat or even identify. Furthermore after the main meal it was a long long time until breakfast was served leaving myself and my fellow passengers hungry. I later established that snacks were available if you made your own way to the galley to collect them but this availability was not announced and by the time I realised (whilst visiting the toilet) all of the sandwiches and most of the ice creams had gone (NOT acceptable). Cabin crew were pleasant and polite but did not seem proactive in any way and (to me) this was evidenced by the fact that they did not bother to serve the snacks or make any announcement as to their availability. The interconnection at CDG was pretty seamless and posed no problem at all.

Not the fault of AF but where were the crew? It was stiflingly hot but no sign of water. The menu looked good but the meal was abysmal.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,M Bryant,United States,2013-08-22,August 1st - Minnesota to Paris aboard AF 340-300 flight was great. Enjoyed the larger seats and more leg room food was average wine with and after dinner was good. The air-conditioning in the airplane was not working correctly so we sat on our blanket and pillows which offset the hardness of the seat. After dinner we were offered liquor flight attendants were friendly and accommodating. Since we departed at 8pm shortly after dinner the lights were turned off encouraging passengers to sleep or take advantage of the in screen entertainment. Screen size was exceptional big and easy to watch movie and TV selections were average. Breakfast was served about an hour before landing again the food was just average.

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,M Bryant,United States,2013-08-22,August 21st Paris to Minnesota aboard AF 340-300. Flight delayed an hour because of a problem with the air- conditioning. Once again we enjoyed the larger seat and extra leg room. I especially like the option which allowed me to raise the seat front to support my calves. When dinner was served; my choice of chicken was quite good while my husbands choice of risotto was not good at all. Flight departed at 1.50 pm the lights were dimmed after dinner to enable passengers to get some rest. Attendants came through 3 or 4 times offering snacks and ice cream as well as additional drinks. The entertainment options were exactly the same offered on our previous flight. Once again we did not need the blankets so we sat on them which compensated for the hardness of the seats. My only complaint is the handling of our luggage. One of the advertised benefits of booking and paying for premium economy is to have your bags tagged priorityâ which is supposed to insure prompt delivering upon arrival. As I stated our flight was an hour late departing therefore we only had 45 minutes to make our connection in Minnesota. We were traveling with friends who did not opt for premium economy. We both checked in at the same time. Upon arriving in Minnesota our bags which were tagged priority were definitely not delivered in a timely manner. In fact many non priority bags arrived long before ours; including those belonging to our friends to flew economy. As a result we barely made our connection (2 minutes) our bags did not.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,4,3,5,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Air Mauritius use their most modern A340's on the London route which are quiet and smooth. Sat in economy and was surprised at how tight the legroom is and I'm only 5ft 9in. That was the only real negative about the flight. IFE boxes are also under each seat which limits your ability to stretch out your legs. I'm used to BA and Virgin's economy cabins which are more spacious. IFE was ok but not enough choice for a 12hr flight. Food was pretty good and tasty.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,E Smith,Australia,2015-04-19,We travelled premium economy Melbourne to LA. It cost about double the economy return. The first leg (to Auckland) wasn't called premium economy although it was in the premium economy cabin and we paid for premium economy. It was called something like 'Works Plus' and you only got economy food. At Melbourne airport we were prevented from priority boarding because of this difference which seemed a bit pathetic. The great advantage of premium economy on Air NZ is that you get plenty of room and the seat in front can't recline into your space. The seats are not great there is no footrest and the seat doesn't flip up to support your feet. On the long flight you are given sort of foot-bean-bags which are quite handy but you aren't given those on the shorter leg. In fact on the first leg I had to be quite insistent to beg for a couple of ordinary cushions from a flight attendant who was very reluctant to hand them over! The seats are actually hard to operate which the staff are clearly aware of. A problem with the seats is that they all face slightly or considerably away from each other. Perhaps this is meant to be for privacy but personally I prefer to sit parallel to the person next to me even if I don't know him/her. It was frustrating not being able to talk properly to my husband on the flights. Another disadvantage of the configuration is that you can't comfortably lie down across both seats if the plane is empty (as it was on the way home from LA to Auckland-we would actually have been better in economy as everyone back there got a row each and could lie down properly! But of course you can't predict that). The food on the longer legs is nice but it seems very odd that they bring out the desserts with the starters and you have to sit and look and the dessert through your starter and main course. As the trays and tables are very small and a bit unstable this is actually a real pain. It is also difficult to get drinks served with your meal. They bring the drinks after the meals and personally I can't eat a meal without drinking something. In general the staff were pretty unhelpful. It was difficult to get a soft drink or orange juice at all times. I was also refused an inflight magazine when I asked. I was told they weren't produced and were 'online'. The safety video (Lord of the Rings-style) was incredibly annoying. So - lots of space but a not very good seat. Nice food but wobbly trays. Snarly staff in the main. Avoid the front row in premium economy as the configuration is even worse than the other rows.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,3,2,3,3,NA,NA,3,0

The aircraft seemed new was very clean and the IFE selection was good. Boarding etc. were far smoother than I am used to on BA my usual carrier on this route. Food was good and the inflight staff were young professional without being stiff and/or overbearing. My experience was enhanced by having been given an exit-row seat. But even the return flight was good and this time I had a ghastly middle seat. Nevertheless the staff kept up well- fed and hydrated; there was an ample supply of cookies/chips/drinks in the galley and the flight was quite pleasant. Timings again are superb - essentially an overnight flight; leave home in Delhi after dinner; arrive in JFK in time for breakfast.

Connecting from Air Canada (Terminal 1 in Madrid) to Iberia (Terminal 4) was a bit of a trial. It took a good 15 minutes on the shuttle bus much of it on the highway. Air Nostrum used a Bombardier CRJ a bit tight for space. Service on this 50 minute flight exceeded my expectations. No inflight entertainment - none was expected of course given the small plane and short flight. The two FA managed to serve drinks and miniature sandwiches (an almost microscopic bun with a single slice of chorizo inside) although they had to rush to get it done. I was in the last row and the descent to Valencia airport was choppy - felt like a life raft in rough sea! Anyway service was pleasant and I give Air Nostrum full marks. On my return leg on an Iberia Airbus 320 the experience was also quite good although below Air Nostrum. FAs did their job and were reasonably pleasant. Clean plane with 3+3 configuration leather seats with lots of leg room. The flight was only half full and left about 15 minutes late but got to Madrid on time. The downside was absolutely no drinks or snacks of any kind except in business class. There was food for purchase but I didn't see a single person purchasing.

The crew on the flight was pretty much the same very nice and very helpful at the end of that flight the crew helped me get my bag out of the overhead compartment without me asking which was very professional. On the flight back it was a different story the staff in Calgary Airport were not helpful at all. Other than that it was a good flight. The new cabins are excellent but the only flaw is that if you tilt the screen up the person in front of you is fully reclined the screen has a mind of its own the system randomly thinks you touched it.

This is the third airline review I am adding - the previous two I have literally just submitted using a 'minus points plus points' format. I'm not sure that I can think of any minus points for this flight. There was nothing amazing about it but it ticked the boxes that this low-cost airline pledged to tick. I have scored 3/5 for ""Food and Beverages"" because I am required to score but I did not have any as I chose to bring my own on-board. However what the airline offers is more substantial and far better-priced and I would pre-book meals with them in future.

airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,Martin Brown,United Kingdom,2014-11-03,"Air Asia is trying to operate a Business Class service on a budget airline basis and it doesn't work. I was unhappy with the choice and availability of food the lack of TV screens and the insistence on being charged for your drinks except for bottled water which was given out freely. The cabin was spacious and the flat bed an essential. The price charged should have been higher and the service quality that Business Class fliers expect should have been provided. This all palls into insignificance against Air Asia X cancelling my flight that I had paid for 9 months in advance citing ""Commercial Reasons"" for this - in other words they hadn't filled enough seats for the flight so they cancelled it and bundled the passengers on to the next flight. This left me facing an overnight stay in Melbourne airport. Air Asia is doing something nobody else is they are trying to offer low cost Business Class service using the Ryanair model. It doesn't really work and travellers like me would be happy to pay quite a bit more to get the proper level of service. I think they have cut off their nose to spite their face.",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,5,5,1,1,NA,NA,5,0

First time flying Air NZ and was very impressed with the in-flight experience. Service excellent and lie flat seats on 777 were fabulous. Inflight entertainment has full TV series (not the one-off episodes provided by many other airlines). All in all I would recommend Air NZ.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2013-09-18,AKL-LAX-LHR in premium economy on Boeing 777-300 with the relatively new Spaceseats. I have flown NZ many times in long haul but this was my first trip in the new Spaceseats and I was pleasantly surprised. On the first leg I was in the front row seat 23A (window) and 30E (middle section aisle) and found the seats private comfortable and with a great deal of width that surpasses any other premium economy on the market (this is a 2-2-2 configuration where other airlines have 2-4-2 in this class). The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ). It shows other airlines what premium economy can be like although I'll admit the fare reflected this.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,3,1

Melbourne check in was pleasant and efficient. 2. Cabin crew pleasant efficient and professional. 3. Premium flatbed seat comfortable. 4. New KLIA2 terminal a vast improvement over LCCT but far too big and poorly designed. The negatives: 1. Had an Optiontown upgrade request for this flight paid for several months ago. Did not get upgraded yet when I went to Air Asia's website there were several premium flatbed seats available for sale after I was denied an upgrade. Was offered an upgrade at the airport for $299 which I took. Why would they promote Optiontown and get us to sign up and pay not allow the upgrade when there are seats available and then sell the upgrades at the airport? Highly unethical business practice. 2. Needed boarding pass reprinted for KUL-DMK connection at KUL when I arrived. The transfer desk had no capability to do this - they instructed me to exit immigration and go to ticket counter or use business centre at airport hotel in terminal. I chose the latter paid $3 for the privilege. This is unacceptable This was after checking in online and having the barcode sent to my phone which Air Asia said was not acceptable. What is the point of checking in online to receive boarding pass electronically if you can't use it? 3. Air Asia's loyalty program is totally worthless. Many many flights lead to no rewards.

airbaltic,/airline-reviews/airbaltic,airBaltic customer review,W Wynants,Belgium,2015-01-14,I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,0,0,NA,NA,2,0

Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor.

By all counts it was excellent and would definitely use this class of service again! The seats were comfortable the service and meals were excellent too! On our return flight we flew on the 747 in premium economy - older style - seats 22 H/K. We enjoy the fact that these seats are on the upper level of the 747. These seats are more like standard seats and not as comfortable as the 777 seats. We had room to spread out with no seats directly in front of us. Unfortunately the service was poor during this flight. The FA mentioned that they were missing a staff member for this flight.

It's not the first time that I traveled with Air Transat and I must admit that it was not the best flight. The flight departed late and the cabin was very hot when we boarded because the air conditioning system had broken during the landing of the previous flight. During the flight we hit a lot of turbulence and the crew could not serve any meals during that long period. After that they rushed to do that service. The meal and the crew were fine nothing special. The seat was a bit uncomfortable it's the same comfort for their longest flights to Europe but I enjoyed extra legroom because it was an emergency exit seat. The inflight entertainment was an old movie show on the overhead screens. I also found some announcements made in French were a bit unprofessional but they were made in a joyful tone. Overall despite the turbulence the flight was fine. I've travelled a couple of times with Air Transat to their Europe flights and the crew (some of them are friendly while a few were unprofessional) the service and the seats are all the same nothing special.

Big problem these days with Air Asia X after many years of complaints is that the cabin was far too cold now it's far too hot. As the full plane was loading one could feel how stifling and hot it was. This didn't improve during the flight in fact many blankets pre-purchased were not even taken out of the plastic bag. Other issue were the flight attendants. Sure its the overnighter but we rarely saw them in Economy. Arrived in KL feeling cooked from an oven.

Return flight was on their new 3x3x3 configuration which was like flying in a sardine tin. Did not get the extra leg room seats we had ordered and paid for the new configuration makes it impossible to get any sleep on night flights the aisles are so narrow that passing passengers stewards and trolleys bump into you all the time. This is the only overnight transatlantic flight I have ever taken where you need to buy or bring your own blanket! This is taking penny pinching to a whole new level. Food was edible but not a lot of it so if your planning to fly Transat take your own food with you avoid night flights and don't forget your own blanket shin and elbow guards!

Check in was normal. The seats were uncomfortable for both flights despite the new cabin. In flying entertainment was good for the outbound leg with a choice of recent movies but it was bad on the return flight that showed 3 old movies on the overhead screens. The service onboard was normal nothing special. The crew was fine but some of them are rude and unwelcoming towards ground agents. I usually fly with Air Transat because there's convenient non stop flights and I had a stand by ticket so no complains on that side.

We purchased two direct round-trip non-refundable flights from Ireland to Riga in mid-February for travel in late May for roughly $600 then made our non-refundable hotel reservations in Riga and Ireland. Air Baltic cancelled our flights in mid-March with a form letter telling us to ""have a nice flight"". They offered to put us on flights 2 days later on departure and 1 day early on return. I informed the AirBaltic that we had non-negotiable hotel reservations and asked AirBaltic to work with us with their air travel partners to get us on other alternate flights to Riga on our established travel dates for roughly the same cost. I provided the specific flight connection info. No substantive response was from them. I then requested a full refund on the website. The website was non- functional. I sent them an email to requested a refund and rebooked through another airline at a cost of more than $500 above our original AirBaltic fare. AirBaltic still provides the short Baltic Sea overflight. The beneficiary of this fare scam appears to be AirBaltic operating with minimal competition in the Riga air travel market .

Bad weather was the reason why the aircraft that we were supposed to get on that morning could not land in OOL and was instead diverted to BNE. Ground crew in OOL handled the situation extremely well by keeping us up-to-date about the situation every half hour. As the situation developed we were offered cash vouchers to get lunch at the airport. At first the crew were trying (very hard) to bus everyone to BNE and fly us out from there on the same day but BNE airport authority wouldn't allow them to do so.

Check-in staff carried out her duty in a rather unfriendly manner and my assumption was because we opted for low cost carrier and hence be seen as substandard.

My pre- order of Pak Nasser's Nasi Lemak was excellent perhaps the only great point about the entire journey. The 'hot seat' as it might sound had plenty of legroom but the seat was equally small and uncomfortable (not worth the AUD 45 at all). It was a relief that there was no delay throughout the journey.

The monitor didn't help at all and I have a couple going to KCH queuing in front of me and a group going to Kuantan behind me. What a mess. The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane. End up waiting 40 minutes on tarmac because 2 gates opened simultaneously and the 2 planes are located on the same aisle.

The Club Class cost is not much more than regular Economy in most other airlines but should not be mistaken for First Class or Business Class in other airlines. Some passengers seem to believe that the additional fare should give them much more than it actually does. Crew members are always pleasant and the service is very good. The food could be a bit better (Menu hasn't changed in at least 4 years) and movies could be a bit more recent but other than that I have no complaints.

We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo.

O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation.

We definitely ""unbundled by printing boarding passes at home and then at the hotel (savings: $60) and by packing light (4 carry-ons and 6 personal items (backpacks between us. We also flew with children over the age of 11 and chose not to board early (savings) and not to guarantee seats together.

The gate agents did not quibble about the size of the kids backpacks which were technically a bit over the size restrictions but we were processed right through happily.

The seats seem very narrow, and once in the flat bed position your feet end up in a narrow, confining box-like area which makes it difficult to move around. Impacted sleep quality immensely. Tablet-based IFE strange, clunky with limited choices. The biggest positive surprise was the food, which was as good an airline meal as I've had.

It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day.

The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines. I can honestly say that I would rather pay a little more to be able to get a drink of water if I need one and to have someone friendly and happy to see me come on board.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,0,NA,NA,2,0

Booked a trip from Punta Gorda to Knoxville I almost didn't make out of Punta Gorda. We got to the airport early and then the flight was delayed (all of the flights were continuously delayed). One ticketing agent said it was weather but the weather was clear where the flight was coming from so I asked another agent and she said they didn't have enough crew. We were packed in that small airport like sardines with kids screaming people yelling not enough seats for people to sit in. They cancelled some of the other flights but finally got another plane and crew that came from Fort Lauderdale for my flight. Six hours after arriving at the airport we finally left. After this experience I will pay the extra money for another airline. My chances of getting out of an airport on time are better and at least I will have the option of being rebooked on another flight or getting compensated.

alitalia,/airline-reviews/alitalia,Alitalia customer review,F Choong,United Kingdom,2012-06-18,LHR-FCO-GIG-FCO-LHR. Really nice surprise at London Heathrow flying on A321 with old Alitalia livery. Service onboard very professional with an excellent hot snack (omelette and salmon) for a duration of 2.5h. Transfer at Rome Fiumicino painless using fast track lane and the airport has lots of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia Giotto lounge was packed but the drinks selection was fine as well as the variety of sandwiches. Boarding A330 to Rio quick using Sky Priority lane. The aircraft had the new Magnifica Class with a 1-2-1 configuration. It was half full. Plenty of space in overhead lockers however if you seat in the middle there are none and have to use the ones on the side. Pre-taking off drinks given great selection of appetizers and the best moment was the food. Alitalia won best Airline Food recently and I was very much looking forward to it. Succulent Beef with Roasted Mediterranean vegetables as main course and for dessert a light unctuous Neapolitan Almond Cake. A 5 stars food and the espresso is served in a very beautiful cup and lid. The IFE had a good variety of recent movies but I thought the international selection was lacking. They have Flat beds (Only Skyteam airline in Europe to have these) and managed a good 7h sleep with a very comfortable duvet. The amenities given were a Bulgari bag with lots of toiletries products very much appreciated and high class. Staff very professional smiling and very happy to go for the extra mile for the customers. Breakfast consisted of a selection of Italian pastries and cakes with fresh fruits excellent! On the return leg Alitalia uses Air France/KLM lounge that can be cramped at times but it has great selection of hot snacks (the palm tree heart quiches are gorgeous). Boarding the A330 was painless again and the Magnifica class was full this time. Despite taking off 1h later we managed to catch up 30 minutes. The amenities given was another Bulgari bag and the best highlight was the food again with Pork Milanese as main course. Slept a good 7hours and had a copious breakfast before landing in Rome. The A321 to London was on time and service very good again. Overall a good value for money their new Magnifica class is an excellent product their Flat beds very comfortable and it's the Best Food I've ever had on an airline. Would recommend to anyone trying their new Business class either for professional purpose or leisure. Will definitely fly again with Alitalia on the lines featuring the new Magnifica Class.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

At 1am the desk girl gleefully announced the plane had arrived everybody cheered. Then after everybody got off the plane she announced with great surprise that the crew had timed out and couldn't fly. Something passengers had already figured would probably happen. Allegiant should have told us earlier so we didn't have to sit around the airport for 3 hours waiting. They knew but didn't tell the passengers.

The flight was on time and the pilot and crew were very courteous. Was a great flight! However the return was a disaster! On July 6 I was to fly out of Palm Beach Intentional. As before I printed my online boarding pass and arrived before the time indicated. This time I did not receive an official boarding pass indicating what time I was to go to board the plane. Instead I received the printed boarding pass that I proved which was torn in half and the gate number written on it. She instructed me to go to the left towards security and afterwards I would see the areas that indicated which gates. I went through security as usual and then proceeded to the gate written on the boarding pass. At the gate there were very few people there and I saw no Allegiant advertising. I asked someone who worked at the airport and she said yes you have the right gate. Since ever all flights were being delayed due to bad weather in the area I thought mine had been as well. About 10 minutes after the flight was to take off I saw one of the Allegiant employees who had been checking people in when I arrived. I asked if the flight had been delayed. She told me no I had missed my flight. I showed her my boarding pass with the hand written gate number on it. She informed me that that was the wrong gate and that she didn't recognize the hand writing.

american-eagle,/airline-reviews/american-eagle,American Eagle customer review,R Hansen,United States,2014-08-11,For the past two years I've been flying American Eagle several times a month between St. Louis and Washington DC (DCA) and the service has steadily declined in quality and reliability. At least half of the flights are late (some several hours) and a number have been cancelled (including several evening flights requiring an overnight stay at my expense). I've tolerated this mediocre service because of convenience (and a distaste for Southwest) but yesterday upon landing at DCA the new gate arrangement has pushed me to Southwest. Now instead of boarding/deplaning at a terminal gate the aircraft parks away from the terminal and passengers are transported to the terminal - a process that takes 20-30 minute (not to mention the hassle of standing outside the aircraft on the tarmac waiting for carry-on luggage). I have also heard flight attendants and gate agents confirm the poor operations of this carrier. Fly with American Eagle at your risk.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,4,4,0,0,NA,NA,1,0

On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy.

Both flights were taken in Business Class. The first was from Dusseldorf to Toyko Narita on a 787. The second was from Tokyo Haneda to London. In terms of cabin ambience seating and IFE both flights were fine. The ANA business class cabin interior feels a little sterile but the seats are comfortable with plenty of personal space and a decent sized IFE screen. The selection of IFE programming could have been more extensive but it was sufficient. Noise cancelling headphones were supplied on both flights. The amenity kit was also fine but didn't stand out. Cabin service was efficient but lacked finesse or genuine attention to detail. Serviceable is the best way I could describe it. The main issue however was the food. With both a Japanese and 'International' menu offered you might expect the latter to actually cater to an international clientele and on the outbound leg from Dusseldorf to Tokyo it did with an accessible selection of options appealing to a wide variety of tastes. However on the return journey departing from Haneda the ANA 'Connoiseurs' international menu was provided (along with the standard Japanese option). This offered an unappetising 'amuse bouche' involving bamboo shoots in apsic and herrings followed by an equally unappetising soyabean milk bavarois with sea urchin jellied asparagus and smoked scallops (all cold) with no other options available. Only the main course a combination of hamburger patty small piece of beef and egg plant in an unidentifiable sauce was even vaguely appealing. Unless you wanted 'tilefish' or a pasta option that sounded even less pleasant. I have no problem with airlines trying to make their food more interesting but when you have a captive audience stuck on-board for 12 hours trying to push the envelope with left-field combinations like soyabean milk bavarois and sea urchin is taking things too far. Especially when it is the only option. It might be something that would appeal to an adventurous diner in an expensive restaurant but not a tired hungry passenger on board a long flight where the food is being prepared in a small galley from pre- prepared ingredients. 30000 feet in the air is not the place for culinary experimentation. Add to that the fact that options for the second meal during what is a long flight were uninspiring to say the least (although more appetising and less avant garde) and for the first time in a long time I actually regretted not eating a proper meal before I boarded my flight. After 12 hours on board I arrived at my destination feeling pretty hungry. Was it enough to put me off flying ANA again.

The pitch was really tight and the recline was uncomfortable. I think I would be happy to trade great inflight service for more in seat comfort.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,5,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

Traveling through the US and Canada during November found me on several AA flights most in first class with upgrades a few in economy. On balance the flights were ok nothing special no notable problems. Most flights were on or close to schedule service was generally better than expected. The biggest negative is AA's equipment on these routes. All B737 or MD Super 80 aircraft. Generally confining for mid-long haul domestic and the S80s are just so old it is a wonder that AA still uses them as much as they do - not a very passenger friendly aircraft.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,7,2,3,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered.

So about 2-2.30pm they announce a gate and plane change. They had to get a plane from another airline Suncoast. Since this plane didn't have the same seating they changed to open seating. So they boarded handicapped first then priority people then groups with small children then people with assigned seats and then everyone else (seems like Southwest seating). By the time we did all this it was about 4.15pm. They did give us water and a snack pack on the trip. So we get there late and what do you know there is an Allegiant plane already at the gate. We have to wait another 30-40 minutes until that plane leaves until we can get to the gate. There were no weather problems at either city.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N Smith,United States,2014-08-06,My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products).

ana-all-nippon-airways,/airline-reviews/ana-all-nippon-airways,ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,M Finch,Japan,2013-05-04,San Francisco to Tokyo in economy class. This was the first time my wife and I have flown an international flight with ANA. From the moment we checked in everyone was extremely polite professional and even smiled. A smile goes a long way. The aircraft was clean and had the hard shell seats that slide forward instead of reclining. This took some getting used to but I managed since I didn't have anything under the seat in front of me. I don't think large people will like this style of seat. The benefit is not having the seat in front of you recline into your lap. The seat backs were higher and the top pf the seat did not taper to a head rest. The top of the seat back was the same width as the rest of the seat back. This allowed for a much larger video screen. I usually need to wear my reading glasses to watch movies but not this time! They also had room to put the remote next to the screen. Nobody hitting the seat back behind me like those touch screens and no remote in the arm rest taking up space. I also liked the foot rest. It gave me another option when adjusting to get comfortable. The differences with this aircraft did not stop there. The lavatory had automatic faucets. No need to push down and hope the water would last long enough to wash your hands. There was a beverage holder on the back of the tray table so you didn't need to pull down the tray table for only a drink. Then when you did pull down the tray table for your food there was another beverage holder in the seat back so you had more room on your tray. The main dinner course was excellent. By far the best airline food my wife and I have had in economy. Then another cart came by with miso soup. As if that wasn't enough an FA came by with Haggendaz ice cream for dessert. Throughout the flight beverage carts were making their rounds offering the soft drinks juices wine and beer. FAs walking around offering three different types of hot tea and another one offering coffee. We were rarely interrupted with those annoying long announcements in English and Japanese throughout the flight. When the seatbelt light came on no announcement. Instead FAs walked the aisles to ensure everyone was wearing their seatbelt. When dinner was served FAs carried a menu to show you what was being offered. All of the small details made a huge difference from our experiences with United and Delta. This flight was part of a trip which included flights with United.

She was travelling with a personal item only so no extra fees to her rock bottom one way fare. I agree with prior reviewers that their fees do add up quickly so plan accordingly. Also keep in mind Allegiant flies from small airports which generally mean higher fares so at least you get the non stop service with them. Also bear in mind if you suffer a delay which is common with all airlines these days this could have been time wasted with 1-2 hours at a hub airport.

Have flown many long haul flights to European hubs and then on to different cities in the US. We usually fly on British Airways (great airline) or KLM or Delta. For the first time was forced (because of a change in flight schedules) to fly on American Airlines from DFW to London (Heathrow) yesterday. So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks.

I was able to bypass the Admirals club check in line handed Premium Drink vouchers and told I would be greeted by someone else to take me to my next flight. Shortly afterward the weather turned horrible for about an hour. My new 5 star agent found me in the Admirals Club and asked if I had any questions. I had her check to make sure the plane taking me to Santiago Chile made it on the ground. She came back to confirm it was on the ground but waiting for a gate due to the weather. Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice.

Boarding delayed by 1 hour due to technical difficulties. When we did board there was no air conditioning and the cabin was unbearably hot. It was left for passengers to get water from the galley which was not freely offered. An announcement was then made that our direct flight would be stopping in Abuja to collect more passengers which resulted in what can only be described as a riot amongst the passengers. The cabin crew were incapable of dealing with the situation as passengers charged up and down the cabin changing seats and classes at will. After a further hour on the ground it took members of the public to pacify the passengers begging with them to return to their seats over the intercom. Eventually we did take off for the short flight to Abuja. On landing we were forced to sit for a further 2 hours without air conditioning and forced to sit through further unrest whilst the cabin crew watched on. At one stage they even threatened to leave the aircraft. Refuelling took a long long time. At this point we had still had no food and were helping ourselves to drinks. We landed in London 5.5 hours late with lame apologies and little remorse from the airline no help from ground staff with missed onward connections.

On the outbound flight our tickets said the flight was 12.20 but it was in fact displayed as 12.00. Check in staff were unfriendly put the wrong seat numbers on our boarding cards which we spotted otherwise our family would have been separated. Boarding was called 20 minutes before the inbound aircraft arrived and the aircraft left late resulting in standing in line for over an hour to board as there was minimal seating in the boarding area. The interior of the aircraft was dark and gloomy cabin lights were left off. The seating was cramped which meant the passenger in front could not recline his seat. The cabin service was shambolic the crew attempted to serve food and drinks from the same trolley and were constantly running our of things and were going up and down the aisles for more items constantly took over an hour to serve the meal. The meal was disgusting and was stone cold and my drink was half a glass of flat diet coke the crew had run out and didn't want to get another bottle. Staff were not friendly and continually forgot to serve people due to the distraction of running out of food. For most of the flight the aisles were blocked with crew with trolleys and food trays were not collected for a long time. Combined with turbulence it was not possible to visit the two economy class toilets for some time and it was not allowed to use them on the ground in Istanbul. On a positive note baggage collection and immigration in Ercan was fast and efficient. The return flight was slightly better boarding was more ordered cabin service more organised and cabin light switched on. Check in however was shambolic.

AV now uses El Dorado Terminal for many domestic flights (for the routes with highest traffic) which is convenient especially if you have to connect to international flights. The lounge has also improved but it is mostly very crowded. Long queues at the entrance. Outbound A318 inbound A320.

Now to the negative points: As mentioned before Lounge in BOG is always crowded lounge in BAY even worse in the evening it makes no sense to enter you don't find any space. F&B offering ok but always picked within 2 minutes. AV says they provide you with Food in the Lounge so they dont provide any food onboard not even in C Class. Not even a pack of peanuts! So when you don't find space in the Lounge you have to go and buy something because onboard you wont get anything! This is very poor for an airline that wants to present itself as the industry leader in Latin America!

It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly. Boarding in Bogota is a mess (no priority lanes) and lounge is also mediocre without enough seats on peak periods.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0
avianca,/airline-reviews/avianca,Avianca customer review,Richard Winger,United States,2011-03-14,JFK-MED-BOG-JFK Avianca business class is taking a rapid nose dive. It's not just that food is getting worse (the new menu to NYC is basically inedible) you can't get a glass of wine on domestic routes (free rum and whiskey only) the uncomfortable A320 turns up on more and more NYC routes and the lounges are stuffy and overcrowded. The most disappointing part of the service is that Avianca makes absolutely no effort to ease the way for premium passengers through the deplorable Colombian airports. There are no dedicated security lines no fast track through immigration (which can take up to two hours in BOG on bad days) and when you finally make it to the plane there is no priority boarding. Obviously equal misery for all is a well tested concept - it's called the discount airline. That seems to be where Avianca is headed - surely with its present state of service there is no way to mistake it for the serious world class airline it wants to be. The only reason I keep recommending Avianca is because Delta Continental and American are hardly attractive alternatives.

If you are lucky to fly 767 or the new A330 in this route you will have a good service from Avianca but not in these smaller planes. AVOD has a decent choice and food service was OK (although I think that travellers would prefer a breakfast before arrival at 6am than a dinner at departure time on mid-night).

The return was nice in business but even though we gate checked the stroller at TAS and told them we needed it at ICN they sent it through to the baggage claim. Luckily the ICN staff were wonderful and retrieved it for us quickly. Return was in the new Quadra business lie-flat seats which were comfortable for us but I can see how they might be too narrow for people with a larger build. Also strangely enough the business class bassinets are more narrow compared to the economy class ones. Nice amenity kit with L'Occitane products excellent food and service. I had the Korean options for all meals and I highly recommend it.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
bangkok-airways,/airline-reviews/bangkok-airways,Bangkok Airways customer review,Shane Walker,Bangladesh,2013-06-30,I have flown many times with Bangkok Airways from Dhaka to Bangkok and Bangkok to other Thai cities. For the most part I enjoy the service i.e. friendly staff clean and well maintained aircraft food OK. However the legroom is not all that great and the on-board entertainment is woeful. Since I first started flying with Bangkok Airways back in late 2011 their prices have increased considerably such that the cost of a return ticket Dhaka to Bangkok is only slightly less than Thai Airways but with no Business Class far worse flight times and crap on- board entertainment. Their so-called 'lounges in Bangkok and Phuket are also not worth bothering with. The food is pretty ordinary the coffee bad no alcohol and quite dirty (e.g. stains all over the lounge chairs and carpet). Hence I have recently switched to Thai Airways.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,3,1,NA,NA,3,1

Outward plane a Boeing 737 and return an Airbus 320. The planes looked clean and well maintained. What lets the service down is attention to details and quality of human interactions. The drop down screens show a very old moving map and the safety cartoon. On the return flight the screen was just left down but blank for 40 minutes before some old cartoons were shown. The cabin crew appear to do what is required of them but with no great zeal. Passengers offered a drink and a muffin on outward flight. On the return leg a turkey and cheese sandwich. When I asked for a vegetarian option I was told directly and with no apology that there was not any. Mints offered after we had landed as passengers were on the way out. Another problem is that it is a very long walk at Heathrow to and from the gate used by Austrian. There are various means that help people a long but it can take up to 20 minutes. The new terminal in Vienna had a similar problem although not quite so bad but still a lengthy walk to passport control and I found very badly signposted.

The food was OK but certainly not Business Class standards and they had a very limited selection of drinks and on-board entertainment (not everyone wants to watch Bollywood movies and the screens were too small). The A310 aircraft was reasonably clean but really starting to show it's age. The toilets were a mess by the end of the flight even though it was less than 5 hours duration.

This was the most shambolic boarding I have witnessed. There were no announcements about cause for the delay no apology and 45 mins later we boarded the plane via shuttle bus.

Baneasa airport is terrible has to be one of the worst in the world badly organized Staff unfriendly rude and unhelpful throughout. Only 2 checkin counters for about 5 flights leaving around the same time terminal is tiny and was fully packed. To make matters even worse they have a stupid policy where if you have baggage to checkin you need to pay a fee of I think 20 euro per piece but they cannot take the money at the checkin desk you need to shuffle through the fully packed terminal and then go and line up at another desk with even more people and pay for it separately then return to the checkin desk so they can check you have paid. The whole process took around 2 hours and we never moved more than a few metres the whole time. When we were finally bussed to the plane the staff were rude and someone I was travelling with has a fear of flying so they wanted us to be seated together but they would not allow it even though there was a spare seat at the back which I then moved to after the flight took off. One cabin crew member yelled very loudly at me because apparently my bag was too heavy but no one mentioned it in the terminal. Staff at the airport spoke little English. The plane was old and we really questioned the safety of it. Complimentary water served but then cabin crew at the back of the plane for the rest of the flight they even were not present to prepare the cabin for landing. On landing there were many people (Romanians) on mobile phones making phone calls etc none of the staff said anything. Mentioned it to staff after landing and they said they did not see it happen.

There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition. The flight arrived into Terminal 5 a few minutes ahead of schedule and outside the UK Arrivals area less than ten minutes later.",A321,Business,Economy,MAN-LHR,10,4,5,5,NA,4,NA,5,1

The flight was scheduled for 0955 however Glasgow airport closed due to severe snow. Was told I would be put into the 1pm flight however this then became canceled as well. By 2 pm I was so tired and jetlagged and with no guarantee of there being any flights out that day I decided to get a hotel for the night. BMI refused to pay for that or provide meal vouchers as the problems were weather related and not their fault. Headed landside and joined the huge queue. Was slightly annoyed that there was only 4 people at the desk. Was told that they would put me on the 0955 flight again tomorrow so proceeded to the hotel. At 0730 the next day called BMI who informed the flight was ok with no cancellation. Arrived at airport an hour later to be told the flight had been canceled. Even bigger queue at customer service and this time only 2 people manning it. Took nearly 2 hours to reach the end of it. During this time BAA website is showing Glasgow as being open as it had from late afternoon on Monday and most flights getting in ok. Eventually got to the end of the queue and asked the girl who was totally disinterested why only 2 people. Was told I could be put on 5pm flight which again there were no assurances of. Since found out all flights that day were cancelled. Decided to get train home so arranged to get my cases (which were still in international baggage) this took over an hour again as they had to find someone to escort me there.

The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Vegâ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldnât make it up.

I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin.

I find this particular cabin very noisy possibly due to proximity of the engines. Seats are comfortable and leg room and elbow room significantly better than economy. The front row of World Traveller Pus has even more legroom but be warned that this is a mixed blessing since this row is fitted with shelves for strapping down babies cradles and if you sit next to a passenger who requires this facility then it will severely compromise your space. IFE was OK but nothing special. Main meal was OK but breakfast was an absolute disgrace; a dry cheese croissant and a small granola bar. No alternatives offered. I know this is not business class but for the premium I paid for World Traveller Plus I feel entitled to something better than this really very poor take it or leave it excuse for a breakfast. The drinks service was nothing special either; one round of juice or water before take off an offer of wine with dinner and another juice and water run after dinner. Then nothing until breakfast. Regarding the crew some were engaging and friendly but far too many others were offhand and unsmiling. When in all innocence I used a toilet in the Business Class cabin I found a member of cabin crew waiting for me when I emerged who promptly berated me for my mistake. Fair enough but when I explained that other passengers in World Traveller Plus had also used the toilets in Business Class I was virtually called a liar. I backed off from an argument but I found the experience upsetting and I simply couldn't get to sleep thereafter. I eventually disembarked at LGW hungry thirsty and a somewhat unhappy bunny.

The flexible ticket cost about 3 times the advertised minimum fare. Despite this I was charged 8 euros for paying with a credit card (none of my debit cards were accepted by the airline's web site). The ticket allowed fast track security although as this lane was merged into others there was no advantage. Extra cabin baggage was also allowed but as the ground staff did not enforce the cabin baggage policy this was again no advantage. The flight left 20 minutes late as the handling agent had not loaded the bags in time. The seat had no head rest and felt like it had almost no padding a bit like resting on a leather covered ironing board. There was no magazine in the seat pocket. The advertised free light meal/snack was a bread roll with two slices of cheese with terrible coffee served in a small paper cup.

As a BA Executive Club member I was able to use the Club bag drop where there was no queue. The Fast Track security staff were disorganised and patronising. The Gold/First lounge was busy and at times uncomfortably hot. Boarding from the C Gates was well organised. On taking my seat I was offered a water or orange juice. The 777-300 has the newish seats that were quite comfortable except for the headrest which does not have adjustable wings. The situation was helped by the fact that I had been able to select an emergency exit row aisle seat (22B). Departure was on time. Bar service was just before and with the meal. I had used the facility available on this route to pre-order my main course. Overall the meal was quite good. The Mixed Fleet staff commendably avoided the bizarre practice on some other carriers of closing the window blinds after the meal service. The seat was a bit stiff in adjusting to a recline. The leg support cushions were useless as they did not move far enough to make contact with my legs. Time passed quickly as the entertainment system was very good. A reasonable snack of sandwiches and a scone was served about an hour before landing. We arrived a the gate slightly ahead of schedule.

KWI-LHR-EDI-LHR-KWI: booked World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) but upgraded to Club World (Business Class) on the outward trip. An excellent experience: as always the cabin crew make the difference. On all sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful. Food was excellent (chicken or pasta seem to be a thing of the past - I was not offered either) nicely presented and for me in sufficient quantity. Water/orange juice runs on a regular basis washrooms clean and tidy and well-stocked A wide range of entertainment on the KWI-LHR sector (it kept me entertained for a 6-hour flight and because I flew out in April and back in May the selection had changed on the return flight). Smooth flights (the 747's on the KWI-LHR sector although old were well- maintained and everything worked - I really enjoy flying the ""Queen of the Skies"") and plenty of information from the flight deck. Slight delay outbound at Kuwait because of a technical problem but it was resolved: all other sectors were on time. I travelled on a Sunday in both directions so no delays in connections at Heathrow although I had built in sufficient time between flights to allow for delays when I booked my ticket. All in all four excellent flights - BA seem to have improved immensely since I last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason I use BA in preference to the carriers from the Middle East especially as Terminal 5 at Heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience).",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Veccio,Belgium,2015-05-12,Flew BA on open-jaw route BRU-LHR-LAX returning one week later SFO-LHR-BRU. BRU-LHR was on an A319 newly refurbished plane. I paid for seating selection weeks before. The day before on-line check-in opened I saw that some seats on the front of the plane became available to economy travellers with no surcharge so I took one of them to deplane as quick as possible (the plane landed a little bit ahead of schedule anyway). LHR-LAX on the A380 was a really nice experience really smooth flight and incredibly quiet upper-deck cabin. Food was not bad as long as you don't expect anything too fancy in economy. There was only one complete meal after take off and a pre- arrival snack before landing. On an 11 hours flight this may seem not enough but passengers are welcome to pick up snacks in the galley during the flight as well as having drinks fixed on demand. Only one negative spot of the flight: the cabin was really cold! SFO-LHR still on the A380 departed a little bit late due to a malfunction of one of the doors but crew kept us informed of the situation. Same nice experience nice crew and so on. LHR-BRU on an A320 departed late after being stuck on tarmac due to high departure rate at Heathrow. Once again the captain kept us informed and managed to catch most of the delay before landing in Brussels. Overall really nice experience but I wish they would not charge as much for seating selection before online check in. As I may be a nervous flyer I need a window seat and don't want to risk seating elsewhere. The four legs cost me more than 130 euros on pre-paid seating which I could take into account when choosing between BA and an another airline that let you choose free of charge when booking your flight.

BA's hand luggage only fares to Europe offer very good value and I wonder when they will consider this pricing tier for long haul routes! The A319 flight left from Heathrow Terminal 1 which is closing in June but now looks and feels like a ghost town. There were 3 shops open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up. As for the flight we had the usual BA chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the new seats are uncomfortable and certainly similar to Ryanair with hardly any space.

European flights in b.flex intercontinental ones in business class. Since I last flew Brussels Airlines in b.flex there has been a significant decline in service. A year ago you received a little tray with a salad a cold meal and hot bread rolls. Now it is down to a sandwich or a croissant depending on the time of day. European business class seemed to be down-graded too. In business you get now what you used to get in b.flex. Intercontinental flights in business class however were quite a different matter. On the way out to Banjul the plane was equipped with the new business-class seats. In one row the seating arrangement is 1-2-1 in the next 2-1-2. Beds are fully lie-flat beds now. Meals were of an excellent quality for airline food and flight attendants were attentive and constantly refilled your glasses. On the return to Brussels the cabin layout in business class was the old 2-2-2 seating so no lie-flat beds which was a pity as it was a night flight departing at 22.45 local time. Service was a bit rushed but then everyone was eager to get at least a couple of hours of sleep before breakfast was served at 5.45 CET.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,5,4,NA,NA,4,1
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,J Rose,Australia,2015-04-14,BA 208 MIA-LHR in Club. Leg four of a seven leg BA adventure. Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. Moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than BA.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,1,3,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Economy flex is essentially economy class on a flexible ticket but has a few advantages. Fast track security is available at both Heathrow Terminal 1 and Brussels which is helpful at peak times. Seating is allocated with an empty middle seat if available which it was on both flights making it similar to business in that sense. Onboard there is complementary food - in the morning a rather bland cheese roll and a pain au chocolat in the afternoon it was two sandwiches and a cake.

The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine.

It was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. The Club World seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. The entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasn't terribly extensive but everything apart from the in-seat USB power socket was working. The general layout of the cabin was terrible. Not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for take-off landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. It makes everything feel cramped and cheap. Meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. Overall I'd rate the outbound experience as 'Okay' for a business class flight. Return flight experience was far from okay. My flight departing IAD at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. Told that there were no Club World seats on the earlier flight out of IAD that night which I could just about make at a push and I would have to fly back in Economy. When I asked about the BA flight from Baltimore (BWI) an hour later I was told that yes there were Club World seats available that evening so I asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. Arriving at BWI check-in I was informed that unfortunately there actually weren't any Club World seats available and I would have to fly back in World Traveller Plus. The flight from BWI to LHR T5 was on a rather old 767. The cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. World Traveller Plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. In-flight food was bland. The crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. Flight left and arrived on time. As a UK passport holder Immigration at T5 was quick. Baggage reclaim took longer but bags arrived within five minutes of reaching the baggage hall.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,3,3,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

Apart from a Berlin trip already paid for in May they can say goodbye to my business travel. This was an Airbus 320 previously owned by BMI. It was not difficult to work that out as it was still showing the BMI banner inside. The plane was never used for business. All the seats were a miserable 30 inch pitch.

Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating.

I had been a huge fan of British Airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. I also was curious to see Heathrow's new Terminal 5. British Airway's overall product has improved in that time. On the first leg from Philadelphia to London I was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new Audio Video on Demand (AVOD) entertainment systems. I had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and I enjoyed their World music section in particular. The Asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. My only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. In addition I found the chapatis on the Delhi-London sector to be hard as rocks. Otherwise the meals were very good. Terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the London-Philadelphia sector when I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner. The plane is a marvel. The windows are huge dimmable by button too. The bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. Additionally the legroom on the Dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the B777. And finally a word about the cabin attendants. Their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of British hospitality - informal politeness.

On a positive note the actual flights themselves were great however there were several issues that left me frustrated and stressed out - not a good way to start and end vacation lack of efficiency lack of sensitivity care and compassion for customer sensitive issues (such as held back luggage) inconsistent information unclear information (resulting in a surprise $280 in luggage fees). Lack of attentiveness to customer inconsistent protocol (you need signs posted in the airport and don't cover up gate doors with plants) so that customers can find you.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

Despite inconvenient location at BOS service is friendly and small aircraft are abnormally comfortable; the seat in front of you has a shape similar and usable as a footrest. Service is wonderful pilots crack jokes you are greeted personally at check-in. At BOS as I was boarding I realized I had forgot my laptop in the terminal. I ran back up to get it and met the gate agent bringing it to me. When I arrived in RUT it turned out my bag got lost. Despite the fact it was not at all their fault and that I could not provide them with any information they tracked it down within the hour and had it delivered in 36 hrs.

The next morning we wake to find our flight now leaves at the break of the next day at half 12 in the evening! We booked our flight to leave Saturday so we would arrive home on Sunday and be able to go back to work for the Monday. But thanks to the reliability of British Airways not only had we paid for two - now immensely - overpriced flights we will be loosing money from not being able to attend our jobs! Absolutely disgusting show from BA I honestly wouldn't even chance a brief flight with them for fear of having to cancel numerous plans due to the ineptitude of a shoddily run business!

Plenty of places to sit and relax; good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar. Priority boarding line worked well for business/status passengers.

On HKG-LHR leg though they did not have enough mid-flight meals for all passengers, which I find hard to fathom given people are paying thousands for the ticket and the meal only costs Cathay a few quid to produce. They should overstock, not understock the flight. The other complaint on the trip was the regionally configured plane from NRT-HKG is a poor excuse for business class on a four hour leg. No reason not to run flat beds on that route, considering the importance of it and the fact that some flights are overnight. Won't pay for that again.

First return trip was perfect - 10/10. Very comfortable business class seat and bed good food and attentive service. Only improvement could be to the choice of movies. First trip from ICN-LHR was particularly noteworthy as the first leg was 2.5 hours late due to a thunder storm in Seoul - flight landed in HKG 10 mins after CX255 was supposed to leave but Cathay held that flight which was very impressive and lucky. The ground staff were excellent. The ICN-LHR trip in May was not so fortunate. Due to ATC restrictions over China all flights to Europe were subject to creeping delays - i.e. 30 mins at a time. With the exception of our flight all flights boarded and eventually left - some were up to 4 hours delayed. For some reason CX255 was the only flight not called for boarding and eventually after 5am (4h30m after scheduled departure) the board stated it was est at 0900 the reason being the mandatory crew hours had been reached. I suspect the decision to hold our flight was more about aircraft rotation as that particular aircraft sits on the ground at LHR for 12 hours so effectively CX255 withstand a long delay without suffering a knock on impact to Cathay's schedule. Eventually the flight took off at 0945. Whilst I accept the delay itself was not under Cathay's control the decision to withhold CX255 was not communicated and all passengers were made to wait in the terminal through the night without any offer of accommodation. When on board the flight was perfectly comfortable but my previously flawless image of Cathay's service levels is now tainted.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,5,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

The check-in area at DME was very congested but I did not have to queue. The lounge had plenty of not very comfortable seats and limited food and beverages. The gate area was more like a holding pen and was much too small for a 747 load. First and Club ended up boarding through a different gate number. Once on board I was shown to my seat and given an explanation about the seat functions. Service from the mature crew was excellent (there were only one other passenger in First). The food was OK but not particularly exciting. The main disappointment was the seat and amount of personal space with only enough room for shoes and a jacket in the wardrobe. Everything else had to go in the overhead locker. There seemed to be too many seats crammed into the cabin. I moved from 1K to 3K as this had a bit more space and privacy than the others.

(No First Class on the aircraft I used). Both aircraft's are similar from the point of view of the seat itself and the service you get although the A330 seat is slightly smaller but that is only really noticeable in the smaller side-cupboard by the seat. Storage is impressive and is everywhere. The headphone cabinet has more storage space too and it has a mirror. Seat firm but comfortable. You don't get pyjamas or a mattress with business class with Cathay only in their First Class. Initially I was miffed but actually I didn't notice not having the mattress and I slept well. The amenity kit has ear plugs anyway. Cathay dining is esoteric and not always to a western palate. It is served from a trolley so you get to see the product before you select it which is rather good. Cathay service is practical and competent but I feel that it is not polished like say BA or Emirates. I chose Cathay because I wanted the best seat for a 24 hr flight and in that respect any short-comings in other departments (food no mattress humourless but efficient staff) are insignificant: these seats will get you there in comfort.

I ended up at the public food court for some decent Hong Kong food. Though I managed to rest at G16 during the 3 hours transit.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,A Moreitz,Australia,2014-12-31,I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient.

Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,J Rose,Australia,2014-10-28,YVR-HKG-MEL in Premium economy. On balance a bit of a mixed bag experience. Seats definitely an uptick from economy but the fundamental problem is cabin design which is flawed - the cabin feels like a retrofitted afterthought which it is. On the B777 YVR-HKG leg the one toilet in premium economy is in the right front of the cabin necessitating anyone on the left side of the plane to crawl across the four seats in the middle front row to access it. That isn't well thought out and isn't a nice thing to do to the people sitting there and is difficult at night with all four people stretched out sleeping so the alternative is walking back into economy down the left aisle which is a hassle. On the A330 HKG-MEL there is no premium economy toilet which requires a trip back to economy. Food seemed more 'economy' than 'business' but to be expected really. The other big negative on the YVR-HKG flight was the premium economy cabin was filled with upgraded passengers due to a massively oversold economy cabin. I would estimate 80% of the people in premium economy were upgraded and not for status reasons which makes the logic behind paying for it hard to justify. On the positive side Cathay service always shines and the crews are professional and efficient.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,3,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1

Flight left Adelaide 90 mins late so missed flight to LHR. What followed was the most frustrating of experiences. 10 hours in HK then we were forced to fly via Tokyo to LHR. Delay of another 7 hours in Tokyo. Arrived LHR feeling dreadful. No compensation whatsoever was offered to us until our daughter complained and we were offered a $100 voucher each which we still have not received and we are now back in Adelaide. Then came the return flight last week. Plane out of LHR delayed two hours. Turned up at airport with bags packed (as we had been told to do whilst still at home) only to be advised that they could not get us on a flight out of HK for 48 hours. Back home and unpacked bags.

Unnecessary delay with boarding process resulted in 20 mins late take-off. Stacked at Hong Kong landed 30mins late. Onward flight to LHR already closed so rebooked on later flight at 23:30. Given a hotel voucher but this didn't compensate for losing my previously selected aisle seat and having to then travel overnight to LHR arriving 05:45 am instead of 20:30pm the previous evening. Aircraft meals and cabin service could not be faulted and Premium Economy definitely recommended on longer journeys just a great shame that ADL to LHR schedule obviously does not allow enough time for flight transfer at Hong Kong so don't expect to fly straight through.

Aircraft was clean and tidy but the cabin crew were the stars of the show very attentive and pleasant without being too enthusiastic if you know what I mean. The food was excellent in both in premium economy and business class but business class certainly has the edge with the comfort and privacy. My wife doesn't normally sleep well when travelling in aircraft however the fully reclining seat was a great bonus which allowed her to get a few hours of good sleep. In comparison with other airlines I have travelled with the service that Cathay Pacific provides gives it that little bit extra.

I spoke to one about the seats and she said they use the old planes to Rome as there are facilities for the staff to sleep and that they use the newer planes for the Melbourne leg. On the return leg we were given a few little packs of cookies. On our trip from Rome to HK we found for some unknown reason our pre-selected seats were changed and my husband and I were apart.

Flew on the last 747 service from London to Hong Kong on 31st December 2013. We were all given a lovely commemorative postcard set at the gate. As we taxied a firetruck water canon salute was in operation although the fact that it was pouring with rain rather spoiled the effect! Seats were reasonably comfortable and although I know others find these older style 'sliding' recline Cathay Pacific seats not so comfortable at least you don't get problems with the person in front if you reclining their seat all the way back. Food was nothing special neither was the movie selection and crew not the most attentive I was expecting Cathay Pacific in-flight service to be up there with the other major Asian airlines and so was a little disappointed. Return flight Hong Kong to Heathrow was on a 777. It may be my 'shape' but I just could not get comfortable in these seats (economy class) and unlike the old style 747 seats the new 777 seats recline by tilting and so inevitably the person in front of me decided to recline fully for the entire flight. This combined with the uncomfortable seat (no lumbar support and either very low armrests or high seat cushion - I couldn't work out which) made it one of the most unpleasant long haul flights I have taken in recent years. Cabin crew not friendly (aside from one female cabin attendant who seemed to be doing more work than all her colleagues and who was genuinely personable and friendly) and as on the outward leg cabin crew not especially attentive.

It was a pretty terrible experience all round. First flight to HKG was a 747-400. The seats were bizarre they did not recline but the seat slid forward a little bit and the support for the bottom of your back is rock hard. Terrible pockets on the seat in front mean if you put anything more than a newspaper in there the seat pocket is touching your knees. Also as with all Cathay flights I've been on there was no personal air conditioning control. Food as always was terrible - 2 meals on a 12 hour flight both of which were not nice at all. Breakfast choice always seems to be an egg based dish or seafood congee. I'd rather just have cereal next time. The dinner is always a choice of an oversalted Asian dish a vegetarian pasta dish or something else unappetising. Having already flown the opposite route we luckily knew to take snacks on board so we didn't starve. With Qantas / Emirates I usually end up feeling almost overfed not with Cathay though where you feel like you're in prison. With 2 or 3 hours before landing when breakfast was about to be served my girlfriend noticed that a child on the seat in front had been sick which had trickled between the seats and gone all over her tracksuit pants which were on the floor in front. We tried to get the cabin crews assistance but they continually ignored us. We ended up just putting them in a bag and then throwing them away. Never again!

cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,J Paul,United Kingdom,2013-03-14,BKK-MNL. Flight left 1 hour late though that was beneficial to me. Staff really pleasant and helpful. Plane was clean and cabin announcements clear in both English and Filipino (sometimes I can never hear what's being said). Legroom bad but not unexpected for an economy airline. Food prices very reasonable at about 80p - Â£1.20 for soft drinks and the same again for snacks. Â£5 for a meal but didn't try. Only grumble is the shocking seat reclining pitch. If the passenger in front reclines then you can't even bring your tray down. It was a nightmare. Had to hold drinks in my hands in 20 years of flying never known anything like it!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,1,4,4,1,NA,NA,4,1
cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2012-10-11,BKK-MNL-BKK. Check-in in both BKK and MNL was efficient. NAIA-3 very quick. I usually buy the 20kg Baggage Allowance just to avoid the hassle. Both flights were on time even late in the day but arrival into BKK was delayed because the pilot parked incorrectly and had to be pushed back to the correct position... Cabin Service was fine but the flights were quieter than usual I think because many passengers (me included) are flying Tiger from Clark to BKK because in some cases it's half the price of Cebu Pacific who are not significantly cheaper than Philippine Airlines on some routes. I've been looking at prices over the next few months and Cebu Pacific need to be more competitive if they want to fill their planes like they did a few years back.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2011-11-09,Prices are going up and reliability is going down. All International flights departing MNL last Saturday evening were late. No weather problems just late arrivals of aircraft. BKK was nearly 2.5 hrs late no flight information screens working in T3 and passengers were shuttled around like cattle between gates. I'd really like to know who gets these so called cheap GO Fares because it doesn't matter how far ahead you book nothing is available on the routes I fly. I'll continue to use Cebu because they offer good value for money no frills service but they need to work on reliability which has up to now been very good.

cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2011-07-15,MNL-BKK-MNL 7 times in the past year. No problems at all with online ticketing using a foreign Debit Card. Prices can vary quite a lot from day to day and I've never managed to get one of their so-called very cheap GO Fares. Changes can be expensive and I usually do those at their ticket office in NAIA-3. This terminal is by far the best in MNL. Check-in is efficient in MNL (though less so in BKK) and pre-paying for excess baggage (over 15kg) is now available when you book. Excellent on-time reliability on all flights. For some reason they do run the cabin temperature very cold on the A320 and this can be uncomfortable on a 3 hr+ flight. I've no problem paying for a snack and a drink if the ticket price is significantly cheaper than the competition which it is. No in-flight movies so bring a book. Good value for money on a safe and reliable airline and I'll continue to use Cebu Pacific.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,J Knibbe,Australia,2011-06-14,Seoul-Manila-Seoul satisfactory for a low cost airline. Check-in smooth. I didn't buy any food because it seemed mostly unappealing. The return flight was extremely turbulent and although the turbulence was obviously not the fault of the airline it would have been good to hear some kind of announcements of reassurance from the captain as the atmosphere in the cabin was very tense for most of the flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,Paul Johnson,United States,2011-01-03,Cebu Pacific has low published fares but by the time you pay for seating excess luggage any snacks including water and Anything else you are paying about the same as PAL. Couple this with the arrogant staff and it is not worth it. After my last trip I have decided that even if Cebu Pacific were free I would not use it. The last flight of my last trip was modified online and changed to a later time and I went through the payment process. When checking in I was told that no record existed and because I had missed my previous flight I would have to buy a new and much more expensive ticket. Having no choice I did so but will never fly them again.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,J Hall,Australia,2014-06-17,I flew from Osaka to Ho Chi Minh with a connection in Beijing. The first flight from Japan was ok although staff were quite unfriendly and check in was really slow they took about 15 minutes looking at my passport and visa. The second flight was an hour delayed just boarding - no announcements were made for the reason of the delay. Once we boarded we waited another hour and a half on the plane. Again no announcements were made as to why we were waiting for at least the first hour and no crew were in sight we just sat there. Food was pretty mediocre and when offered a choice of chicken or seafood they then said there was no chicken and I had to wait. It took about 15 minutes for them to bring the food out after serving everyone else and when I asked for it after about ten minutes the crew member just laughed and said you will have to wait. Small uncomfortable seats. However no issues with baggage being transferred which was good and flight itself was pretty smooth.

No problems with ticketing and some very good prices to be had compared to PAL and Thai.

cebu-pacific,/airline-reviews/cebu-pacific,Cebu Pacific customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2010-06-17,BKK-MNL-BKK. Flights a little quieter in recent weeks due to the problems in Thailand. Quite large variations in price depending on precisely which days you travel. Cebu Pacific used to have very good last minute prices - not any more and the cost to change a travel date was about the same price as the original ticket. They're also cracking down hard on excess baggage - 15kg for checked in bags and 7kg hand carry. Don't expect to haggle an extra few kilos for free - and they're checking (weighing) bags again at the gate. I'll continue to use them in favour of PAL or Thai since their prices are still very competitive their reliability in my experience has been very good and NAIA-3 is by far the best MNL Terminal - just don't carry too much luggage.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
china-eastern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-eastern-airlines,China Eastern Airlines customer review,M Atkinson,United Kingdom,2014-10-31,I travelled from Paris to Shanghai in business class. Going out the configuration was 1-2-1. Coming back it was 2-2-2. I have read a lot of negative reviews about this airline but actually it was very reasonable. The business class ticket was very cheap in my opinion. We had full flat bed seats on both legs of the journey which were very comfortable indeed. Food was average. Service was average but typical Chinese standard. Check in at both ends was efficient.

The seats are very uncomfortable there is a very thin padding that separates your body from the metal under the seat. There is absolutely no entertainment no drop down TV screens or personal TV screens. The food is very nasty and tastes inedible the rice was very dry and tasted like it was over a week old the vegetables have no seasoning and tasted horrible the beef was the worst the meat tasted very dry and was under heated as though it were a leftover from another airline it was cooked in a sauce that had no flavor and tasted like water. Passengers randomly got up during take-off and landing when the seat belt sign was on and no flight attendants even tried to tell people to sit down. I will never fly China Eastern Airlines again because of it's terrible service and nasty food.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

We flew from sydney to Guangzhou in January. The service was excellent. For the whole flight staff walked up and down the aisles. They were funny and kind. I think the service made this experience one of the best I've had. Inflight entertainment was fantastic! I was surprised as a lot of movies and songs were pretty recent. The food was quite nice.

Flight pretty much on time and cabin crew were quite attentive. During the 11 hr flight they served 2 meals and 1 snack with rounds of water and juice. The meals were all Chinese but sufficient only choice of pork and fish was offered. The snack was hot and refreshing. The crew try to be friendly with their almost zero knowledge of English. The toilets were clean though no supplies inside no toothbrush or face lotion; only hand-wash. The choice of entertainment was poor though each seat had a screen and a USB port.

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,N Raven,Canada,2014-01-15,CA998 YVR to PEK then CA969 to SIN then back again a few weeks later. These flights employ well-used A330s. Flights smooth and on time. However my economy seat was narrow and very poorly padded - little better than a city bus. The entertainment system was old and tired with a limited selection of movies. Flight attendants did the basics but disappeared for long periods. They did however keep the toilets very clean. Loading procedures were amateur and chaotic as if the ground staff were improvising. Individual staff were OK but as a group they lacked management. This unpleasantness was magnified by the loading at Beijing. For reasons unknown the SIN and YVR flights had to load using buses out to the tarmac (when gates at the main terminal were obviously available). This is not appropriate for a large plane at capacity. Beijing airport is a liability as a hub. It is very large dreary inefficient and immersed in a toxic smog. Moreover as a passenger in international transit I had to go through a passport check and then through the general security check. This gobbled up most of the 3 hours I had for my connection which I almost missed. Unacceptable. Avoid this place.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,2,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

First time travelling with China Airlines and it turned out to be a fairly good experience. 747-400 between YVR and TPE seemed newer but A 330's between TPE-DEL seemed older. IFE was fine and toilets were kept clean and cabin crew was polite and spoke fairly good English. We had a delay at YVR which was not really airlines' fault because the bridge could not be retracted. Apart from that all other three take offs were also slightly late. My only real complaint would be the beverages and food. They seem to be very limited in what they offer.

This is by far the worst in terms of food and amenities. During service for first round of drinks and peanuts the staff did not provide napkins and no I wasn't skipped by accident. The food quality is terrible. What was served was worse than a $2 meal you can get in Shanghai. The rice was hard fish beef chicken all dried out. If you want soft drinks instead of a can you get about 2/3 of a small cup. Selection is extremely limited no ginger ale only 1 kind of beer. Only recommend if this is the cheapest flight you can find. You really get what you pay for in this case. The seats are probably the hardest ever for me on a plane.

Good points: 3 week old 737-800 with passably comfortable seats that reclined and had ample leg room. Food and drink provided for a flight just over an hour long although being a vegetarian the ham sandwich was not to my taste. Bags waiting on the carousel - beware the long walk that characterises modern Chinese airports. Bad points: Twice the price of the outbound flight though to be fair it was a peak time departure (1630). An hour late leaving with no explanation other than the incoming plane was delayed; probably weather related with the after effects of Typhoon Usagi creating havoc generally - the weather at Chengdu was particularly inclement - so why not say so? Failure to control carried-on luggage resulted in chaotic boarding the overhead lockers full with little more than half the passengers onboard - again beware if travelling in China pretty much anything and everything irrespective of size is brought into the cabin. In summary OK a far higher standard than any European airline would provide but I've had better in China notably Sichuan Airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

The headphones aren't great - you'll need a two-pin adapter to use your own ones. There was lots of legroom and the seats were the type that slide forward to recline. This is really important on a flight into China as people recline as far as they can; the person in front of me reclined all the way but this did not impinge on my space. Food was OK - not spectacular but better than I expected.

Before the trip: I spent hours on the phone trying to get hold of a representative to get a seat assignment. No luck. On the outbound segment I missed my connection in JFK (due to a delay from my home city) and could not find a CEA representative anywhere in the terminal. After hours on the phone I was rebooked to a flight the next day. Once I arrived in Shanghai I learned that my flight was cancelled (due to weather not the airlines fault) but the airline could not provide any assistance. A mob of passengers flocked the gate agent.

No personal TV screen system so not sure why they had those annoying boxes under almost all seats. There are a few tiny screens above the seats but unless you sit close to these screens you will not be able to see anything and the movies were dubbed into Chinese with English subtitles so anyone that do not understand Chinese would not stand a chance reading the subtitles.

Food and drinks are pretty good. PJ was distributed for CAN-LAX-CAN legs pretty good quality PJs as well. First suite with A380 is fantastic very private staff did great trip on LAX-CAN leg toilet cleaned every time after passengers used bed was made every time I left. Transit in Guangzhou is also significantly improved you don't have to go through security or immigration for international transfer at CAN. Airline stamp on your boarding pass and you can go straight to lounge or boarding gate. The only down side is staff at CZ lounge in Guangzhou a lot of flights landing at same time around 5-6am but seem the lounge does not have enough staff they are not really helpful either.

The English level of the staff was not high but they were quite friendly and efficient. The food was reasonably good but only Chinese style food was available. The flight out of Dhaka was over an hour late departing and so I missed the connection in Kunming but the staff in Kunming were friendly and reasonably efficient in arranging another flight for the following day and a free night's accommodation in Kunming.

One must give themselves at least 2 hours between flights. Condor have limited gates and the size of FRA requires at least 2 hours for connection. On our return, I was injured a day prior to our flight and we contacted Condor to reschedule our flight and to request a wheel chair and was refused due to their rules for needing at least 7 days notice for any request changes. Flying business class and not having any customer service was astonishing. We had to contact the airport to arrange our own services. When we arrived at the gate in FRA, we were told business class was oversold and we were asked to fly another airline to get home. We asked if wee would be in business class and if we would have seats together and would our luggage be on the flight. The Condor representative assured us all would occur. When we arrived at the other airline, we did not have seats in business class, we did not have seats together, and our luggage was not in their system.

I thought Expedia had ordered a veggie meal for my wife as my e-ticket said it had been 'requested' but apparently this is not the same thing! The stewardess asked if I had paid for it which I hadn't so we weren't getting it. Turns out you have to pay extra for a veggie meal (or any other special diet). Never ever heard of this before on any airline ticket for which meals are included. The seats in economy were narrow and uncomfortable (impossible to sleep) the TV screens were few and very small the washrooms dirty. To top it all after disembarkation at Frankfurt we had a 20 minute bus ride to the terminal. Then we had to walk about 2 miles right across the airport and even go through security again despite being transit passengers before catching our connecting Lufthansa flight to Manchester which we only just made although the layover was nearly 2 hours. Why can't Condor/Lufhansa (both German) connections be simpler than this? The only good points were that they did make up time on the flight (lucky with the prevailing winds I guess) and they didn't lose our luggage!

Although I had booked a vegetarian meal there was no vegetarian option for one of the meals - only a meat sandwich. The flight attendant did not care and I was denied a meal. On the return I asked at check in to confirm my vegetarian meal had been ordered. The reply was along the lines that if there wasn't a vegetarian meal onboard then I should make do with what there was available - eg. remove the meat from the meal. I did receive my vegetarian meal this time but it was frozen and by the time it had defrosted I discovered it wasn't worth the wait.

The flight was at 9.05pm so after walking around trying to find a Darwin representative (who don't exist) I found out that they use Servisair for this job. The women was very polite and understanding and booked me into a local hotel telling me that the next flight was at 12.35 the following afternoon. I arrived back at Schiphol the next day and whilst queuing to drop off my luggage I was informed that there was a 3 hour delay on this flight! I checked my luggage in and settled in for another 5 hours at the airport. At 12ish I happened to just check the departure board to see what the new expected departure time was only to see that the delayed 12.35 flight was no longer delayed and was boarding! There was no information stating this in-between. I then legged it to the departure gate and proceeded to stand on a shuttle bus for a further 20 mins whilst there was a delay in fuelling the plane. Eventually was took off. Just to complete my horrific experience with Darwin I arrived back at Cambridge unfortunately my luggage did not! There was less than 20 people on the plane!

Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra Â£50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video.

Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight â  wonderful.

Why such a circuitous route to Stockholm? Delta's service: I seem to be the lucky person who gets a great flight crew (even when in Coach) good food and on time departures. The upgrade of the business cabin to business elite with lie flat beds was a great way to fully relax and get quality sleep. Even though I am now based in USAIR/American country I still fly Delta - and know a lot of great people in all of their hubs. Only drawback is their very restrictive FF program.

On time departure early arrival. Very tasty meal (Thai chicken) perfectly adequate amount of food. Nice snacks first an ice cream then a sandwich. I really appreciate the large bottle of water everyone gets after the meal service. Inflight service was very efficient though I think the flight attendants could have smiled a bit more. Seat size and pitch were comfortable and I'm not a small person. Inflight entertainment was outstanding - a huge choice of movies both new releases and older classics - that I really didn't want the flight to end.

By booking early we got a very good deal for return flights to Corfu: in fact we would not have chosen Corfu but for the good flight prices. The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg.

Return trip flight was delayed by 90 minutes at Marrakech but they did not announce the delay until 10 minutes after the flight was meant to depart no announcements or explanation until after we had boarded.

These ""premium"" seats offer a pitch of just 37 inches (that's less than JetBlue's premium economy); they also recline quite a bit and the result is a wedge experience which made for one of the most uncomfortable flights I can remember.

The food was fantastic and filling. I liked the fact that there was a great selection of entrees both for the main meal and the meal prior to landing. The seat sort of reminded me of L'Espace Affaires on Air France in 2007. That said it was very comfortable. The only downside is that I was unable to sleep. The flight crew going to Dublin was nothing short of fantastic. The flight crew returning was great but not as good as the outgoing crew. The in- flight entertainment was OK. While I didn't explore as much on the outgoing flight I was able to watch 3 movies I had not seen on the return flight.

There were a lot of Russians on the flights but EasyJet have employed some English speaking Russian flight attendants to handle them. Yes the food wasn't cheap but in quality and price it compared favourably with UK rail and motorway services offerings. Even with the food added to the ticket price costs were less than half of a comparable flight with other airlines.

If it were not for easyJet we would not be able to afford so many foreign trips. Moreover we have always found easyJet staff efficient friendly and helpful. Our most recent trip from Liverpool to Palma and back was typical: on the outward journey the computer system at the boarding gate was down but the agents just got on with checking us through ""manually"" with one of them relaying our boarding card numbers over the phone. Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue. The introduction of allocated seating seems to have made the whole boarding process more relaxed though it does mean that you can no longer vet the passengers in your immediate vicinity before sitting down: on one of our flights we had to suffer seat kicking children behind us with parents who took no notice.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

Flight booked in May for a 13/12 return. One month after booking the return ATL-MAN was cancelled by Delta. Automatically rebooked on a flight for the following day. Delta refused point blank to compensate for the inconvenience and extra nights accommodation. As such we chose to fly back a day earlier then our original plans. My request for compensation was a free upgrade from economy to economy plus on the return Atlantic flight. Simply had the terms and conditions quoted to me. Online check in is a joke. Had seats allocated together on each flight but on clicking the change seat option you will find all other seats marked as unavailable. Options were available to upgrade however at a cost. Our expectations for the flight were therefore low on boarding. However both pleasantly surprised with the flight and service. Transatlantic flight on a B767-300 which featured personal seat back TVs. Good choice although the music channels were a little mainstream for my preference. Food more than OK. Plenty of soft drinks offered and alcohol with the main meal. The return flight was on an older model and featured overhead TVs which didn't matter too much as it was an overnight flight and a good hour shorter in travel time than outward. Both internal flights on a B757-200 were adequate. Seat pitch for all four flights was fine typical of an economy flight. Professional cabin crew on all sectors flown. Touch of humour with the Christmas 2013 flight safety video - certainly kept you watching it. All four flights were full in all cabins all had on time departures and arrivals.

An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,3,1

The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity.

The service on board was fine but the food quite poor. Landing at LUX was quite bumpy too. The return sector was again late this time by 40 minutes but what made that annoying was the flight crew turning up and walking past the waiting passengers at the gate at the time of scheduled departure rather than before as anyone would expect somewhat unprofessional.

During all flights the crew was very kind and professional, I was satisfied with their service. Meals were above average. Only one thing really suprised me  was the entertainment system in A330 flying DXB to WAW.

Paid extra for exit row seats as this was a 4 hour flight and that gave us the option of Speedy Boarding. However not so important now that easyJet have started offering pre-assigned seats which removes the scrum. Speedy Boarding does mean you can drop your bag at a special Speedy Boarding desk rather than queue with the majority of passengers. This saved quite a bit of time at both ends. We had checked in online and the airline's website suggests you just turn up and drop your hold baggage. However Easy Jet's definition of ""bag drop"" sees the same lengthy queues at desks that you would get if you were checking in at the airport. Seats were comfortable with the extra legroom that goes with exit seats. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. The food offering is perfectly adequate for the length of journey.

Departed on hour late but didn't mind as it cut the transit time down in CAI. 737-800 to CAI with older style seats. It is a dry airline so juice or water offered pre take off by crew who did not smile. They also give out hot towels which are so hot you can't actually touch them. No menus offered on either sector toilets not maintained on either sector. Food is well below the usual standard of most airlines but ok ex AMS only. On arrival in CAI a bus meets the aircraft and whisks Business Class away promptly and we were impressed. Once inside the terminal it was a mess. If in transit you must visit the transit check in desk which has long lines of people. We noticed there was a desk just for Business Class so went under the rope only to be yelled at by Egyptair staff. Security was a joke and did not put us at ease. Star Alliance lounge is tired and wifi not working at all. No alcohol in lounge. Toilets are disgusting. On the next sector service was just as poor with unhappy staff and no real flow to the service. Flight stops in BKK for an hour then goes on to KUL. Most people left Business in BKK but staff kept upgrading friends and family in flight which became distracting. Upgraded children running around the cabin and pushing past us. Manager was standing during take off and only just managed to strap himself in as we were climbing into the sky.

It was a full flight and I did not get the seat I requested however that is not unique to Emirates and the aisle seat I had 87H was ok its drawback was being knocked as people navigated the aisle. The noise from the flushing of the nearby toilets was annoying but after 14 hours and 20 minutes it takes very little to mildly annoy you. I received 3 adequate meals receiving a menu would have been nice and would have avoided much confusion and a protracted meal service as the dishes or lack of was explained to questioning passengers. Being seated at the back of the plane meant no choice of meal as they had run short of one of the options. The cabin crew from 19 countries speaking 17 different languages were young and seemed to lack any cohesion or team work. The meal services were seemingly the most unorganised I have seen but everybody ate in the end. The bar service was poor but that might be expected of this carrier but was available if you were prepared to go looking for it. The staff were not overly helpful and frequently served refreshment throughout the flight the cabin staff were commonly found in the galley areas chatting and seemed to lack some direction and co- ordination. The seat was adequate with better leg room than some carriers a foot rest would have been useful. The inseat TV screens and entertainment system were excellent. The onward flight was equally full - EK161 A330 with a similar review. This time a menu was provided and the bar did arrive in time with the meals. We were airborne without being offered any refreshment for almost 2 hours until the meal service commenced and again this was more disorganised and ad hoc than any other airline I have ever experience but again all were fed and watered. Towards the end of the 7 hour 40 minute flight the toilets were dirty the bins overflowing and toilet paper expended. These seats were less comfortable with less leg room and smaller TV screen.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,L Stewart,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,BHX-CMB via Dubai. First and last flights with Emirates. I thought they had a reputation for excellent service but unfortunately in my experience this was not the case. A delayed departure and fog at Dubai meant a late arrival. The biz cabin was not very clean with a stained seat and debris in the drinks holders. The staff appeared disinterested and we were not offered a welcome drink. Thankfully the lie (almost) flat seat was comfortable and the cabin cool so got a decent sleep. The window blind wouldn't shut so woken by dawn over the desert not long before arrival although we were then stacked because of the fog. Huge comms failures at Dubai trying to get a rearranged flight to Colombo. The biz lounge staff couldn't help us so we joined a slow line at the help desk to be told to run to the gate as the new flight was boarding. When we got there the boarding flight was to China! We returned to the desk and also mentioned we had now economy tickets but had been booked in biz. They were unable to help although interestingly the 6 other members of our party had received new boarding passes issued in the biz lounge! Advised that we would get a downgrade voucher (not refund) at gate but the clerk could not do this and advised we would receive it in Colombo. I said this was not acceptable as we did not want to fly Emirates again. They could also not guarantee our re-entry into the biz lounge as the passes said economy! We just walked in anyway! The flight to Colombo was routed via Male lovely apart from the stop and 1.5hrs on the Tarmac meant I missed my pre-conference meeting. At least they left the IFE playing! My colleagues advised the biz cabin had lots of space from Male to Colombo but we were not offered to move. On arrival in Colombo there was no record of the downgrade voucher. On discussing this with the ground staff they said it would be available when I checked in for my return flight. Why do I not believe him? Why would I want a voucher when I will not fly with them again for this terrible service? Ironically my original connection was late leaving and as I only had hand baggage and can run I could easily have made it for that departure. Terrible start to my conference and will not allow me to relax during my week's holiday after when I know I've got to repeat the trip in reverse!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,2,1,2,4,NA,NA,1,0

I got upgraded to Business on the DXB-BKK leg again an A380 which was about 30mins late. The best part of Business on Emirates is a priority pass for immigration in BKK.

Appalling start in the Bidvest 'Premier' lounge at CPT stuffed to the gills and poor quality food and drink. FAs friendly enough on 777-300ER but dinner service slow and the 2-3-2 seats lacked privacy for a night-time flight. 4 hr stopover at DXB fine once the gate for A380 flight to LHR had been identified - no thanks to a discourteous DXB employee. A380 impressively quiet as ever and a pair of E/F seats were excellent for a couple. Lunch service again slow and the main courses inedible.

The Manchester lounge was one of the best lounges I've ever used. The flight to DXB was the A380 - the business seats and service are very good. We never bothered with the bar at the back but it did look good. The business lounge at DXB was fairly gruesome to be honest. To crowded dirty and quite a let down after Manchester. The flight to CPT was a 777-300ER. The seats and facilities are not a patch on the A380 still much better than economy. The service was better probably due to the fewer business class passengers. The return flight was all 777-300ER on both legs. Again the seats weren't the best but the food and service on all the legs was generally very good. The chauffeur service was excellent.

Seat is a little narrow when lie flat but infinitely better than economy. First Class Lounge in DXB was disappointing. Apart from table service for eating I think that the Business Lounge is better.

The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface.

Seats were okay for a 3 hour flight but definitely not as comfortable as on the Qatar Airways or Egyptair 77Ws. On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests.

Every time I fly this airline I swear I never will again - things have not improved. The planes are good but the cabin crew are just horrendous. Without doubt Emirates is the rudest airline I have flown and they are not improving. Instead of asking passengers to do something they demand it. Instead of asking if people would like a landing card they say ""where are you from?"" I think in the entire flight I heard one please or thank you. I really don't care if they don't enjoy their jobs but it would make for a pleasant experience for the pax if they weren't abrupt surly and clumsy.

Emirates staff improved its service since our previous flights one year ago. On board service is good beverages offered very regularly including on night flights. Food and snacks are excellent. IFE was excellent on the Dubai-Singapore leg but quite average on the Abidjan-Dubai one. Both legs were on B777 and the 3-4-3 seat configuration is quite uncomfortable especially for a 2 times 8 hours journey. But the main setback remains the transfer at Dubai with this incredible and uncomfortable 20 min bus drive from the plane to terminal 3 a bit problematic if you have a short time connection and have to queue to security check and walk across those long corridor to reach your departing gate something Emirates whose traffic is mostly longhaul transited through this Airport should fix.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,2,4,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Not Emirates fault as such but I'd have thought the Captain would have had a cut-off time with many more passengers (myself included) having tight onward connections in DXB. In fairness they made up 30 minutes en route. In Dubai passengers with tight connections on late arriving flights are usually gathered together and accompanied through the terminal and allowed to make their connection after the 45-minute cut off period stipulated by Emirates - usually. Cabin Service on all flights was perfectly acceptable but the seats on both the B-777 and A380's are not the best. Food in Economy was of a high standard with plenty of drinks choices.

I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,4,NA,NA,4,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,E Wright,Hong Kong,2014-05-05,Emirates had become my airline of choice because of the great seats and entertainment system on their new A380's. Until my most recent flights I also found their service and food to be among the best. However on my recent flights from HKG to DXB and DXB to Dublin I found both the food and service to be awful. Their switch to serving food in J class on open plates is a disaster. The food ends up lukewarm and dry. I much preferred the sealed container. The food was bland and tasteless. The cabin attendants on both sectors were pretty indifferent. On the second sector service was particularly clueless with wrong orders and lack of apology. I might just look for other options next time I fly. One thing also to bear in mind if you can avoid it - the HKG-DXB route flies over Bay of Bengal. Turbulence here as on my flight can be fairly rough during monsoon season. Also for some reason we had to be bussed to the gate when we reached DXB. The ground journey took 20 minutes. The place where we were dropped off happened to be the confluence between T1 and T3 and as a result a lot of transit passengers headed off in the wrong direction. A frustrating mistake to make at midnight when you are already tired.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,4,5,1,1,5,NA,NA,3,0

Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

LGW-BKK-LGW - all flights were late (up to 1.5 hours) except the DXB-LGW leg. 2.5 hour connections in DXB are now becoming very tight and stressful due to lateness of flights and the inordinate amount of bussing in DXB. Check-In (online) on all flights excellent. As for the flights themselves all very full so Emirates must be doing something right. Cabin Service in Business is OK but nothing special and in Economy is very much dependent on the crew - can be highly variable. On the plus side the in flight entertainment is good the prices are competitive and frequent fliers are frequently upgraded.

Arrived at the airport disembarked and were met by ground staff at 1.40am who advised us the connecting flight had already left. We were sat in the connecting flight area while our baggage claim tickets were taken from us advised that they needed to rebook our flights.

Given a hotel voucher and advised we needed to be back 2 hours before the flight to check-in. 5 hours at the hotel did not seem worth the hassle and we asked if we could instead use the Emirates lounge told no to this request. We finally got to the hotel at 4.30am. When we finally arrived back at Dubai airport to check in to our rebooked flight we were told that as it was an almost full flight there were no seats next to each other left and that we would be sitting in separate aisles and middle seats.

Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar.

On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated.

Crew were friendly though seemed new or a bit lost. Seats are comfortable on the A340. Headsets are top notch but not their entertainment system - not user friendly one and less options. And it doesn't work until half way of the flight and crew collect head sets almost an hour before landing. On the return flight it was almost empty. With a very cold cabin surprisingly there were no blankets on the flight to be offered . No drink rounds. Meal was just a Ramadan Iftar box with some bland sandwiches for a 4 hrs flight. No tea or coffee offered and crew just disappeared. They were very keen on selling their duty free products only. My entertainment system had a problem with the audio and informed the crew - she just apologised with no offer to transfer to another seat with the flight almost empty and many rows were totally deserted and I had to use the entertainment system on the seat next to me which was free as well.

ethiopian-airlines,/airline-reviews/ethiopian-airlines,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,M Carson,United Kingdom,2014-06-10,I flew to and from Nairobi and Addis and made two internal flights within Ethiopia. I was extremely disappointed with the airline: while it feels safe and the in-air experience is reasonable the ground experience at Addis Bole Airport is atrocious: was supposedly the international hub yet they had a single counter open for all ET flights (even after checking in at a kiosk I had to wait an hour in the heat with crying babies) seemingly under-trained staff and/or technical issues at check in completely chaotic baggage reclaim in Terminal 1; poor information and confusing signs. I also received SMS from the airline telling me my domestic flight had been delayed 3 hours and then that it had been cancelled - I therefore arrived 10hours late in Bahar Dar and missed my tour of the city. As it turned out the morning flight had run on schedule all along and with spare seats- yet another sign of the incompetence of the airline. I think the airline is very strong at marketing themselves as a serious international airline ('Proud member of Star Alliance' etc) when in fact it should work at sorting out basic logistics in its operations. Addis faces significant infrastructure problems at presents (including constant electrical interruptions) so no wonder this is a factor holding the airline back.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,2,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

A330-300 on LHR-AUH and 777 on AUH-BKK. Both feeling somewhat tired but the A330-300 was superior as it has a two-four-two configuration. To top it off T3 on AUH was such a big disappointment.

On the second leg though (a long one) the crew were awful. In my view we didn't even get economy class service. Nobody introduced him or herself they staff were off-hand to the point of rudeness the meals took forever to come and the staff didn't respond to any minor requests. For example I wanted a little sugar to sprinkle on my breakfast cereal-I was told that only sugar lumps were available and it wasn't until I suggested that I could go myself and collect some from economy that some appeared! This is just one example of the inadequate and even offensive service. My main course at dinner was almost stone cold and because I had waited so long for it I didn't send it back but it was really horrible. This has never happened to me in scores of long-haul economy flights. Also our trays did not have the correct cutlery on them so we had to keep asking for appropriate utensils. Again this doesn't happen in economy! Another issue was that when one pushed the button for service nothing happened. On two occasions we waited for over ten minutes and nobody appeared.

eva-air,/airline-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,K Chen,Canada,2014-03-27,"LAX-TPE a direct flight on the special Hello Kitty jet. From check-in to landing the service and attention I received was excellent. The check-in staff were very welcoming and when I asked for extra luggage tags and stickers (because they are so cute and definitely something to collect!) she didn't hesitate and gave me a whole stack. The crew were extremely friendly and helpful and made me feel respected and very welcome from the moment I got onboard. They came around with drinks often and they seemed to pay close attention to whether you are asleep or not because it seemed like whenever I got up I was offered drinks snacks and/or food. The toilets were very clean and carried a variety of Hello Kitty amenities and I noticed crew went in to clean up every time someone used it (I was seated close to the washroom). When I asked for some playing cards as a souvenir and one of the crew returned with a smile and several for me to take away. The seat itself is a full lie flat with a large flatscreen TV and lots of movies and tv series to choose from and came with noise-cancelling earphones. What was special was the amenity kit which was a green Rimowa case-and I believe EVA Air is the only one to give these out in Business class. The pillow was very comfortable and had a Hello Kitty motif. The duvet was so light and made from down and under them I had the best sleep I have ever had on board a flight (and I'm a light sleeper!). The only complaint I had was that the seat felt a bit narrow when going inside otherwise when you sit down or lie down there is plenty of space for your personal belongings and to stretch out. I had pre-ordered meals online and was rewarded with wonderful Taiwanese delicacies that smelt and tasted of ""home cooking"". Because it was a Hello Kitty flight the napkins were specially designed and even fruits and desserts had Hello Kitty motifs. The only down-side was that the portions were a bit small but they did not hesitate to give me more food when I asked for it. The bubbly wine onboard Dom Perignon was recently voted best in Business Class. I normally don't drink on a flight but this is definitely not something to pass up. All in all a wonderful flight experience and I would highly recommend it to business class passengers for flying long haul across the Pacific (or even for other long haul flights).",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Though it was a short regional flight (3.5hrs) the Business class service was excellent. The staff were very pleasant and welcoming but most wonderful of the experience was the food on board. Flights originating from TPE carry special food prepared in collaboration with Taiwan's Din Tai Fung restaurant-something you must pre-order online before the flight. The chicken soup and steam dumplings (siaolungbao) were exquisite and memorable even though they were heated on board again. The sparkling wine a sparkling rose served was light and fruity and went well with the food. Though this is not a lie-flat seat but instead a reclining one inside a pod I was surprised how comfortable it was and how long it could stretch (I am pretty tall). So I even managed to take a nice rest on the shortish flight. Highly recommend it and definitely good value for money.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1
eva-air,/airline-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,J Hall,United Kingdom,2014-03-05,Flight from London to Bangkok was OK (just) but the flight back was an awful experience. We were in the middle of 4 seats and both middle seats have a metal box on the seat in front just where one leg needs to go so you end up with one leg at an angle all the time and one foot twisted. Not at all comfortable on a long flight. Seats were hard. On the way out they gave us a menu which listed cocktails liqueurs etc but we were not offered anything other than wine and only 1 glass at that. Food was not very good. Flight back to London from Bangkok was terrible. We had the same middle seats so same problem with where to put your feet. The staff were extremely unfriendly - not one smile from any of them until the point at which we all left the plane. When we asked for a gin and tonic we were treated to glares and when we (plus a number of other passengers) asked for a second glass of wine with the meal it was almost thrown at us.

etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,M Horsfield,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,My wife and I flew in Business from LHR to BKK via AUH on EY18 and EY408 on 16th/17th October. Business Saver fare was an absolute bargain. We booked the limo service from Suffolk to LHR and this arrived on time and dropped us outside T4 for an additional charge of just Â£20 since our home was just outside the 100 mile trip limit. Quick check-in having pre-booked our seats and apart from the pretty useless Fastrack courtesy of Heathrow's disinterested staff we were in the lounge shortly thereafter. As lounges go it was fine - quiet comfortable and good service. Boarded 15 mins before departure with no delay and the gate was conveniently opposite the lounge. Jacket taken and champagne provided. Settled into comfortable seat in the Airbus 340 the excellent cabin staff explained the menu and took orders alongside after take-off drink requests. Flight took off on time and the rest of the inflight service was outstanding. The freshly made steak sandwich as a snack from the kitchen was as good a snack as I have had on any airline. Arrived into AUH on time but we had gated at the old terminal and had to transfer to the new one for our flight to Bangkok. Business lounge was very busy so we went in the First Class lounge and had a shower. Boarded EY408 on time and had a trouble free flight to BKK in a 777 this time but pretty similar set-up. Steak sandwiches just as good. Arrive BKK slightly ahead of schedule and given card to use its Premium lane so was cleared of immigration and collecting bags of carousel in quick time. Return leg was exactly the same with excellent service throughout and punctual arrival into LHR. My only gripe? The complimentary chauffeur. I initially booked one for arrival in BKK to our hotel but never got confirmation and when I tried to it seemed their was some confusion as to eligibility (2 journeys per adult passenger). Since it is hardly an expensive taxi from the airport to downtown Bangkok I cancelled it to make sure that we had the return from LHR to home but given the confusion wanted to make sure this was understood. I had to call Etihad in AUH in the end and it took ages and then started getting calls from the limo company in Bangkok advising what time they would be collecting us! When we arrived back at LHR they had organised a car for me and a car for my wife! We declined and continued our journey together. Seems like the system on these could be improved but it did not detract from the superb service.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Champagne only served with the dinner service. Food ex AMS very bland. Spicy seafood dish that I pre-ordered online was nothing but spicy and no sauce to go with the steamed rice. Dinner service seemed very rushed. Pre-dinner drinks not offered. A bottle of water was passed out to each customer and then the crew appeared again only in time to serve breakfast 2 hours before landing. AVOD systems was good with ample videos and audio programmes. No chance of sleeping on these seats. They are not fully lie-flat. You keep slipping down despite being given a comfort pillow which you place under your legs. It did not help. The duvet and pillow were of good quality. Toilets were kept spotless throughout the flight. On arrival into BKK our Priority baggage arrived first at baggage claim. The return flight was an afternoon flight. The crew didn't seem as rushed and were much friendlier. Again same aircraft type same seats. Catering out of BKK was just as disappointing. The salad consisted of a few large leaves and a few tomatoes. Although I love salad this just wasn't appetizing. Again the main entree very bland. Wines OK. The best plate is dessert. It consisted of 2 small cakes raspberry ice cream a cheese plate and crackers and a nice selection of fruit. Coffee was brewed individually for each guest. The onboard bar in this class was not stocked so you could not go and help yourself to refreshments or snacks as their website advertises. At both stations it was an on time departure and arrival.

A new policy that you only get 2 limo transfers per trip I am gold but the person traveling me was not. Bangkok refused to confirm if my travel companion could travel with me on the London transfer. It took 4 phone calls in London to get it sorted. Menu choice is now boring. Entertainment system is full of old movies. The seats on the BKK to AUH sector are old.

Took several round trip flights between Singapore - Budget Terminal and Kuala Lumpur - Subang in July. On time flights new aircraft. Low fares with no extra charges for seating checked baggage or refreshments unlike on budget airlines. In particular departing and arriving at Kuala Lumpur Subang is very quick and much closer to Petaling Jaya and downtown Kuala Lumpur. Only quibbles are that the ATR72 can be bumpy in turbulent weather and that the food (muffin) & drink (juice) onboard are uninspiring.

She called Fiji department of immigration from US to get clearance and made us wait 20 minutes during check in realising that we did not need any visa she did not apologise at all instead she mentioned that we are not allowed to go to Fiji and we have to transit to Australia (which obviously was our intention in the first place).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,3,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

flybe,/airline-reviews/flybe,Flybe customer review,A Ahmed,United Kingdom,2015-04-08,"STN-NCL. The booking process is confusing and unclear there is a constant feeling you're trying to be tricked into paying for things you don't want. Online check in did not work and seems to be a common recurring problem going by other reviews here I fly with only hand baggage for these short hops so I can arrive later at the airport and walk through without having to queue at a desk - this defeats the point of this if I have to check-in the old-fashioned way. Of course I didn't get a window seat because they had been taken and I didn't want to pay the obscene charge to pre-select. They chose Stansted for this route - this airport is decrepit and dark security is overcrowded and a mess with poor management of queues. Moving on to boarding - the misinformation flyBe give which adds to passengers frustration - we were told we had to be at the gate 45 minutes before the flight this is excessive and pointless. Arriving at the gate the board said it was open - it wasn't with no one about. Then it said they were boarding again it wasn't. Then finally 15 minutes before the depart time said gate was closed - we haven't even boarded. We didn't board until the scheduled depart time. Boarding was on foot in the rain with no bus or sheltered path. Upon boarding it was clear the Dash 8 Q400 aircraft had seen better days cabin looked very tatty and tired and a lot of passengers didn't seem to be aware of the size limitations for cabin baggage boarding took significantly longer than it should have. The seat itself was thin hard and unsupportive and looked very tatty with scratches and frayed bits hanging off. Departed 15 minutes late with no explanation or reason given for the delay. Cabin Service Manager was friendly but her colleague was surly and stroppy. FlyBe like to pretend they are above the low-cost carriers such as easyJet but they are anything but and this is very poor replacement for the easyJet's flight from/to Gatwick that were ended at the end of March - not only with the odd flight times and use of Stansted but also because of the poor quality of their short-haul product. It's ironic with their current tag line of ""Faster than road or rail"" they are trying to compete with these forms of transport but with the delays it is anything but and the overall experience is so joyless - it is doing the opposite and I will probably save the hassle and get the train next time.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,1,2,2,0,NA,NA,3,0

Approached this flight with some trepidation after reading a lot of negative reviews on this product. Well it's definitely not Emirates but it also was not a bad experience for me. The connecting flight from Amsterdam was fine. A tiny curtained off Business section with economy seating with middle seats left vacant. A pleasant dinner good Champagne and on time. From Helsinki to Singapore was one of the old A340s (OH-LQA in this case). First impressions were favourable with the cabin being spacious and clean. We had pre flight drinks and a snack and left on time. Once seated I tried the seat out and it's more of a recliner but seemed ok. Menus drinks and dinner all happened smoothly and quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed my supper. It's a bit of a no frills offering but enjoyable and had nice wines also. IFE is poor. The screens are tiny and the offering is limited and old. Didn't really matter as I wanted to sleep as much as possible and despite the seat being at quite an angle I managed a few good hours. Breakfast was simple but tasty. So overall the experience was a good one - on time fed and slept well. If you want the deluxe business experience it's not this but as a lower priced business option that keeps me out of economy it does the job admirably.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,5,4,2,NA,NA,5,1

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,K Singer,Australia,2014-08-14,Flew SIN-HEL-ZRH return. With Finnair Business Class you get what you pay for. Finnair uses an old leased Air France Aircraft on these Routes and they have not been updated or refurbished for years. The seats are old and worn and certainly could use a bit of TLC. On the outward flight the inflight entertainment system in my seat was not working and the lights in Business Class could not be switched off during the night. Space is good but if in stretched out setting you tend to slide down the Seat. Cabin Service on all Flights was excellent but Cabin Crew were quite frustrated with the problems associated with those ageing aircraft's. The New Menu's advertised on Finnair websites was not offered on these Flights. Overall the Flights were reasonably Ok but Finnair Business Class on these old aircraft's is only second or third Tier compared to other Airlines.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,2,4,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

AY uses their A340-300 on the HKG route and was lucky to get OH-LQC (year 2007) on the HKG-HEL leg with their latest greyish interior and newest IFE. Some operational problems at HKG Airport: the plane was taken to gate at midnight just 20 mins before departure and finally took off 2 hours late due to heavy traffic but arrival at Helsinki Airport only 30 mins late. Was lucky to get two seats on the last row for myself on this full flight but the IFE didn't work on either seat so slept all the way. Two hot meals served on this 10 hr flight: two meal choices at night but only one option for breakfast - hot meals quite small but otherwise OK. Leg room and seat comfort was good enough for a 7-hour sleep. Cabin crew professional and friendly (a mix of Finnish and Asian cabin crew) and the flight pleasant in general but cost cutting is visible in many areas which quite frankly puts Finnair way behind MH or CX.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

fiji-airways,/airline-reviews/fiji-airways,Fiji Airways customer review,S Davison,Australia,2011-02-19,LAX-NAN-BNE. I booked the ticket for a very good price at last minute and was not sure what to expect. Check in at LAX the toughest part - I am a professional musician and fly regularly with my instrument I was informed at the check-in desk that I would have to pay $50 USD for extra equipment and gate check the instrument as the flight was full and it wouldn't fit in the overheads on a 747-400. Check in clerk got the manager who advised me they would tag the instrument and if the flight crew deemed it too large than I would have to gate check it. This was great as I never have a problem with any flight crew and I know it fits in any over head locker it's smaller than most peoples carry on bags and very precious to me. LAX-NAN was fully booked and the overhead lockers were packed I did what I do every flight and presented myself at boarding at the front of the line secured my space in the overheads and took my seat we managed to fit everyone's carryon's from the row behind me my row and the row in front in the over head bin. The food was OK entertainment system was awful but I never use them. I did manage to catch a movie when I awoke 3 hours outside of Nadi they seemed to have got the system working by then. Seats were comfortable cabin crew friendly more so than Qantas. Nadi was unorganised with 3 departing transfer flights leaving at the same time roughly with one transfer desk with two staff for everyone. I think the entire 747 was transferring. There was also another security check point after the transfer desk which I thought was strange. NAN-BNE was great on time and no problems on a 737 had an entire row to myself on a 4 hr flight! I didn't bother with the entertainment again as I stretched out and slept the duration of the flight. Got all my luggage with no problems walked straight out onto the street and into the car. Cheap good Service excellent flight crew good friendly cabin crew on time and spacious. Against - charges for equipment despite it being my carry on. Food only OK Entertainment system poor.

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,Jennifer Bentley,United Kingdom,2014-01-30,LHR-HEL-SIN HKG-HEL in Jan 2014. Short haul was pleasant. Lounge at Helsinki was fairly quiet but this obviously depends on the time of day. On HEL-SIN sector we had seats 6 A and C bulkhead in the A340. We got some rest but the seat is not conducive to sleep. Why on earth any airline serves a meal at midnight defeats me so we declined and tried to get some sleep. On arrival at SIN we had use of Qantas lounge for our ongoing flight with BA codeshare. Overall the flight and lounges for the outgoing sector were fine. The return was awful: Finnair uses Plaza Premium lounge at HK which is poorly equipped uncomfortable old seating and it's a very long walk to the gates. No announcements were made (and we were told this) but the only flight screen info is one which scrolls through the next 24 hrs flights. With no help from the lounge staff we decided to make our way to the gate about 45 mins before departure: a good thing we did since the flight was not showing as boarding as we left the lounge but the extremely long walk to the gate meant that we were some of the last to board. Although the flight was scheduled to be on an A330 with flat bed seats it was an old 340 and sleep was difficult. Staff are pleasant but not particularly proactive. Not sure I'd fly with AY business again unless I was assured of a flat bed. I understand they are upgrading most of the fleet this year.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,3,3,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

Finnair is strict on weight of cabin baggage - they actually checked it. During the Delhi - Helsinki flight an additional round of drinks were served between the two meals which was welcome. Crew seemed friendly and efficient but not as warm as other airlines. Quality of food was very low - greasy and small in quantity probably because Finnair sells snacks in between meals. Return flight of six hours in the night was packed and crew did 4 hours of service for dinner and breakfast interspersed with announcements so ensured passengers did not get sleep. Cabin lights were not dimmed prior to take off and during landing. Average airline and not the best. Helsinki Vantaa airport was a breeze.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,4,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,Tapani Utunen,Finland,2012-08-07,HEL-SIN-HEL on A340 in June-July 2012. Haven't flown with them for 4 years because competitors have been cheaper on long haul. Flights packed to the last seat but both flights on time two hot meals served on this 11-12 hr flight pleasant and adequate service by a Finnish-Chinese-Malay cabin crew and the IFE worked well on both flights. However there is room for improvement on this 4-star airline: Meals from Helsinki Airport flight kitchen are bland and cheap quite the opposite on the SIN-HEL leg with tasty chicken or beef plus a proper hot breakfast IFE is too limited. A wider range of newer films are needed. No overnight pack (socks etc) which is a standard on many airlines. The price was right this time and we felt it was good value. Moreover their new uniforms are quite classy. When the price is right Finnair will be considered again although they are clearly behind many other 4-star airlines (LH TG TK etc.).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,5,3,3,NA,NA,4,1
frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,A Young,United States,2015-05-13,I took Frontier from LAX to DEN to DWT. In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels. Overall I had a good flight both ways and would recommend Frontier based on this experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,0,5,NA,NA,4,1

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,L Gonzalez,United States,2015-04-17,Flight F9 1256 4/15/15. I was worried about my flight today after reading all of the negative reviews but I must say that I was pleasantly shocked! This was probably one of the best flights I've experienced flying out of O'Hare airport or other airports for that matter. Our flight even departed a little earlier than planned. It was a pretty early flight so I did sleep the entire way which was very uncomfortable because the seats have little cushion and do not recline. Since I slept throughout my flight it didn't matter to me that there wasn't any entertainment or wifi. Also I like that the cheaper option is to check a bag in. I decided to pay more for a carry on and the process to board and off board is so much faster since many elect the cheaper option to check their bags but also there was plenty room available in the overhead compartments. For the price I paid for the ticket and because I am an anxious flyer pilot skill is more important than the seating or entertainment. The fact that I was able to sleep on a flight which is very rare is important to me. I think Fronteir is exactly what it markets itself as an economy Airbus. Expect to get from point A to point B nothing more. Plan on bringing a pillow and a book to make the flight more comfortable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,1,3,0,2,NA,NA,4,1

Finnair is increasingly using their E90 planes on their central European routes and quite frankly these small planes are suitable for max. 90 min flights due to cramped seating and narrow aisle. The planes are new though and in good condition and Finnair crews usually make a good impression in a cool Nordic way but the cramped seating on E90 makes the whole experience somewhat claustrophobic.

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,D Petersen,United States,2015-02-24,This was my first trip with Frontier. We flew from Cleveland to Las Vegas return. I opted for the stretch seats. The flight was delayed slightly on the outbound leg but this was communicated to us before we arrived at the airport. It was really not a problem. The ground staff were friendly and efficient. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The stretch seats were worth every cent of the small supplement payable ($25 per person per leg of the flight). The aircraft was a modern Airbus A320 which was clean and comfortable. The return leg was exactly like the outbound. I will not be giving five stars however. Upon arrival at Cleveland 5.45 am we were directed to a piece of taxiway until a stand could be found for us. The delay amounted to 45 minutes. That is unacceptable at that time of the morning and Frontier and Hopkins need to address it. I will have no hesitation in recommending the airline with that caveat.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

IFE is poor in comparison to other major carriers. A330 has lie flat seats but if travelling as a couple avoid the left hand seats as there is less room than in the middle paired seats. A340 on return was awful for sleeping: the low back shell design means limited space in footwells and the seat does not go flat. I'm 5ft 8 and could not fit into the space to lie down. European leg was economy seat with middle seat vacant. We'd booked flights to Australia so the onward connections were with Qantas (on Finnair codeshare) who have great seats and lounges.

garuda-indonesia,/airline-reviews/garuda-indonesia,Garuda Indonesia customer review,A Ahmed,United Kingdom,2015-05-10,LGW-AMS-LGW. Price for the May Day Bank Holiday weekend was fantastic value. A small gripe is that you can't fully check-in online at the moment although seats selected up to 24hr prior to flight are usually honoured upon completing check-in at the airport and I know Garuda are working on this adding the ability to have mobile boarding passes. For now this does mean having to arrive a little early at the airport even if you only have hand baggage and completing check-in manually which is probably more of an issue on this short-hop sector than is likely for a full long-haul flight. Outbound this wasn't such an issue as there wasn't much of a queue but Inbound there was a considerable queue at Schiphol for economy check-in. Check-in staff were very efficient however and warm and friendly. Outbound flight left a little late with a short delayed arrival in Schiphol. Aircraft was an immaculately maintained fairly new 777-300ER in 9 abreast layout with good comfortable seating. The interior was beautifully designed and reflective of Indonesian culture. AVOD was ok although not as comprehensive as on some other carriers. Kept informed by Pilot and announcements in English Indonesian and Dutch. On both sectors Cabin Crew were great and immaculately presented. The crew on the inbound flight were much warmer which I preferred. The slight disappointment was the small snack served with only water which is virtually identical on both sectors. Whilst I don't expect anything on short-haul flights and have flown on low-cost carriers on flights that have cost more and not received anything this is a full service carrier with a 5-star rating and what was served was below the standard I was expecting from a full-service short-haul product.

She would not issue our boarding passes until we lowered the weight of our carry-on bags from the high amount allowed on the Delta flight to the 5 kg. We had to have the checked bags brought back from the bowels of the airport so we could move items from the carry-on bags to the checked bags.

After a stay over in Bahrain the second leg to BKK was in a non-refurbished cabin (travel tip: get a set in row 1 or 2 as these seats are better). The cabin was old worn but clean. Service and food matched the first leg and was excellent. The old entertainment system was next to useless but a tablet like device was handed out which was well specked with movies and series and the selection was better than the AVOD system in the refurbished cabin.

Cabin temperature was freezing and when I asked for a blanket was informed that I would have to pay for this a pillow would also be provided as part of this fee (a lot of help that would be to me when I arrived in Honolulu). The 'meal service' if you could call it that was appalling. Our meal consisted of soggy watermelon cantaloupe and a few grapes served with cheese and crackers. Also informed that to use the inflight entertainment I would have to purchase a set of aircraft earphones as well as pay per view for movies/TV shows. So much for the Aloha friendly airline advertised on their ensuite. Flight staff were rude and unhelpful obviously not happy to be in the job.

The flight attendants were friendly and helpful the seats comfortable for these 2 short flights and the meals were quite tasty too. The leg from BAH-MCT was in a fairly old plane and the seats were showing signs of wear. The lounge in Bahrain airport was comfortable and spacious though they don't give announcements for flights so you just have to make your way down to the gate at about the right time (which for us was always too early).

Cabin crew not smiling and are always in a hurry they disappeared after the meals were served. Only one round of drinks given. Garbage on the floor and crew did not bother to pick them up.

gulf-air,/airline-reviews/gulf-air,Gulf Air customer review,A Fleming,United Kingdom,2012-06-13,LHR to Kabul return. Outbound excellent check-in and very impressive Gulf Air lounge. Onboard A330 seating was ok but short of offerings by their Gulf based competitors. A good menu available well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines and other beverages. Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast.

Passengers left the queue and returned as told and at approximately 7pm they told us to wait until 19.30. Eventually at 20.30 they told us to wait for another announcement which would tell us whether we could fly or not. There was no offer of water or biscuits or any sort of remedial gestures at all. Finally at 9pm we were told that the flight was ready and we were sent to the plane. We had to wait for another 90 minutes onboard before we could take off. Plane left Hong Kong International Airport at 11pm. Unfortunately that was not the end of the story. The flight attendants sold food and drinks on the plane. As we were all very tired and hungry passengers almost all of us had to buy food from them.

Per my previous post this airline could be good. Pluses: new A330 aircraft flights on time decent 2 piece 70 lb baggage allowance for international pax the crew on the final four sectors were much more enthusiastic in serving their passengers (HA445 in particular) the web check-in and bag drop at all airports worked well. The pluses end there. Minuses: For international passengers the food/beverage and inflight entertainment is dire. Can see why US passengers might rate them highly given what they endure domestically! What's with the bland chicken and rice dishes on all lunch and dinner flights? The free F+B offering on SFO-HNL breakfast run consists of 4 grapes 4 slices of melon a piece of cheese and 2 packs of crackers? HA should charge a couple of bucks more and get serious with their offerings or drop the pretence of food completely and charge for a decent offering. The 'complimentary IFE' is a joke in content despite the new A330 planes even the pay per view movies (US$7.99 a pop) were exceedingly limited in choice. The HA terminal in HNL and terminal in LIH are in a time warp but suspect this to be the fault of the airport authorities (and TSA is certainly outside HA's control). Like I said all's not lost this airline certainly is no 4/5 star airline but it could be halfway decent with a few weeks. For the price paid not really good value.

The outbound flight was made on an A330 that was so old that there was no button on the armrest to turn the light on and off. (I remember this because a flight attendant who saw me reading asked me if I needed her to turn on the light.) The return trip was on a newer A330 equipped with the latest IFE. However none of the Hollywood movies listed in the airline's magazine was available for viewing so I occupied myself with its games. While this was only a 2.5-hour flight full IFE was available when I flew with HKA on the even shorter route to and from Shanghai in 2012. Beverage selection was good but food consisted only of a bun wrapped around some meat on both flights. Perhaps HKA expected its passengers to have eaten right before boarding? What HKA could do right before boarding is to board passengers by row number so that they won't have to form a long queue well before boarding begins and get in each other's way inside the plane. For short flights (three hours or less) I'd recommend HKA but mainly because of price.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

Meals the same bland poached chicken bits on rice with broccoli (ex AKL) and diced carrots/peas (exHNL). Not worth staying up for esp when served at 2 am out of AKL!

I gave the porter a tip but still did not get a priority tag. No information given about lounge access had to find lounge on my own. Overall a very chaotic unfriendly check-in process. Lounge at HNL airport very basic staff ok not overly friendly. On board the service was good and so was the food and wine. The seats however have only minimal recline and were not very comfortable in the upright position. Overall ok for a 5 hr flight but longer flights would be a problem.

A few things about the Q400: This is not an old or aged aircraft. They are extremely fuel efficient compared to jet aircraft. They can cover shorter legs in approximately the same time as regional or larger jets. They tend to be a bit noisy on the inside particularly between rows 6 and 10 which are nearest the engines. Most of the examples in Horizon's fleet are less than five years old. I like the fact the Q400 can be boarded and deplaned from both front and rear making both processes faster than larger aircraft. I agree that this is not an airplane that you would probably want to spend more than about 90 minutes on at a time. I greatly prefer the Q400 to the Bombardier regional jets also flown by Horizon. Horizon's flight attendants are the best. Boarding in Seattle Spokane and Portland is frequently a bit trying.

We had tried to upgrade to first the day before (you can to it at a reduced charge 24 hours in advance) but fc seats already filled. No matter. Didn't see that much of a difference.

I was seated in Seat 2b. The flight on the way home was a newer Boeing 767. I was seated in 1A and it was better. Hawaiian Airlines should not say these are Business Class Seats.

The in-flight entertainment systems were working on all 4 flights, they were all basically on time except for one that was about 45 minutes late taking off. All of the planes seemed in good shape to me and were clean. The seats in economy were much roomier than other airlines I've been on. Plenty of leg room. I have had issues with the seat belts being tight on other airlines and this is the first time I have had plenty of extra slack with the seat belt. I also found the seats to be a little wider than what I have experienced in the past. I did purchase a couple of snack items from their menu and they were very good. They offer a wide selection of items to eat for many different tastes. The attendants were all excellent, going out of their way to help and bring pillows, blankets, headphones, etc. I noticed one lady was offered an iPad to watch when her screen wasn't working and another passenger was moved to an empty seat to be more comfortable. I myself was offered a seat up in SAGA class when I mentioned I wasn't feeling well. I did not take them up on it but I appreciated the offer being made. I think this is a really good airline and they do not seem budget in any way even though their low prices tell a different story.

I flew to Portland to visit friends with a 4 day stopover on the way back in Iceland which is included at no extra cost. I think I agree with the review by M Brown on the 20th March, people are being are rather unfair particularly with regards to the catering situation on Icelandair - they are very clear on what the product being offered here is and there is opportunity once booked to add food from the regular menu at a discount before flying and this is served to you before the main food service begins. I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained. Outbound from Gatwick the plane was a bit older and had no IFE, but this was ok for the short flight to ReykjavÃ­k and I was notified 24hrs prior to departure of this via text. On the long-haul sector from KeflavÃ­k to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so! Flying back to ReykjavÃ­k was pleasant with blankets and cushions provided for this overnight sector and IFE was newer and the the best of all the sectors with a clear picture. My return to London a few days later was also fine with everything on schedule and generally pleasant. One thing that didn't work on any sector was mobile boarding passes - this didn't work on a single sector for me, but I easily received a paper version in most cases.

On the American air carriers, the first and business class passengers are always boarded first prior to the economy class. The only time Icelandair did this was at Newark. At the European airports, everyone was asked to board at the same time. When we confronted Icelandair, they said they didn't have the facilities to do this. You don't need facilities. All you need is to use the microphone to call out asking for the Saga class to board. The wine choices were good. The food was typical airline food. The attention from the FA's was very good.

I believe we had the latest business class seat and the storage space around this is excellent - a lot better than BA business class. Staff were attentive and polite. I declined the late night meal as I wanted to sleep but breakfast was very good. The only downside was in the earlier connecting flight LHR-MAD with the usual business arrangement for European flights i.e. economy seat but 3 seats between 2 people.

On the positive side they are generally punctual and if you fly one of them new A330-300 and A340-600 then the experience is satisfactory however flying on one of their old A340 (there are still quite a few in service) is a truly miserable experience as the seats are uncomfortable and cramped and the entertainment system is limited to a few screens for the whole cabin. Food is generally speaking mediocre and the crew service ranges from indifferent to fairly polite. I find their policy of charging for selecting a seat and food on European routes really mean and I really wish they stopped doing that.

Worst about this was when flying at night the seats are about as comfortable as economy seats due to lack of flap reclination and no leg support. Also dirty table top. The food was ok and service adequate but nothing special. The entertainment unit was old fashioned and unresponsive so always jumping back and forth 2 pages instead of one. Another annoying experience is the lounge in Reykjavik for stop over flights. It is before passport control and US gates. In the lounge no one tells you when to leave or how much of a queue there is for passports so I went when boarding started but was far too early at the gate just standing around. The other time I went later but there was enormous queues for passport control so I had to run afterwards to the gate.

icelandair,/airline-reviews/icelandair,Icelandair customer review,D Jones,Canada,2010-09-18,Economy Comfort Class Toronto-Reykjavik-Helsinki return. A mixed experience flying Icelandair but generally great and decent value for money. Crew were professional and courteous on all flights aircraft clean and modern and flights on time. One of the perks of booking Economy Comfort Class is often the ability to reserve seats in the Saga Class cabin - ie business class seats for economy prices. I was sat in these seats on all 4 sectors which made for a relaxing and comfortable journey. Icelandair seems to oversell economy pushing these passengers into the Economy Comfort cabin and the Economy Comfort passengers moved to the rear of business class. Other benefits were priority check-in - a huge bonus in Reykjavik where as a previous report states early morning is total chaos in the check-in area. Saga lounge was good and a welcome place to spend transit time. One negative is the onboard service. They promise meal service on all flights but the reality is you get a free sandwich or snack from the buy onboard economy offering as they pass through to serve economy - not really as advertised.

The FA on both flights a mixture of Japanese and Europeans were attentive friendly and efficient. The meals were good although they were understandably targeted at the Japanese palate. The IFE was also good with big flat screens in Business Class and touch screen controllers. Overall the cabin was excellent with a very comfortable flat bed a decent amount of space and unobstructed access to your seat irrespective of its location. The only slight negative was the fact that the middle seat in each row (which have a 2x3x2 configuration) that I had on both legs can feel rather isolated with its high partitions either side and the over head bins above. Service at HND was excellent too benefiting from the brand new international terminal facilities. The JAL Business Class Lounge was clean comfortable and reasonably quiet.

The legroom was great due to WestJet putting in new slim seats but these were a bit hard and uncomfortable on your posterior. The other negative aspect was the complete lack of in-flight entertainment system! The reason given was that WestJet is rolling-out a new entertainment system where you can use your smartphones/tablets but this wasn't ready yet. They did however rent tablets with pre-loaded movies which seemed were quickly snapped up and looks like an extra way for them to make cash.

They comment that the plane look old and very worn out inside the air system was very loud and the toilet door would not shut having to be repeatedly slammed throughout the flight. The plane was in fact no spring chicken at 28 years old. My parents were last aboard as there were large groups of young fit men aboard and in their 70s they can't move like they used to. This shouldn't have been an issue as they were booked on the front row. Unfortunately Jet2 seem to be of the opinion that people on the front row don't need an overhead locker. Whilst they only had two very small bags (not roll on cases) they asked the stewardess to help them find some space. At which pointed she shouted at my tiny assuming mother in law that she should have got on the plane earlier. Frankly my mother in law was astonished by this rhetoric. Someone is always going to be last on the plane does that mean they don't have a right to stow their luggage. Of course their luggage ended up miles away so getting off was difficult. As usual Jet2 ran out of sandwiches and of course as usual their flights were booked at convenient times at a premium compared to other airlines and changed to an inconvenient one with no refund.

jet2-com,/airline-reviews/jet2-com,Jet2.com customer review,M Wilson,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,Flight from Arrecife to Glasgow airport on January 6th 2014. Several weeks prior to flight the times were changed meaning a later arrival at Glasgow on the return flight. At Arrecife the plane began to taxi to the runway then stopped. The captain announced a small technical fault. The plane was directed back to the stand and engineers called. As it could not be fixed it was finally decided to return to Glasgow flying low in the hope the fuel would last the journey otherwise we would have to land and refuel at Manchester. The arrival at Glasgow was just under 3 hours late meaning we did not get home until almost 2am. On the flight from Arrecife we were sitting in the plane for over 2.5 hours before take off and only the children were given water. The adults had to pay for drinks including water. They also ran out of food. I would now rather fly from Scotland to Gatwick and then onward with a different airline as Jet2 seem plagued by technical faults and have spoiled the end of three holidays for us.

If we paid there were plenty of seats together if we wanted them. I don't know if they charge extra for people wanting to stay together in the same room when people book a holiday! On the return flight they just has one desk open for most of the time to check in at. At the airport over 2.5 hours before the flight we spent most of the time standing waiting to get checked in. We then had to wait 30 minutes on the plane while the rest of the passengers tried to get through security.

japan-airlines,/airline-reviews/japan-airlines,Japan Airlines customer review,J Rose,United States,2011-10-16,NRT-SYD in Premium Economy. This cabin is a well-priced alternative to economy in theory contains shell-style seats good IFE etc. My biggest complaint is related to legroom. Although Premium Economy has more advertised legroom than Economy due to the presence of large metal boxes (presumably supporting the IFE) under the seat in front of me I couldn't fully extend my legs which made it hard to sleep hence negating the value proposition. I did notice these boxes throughout the cabin so suspect it wasn't just my seat. And I'm neutral to negative on the shell seat as well. Yes it is nice that nobody is reclining in your face but the slide is awkward and I don't find it terribly comfortable. Food in Premium Economy much more akin to Economy than Business.

I had a few queries before I left that were always promptly replied to via email and one of the passengers had given me her married name and only realised it was her maiden name on her passport the day before we were due to fly. I rang Jet2 and they sorted it out right away at no cost which was brilliant. We only took hand luggage but they let us put it in the hold anyway.

Once again and we were ready for it this time it came with the same bag of crackers and bread roll and everything the same as I had been given. Once again it is advertised as GF when it is clearing not entirely GF. In this day and age when Gluten Free products are readily available and more often than not come in air tight long life bags can you not create a GF bag of bread roll crackers muffin etc. and put them in a different coloured bag that can be easily identified by the crew.

Usual ancient 757-200 but clean and plenty of legroom in standard seats. Bonus is not being able to recline so passenger doesn't bash you in the face and take up your personal space. The only problem is that the seats are just so uncomfortable as the are made of thin sweaty plastic that give no support. Had to stand for 30 minutes during the flight to get any feeling back in my legs and bottom. Next time I'm taking a cushion! Cabin crew pleasant and efficient. Landed 20 minutes early at EMA.

Whilst the flights were on time the plane was old (27years!) and the crew were badly trained and inexperienced and safety was compromised on the return flight. On the outbound I'd arranged a champagne gift in advance to my partner and the crew were late in providing it and asked them if they had ordered it - completely lost the surprise!

No one at the airport in Toronto could help me and one Westjet worker at the baggage area even told me I should have informed them that I had a tight connection and they would have sent them to Moncton (my final destination) with the next Westjet flight even though I was connecting with Air Canada. This was completely astonishing and untrue. When has it ever been ok for you to leave your bags and go on a flight with a different carrier and expect the other carrier to send your bags along. Anyway all Westjet reps I spoke with at Pearson told me to call the 1-800 number on the website which I did and I was told that 2 hours is not enough time for a connection with a domestic flight. Finally I called back again and spoke to someone who offered me a $200 travel credit with them.

Air Canada's inflight entertainment is somewhat superior - they offer a wider variety of audio and video entertainment gratis while Westjet offers certain TV channels for free and premium programming (Movies and certain TV programs) at additional cost (there is a slot to swipe a credit card in the seatback to pay for this). I did find it annoying that the channel displaying the aircraft's position (a personal favorite) was 80% Westjet advertising and only 20% map.

We caught a train (frequent service) to Luton Parkway from central London and were transferred to the Silverjet terminal by complimentary taxi. All relatively straightforward. Check in was the best I have ever experienced- staff take your passport and whilst you sit in the lounge enjoying breakfast they complete the check in procedure. Very stress free. Our outgoing flight was an hour late in departing due to adverse weather conditions but passengers were kept updated and the pilot himself came into the lounge to introduce himself and explain what was happening. This was representative of the whole experience - staff friendly (they ask onboard how you wish to be addressed) and courteous but informal which is a very pleasant departure from other airlines I have been on. Food was better on the outbound leg and the departure lounge in New York is a little small but overall this was one of the best airline experiences I have ever had and despite the inconvenience of leaving from Luton will certainly be using them again.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Barr,United Kingdom,2007-11-06,Luton-Newark-Luton. I found this for the money an excellent service with just a few niggles. Plus points are the really excellent and stylish lounge at Luton; the quick and simple check-in and boarding procedure there; polite and enthusiastic staff on the ground and in the cabin; the food and its presentation; and general impression of stylishness and design. Personally I find Luton perfectly accessible from central London: trains from Blackfriars (London Bridge Farringdon and Kings Cross are other stops) every 20 minutes or so and a cab to the terminal. There is simply no comparison between the check-in and security experience with Silverjet at Luton and Heathrow or Gatwick whatever the airline and however elevated the class. The niggles: though I had printed out my confirmation and several other web pages my computer packed up a day or so before I left and I could neither check in online nor order a car from Newark to Manhattan. I tried to ring Silverjet to arrange the latter but could find no telephone number on the website; obtained the number from new unimproved directory enquiries but despite my 'phoning several times at various hours over the next two days no-one ever answered. When I checked in they agreed to send an e-mail requesting this but it was almost as if this was an innovative and brilliant solution! I did not find the non-availability of duty-free shopping at Luton any problem - it's the quid pro quo for the private channel: but prospective passengers should be aware of this indeed the website (otherwise informative re the terminals) should state it. I am also quite happy not to have duty-free goods flogged in flight. Arriving at Luton Parkway on a filthy wet day no taxis were evident and none of the station staff seemed to have heard of the Silverjet-branded free taxis as advertised (this despite the fact that they obviously pull up or wait in front all day). A very scruffy and decrepit minicab eventually showed up - quite a way from the canopied forecourt and then a silver 'black' cab. The procedure was not obvious and I got very wet. At Newark I had to wait about 20 minutes in the rather crowded Silverjet lounge before my car came: the ground staff were not efficient in locating me. On that subject I agree with the comments of many other passengers that the Newark lounge is inadequate: but this seems to be a feature of all US so-called premium lounges and no doubt Silverjet has had to be grateful for what it can get. Also Luton sets a very high standard for comparison. Immigration at Newark was amazingly quick for the US and courteous and friendly: and the baggage was already on the carousel. I would agree also that the seat is not as comfortable as it looks especially when reclined (too short and not flat as people have noted). Still pretty good for the money. The outward flight in particular was very lightly loaded with the rear cabin almost unoccupied. Pleasant though it is to fly without crowding I do hope that they get higher load factors or they will not be in business much longer. I do hope there is no truth in the suggestions that flights are cancelled for lack of sufficient passengers - there is no way one is prepared to risk this happening. I would give a 5 but for the niggles and really do hope Silverjet succeeds.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

On both flights 10 bags had no space and on MAN the cabin crew began writing surnames on paper hand towels before handing bags to the ground crew. Only a few baggage receipts were returned. Staff at BUD were much more professional but this still adds a 30 minute stressful delay to the boarding process. Answer is be sure to board early which in BUD means lining up in a cold marquee on the tarmac.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,3,3,2,NA,NA,NA,2,0
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,David Ellis,United Kingdom,2007-09-15,LUT-EWR-LUT. Outward journey was thoroughly impressive from start to finish. The car valet service happened without a hitch and check-in was over in a minute. The Luton lounge is spacious and comfortable and the 95% occupancy for the flight seemed to be accommodated easily. Security was a breeze and the private bus service to the plane was efficient. On board staff were friendly and attentive throughout and really seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Food was actually as good as I've ever had on a business class flight and the individual attention given to preparing and plating up the food seemed to make a real difference. Immigration and baggage collection at Newark was efficient and our pre-booked chauffeured limo was pretty much ready and waiting. The return journey didn't start too well because of the overcrowding in the Newark lounge. The flight was again full apart from a few seats and the lounge couldn't handle this. I've heard that a new lounge is due to open soon but Silverjet haven't confirmed this. The Silverjet CEO was actually on the flight so hopefully he'll have realised first-hand how unacceptable the current situation is. Take-off was delayed by about an hour because of air traffic control issues. The service on board didn't seem quite as polished as the outbound flight and the food was only average. Sensibly Silverjet offer a two-course meal on the night flight so that one can get the maximum amount of sleep. As others have commented the seats are far from truly flat but comfort wise they're not bad and we both managed to get some sleep. Breakfast is a sort of on board 'take out' i.e. yohourt smoothie fruit and a choice of cheese and ham stuffed croissant or cream cheese bagel in a bag. Not really my ideal for breakfast but probably better than a ghastly reheated omelette and hash browns and certainly easier for the FAs to dispense 40 minutes before landing. Baggage handling at Luton again let the side down but the car valet service was as efficient as on the outward journey. Overall I'd rate Silverjet very highly; better then MAXjet not quite at the level of EOS but then it's half the price.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,P Simpson,NA,2007-08-08,STN to JFK and flight was fine apart from a number of issues. JFK is a disaster for small airlines as the big boys get priority on departure slots. We waited two hours to be assigned a slot sat nailed to the seat unable to visit the bathroom was no fun for anyone. The endless queues in the immigration lounge also should put off any sane traveller. Other points of interest: The food was good (not exceptional) though service speed was ponderous. The tv system sits on the table and is therefore an aggravation when the food arrives due to lack of room. The choice of films/tv programmes is excellent. The planes are old and the bathrooms are in dire need of a professional upgrade - the current bathrooms have obviously had a paint job but the job was rushed and shabby. FAs are ok - some smile some dont. The seats are fine for the price but don't compare to VA or BA's business class offerings. They are vastly superior to Premium Economy seating. The plane could do with on-screen maps to show the progress of the flight and the PA system is poor. Overall - good flight good airline but still with one or two teething problems.,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,C Jones,NA,2007-06-13,I just travelled with Maxjet to Las Vegas. Service was excellent for the price. The Business class cannot be compared with the likes of BA or Virgin but the price is comparable with Premium Economy. The seat is equivelent to the old style bucket seats. The seat goes back far enough to get a decent night sleep and the configuration is 2-2-2. As for the price I compared their price with Virgin and BMI's Premium economy price. And at just under Â£800.00 including tax it was a no brainer! I got a further discount from invegas.co.uk. The flight takes a bit longer than Virgin but this is probably due to the smaller plane. If you are a regular business class traveller and you think you are saving a fortune you will be disapointed.

The flight was delayed and no information on further delays although they were obvious (e.g. crew lining up at what was supposed to be the departure). Well worn seats. Once on the plane we could not depart for 1hr. They easily could have kept us at the gate. The satellite radio is mostly obscurities and a lot of programming for political conservatives and evangelical Christians.

Rubbish lolly wrappers under seat in front. Return flight cancellation announced on almost indecipherable loudspeaker only 10 mins before boarding time then flashed up on screen at Boarding Gate. Such late notice (none received by SMS) left many stranded and those with already checked in baggage unable to transfer to another airline in time. We were forced to sit at airport an additional 4 hours to be seated on their next plane. Staff claimed Captain had called in sick. Surely there are procedures in place for crew to be obliged to give more notice so standby crew if they have such a thing can be called in. To cap it off purported staff shortage on arrival at Tullamarine meant a further delay as cabin crew unable to open doors to allow already disgruntled passengers to disembark. No apologies. Not even an offer of a complimentary tea coffee or water in flight for those affected. Very bad PR. Don't try to speak to Senior Management about your experience or have them contact you - Jetstar claim they have no direct line. First and last time we travel with this airline.

Cramped cabin little leg room nickel and dimed for everything. Add to this the fact that the in seat power and overhead reading light wasn't working (despite a few reset attempts) and it added up to a fairly unremarkable experience. Jetstar has also changed their check in for international flights at MEL adding slick new kiosks which generate boarding passes and baggage tags. All well and good however there is no longer a separate queue for online check ins necessitating a long wait in the single check in queue. Absolutely no value to a customer to check in online now - don't waste your time.

Kenya Airways have kept a 3-3-3 arrangement so the seats are wider. Food tasty and cabin crew friendly and professional. Nice welcome from captain. Good inflight entertainment. Connecting flight to Dar-es-Salaam equally straightforward and comfortable. Very keen to use Kenya Airways again - far superior to KLM who they codeshare the AMS-NBO route with.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1

kenya-airways,/airline-reviews/kenya-airways,Kenya Airways customer review,M Carson,United Kingdom,2014-06-10,I flew LHR-NBO return and was generally satisfied by the service. It's nothing special but the 777 are relatively comfortable (showing some sign of age) - the best feature in both directions was that there were plenty of spare seats so passengers were able to spread out and I found the overnight timings most convenient. I found the food and drink poor however (particularly hard to face food overstrained tea and vile juice) and the in-flight entertainment distinctly average (limited range of films poor sound quality broken in several seats). Basically it's an acceptable in-flight experience that gets you efficiently from A to B and the ground experience is much more professional/competent than many other African airlines from my experience. Staff were generally friendly (with exception of some check-in staff at NBO who were grumpy).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,2,2,NA,NA,3,1

klm-royal-dutch-airlines,/airline-reviews/klm-royal-dutch-airlines,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,D Cassius,Netherlands,2015-04-01,Rio to AMS in EcoComfort. KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible. The flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. All in all one of the worst experiences I have had with KLM.

Typical Jetstar lack of truth in advertising and false information provided at booking. With two weeks notice this was not maintenance related but rather it was planned. No refund offered despite the B787 being the only reason I booked. The flight itself was typical Jetstar. $46 for my checked bag $20 for an 'up front' seat $59 for the 'plus' package etc. Nickeled and dimed to death.

First trip on the 'Dreamliner' which might as well be named 'Nightmareliner'. I found nothing particularly unique about the plane other that it is new and in good condition an uptick from Jetstar's A330 which are generally appalling. I found the seats and aisles to be tight. Quite a bit of bumping as people walked up and down aisles. Seat quality dubious as the guy in back of me kept 'kneeing' me the entire flight - suggestive of a poor quality seat itself. The IFE looks promising but is actually quite limited and in typical Jetstar manner you pay for it. The 'mood lighting' and large windows were largely irrelevant and made no difference to the flight quality so much ado about nothing. There is also some serious 'disinformation that Jetstar should retract - they claim there is 'shared seat power' on the aircraft. I didn't see it in my seat and when I asked the FA he said only the exit rows have it. There is a USB connector for PEDs but no shared in seat power. It is another example of Jetstar's notoriously poor misleading marketing claims. As for the flight it was on time out of MEL and early into BKK so credit to Jetstar for that. Crew was rude and indifferent pretty typical for Jetstar. Summary: neutral to negative on balance and a bit of a yawner.

Out of Amsterdam it was very good. The sole was one of the best meals I have had on an aircraft in years. My only negative is the departure gate in Schiphol. Security is cleared at the gate. This meant the flight was called an hour and a half before departure. All the passengers were squeezed sardine lik in the tiny waiting area. There was not enough seating.

We had booked the flight over a month before the flight departure date. Upon online check-in one of us was at the front of the plane and the other at the very rear.

We were told the only seats next to each other had the aisle in between. We were also told if we got to the airport early the check-in staff should change this so we could sit in the same row together. We arrived at airport check-in more than 3 hours early but we were told the airplane was full and there was no way to get around this. We were also told that we had to pay 30 Euro to check in our baggage since we had not done it online (but we couldn't do it online or else we wouldn't have been able to change our seats at the airport!). We discussed our experience with the lady at the check-in desk and she told us if we used one of the computers located on the other side of the airport we would be able to check our luggage in for free. So we went and found an internet kiosk checked in and still had to pay 15 Euro per suitcase. We then went back to the check in desk paid an extra 20 Euro each to sit in an 'Economy Comfort' seat because we were told there was simply nothing else that could be done. Long story short: this two hour flight cost us $900 AUD up front to be seated nowhere near each other. When we tried to alter this so we could sit next to each other it cost us an extra $120 AUD.

Chewing gum was stuck to the seat in front of me windows were covered in finger prints which indicated a child had sat in the seat on the previous flight and the toilets at the front of the plane were not clean to begin with so were quite revolting by the end of the 6hr flight. To top it off the young couple in the seats directly in front of us reclined their seats as far back as possible so neither my hubby nor I could move his knees were literally squished into the back of the seat.

Although I'm a Flying Blue member I do travel with other airlines so I think I can assess KLM position to other benchmarks. I am actually quite satisfied with KLM.

Personally I think KLM is ahead of many competitors when it comes to online check in and self-service luggage drop-off (at least at their home-base AMS) it's far more advanced and smooth than most airlines. Although my last flight was in a 737 without entertainment I know that their entire long-haul fleet now has proper personal entertainment systems so that's good. They were a bit late on their 747s though. I will use them in the future.

Seat was comfortable though the leg rest on the seat of the return flight was not as adjustable as the outward flight. Meals were ok as airline food goes. Glad we paid the extra to fly business. Only snag we had was the booking we made. Our return flight from K Lumpur to Singapore and onto Auckland we were told that we had to go through immigration collect our bags go through customs then check in again and go through immigration again to board our flight from Singapore to Auckland! Though we were travelling with Jetstar right through they couldn't check our bags through to Auckland. Reason given was the booking numbers. Wished that we were told when we booked with Jetstar.

Jetstar insist that their own international passengers claim their bags at Sydney domestic and then carry them across to International although they will check bags through for American Airlines passengers! In fact nowhere on the ticket is it mentioned that passengers have to make their own way from the domestic terminal in Sydney to the international - either a bus or a train fare away. The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid. I would suggest that elderly passengers in particular stay away from Jetstar International if their flight involves a domestic connection because Jetstar will require them to claim their own luggage and check in again at the connection point.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,3,3,0,NA,NA,3,0

Seats are much more akin to US domestic airlines first class seats with limited recline limited legroom and a worthless footrest. When the passenger in front of me reclined my knees were jammed against the seat. I measured 6 inches of space between the seatback and the front edge of my seat.

The Asian vegetarian meal I ordered was great and staff efficiency was excellent. Inflight entertainment only featured Korean, Japanese and Chinese films in addition to Hollywood which I felt was rather limited. Would have been better if there were other language films such as Indian on board since KE recently announced its intentions to expand in India. Transit in ICN was hassle free and easy to locate gates with lots of shopping and Korean cultural experiences. ICN to CTS was a brand new A330-300 and felt way more comfortable than the B777-300ER as I heard the premium cabin is one of the smallest in Korean Air.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,G Cueto,United States,2015-04-26,I live in DC but flew out of NYC to MNL and TPE via Incheon to take advantage of the lower fares offered out of JFK and to fly the A380 on the NYC route (vs 777 on flights to Dulles). I had flown EVA Air 777 JFK to TPE a few months prior and Y class seats on the Korean A380 definitely felt more spacious both in terms of pitch and seat width. And the more generous headroom on this aircraft was also noticeable. I also appreciated that the Korean lunch/dinner option (usually a pretty healthy bibimbap or some variation thereof) always came with soup and the snacks between meals - fruits chips chocolate hot ramen and/or hot sandwiches - were filling and tasty. The attendants treated customers with respect. Flight attendants were proactive helping parents with babies. I also thought the attendant uniform and the overall branding and color scheme of the airline were quite stylish and appealing. The AVOD movie selection was comparable to EVA but not as good as Cathay or Singapore. The only downside to the journey was the horrendously long and slow-moving check in line in Manila. Online check in was out of commission so I arrived at MNL a full three hours before the flight and completed check in with only 50 minutes to spare. But I suspect this had more to do with the poor infrastructure at this particular airport/terminal than Korean Air. Incheon is a wonderful airport for with lots of pleasing amenities for extended layovers so I would not hesitate to fly Korean (or Cathay for that matter) for future transpacific flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

After listening to 25 minutes of inane drivel (at R2.40 a minute) telling me how wonderful their service is and how all their agents were just waiting to pick up the phone and help me I gave up. Later I contacted the office at George Airport where the response was unhelpful and I was offered a refund. The alternative SAA flight would have at that point cost me R800 more. I wish I had booked SAA from the beginning but foolishly thought it was worth saving some money. That said I understand that flights can be delayed I was notified in advance and when I checked in I was given a R250 voucher to use on a future Kulula booking and the service and flight were satisfactory.

kuwait-airways,/airline-reviews/kuwait-airways,Kuwait Airways customer review,John Doe,United States,2014-08-06,I flew JFK to LHR return in July 2014. With transatlantic fares being extremely expensive these days I was left with Kuwait Airways being my only viable option without spending $1000+ per person. I considered flying this airline to be somewhat like flying Ryanair - expect nothing except basic transportation from point A to B and everything else is a bonus. The Boeing 777 used on this route is old and clearly in need of an upgrade. PTV entertainment screens worked for virtually no one. However in my opinion the dated interior can be somewhat of an advantage. I found the legroom and seat width to be quite generous compared to other airlines especially the newer 777s with a 3-4-3 layout in economy (Kuwait uses 3-3-3 in economy). The flight attendants were definitely not highly trained or overly polite but I also didn't find them to be rude and they served the meals efficiently. The food was surprisingly some of the best food I have had in economy class. Indian fare was served on all flights and was quite tasty. The JFK-LHR leg included a full hot breakfast I don't believe many other airlines still serve this much food in economy for a transatlantic flight. My outbound flight was just about on-time while my return flight to JFK was delayed by about 1 hour. If you take a look at Flightaware or other flight tracking software for the flight you will see that this flight is on average about 1 hour late so plan accordingly. However given the price paid and the fact that this is a direct flight to LHR I would fly Kuwait again if savings is substantial over other airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,S Gray,Australia,2014-01-23,"SYD-ICN-JFK-ICN-SYD. Economy class. Sydney to Seoul was a day flight on an ageing 747. Pet hate number one: all window shades had to be closed and lights turned off during the 10 hour day flight. Uncomfortable seat despite the generous 34"" pitch. Limited IFE choices. Bibimbap is the only meal worth considering. My seat mates' western choices looked very pedestrian. Cabin crew mostly young with very limited English and all service seemed very rushed and chaotic. They did spring immediately whenever people rang the call buttons. Drinks (soft and hard) were half pours in 200ml plastic cups. Overnight ICN to JFK on a much newer 777 was more comfortable. Same level of clumsy but well-intentioned service. Some mediocre entertainment choices but on a newer and more user-friendly system than the 747. Seatbelt sign was turned on at the slightest hint of light chop throughout the flight. Cabin crew stationed permanently at the lavs directing traffic and ensuring they're kept reasonably clean. JFK-ICN on A380. Seats as comfortable as they get for economy class and like the 777 great entertainment hardware but limited choice. More bibimbap. More sips of drinks from small cups. Another day flight with enforced darkness. Quick and simple transfer at ICN. Paid lounge access upstairs for USD22 is a good option and free showers available to all passengers adjacent to the lounge. ICN-SYD back to the old 747. Bibimbap for dinner on departure. Uncomfortable seat. Same service not unfriendly just impersonal and very ""green"". Another pet hate: breakfast was served a good three hours out of Sydney and cleared up with two hours left to go so lights turned off and blinds to remain closed.

However it snowed (not heavily) that afternoon. Arrived at JFK with plenty of time. Flight shown on departure board as being on time. I was at the gate at 7pm and the flight still showed on time however there was an Air Berlin plane at our gate. According to the agent the flight was still leaving on time even though the plane was not there. We finally left the gate at about 10pm and had to wait to be de-iced. Took off at 11pm. Plane was a Dreamliner and other than the having little room between seats was great. Food service on LAN was much better than on American which I usually use to go to MVD. Flight attendants were young enthusiastic and had good rapport with the passengers. Dinner was a choice of beef or pasta and I chose the beef which was quite good. LAN still uses regular cutlery for meal service (no plastic ware) and glass for wine (no plastic cup). Breakfast was also a choice of two different meals cheese sandwich or eggs and sausage which I chose. The eggs and sausage came in s ceramic dish. Far cry from American's minuscule continental breakfast. Arriving at SCL all transit passengers went to transit area LAN had already printed boarding passes for connecting flights and also provided voucher for food while waiting for the connection. I don't think that any US carrier would do that nowadays. Flight from SCL to MVD was on A320 which was more comfortable than seating on Dreamliner. LAN offered snack service (sandwich and beverage) on 2.5 hour flight which most US carriers do not do any more. Return from MVD to SCL was also on A320 boarding pass issued at MVD showed Gate 5 however departure board showed Gate 4 (which was correct gate). Again LAN offered snack service to SCL. SCL to NYC was a nightmare. We were scheduled to leave at 11pm but did not depart until midnight. The plane was full with families with children onboard many of whom cried screamed at night. Perhaps airlines should keep a stock of pacifiers on board. After take off dinner was served and again the offerings were much better than American's. We were scheduled to land at 8am at JFK as we began our approach and landing gear and flaps were down the captain announced that JFK had just been closed due to weather conditions and we would go to Newark instead. Landed at Newark at 9.30am and waited for an hour on taxiway for gate to be made available. Disembarked at 10.30 and by 11 was through passport control. Then we had to wait for 90 minutes for the luggage to start coming onto the carousel. Left the airport at 1pm.

LAN seem to have major operational issues with their A343 flights to and from Oceania. Being kind one could say they are erring on the side of caution but significant punctuality issues where flights are frequently either delayed or cancelled does not inspire confidence (retrospectively checked flightaware.com to verify my suspicions). LAN800 delayed ex Auckland by over 1 hour which proved QFs text message received the night before to be correct. Contacted QF on receipt regarding my 1h20 min connection as was travelling on to Europe from Rio same day. Told to contact LAN directly. Did so and LAN adamant that no problem with connecting as flight on time. Phooey! Encountered same circus at Santiago on arrival from Rio enroute home. Went to allocated gate to snare some snooze time for the 4 hours transit only to wake up to 2 gate changes (from gate 11 to 14 then finally 17B) one flight status of 'cancellado' and one of 'atrasado' (delayed). All for the same LAN801. Amazing. Flight eventually left some hours after scheduled 2320h take off as a replacement crew then needed to be called up. Insult to injury was the dinner served around 4-5am. Food masquerading as beef is not worth being kept awake for. Real shame as inflight the crew are pretty charming and attentive. I would expect these shenanigans from AR with whom I've previously travelled to Argentina. Had hoped LAN would be superior. On the positive side the flights between Santiago and Rio were pleasant.

Lan Peru from SCL-EZE was the only flight available that day for our ticket and was an OK experience. Flight on an older 767-300ER with no personal TVs but the flight is barely 2 hours. The crew were polite and food was good. EZE-LIM was 2 hours 45 minutes late with no explanation meaning we didn't arrive into Lima until 2 am. However we were given a free meal at the airport. We discovered that we had not been sat together so asked the gate agent to move us and were moved right to the front which was great. The plane was a very outdated 767-300ER with no personal TVs and no movable headrests on the seats which was annoying for a 4.5 hour flight. However we massive legroom at the front in the middle so we were able to get some sleep. The cabin crew were good actually making sure people watched the safety video and food was fine. LIM-MIA however was great. It left roughly on time which was good as we had a connection at MIA to LHR (our bags did make it the whole way). The plane was a refurbished / new 767-300ER so it had the excellent new seats and AVOD ""IN"" entertainment system.

LAN expect you to be at the airport 3 hours before departure for international flights. They are not joking. Passengers like me who had already checked-in and printed their boarding cards were made to wait outside the cordoned off check-in area. We were admitted after airport security complained about the queue getting in the way of other passengers. After 50 minutes waiting it was my turn but the agent just held his hand up and got out his mobile phone. He was still chatting after I had finished leaving my bags with another agent. Boarded in strict priority of cabin class frequent flyer status and row numbers - then all got on to the same bus! Cabin crew too busy having coffee to check the boarding cards. Crew surly with no smiles or good-byes. Usual economy class type snack. Arrived on time with fairly quick bag return. My experience on this flight was that LAN staff are all well turned out check-in areas and aircraft are clean and appear almost new but just scratch the surface and you may find a very different airline to the first impression.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,3,2,NA,NA,4,0
liat,/airline-reviews/liat,LIAT customer review,J Taylor,United States,2015-01-05,"We booked SFO-FLL-SJU-DOM the last leg being on LIAT. A few days after booking we received an email stating that our SJU-DOM flight had been canceled and we would be rerouted through ANU at no additional charge. Inconvenient but we sucked it up. After all it would only be one more hour. Arrival in SJU was stressful. We had to find a LIAT employee to check in and get boarding passes. The transfer service desk was unstaffed and personnel from other airlines told us that they had no idea when a LIAT representative would show. Exited the secure area and checked in at the painfully slow and incompetently staffed check-in counter. The other half waited at the customer service desk inside the airport and checked in when a LIAT representative finally decided to show her face. At the check-in counter I checked in without issue though the computer crashed multiple times. Our 14.50 flight ended up leaving the ground around 16:40. Needless to say we missed our one-hour connection in Antigua. We were livid. Our plane was the largest in LIAT's fleet - an ATR-72. Nice enough clean and comfortable. No beverage or food service but at this point that was not unexpected. Landing in ANU we were informed that although we had missed our ANU-DOM flight the airline ""graciously"" scheduled another flight to take us to DOM. There was a single LIAT employee or so it seemed in the entire terminal â we initially encountered her at the desk that dealt with passengers in transit. There was a line at this desk that reached out the door of the terminal and onto the tarmac as people needed to get boarding passes for this new flight. The new ANU-DOM flight was scheduled for 18:30 but we were not surprised when we took off at 19:00. The plane was on an old Bombardier.

This one and-a-bit hour flight was due to leave at 1430. Be aware that when you fly on Libyan Arab Airlines you will be bussed to a very distressed 30 year old 727-200. We boarded the plane only half an hour late because of a âsecurityâ agent in dark glasses and an Armani- type suit (jacket draped over the shoulders) who laboriously checked documents of all passengers on the 40 degree tarmac. The interior of the plane was so hot probably 50 degrees) that the older passengers were dropping like flies which further delayed the departure by a couple of hours. Sitting beside me fanning himself at high speed (the interior was now like 120 large beserk butterflies) was a flight engineer for LN who explained that there were no spare parts for the Auxiliary Power Unit that provides the AC so thatâs why it was hot. I thought that this was not the moment to ask if there could be similar spares shortages for the main engines. People perked up above 10000 feet when they recovered and the cabin crew were not as aggressive as they were on the ground. Your heart goes out to these folks who are on these planes itâs both unpleasant and dangerous work.

Connecting in FRA extremely stressful (this airport is now worse than CDG), I had 60 mn to do it. It took 30 mins only to arrive at terminal, due to very very remote parking plus a lot of airplane traffic that stopped our bus. Then a long queue at Immigration, and very remote finger (Z62). Boarding had started when I arrived. Service on upper deck (FRA to KIX) was pleasant but slow, the food was delicious. Brand new flat seats, a bit too narrow, but pleasant anyway.

First leg on Embraer was a short one hour flight with very good service and smooth flight. LOT041 was on the Boeing Dreamliner business class. Boarding in WAW a bit chaotic. Flight left 90 minutes late as workmen attempted to fix (unsuccessfully) a seat that would not go flat. They gave up and said it would be fixed in Toronto. Only about 10 passengers out of 24 seats in the J cabin so it wasn't a problem. Another seat had a tray table that refused to stay horizontal rendering it useless. A metal flap covering the opening of the place where the TV monitor flips up in my seat fell off. All this in a new plane that has only been in service since last December! Cabin service very good FA friendly. Food and drink quite good. The plane itself - the 787 is super-quiet and I love the electronic window shades! A very good experience despite the few glitches.

They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards.

Lufthansa in Krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. Lufthansa staff at Krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in Germany! Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. Announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding Chicago. I asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. We arrived late in Munich So the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to Chicago by minutes! No one at gate in Munich to assist us. Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The clincher is when we boarded our flight to Chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration! What happened to not being able to hold the plane? Horrible service.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,David Butcher,Canada,2014-12-22,Flew four legs MAA-KUL-BKK KBV-KUL-MAA in October/November 2014 - a total of about ten hours flying. All flights in Business all in 737-800's. Found it all to be a superior experience - from check in to land and air staff to cleanliness of planes to entertainment (a bit limited but these are 737s) to timeliness. The golden lounge at KUL is excellent - very bright and clean good wifi decent food clean showers. All of it puts North American airlines to shame.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,V Ladhani,Germany,2014-10-05,TXL-FRA-RIX: Both the legs were operated by A321. Crew were pleasant on both the flights especially that onwards to RIX. They were lively willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds. I have travelled extensively on different airlines and wouldn't hesitate to suggest LH to up their game.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,2,2,NA,NA,3,1
malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,M Walsh,United Kingdom,2014-11-25,20th Nov 2014 MH002 Kuala Lumpur (dep 2355) to London Heathrow. Minus points: 1) Uncomfortable seat. I generally find seating less supportive and comfortable than those used on MH and SQ's 747-400 fleets of yesteryear and I have found the seating on SQs and MH's A380 and QR's A330 and A340 to be much of the same. This particular seat felt like it was worn down and it was the emergency exit row seat 42K which I had paid extra for so this was particularly annoying. 2) Cold cabin but nowhere near as cold as the outbound MH001 flight I took on 31st October which I also reviewed. 3) As mentioned in my aforementioned review of the 31st October MH001 flight the in-flight entertainment is lagging behind - slow poorly laid out and not intuitive. Plus points: 1) Attentive and friendly cabin crew as ever. 2) Informative and friendly Captain. 3) Good quality food. 4) The content of in-flight entertainment is sound. General thoughts: An enjoyable flight again but one in which I could not sleep well or get comfortable in. In-flight service is exemplary.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,1,5,4,2,NA,NA,2,1
malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,M Walsh,United Kingdom,2014-11-20,31st Oct 2014 Flight: MH001 London Heathrow (2200 dep) to Kuala Lumpur. Minus points: 1) This was nowhere near a full flight yet when serving dinner shortly after take-off they quickly ran out of one of the two standard options on offer. 2) The cabin was very cold. I was in the window seat 43K and had no one sat next to me so I turned off all 3 vents and used to blankets despite wearing 3 layers including my hoody with the hood up. Still cold. 3) The in-flight entertainment user interface sorely needs updating - it is slow cumbersome and far from intuitive and there really isn't a need for the old-style dual-hole headphone jacks to be retained. Refer to Dragonair as an example of a modern system. Plus points: 1) Cabin crew friendly as ever MH's true asset. 2) Nice in-flight meals although the dinner option that was left (tuna lasagne) might be considered an acquired taste. 3) Despite criticisms of in-flight entertainment there was ample content and of a wide range. General notes: Contrary to what my notes and scores might suggest I did enjoy this flight and very much looked forward to it - my first flight with MH in 7 years and my first on their A380. But flying with them certainly isn't the experience that it used to be. I had flown on 31 MH flights prior to this and can say that they deserved those Skytrax 5-Star Airline ratings but right now they're not quite there. A simple measure like not running out of certain food on a 2/3 full flight would help as something like that isn't acceptable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,5,4,3,NA,NA,3,1

Flight from BOM to KUL was uneventful as its a night flight. Food served after take off and was quite awful. The BOM to KUL route is served by what seems like a very tired and old 777 and the 2-5-2 seating is great if you booked the 2 but seemed crammed for the rest. Leg room good. PTV options okay. From KUL to REP the flights were on a 737. Lunch served- once again the food was terrible. Staff and service all the way through was okay - nothing outstanding. Packed flight on all 4 sectors.

We were unable to check in on-line cabin baggage has a weight limit that was not mentioned on the BA website meaning that our bags had to be checked as they were slightly over the limit.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,A Thomas,Sweden,2014-08-28,Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

monarch-airlines,/airline-reviews/monarch-airlines,Monarch Airlines customer review,N Smith,United Kingdom,2015-03-25,This was the first and last time we will ever fly with Monarch. We have just arrived back from Hurgada - 'Gatwick'. The outbound flight on 13 March was fine only a few issues namely the severe lack of entertainment on board for a five hour flight and the ever changing price of an extra leg room seat which went from Â£30 online to Â£ Â£7 in the airport then back up to Â£15 on board. Our return flight was where the major issues started. Firstly the flight which took 5 hours on the way there was now going to take nearly 7 hours to return. We then sat on the tarmac for around 45 mins before finally taking off. After all of the waiting we then were told rather abruptly that the runway was closed at Gatwick and therefore we had to fly to Luton! We found it hilarious that all other flights managed to land at Gatwick with the 'runway closed' and also that Luton is Monarchs head quarters. We believe they had absolutely no intention of ever landing at Gatwick. Monarch staff were not present once we arrived as I imagine they simply couldn't be bothered to help us in any way. The handing agents Menzies were to organise the coaches. We were made to queue at a check in desk and told two coaches were ordered but that we would be taken to Gatwick on a first come first served basis! Bearing in mind there were 300 people on our flight. At no time were we given any vouchers or even a cup of water and we couldn't leave the queue as this may mean we would miss out on a place on the coach. When the coaches did arrive we had been waiting for over an hour and then had to tolerate the hour and a half coach trip to Gatwick. We were due to arrive at Gatwick at 9pm on Friday we actually arrived at 2am on Saturday. We have never experienced such a thing and we travel up to 7 times a year.

How anyone should have to put up with seats with very little leg room and have to stand most of the journey speaks volumes about the bean counters at Monarch. Also the new seat design is very thin and you can feel the person behind you placing their water bottles in the seat holders which then stick in your back.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,P Anderson,Hong Kong,2014-03-04,I am a frequent flyer. Having flown 6 sectors with Malaysian over Christmas and New Year I have enough experience to make a judgement. The cabin crew are generally inefficient and disinterested. The food is mediocre (breakfast during an 8 hour flight consists of a soggy chicken pasty and no hot drinks). Despite relatively calm flights on all 6 sectors I was offered tea just once due to the seatbelt signs being illuminated for most of the flights on all 6 sectors (which the majority of passengers ignored but the cabin crew ignored their non compliance).

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,Emily Borowski,United States,2014-04-24,I flew flight 434 from Munich to Chicago (ORD) on their A340. The plane was new beautiful and the flight attendants were pleasant. I had the chicken with rice meal option and it was good. I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option. To summarize I had a good experience and believe I got good value for my money. I would recommend Lufthansa.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Boarding staff at the terminal were rude. The MH cabin crews were very indifferent and disinterested. I asked for a snack prior to take off but was not given anything no excuses given (did the same with Qantas and was given plenty). Meal was served with two main choices terribly bland.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,J Singh,Australia,2014-01-20,Melbourne to Paris return in Business. First time in Business on Malaysia. Previous experiences with airline had been mixed. Overall their Business product doesn't have the polish of Emirates or Singapore but is a satisfactory alternative given the price. 777 MEL-KUL A380 KUL-CDG-KUL and then A330 KUL-MEL. 777 is aged but found it very comfortable (more so than the much newer A330). A380 was spacious and seat was good. A330 seemed more cramped than either 777 or A380 and lacked privacy. All flights had good service. Food varied from good to excellent and there was always plenty of it. IFE was a weak spot with not much of any interest to me. Lounges too were mediocre even in KLIA which surprised me being home base. However despite all this given that the cost of the ticket was substantially less than any other carrier and comparable to China Southern it represents good value and would happily fly them again.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

Flight left 15 minutes late but arrived 20 minutes early. Pre- booked extra legroom seats which were very comfortable with lots of space. Almost new A320 very quite and smooth. They had a special offer on pre-booked meals so took advantage of the offer. I wasn't expecting much in quality but was pleasantly surprised how good and tasty the whole meal was and it even included a free Kenco coffee which would have cost us Â£2.50 anyway so for Â£7.00 excellent value for money. Cabin crew were very attentive and pretty much refrained from the shouting offers that you get on Jet 2 flights. Return flight was affected by ATC strikes but was reassured to receive a text message from Monarch on the morning of departure advising that our flight was still operating although it may be subject to delay. They pulled out all the stops and we returned 2 hours late. This is the first time I have flown with Monarch for quite a few years and they are definitely a cut above other low cost airlines. I just hope that they expand their destinations from Leeds Bradford even more as Jet 2 and their ancient 'planes are becoming too complacent.

A few days before we were due to fly we received a telephone call to say that the flight had been put to 5.30 pm which we were not very happy about. When we arrived at the airport we were informed at check in that the flight would not be leaving until 7.40 pm. We eventually departed at 8.45 pm 6 hours and 45 minutes after our original time. Most of the other passengers were grumbling and it seemed pretty clear that the original flight of 2pm had been taken off. We finally arrived at our hotel at 2 am local time after setting off from our home at 2 pm the previous day. The seats were so closely packed together that my knees were up against the seat in front we could barely get the trays down in front of us and it was impossible to recline the seats as that would have given no room for the people behind us. To add to this the stewards wheeling the trolleys met right against our seats and were there for about 20 minutes constantly opening the metal doors to get out items and letting the doors bang against our seats.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,2,4,0,NA,NA,2,0

The cabin crew did a really good job but when someone reclines it makes you feel claustrophobic so you need to stand up for a while then there is a problem. For anyone who wants to fly this airline between Hong Kong and KL I would recommend going for one of the earlier services on the A330-300 or the A380 where the seat configuration is more suitable.

Upon boarding the aircraft Heraklion bound (25 mins late due to the late arrival of the aircraft from Rome) we noticed the horrible fake leather green seats that were pealing. This was not too much of an issue however. The crew were friendly and we landed on time in Heraklion. The flight times both ways were a little inconvenient but certainly a lot better than early morning flights. On the return flight we noticed our Monarch A320 landing 25 mins early from Birmingham much to our surprise. We boarded and were in the air 20 mins early which was great and Landed at BHX a full 40 mins ahead of schedule! Unfortunately this was overshadowed by having to wait 25 mins for a bus to the terminal (which was not the fault of the airline I must stress) but nevertheless a pleasant flight. The only reason I haven't awarded higher is because the flights were a little over-priced. Overall I would recommend Monarch and had the prices not have been so extortionate for next year on the same route we would have flown again.

Have found Nok to have the most frequent service however ran into a serious problem with their mobile website functionality which wouldn't allow me to pre-purchase additional luggage before the flight during online check-in. This limitation then 'forced' me to purchase the additional baggage at airport which was priced ten times higher than the online rate (I paid 1200 baht vs 150 baht online). Absolutely no sympathy from surly unfriendly Nok staff the 'all smiles' airline. They told me I should've known and bought the baggage at ticket purchase. This is preposterous as I bought the ticket two months prior and had no idea how much luggage I would have. I don't mind paying a premium but absolutely resent the idea of being extorted into paying a premium due to their own website lack of functionality. Given the frequency of my travel on Nok I would've expected them to be more reasonable and understanding but there is a complete lack of commercial sensibility with the employees basically suggesting that I'm a fool. I am a fool for choosing Nok and would recommend Air Asia or Thai Air on the route unless you like to be taken advantage of humiliated and extorted by draconian policies extortion pricing and rude employees. Their employees all explained this away as Nok being a 'low cost carrier' which is a spurious explanation as the high cost of baggage makes them a 'high price / low service' carrier and other 'low cost carriers' such as AirAsia and Jetstar allow you to buy additional baggage online during check in Nok Air does not.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,3,NA,NA,1,0

On the outward flight we were seated in cattle class at the back with legroom fit for a dwarf like Mr Moss the cabin crew came round with hot drinks etc without being informed there was a hot meal being provided later luckily we had a hot drink/snack because I could not fold my tray down because of the lack of room. Coming home we booked seats at the front with extra legroom. On arrival at Hurghada airport we were all given a letter telling us we were being diverted to Rome as the plane would encounter very strong headwinds and was incapable of holding enough fuel to get us back to the UK. Had a good flight up to Rome just over 4 hrs with a nice meal on a tray that we were able to fold down with comfort - paying Â£40 a couple for the extra legroom. Then informed by the captain that once we landed in Rome there was a standby crew that had been flown from Gatwick waiting for us - Monarch must have known well in advance this was going to happen.

This was the worst flight I have experienced. Only one check in for 400 people at Barbados plane left one hour late and all boarded at once up one set of steps. Evening meal serves at 10.30pm and no second cups of tea or coffee available. Very cramped seating and aisles so narrow you had to walk sideways. Sudden diversion for emergency landing at Santiago Spain to get medical assistance for sick passenger. 'Breakfast' served after resumed flight i.e. orange juice sticky bun and one Nutrigrain bar with no tea or coffee due to 'no hot water on board'. Unbelievable!

I would suggest that they travel for Â£10 in the hold or Â£15 in the cabin. If the economy passengers do not like the legroom provided then they should buy extra legroom seats and if the demand increases then no doubt Monarch will increase the number.

nok-air,/airline-reviews/nok-air,Nok Air customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,3 flights over Christmas/New Year between Bangkok and Buriram all had problems. Nok Air have increased their frequency to daily on this route but as a result have over stretched themselves if any issues occur. Flight 1 - originally booked for 23/12 emailed 3 days before to say flight was cancelled due to weather forecast but managed to get rebooked on to next day flight instead. However flight was full and found last row of seats in saab plane has reduced legroom so not happy. 2/1 - Buriram to Bangkok. Flight due to take off at 3.30 took off 5pm. No information provided about delay to any passengers from Nok air staff about delay or when incoming aircraft likely to arrive - dependant on information on internet instead. Buriram - Bangkok 5/1 worst of the 3. No information about issues until arrive at airport. Told flight cancelled - after much arguing between all passengers and staff offered alternative of flight to Ubon and then minibus back to Buriram with cost of ticket refunded. Originally scheduled to arrive 3.10 arrived Buriram at 11pm instead. Very disappointed with Nok Air this trip not only with issues but with lack of honesty about cause and information on delays being provided in an accurate manner. The issues have arisen due to one of the leased aircraft developing a major fault causing numerous cancellations and knock-on delays but would like to have been told this. Being a big supporter of Nok Air previously I am disappointed by this.

nok-air,/airline-reviews/nok-air,Nok Air customer review,James Choochot,United Kingdom,2013-11-29,Online booking and check-in easy to use. Don Muang to Chiang Rai and return on B737-800.

Quick check-in and luggage collection at both ends. Please note that when booking online you must de-select extra luggage and insurance or these will be charged for. Free 15kgs luggage included. If your trip might involve changes to your itinerary it's well worth paying a few extra baht to buy a flexi ticket. Otherwise you have to buy a new ticket in most cases.

No queue for check-in due to very few people in the airport. Slightly dubious the luggage scales were correct given a subsequent Air Asia flight and had to pay 400 bht for a couple of kilos extra luggage - not a big deal given the price of the flights booked (1100 bht all in) but disappointing none the less in hindsight. Other than that an excellent value for money flight which arrived early and had the usual free snack and water provided during the 40 mins in the air.

Customer service was mediocre over the phone. No compensation given for this huge hassle which caused a very long layover at KLIA. Food was offered even on short flights but it did not taste very good and wasn't presented well. The service onboard was pretty good and attendants were generally very helpful.

Return was full and the usual mayhem for those boarding later who had nowhere to put hand luggage - it eventually being taken off to go in the hold (""the hat bins are now full"" as the flight attendant quaintly put it).

Again like previous reviews Monarch used a Slovakian airline using an old 737-400.

So we wait on board for a further 2 hours then are told it was only a minor problem & we can take- off. The only thing we got as an apology was a cup of tea/coffee.

The Faro flight was very uncomfortable as it was so hot and stuffy - and you cant escape it but after talking to a helpful person in Norway I was assured the other 2 flights would be properly air conditioned which they were. Always prefer airlines where you can adjust seats and that was the case re Lanzarote. The short films would be better if we had headphones and could listen too (or simply listen to music). The free wifi just about allows for emails to be received or sent but you need a well charged device to take full advantage of wifi (or provide a charging point). Slightly confusing in regards to 'flight mode' regulations as clearly it only works if your device is not in flight mode! This is the one airline however where the food and drink options are too limited and lack 'healthy' choices or good veg options - (Easyjet are best for food/drink). Unlike any of the other airlines we have to remember to bring own snacks etc. Finally no hassle with hand baggage which used to be a pre-flight concern with extra stress when flying with Ryanair or Thomas Cook. Easyjet has the best and clearest policy here 'if it fits it is free'!.

The lounge at Dulles is very nice the plane was spacious food and wine were good. The return was fine as well. My next trip the first leg went very smoothly but now as I approach the final part I am terribly frustrated and disappointed with OpenSkies. Unfortunately I had to book my return flight for this summer in November when my schedule was still a bit up in the air. About 3 weeks ago however I finalized my schedule and saw to my dismay that I would need to change my ticket by about two months. I was bracing myself for a ticket change fee - but was shocked to find out that in order to change my ticket (giving them months notice) I will need to pay $450 in addition to about $150 extra for increased gas prices - that's $600 extra for a flight change with months notice! I emailed and called and spoke with many people - all said that same thing - that's policy no way around it. Now I don't expect a big cooperation to just change their policy for me but I do expect some sort of help or at least a little sympathy when I pay thousands of dollars for a ticket. The lack of care or sympathy from those I spoke and emailed with astonished me! Not only did they not give me a break at all but they didn't even put out the effort to seem sorry for my circumstances. Perhaps most people who use this airline are wealthy but I am not. I used them this year as a special treat and now I am absolutely paying for it. As of today I can buy a round trip ticket with British Airways from Paris to NY for less than $600. And unless a miracle happens soon I'll be paying $600 just to switch the day of my flight.

pal-express,/airline-reviews/pal-express,PAL Express customer review,John Mower,Philippines,2014-06-02,I have flown several times this year on the Bacolod - Manila route most recently in the last week of May. Delays are dreadful as they seem to be on other PAL Express routes. Some of the delays are due to congestion at Manila Airport but most are not. What makes a frustrating situation worse is the complete inability to keep passengers (and those waiting to collect them) informed. Check the airport information screens and they will likely say the departure time was two hours ago; check the internet and there is no indication of any delay. Absolute rubbish. Once the plane takes off then the seating and service are fine for a budget airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,3,1,0,NA,NA,4,0

Outbound flight was tolerable although service has declined to perfunctory. What happened to the meals? Suvarnabhumi deplaning delayed first by 30 mins as pilot appeared to take wrong exit from main runway. Chaotic scenes as people started unloading luggage lockers while still on apron. No control from crew. 27th flights back were appalling. Muscat transfer was 1hr. Qatar can manage at 45mins. Not Oman. Deplaning delayed for 25 minutes as coaches were found. Chaos ensued with huge tail back at security. Being shouted at for being late by airport staff for Oman's inefficiency is not on. Plane for Muscat Heathrow leg was both shockingly filthy and decrepit. Toilets were disgusting tray tables stained and smothered in food debris. Whole plane smelt. This was a real shock to us we've used Oman regularly for over 5 yrs but these flights mean we're looking elsewhere.

Staff were unsmiling and off-hand initially we put this down to the language barrier and cultural differences. I had fallen asleep on this evening/night flight and as sitting on the outer seats ensured I positioned myself away from the passageway so as not to be bumped by other passengers. I was woken up by one the stewardesses pushing her serving trolley and knocking into my shoulder. On her way back she did it again. However as I was awake this time I asked pointed it out that I had been barged into the stewardess just looked blankly at me in an intimidating manner. Then smiling sarcastically apologised. Later when asking to purchase milk for my 4 year old daughter I was told that they had no milk no apology no smile and no offer of an alternative.

orient-thai,/airline-reviews/orient-thai,Orient Thai Airlines customer review,Gareth Duhig,NA,2005-01-01,12/04 on their new onetwo-go 'no-frills' service Phuket - Chiang mai via BKK. Being a budget airline you have to book each sector separately. They are having some issues with their website which makes it difficult to book unless you read Thai (the English option reverts to Thai every time you change a paramater then trying to change it to English takes you back to the start & back in a circle many times) Booking online you should receive an email ticket 24hrs after you book. This didn't happen for me & resulted in a very frustrating 40 mins telephone call being passed from person to person at the call centre - when all Ii wanted was the booking code to enable be to check in i spent the whole time explaining that I didnt want to book a flight etc so I had to get a Thai person to get the info I wanted. From Phuket to BKK we fly on a 747 which was old but comfortable no service was offered on the 60 min flight which was fine. Bags came through quick so we could check in for the next sector to Chang Mai. 757 used on this flight & again given emergency exit rows so very comfortable. I slept most of the flight but they served complimentary drinks & peanuts to those who wanted them.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,S Ross,United Kingdom,2014-09-06,Following all the negative reviews of the transatlantic service I was somewhat nervous about our London Gatwick - JFK return flights. However I have to say that the whole experience was as good as economy class air travel gets these days. Norwegian is using the budget airline model for this service so if you have to be realistic in that you will either have to pay for everything or take it yourself (drinks snacks pillows blankets etc.). We did a combination of both. All the staff we dealt with were professional and polite we travelled on the Dreamliner both ways which was comfortable and had no issues with the entertainment systems that others have described. We were delayed on the return leg of the journey however this was not the airlines fault as someone had checked a bag and then not turned up for the flight we had to wait while their bags were removed. My only negative comment is that Norwegian put the time of the return flight back by several hours after we had made our reservations. Although we had a lot of notice of this and were offered the option to cancel the flight we were unable to re-arrange our plans as we had already booked connecting flights etc. As we were travelling with young children this was a real pain. It seems that when the transatlantic service works it is great if you can avoid the teething problems!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

I was told that the credit card machine didn't work so I asked them to make a manual imprint of the card which they do at all other civilised airlines but they refused. I then asked to get at least some water but because they only wanted Swedish cash this was not possible either. The guy next to me wanted to buy a cup of coffee this was not possible because as it turned out also the coffee machine was broken. On the ARN-CPH sector cabin staff couldn't finish their job fast enough to have a break. My seat was passed in less than three seconds and I could get the attention of the cabin staff after that.

After reading all of the other reviews here I'm wondering if delays and cancellations are just standard fare for this airline.

Having booked well in advance was annoyed to receive email informing us of schedule change (don't Oman know their schedules for the year?) with two options : cut short trip by three days or extend by one. No offer to compensate for either loss of holiday or extension expense. Online check in is a farce only one sector can be checked in and a seat selected. Ended up row 23 LHR-MCT but row 44 MCT-BKK. Same on the reverse journey row 23 BKK- MCT row 44 MCT-LHR. Of the 8 flights with Oman on this route in the past six months IFE has worked only once. Crew range from attentive to disinterested. Food has taken a nose dive in the last six months. MCT-LHR flight at least 7 rows were denied a drinks service as a 'senior' staff member resented being told she had forgotten to do it and sulked. For the first time ever had to use the call button to ask for a drink with meal and get IFE reset after a promise to rectify went undone. Have used Oman Air's OnAir product successfully once. Good wifi speed but at $29.95 its very expensive. Decided to treat ourselves to OnAir on the MCT-LHR (longest leg). Worked fine for 20 minutes then crashed and crew couldn't have cared less.

But on the first leg LHR-MCT when my partner developed a headache and asked for a paracetamol she was told that she couldn't have one as she had been drinking alcohol! Yes she had had a 330ml of Fosters and one 18.5ml bottle of red wine in the previous 6 hours but to deny a customer a painkiller on these grounds is ridiculous and poor customer care. Then on the return flight from Muscat I requested a Gin and Tonic and was told there was no Gin on board - this was about 30mins after leaving Muscat.

Travelled on the London - Manila - London sectors several times from early December 2013 and was generally happy with the 777 comfort. However my recent journey from Manila to London was terrible. Evidently Philippine Airlines started using 15 year old A340 planes on the route in early August that appears to be part of the problem - slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality Middle Eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the in-seat media system - understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. Very basic food compared to alternative carriers. Philippine Airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for $500 which is then $500 less than a business ticket purchased online. Advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full - presumably passengers took the $500 check in upgrade.

I flew Philippine airlines Jakarta to Manila and Manila to London on July 5 2014. The latter leg is a 14.5 hour flight. Having read some of the reviews on this site I was an exceptionally reluctant flier and in fact protested belatedly at the choice of airline. I will be apologising to my agent for my complaints. The service on the flight was exceptional staff were professional courteous and always helpful in spite of some difficult requests (I chose to anticipate change in time zones by sleeping and eating at all the wrong times). The food was great wine was good cabin and toilets spotless. Although the seats don't recline all the way it is flat bed at a slight angle and perfectly acceptable for sleeping. They have a relatively sparse choice of inflight movies and shows only somewhat compensated for with loan iPads for the flight with additional choices so if are a big consumer of inflight entertainment it may be worth bringing your own especially given the length of the flight. Both flights were on time transfer at Manila faultless if surprisingly personal (escort for most of it) - this in spite of only a 1hour 10 minute layover. Check-in at Jakarta is through a dedicated business class channel which includes immigration. In all a great experience.

Manual check-in only at Edinburgh as they do not offer online check-in however no queues. Older B737-300 and did not have wifi available.

Norwegian take part in Arlanda's common check-in kiosk system which allows you to check-in at Stockholm Central Railway Station before catching the Arlanda Express. Baggage allowance is generous and flexible. Landing at Arlanda is a big bonus as is allocation of seats before boarding and the overall service is worth the little bit extra over the competing service offered by Ryanair to Skavsta (which isn't even in Stockholm) - also without the general unpleasantness with that operator.

This trip turned into a nightmare due to an unimaginable 'operations' decision that adversely impacted the travel plans of 50-100 passengers. As background QF runs the JFK-LAX flight for passengers going onwards to Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane. It is a huge convenience as there is no need to change terminals at LAX no need to go through TSA security a second time and generally better to fly QF transcontinental USA than the US carriers except on this night. That said the JFK-LAX flight on this particular evening was running about one hour behind schedule due to late arrival of the aircraft and typical JFK evening delays - this isn't all that unusual and the delay not all that long. For inexplicable reasons however Qantas chose not to hold the LAX-MEL flight for all of the passengers on the JFK-LAX flight who were Melbourne bound. Even with the one hour delay on the domestic leg we still arrived LAX before the scheduled departure time of the overseas leg and the LAX-MEL flight was running 30 minutes behind as well so Qantas had no legitimate reason not to hold the flight for another 30 minutes or so to get all Melbourne passengers on board. This forced all 50-100 of us to fly a packed B747 instead of the more comfortable A380 lost seat assignments and change planes in Sydney which is more complicated than you would think (domestic and international terminals aren't close and there is no easy from one to the other) and even worse added approximately five hours to the trip. It is inexcusable and Qantas has been unapologetic and unresponsive to emails I've written them about their decisions on that evening.

She ignored me for several minutes before finding it (she had removed it - although we had booked the same seats right through of course - and the plane wasn't full so she should even have remembered us!) and returning it without a word of apology. I am hanging out for the day when another airline services Moruya and I never have to fly Rex again. We could get to Moruya from our home airport of Melbourne via Merimbula and a drive from there but instead we choose to fly to Canberra with any other airline and drive from there as we hate flying Rex so much.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

How can you expect people to just sit there for 3.5 hours. The small shared screens are an absolute joke. Please either use newer planes with IFE flights 3+ hours or give out ipads Q streaming as is done on the 767. Flight back was on the new VH-XZO with IFE and the food was a lot better and with choice this time. What a difference it was like flying a completely different airline.

I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. Itâs fair to say that our impression of Qatarâs in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average â all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha â Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and weâd been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating itâs 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats.

royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,R Woodward,Australia,2014-09-06,I flew Melbourne to Manila return last month on RBA and was very satisfied with their overall service. Because the base airfare was already around $400 cheaper than Singapore Airlines and Philippine Airlines (who fly direct) I was not expecting a great deal. But from this experience I can say that aside from the no alcohol policy there was little to separate the flying experience between RBA and Singapore Airlines. The new B787 flying between MEL and BWN was presented in spotless condition the food onboard was very good and plentiful with very good customer service from the staff. Even on the shorter A320 flights between Brunei and Manila we were served a full meal similar to the longer Melbourne services. Probably the only downside to the experience is the small Airport at Brunei which was undergoing renovations at the time of my trip. Very little to see and do in the small terminal. No wifi TV to watch or even interesting activity on the airfield. Thankfully stopovers did not last much more than one hour or so. Like most modern economy class offerings the economy class seats on the 787 were not so comfortable and felt very hard. I have noticed this is also the case on new SQ A380s and CX 777s so it's not a unique fault of Royal Brunei. But besides these small faults I will be flying with RBA again the next time I return to Philippines and can say that as an overall experience they were well worth the money.

royal-air-maroc,/airline-reviews/royal-air-maroc,Royal Air Maroc customer review,A Conway,Morocco,2011-08-07,"Awful airline and only getting worse. Due to budget cuts flights are often cancelled at the last minute and passengers are rerouted from direct flights to itineraries that consist of up to 3 extra flights. The airline will list several flights available but then combine all the passengers for that day on one flight. This makes travel with RAM impossible if you have a connection with a different airline. While travelling to Paris my husband and I had made separate reservations. For some reason he was told on a Monday that his Saturday flight had been cancelled. I was not alerted until Thursday that the same flight had been cancelled. My mother recently flew from JFK to Casablanca. It took her friend 2 hours after landing to receive her baggage. My mother's baggage was left behind in NY. We were told to call back the next day when the suitcase should have arrived on a flight coming in at 8am. The next day I called three times hours after the flight had arrived and was told that they could not confirm that the suitcase had come in. One customer service woman refused to let me speak to her supervisor and hung up on me! We ended up paying a 50$ taxi fare to go to the airport and were told to look for the suitcase ourselves by two employees who were sitting and gossiping and playing with their cell phones. Finally we found an employee in a back office who was willing to do his job. He went to another part of the airport and returned with the suitcase.

royal-air-maroc,/airline-reviews/royal-air-maroc,Royal Air Maroc customer review,Peter Nakhili,United States,2011-07-03,I flew with Royal Air Maroc to Morocco. I bought a package that made me take a Delta Connections flight from Boston's Logan-New York's JFK. The Delta flight was bumpy! Once at JFK I made my way over to the terminal. I had to wait 8 hrs for the plane to show up. I knew this ahead of time the Delta flight was a morning flight and the Royal Air Maroc flight was at 6:32 PM. Once it was time to board the line was ridiculous. Once on board the Boeing 767 I sat down and the seats were comfortable and reclined reasonably far. About 1hr into the flight they served dinner. There was a menu and all the meals were hot. If you're ever on thus flight get the chicken. The flight was very smooth the cabin crew was very nice and also served breakfast.

I flew from London Heathrow-Casablanca which was bearable although the staff were very rude and aggressive - they obviously have no customer service skills. I would probably lose my job if I spoke to customers the way this airline's staff do. The return journey was a shambles - the original flight from Marrakech- Casablanca was cancelled and no explanation given so I was put on another flight at a later time which meant I made the connection from Casablanca-Heathrow with mins to spare. Again the staff were rude patronising and arrogant the food was unidentifiable and no apologies were given in respect of the cancelled flight added stress and subsequently lost baggage (which I am still waiting for).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Both flights on-time planes were fine food good - for economy class food it was better than some airlines I have previously flown including Qantas and Icelandair. We had no problems with service. Our only problem was the stopover in Casablanca on the outward flight as the transit lounge facilities are very poor insufficient seating and availability of food and drink was very limited. There are improvements being made at present but in the meantime we would avoid the route via Casablanca and book direct flights both ways. The staff were are all time polite and available.

All flights on 777-300ER except DOH-FRA which was an older A330-300. This was our first time with QR (would normally use SQ or CX for this type of trip)and we were quite impressed with the overall economy service. Planes were quite clean and well maintained although the A330 was definitely showing its age. We found all staff to be professional and in general were quite friendly even if smiles were a little limited. The economy food was surprisingly good and varied plus of decent quantity. Alcohol limited without asking but always available. Call buttons seemed to get quick attention from what we observed. All flights on time or early except for one which was only 20 minutes late. I found economy seat comfort and legroom acceptable despite being 192cm tall. Very happy the QR 777 is 9 abreast and not the 10 across that some others try to squeeze in.

royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,K Pascoe,Australia,2013-10-10,My Husband and I travelled from Melbourne to Hong Kong with a stop over in Brunei. The staff on the 7ish hour flight from Melbourne to Brunei were lovely. They constantly came around with drinks and were happy to hand out blankets and pillows. Plus they handed out peanuts. The only problem was that the headphones they supplied wouldn't go into the plugs in the armrest but I used my own with no problems. The flight was great one of the best I have been on. Entertainment is a little limited if you compare it to someone like Emirates but it is a cheaper airline. Provided good movie choices some TV and music and some games. Flights from Brunei to Hong Kong and back again were on smaller older planes. They still served a full meal despite it being a much shorter flight and the entertainment was drop down overhead TV's. I don't have a problem with this on the shorter flights and usually take my own entertainment anyway. On the return flight to Melbourne it was an overnight flight. Blankets weren't provided but handed out when people asked. They were also around quite frequently with drinks and I had no complaints on the food either. I am vegetarian and am a little hard to please but I was quite pleased. No problems with the toilets on board. Clean whenever I went and I couldn't smell them at any time. Only complaint was of course the bathroom facilities in the Royal Brunei terminal in Brunei. Terrible! My suggestion would be to use the ones in the shower rooms as they were a bit cleaner.

Check completed in under five minutes but surprised no fast track through security Qatar use the No 1 traveller lounge adequate but nothing special. Boarding was quick and staff apologised for small delay whilst a family with young children boarded in front of us. We flew the Dreamliner and had chosen window seats specifically with my partner seated directly behind me. Seat was very comfortable and the general cabin ambience was excellent the cabin layout is 1x2x1. Served a very nice rose champagne after boarding food choice of wines and entertainment all very good. Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in. Had more time to see the new Al Mourjan Lounge this time it's very large good choice of food and lots of seating although at 06.00 it was very busy.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Walker,Bangladesh,2014-01-29,Living in Asia there are not a lot of route choices with Qantas especially as they have recently withdrawn a lot of their Asian flights and/or downgraded from 747 and A380 to A330 aircraft. However as I am still a Qantas Gold member I decided to remain loyal and travel back to Brisbane (via Sydney) from Bangkok. This flight used to have Premium Economy but since the introduction of the 330 aircraft there is only Business or Economy and so because of the exorbitant price for Business Class ($3920) I chose to travel Economy. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable with a ridiculously small amount of leg room (I am only 178cm so I have no idea how a tall person would cope). The seat fabric and carpet was very worn and faded and stained and the entertainment system only worked for the first 2 hours of my return trip. The food was terrible but thankfully the wine was good. However by far the worst issue is the FA's most of them have obviously been in their jobs way too long and no longer seem to enjoy what they do and show it through their couldn't care less attitude and lack of attentiveness to their customers. I am now thinking about taking my loyalty to Malaysia Thai or Cathay Pacific all of which are far better and less expensive than Qantas.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2014-01-09,Flew First from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai on A380 and was impressed by nearly all aspects of the trip. Check in at Sydney was a little chaotic as the First Class check-in area was overwhelmed by large families of Platinum members using the facility but then having the usual priority immigration and security available to premium travellers I enjoyed the Qantas First Class lounge. An enjoyable spa treatment. The food at the sit down restaurant was one of the best lounge restaurants I have been to. On board service was indeed First Class with staff making sure they knew all passengers by name and able to respond to any queries. The seat itself is comfortable and infinitely adjustable although the controls for it are rather complex and take a little time to get used to. Made up as a bed it is easy to get sleep with adequate privacy and space to sleep on one's side and upright it is good for relaxing eating and working. Inflight pyjamas were better than those provided by other airlines and the amenities kit more useful as well. The massage function is enjoyable although a bit noisy. Quality of food for dining was excellent although it would have been helpful to know that the supper menu either side of the Dubai transit was nearly identical. Large range of food items although I thought the dessert selection was rather poor and the champagne in the lounge was better than that inflight. Inflight entertainment system excellent with a good choice and high quality screen and headphones. Transit at Dubai is pleasant at the enormous Emirates First Class lounge although at the time I travelled the spa was closed and it wasn't entirely clear when the boarding announcement would be. On arrival at London we had the same experience as other travellers and it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive - hardly priority. As an added touch it was good to be able to use the AA Arrivals lounge for a shower and a quick cup of coffee before heading into town. An excellent experience competitive with others but unclear if it is good enough to justify the price premium over business.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,9,5,5,4,5,NA,NA,3,1

Departure delayed due to an ill passenger having to be off loaded but the cockpit crew kept everyone informed of the situation. Seats are not the newest design but the airline supplies a duvet too fit over the cushions as well as pyjamas which really aid sleeping. The crew were very friendly and efficient making the trip all the more enjoyable. For example they got some balsamic vinegar for me as I could not use the dressing provided. My main gripe is about the food. The salad is just a few leaves and the main course I had amounted to a fancy Panini sandwich. Nice as it was it did not fit the business class image. Nor did breakfast which was a choice of either fruit one cinnamon cake or a spinach/cheese tart. Rather poor given you often get more in economy class on some routes. Baggage delivery at Sydney was quick which was good.

Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members' assistance.

I flew with Royal Jordanian on the last three flight segments and I would not recommend it. The interior quality of the planes were poor 2/3 times and the seats in economy class do not easily accommodate someone taller than 5'10"" (too tight for the knees). The staff and crew seem unapproachable and disinterested. It is also irritating that if you book online you then have to be pulled aside at check-in so they can verify your card. I understand the concept but the fact that they force you to step out of line and then wait in line again after they finish is really frustrating. I don't understand why they cannot invest in card reader machines at the check-in kiosks particularly at the new airport where RJ is the resident airlines.

I've opted to avoid Ryanair for the last five years preferring to travel on full-service airlines from central airports for a little more money. However in this instance Ryanair offered the easiest best times connection from Edinburgh to Vienna (well Bratislava). I paid Â£8 for seat 1C (extra leg room and priority boarding) and Â£15 to check in a bag online the day before departure. Bag drop at Edinburgh was efficient. On time departure friendly staff quick flight early arrival can't complain. Apart from the lousy dry cheese sandwiches and drinks you get on Lufthansa/Austrian the difference was minimal.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2015-05-22,MAN-PMI-MAN. Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost Â£10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under Â£120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for Â£200 per person in low season.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

I was told on check-in at La Paz that it had been upgraded to Business Class which would have been welcomed after 26 hours travelling on two international sectors earlier. On boarding flight SK638 at FRA I found the seats to be exactly the same size and configuration as in economy class and every seat was to be occupied i.e. including the middle ones or all 15 seats. Yet the economy cabin itself was only one- third full and there were many rows with no passengers at all. Why was I then forced to pay a full-fare economy to fly that evening? We at SAS Plus were offered an alternative of either a chicken or cheese sandwich only and only then asked if we wanted anything else. When I asked what else was available I was shown the menu turned specially to the pages listing snacks with prices which I declined considering it an insult on business class of a non-budget airline. Yet I saw about 4-6 full-meal trays handed to an economy flight attendant. The meal clearance was conducted within 10 minutes of the completion of the meal serving. Soon after I spotted the business class attendants in the galley eating a full-meal tray each. Later I noticed that this was the evening meal on the menu which was meant as complimentary for business class (SAS Plus) passengers. Why were the flight attendants - including those in economy cabin - eating our meal entitlement never even having offered it to us? Shameful behaviour! The menu in-flight magazine and safety card were dog-eared and very old looking.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2014-10-28,"AGP - LPL. Usually fly with easyJet but Ryanair had a more convenient time for our return from Malaga. Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,4,3,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Booked China Eastern but the flight was operated by Shanghai Airlines. IFE was via a projector projecting onto a screen at the front of the cabin but for some unknown reason it was not used during the 4hr 40min flight. Seat was a recliner seat (what you usually find in domestic business flights) and they were very old and worn out. Leg rest on my seat was broken and the tray table on the seat next to me was broken. The fabric on the seat behind me was torn. As I was in the front row there was a bit more legroom than other business seats but for a 180cm person my leg was still hitting the bulkhead. Legroom for the seats behind were around the same as an economy seat on most other large airlines. Food was very average and staff service was quite good.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,2,4,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

The flights were on time and the planes were reasonably clean. We travelled with hand baggage only and didn't pay extra for seat allocation. We travel regularly with Ryanair and rarely experience problems - I find them more reliable than many other airlines. The return flight was 2 1/2 hours and I think that this is the limit that I'd be prepared to fly with Ryanair.

SAS prices on this route are only going one way - up. A return ticket will set you back around â¬400 which in my opinion is a rip-off for a 1.15 flight cramped in a CRJ900. Funnily enough a return ticket from VNO to LHR via CPH on same departures from VNO is exactly the same price. Onboard services are the usual low-cost standards: everything except tea or coffee is completely overpriced. As long as there is no competition on this route things are unlikely to change.

There was even a fold out foot rest under the seat in front. Food was nothing special a snack box type thing and a drink. Handed out with a smile from crew which were otherwise not present.

After about 6 calls over 3 hours time had run out. I took the original flight and missed the connection. At Singapore at midnight SQ gave me a hotel voucher for the Conrad and told me to take a taxi. The taxi queue was at least an hour long. I would have had a couple of hours sleep before needing to get up and return. At the SQ desk I swapped this for a much more logical bed in the ""pay by the hour"" mini hotel in T3. Why wasn't this offered in the first place? Why do I have to ask? Silk Air A320?

Copenhagen airport was very quiet when I got there on Tuesday. SAS is constantly upgrading passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting through the airport to your gate. Their latest development is a self-service Bag Drop. Fairly simple to use. The bag is put on an unmanned luggage conveyer belt which the machine registers and weighs. The passenger then uses a bar reader gun to pick up the details from the luggage tag. The bag is then transported away. Any problems/machine errors are sorted out by a member staff on call. So now all normal pre-flight checks and documentation before security (including passport verification) can be done without staff contact and hopefully without queuing.

Check-in at LHR for lunchtime departure was instant - no queue. Boeing 777 2x5x2 seating. Comfortable seats decent legroom economy about half- full. Newspapers offered (mainly Arabic) followed by soft drinks. Typical airline food. Seatback screen but not AVOD - system had to be re-set twice by cabin crew early on but otherwise no problems. Flight smooth with the exception of a couple of Arab children running repeatedly up the aisles - fairly normal on MidEast airlines where parents rarely discipline their offspring. Major stroke of luck on arrival at Jeddah as I was attending a conference for which Saudia was handling many of the arrangements so whisked through VIP lounge passport stamped and into a taxi within 20 minutes of getting off aircraft. Jeddah-Riyadh again a 777 an 80-minute hop. Aircraft packed which made the serving of a full breakfast particularly impressive : full marks to the cabin crew. Not a lot of smiles from them but understandable when concentrating on serving 300 people in such a short time. Riyadh-LHR another 777 but this time 10-abreast (3-4-3) and seats noticeably thinner and less comfortable. Felt as though there was around an inch less legroom too which made an appreciable difference. Cabin crew helpful: one FA volunteered that my seatback screen was not working and offered to re-seat me. Only problem was again children running around and one little girl was actually standing on her seat as take-off started. Toilets acceptable.

We did pre-order a meal Coolangatta to Singapore which admittedly I will not be doing again - the worst airline meal I have ever had. We learnt our lesson and didn't worry with the on board food service again. I noticed a number of reviewers complained about lengthy check-in queues - perhaps we were lucky but we had no such difficulties. I should mention that between the four of us we did only have 3 small backpacks which were less then 7kg in weight and we checked them in as cabin luggage. On the way home we did arrive at both Bangkok and Singapore airports quite early (around 3.5 hours) due to an early flight from Koh Samui and an overnight in Singapore. So we were the first ones to check in. this worked in our favour as we were for some reason automatically upgraded to the yellow seats on both sectors. they are definitely more comfy and have more leg room then the blue seats. However to be honest we are not big people (average height average build) so the blue seats were fine for us anyway if you were taller or bigger in size it may be more uncomfortable I guess.

On the way back to Stockholm I travelled with the A321 quite similar but equipped with overhead monitors. The A321 is also equipped with Recaro seats but with slightly better padding but obviously worn since they have been around for some years by now. Generally the trip was good mostly thanks to the very professional and friendly staff.

Transfer went very smoothly. However Hertz told me that they did not have an office in Poitiers and my only option was to cancel which I did only to be charged a 50 euro cancellation fee even though I had booked through Ryanair.

As other posters have noted it's definitely worth paying for the extra leg room in the yellow ""Stretch"" seats. However the seats themselves are very narrow (10 abreast in a 777) and are uncomfortable with no head rest. The forward economy cabin was also very cold. I pre-paid for meals but wouldn't do so again. In future I would bring my own food. I also pre-paid for ""Scoot-thru."" - the Scoot transfer facility in Singapore for Scoot-Scoot or Tiger passengers. The advantage of doing this is that it provides a similar connection facility to that of just about any legacy carrier. Not pre- paying this fee means that if I had missed the connecting flight I would have had to pay (according to Scoot terms and conditions) a re-booking fare and the fare differential for the next available flight even if the problem was with Scoot. Paying the ""Scoot-thru"" fee also meant that in Singapore I did not have to claim my bag clear customs and check in again for the connecting flight. Instead I was able to organise my next flight at Scoot's transfer facility within the airside departure level. Service is friendly but the staff don't seem particularly assertive.

The flight was SK580 from CDG to ARN with a Boeing 737-700W and although a long term Eurobonus Gold member I was given seat 2B (middle seat) with no possibility to change seat. Since SAS introduced SAS Plus there is no longer a free middle seat. The very good food previously served is also gone. Now the only option is to choose something from the so called ""Sky Cafe"" i.e. cold food with low quality like a sandwich or a salad. During my six flights since the new service concept were introduced there have been no variation in the menu. To me this is a disaster.

This was my second experience with SAS newly adopted SAS Go and SAS Plus. I travelled in SAS Plus at seat 1F. Cabin staff at SAS are generally very friendly and service minded. The new SAS Plus (C-class) is however a greatly degraded service compared to the previous Business Class. To my opinion even the former Economy Extra was much better. In SAS Plus you are served (free of charge) a limited choice of cold sandwich or a cold salad i paper boxes with plastic cutlery. Exactly the same choice is offered in SAS Go but then you have to pay for it. There is no longer a free middle seat in SAS Plus.

The lounge at AMS (3rd party) is poor - I hadn't had breakfast thinking I would be able to grab at least some bread/crackers and cheese at the lounge but that was not to be. The lounge does have ample seating but that's about it - no computer terminals. The lounge at CPH was better but not up to the standard of a major carrier's hub (at least not on the first level where Business class passengers are directed) - the only wine (2 choices - red or white) came from beer taps and the food selection was bare bones for an early evening transcontinental departure. Once on board things looked up - with 1 recurring annoying exception - both my seat mate and I both women never got an offer to hang up our jackets and finally wound up hanging them up ourselves - this happens to me a lot and always burns me. Aside from that the service was very good and the food OK - after the meal service when the flight attendants change into chef's outfits they put out a snack bar of fruit cookies etc. and I always like this possibility.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,5,4,0,NA,NA,4,1

They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (Â£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat.

No one at the airport to talk to only a phone at the help desk and then you could not get through. Eventually did speak to someone who did not explain the reason for the delay and explained that food vouchers would be given out at 20.30. Really poor customer service in my opinion. Hiding behind a telephone. Other families with very young children were told that the children under 5 not entitled to food vouchers. Do under 5s not eat and drink?

The cabin staff are pleasant as always but it's definitely harder for them. The planes were pretty much on time (as usual). On my last trip the particular check-in staff at Sydney were great (our bags were mistagged and they sorted it out well) and I think it reflects their character: I'm sure these people are always good.

The outbound flight was delayed 45 minutes due to a late inbound flight. The plane we flew on was not branded as Small Planet. It was a rather garish black and orange and I could not make out the company from the insignia on the tail. Most of the writing insight was Greek so perhaps it belonged to a local airline. Plenty of legroom and we were served sweets on takeoff and drinks (water tea etc) and a sandwich for free during the flight. My sandwich was supposed to be toasted but was in fact quite soggy. Flight was smooth and staff were quite friendly. Plane was quite old but the flight was smooth and we landed probably only about 30 minutes late. The return flight left 15 minutes late and arrived on time at Gatwick. The plane was Small Planet branded a lot more modern than the inbound flight however with significantly less legroom! No free food this time but the interior was much better and the staff more friendly and upbeat. Again the flight was smooth. I would use the airline again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,2,0,NA,NA,4,1

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,N Hobbs,United Kingdom,2013-09-08,Having used Ryanar for the past 3 yrs travelling to Tenerife Gran Canaria and Reus I we can only fully recommend and thank them for their fast efficient service. This is a budget airline and all extras are stated on booking on their website. For all those who wish to pay over the odds eg. extra Â£700 per family to fly to a destination then book Thomson or Thomas Cook however we used these one way to Reus and had an hour and half delay compared to every flight with Ryanair on time or usually 10 mins early. Some people just like to complain if you have a young family and want to sit together pre book seats or alternatively use Priority Boarding. I only wish Ryanair flew from Cardiff airport as we would save even more travel costs however it is worth the trip to Bristol as you could never fly a family of 4 from Cardiff for Â£700 to Canaries.

Upper deck economy cabin is a small cabin which contains around 80 seats. SIN-HKG I was greeted by the FA's with smiles food was very good. HKG-SIN flight an unusual announcement made by the captain about strong winds on the end of the airfield .

The plane was clean and it took off and arrived on time. If you are travelling on a weekend break for 2 adults then I imagine it wouldn't be a problem just so long as you read all the small print and adhere to them very carefully however with 4 small children and no way to book a seat it was extremely stressful. I do not understand what they gain by using this system! Would go as far as to say that it is immoral that knowing that you cannot take drinks on board they do not supply water and a small bottle of water is Â£3! Staff were miserable and openly complained about other passengers whilst stood next to me. They enforce the rules when it suits them. They told a lady that she had to put her cardigan in the overhead lockers but the woman next to me had a handbag on her lap.

We bought tickets from their website and purchased preferred seats for an extra hundred dollars only to end up sitting in completely different sections of the plane. Our advance purchase had not been logged into their booking system. Our problem isn't that we couldn't sit next to each other but the way in which we were treated by the Singapore Airlines staff. One particular male check in staff blatantly displayed annoyance at us and showed no signs that he was willing to rectify the issue. We gave in and just decided to sit in whatever was assigned to us and after a promise of a refund for the preferred seating we were dismissively waved off. Started off badly on the ground and continued in the air when we were bypassed during meal service and one rude staff wasn't interested when we questioned her.

Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option.

Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest. I can fly into JFK pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a Southwest flight to ISP costs.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,2,4,0,NA,NA,NA,2,0

JNB-PLZ in B737-800 fitted with wider seats and more legroom in Business class. If you have to travel from Cape Town to Joburg book SA346 flight in the afternoon at around 3pm. They use an A340-600 from the Cape to JNB and you'll sit - or lie - in SAA flat bed seats for a domestic flight of just 90 mins. If SAA only managed to teach their ground staff the same efficiency and friendliness that their onboard crews have I would have rated both trips a10 instead 9. I've rarely met more attentive polite and friendly flight attendants than on SA flights. Some airport staff on the other hand prefer to give you the impression as if they were forced to work there.

Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes. Southwest gave us a credit for the trouble without us asking.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1

FCO-CMB: the seats immediately appeared old and not really clean. Each seat had a display which definition was extremely poor and despite the in-flight guide told that there were a couple of movies in Italian I didn't find them. I asked a cabin attendant and the answer was ""I'm afraid that there are no movies in Italian"". The available space was average enough comfortable and the food had a good taste. The only positive aspects: good to have metal cutlery and bar always opened. At the duty free they didn't have the cigarettes I asked for (even in the catalogue). CMB-MLE: short flight on a pretty new aircraft but the temperature was set extremely cold despite many passengers asked for increasing it no results. MLE-CMB: 1.5 hour delay trip acceptable. CMB-FCO: 5 hours of lately announced delay about 6 real hours until the effective departure time. Tens of passengers waiting for the opening of the waiting room sitting on a few chairs and on the floor (it was 5 am local time). They opened it about half an hour later that the announced boarding time. Again old-looking seats but better displays with movies in Italian. The displays however seemed not to be originally ""built-in"" the seats and the inclination was not wide enough per a perfect view. I needed a glass of water to take a medicine and I had to ring the cabin assistants 8 times before to have their attention.

Main dissatisfaction was that after making very specific enquiries about weight and dimensions of cabin baggage we scrupulously limited ourselves to 7kg only to see people carrying large cumbersome and clearly heavy cases onto the aircraft. If they make rules they should enforce them and not rely on Brits to do all the compliance! On three out of four meal services the options shown on the menu card we had been ceremoniously presented with had run out. On one occasion a cabin stewardess made a special effort to try to provide something better than the default. Ordering a drink that came out of a can (eg beer) you did not get the can - just a glass! The safety demonstration was very poor. I was twenty rows back from the cabin crew and they simply seemed to wave their arms around to demonstrate the emergency exits. Terrible lack of rigour. Ironic that we had to make a safety stop at Frankfurt on return to London and the cabin crew we called upon to demonstrate emergency procedures again just before we landed. That said the flight was reasonably comfortable and passenger handling otherwise to an acceptable standard. My main yardstick is BA who would win hands down.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,2,3,NA,NA,3,0

Tried repeatedly to check in online but got an automated message that this was not possible. BA desk at Manchester confirmed they could not through check pax or luggage. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the baggage collection on arrival from Manchester transfer between terminals and so called âfast-trackâ security was a nightmare taking almost 3 hours. Lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used â spacious and relaxing environment. Boarding was a bit chaotic. Families with children called first no preference given to business class. Onboard service and environment was similar to typical business/club class with many other airlines with the exception of the entertainment system (very limited selection not easy to use poor quality sound). Crew very attentive drinks served frequently good choice of western and Sri Lankan meals for dinner and breakfast. Flat bed was very comfortable. Good Bulgari amenity kit. Returned in economy class (2-4-2 configuration). No queue for check in at Colombo and were allocated requested seats. Surprised that we were automatically through checked to Manchester even though we were overnighting at HRW. CMB airport was a reasonable size with a good selection of shops. Airport has a limited number of toilets and these can be very busy at certain times. Clear boarding announcements. Good welcome and attentiveness from crew. No amenity kit despite this being a 12 hour flight. Seat pitch and width is not significantly better or worse than many scheduled economy seats. There was no foot rest.

The only hitch on this trip is that upon returning to DFW we could not get our checked luggage for over 1.5 hrs. It was very frustrating. But if you need a cheap seat and you can pack light and either pay the carry on charge for you luggage or just put everything in a small backpack then Spirit may work for you. We also had to wait once we landed for a gate to open up so we sat on the ground an extra 15 minutes before our plane could get into a gate. I also brought my own snacks so make sure you do that. I chose to purchase water after passing through security and getting inside the terminal. I took my bottled water in my small backpack along with my snacks onto the airplane and this was not a problem. Other than these problems it went relatively well. I checked in online and printed my boarding passes online from my home. The Spirit staff and the airport and on both flights were acceptable. Also Spirit was one of few airlines that offered DFW to PDX non-stop which for me is important because I don't like multiple flights. Bottom Line.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,D Tyler,United States,2014-05-13,I flew from Chicago to Vegas and it was fine for the most part. Employees were friendly and the plane arrived on time. There was basically no leg room (I'm 6'0 185 lbs) but it's not like my knees were on the seat in front of me. I joined the $9 club and had everybody I booked tickets for split that cost; our trip there and back was a couple hundred less than any other airline I looked at. The complaints about the lack of free food/drinks and high baggage fees are ridiculous to me. There is a reason the base price is so low so understand what you're buying first because I had zero surprises when I showed up at the airport. I wouldn't want to be on a Spirit plane for any kind of international flight (unless I made the seat upgrade) but for a 2-3 hour trip the savings are worth it. This is especially true if you're traveling light. My only legitimate complaint was they lost my bag from Vegas back to Chicago but they shipped it to my house within a few days. I was the only one on the flight who lost his bags and I know losing bags is not an isolated occurrence for just Spirit. I'd give my experience an 8/10 and I would fly Spirit again for a domestic flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,1,1,NA,NA,5,1

Do your homework lower your expectations and enjoy your cheap airfare. They charge for everything water to check a bag to stow your carry-on in the overhead compartment to choose a seat print your boarding pass at the airport. Do your homework and figure out what makes the most sense for your trip and don't assume you'll get anything for free. For 2 of us checking one bag and purchasing our seats was still $150 cheaper than 2 tickets on Delta. You are allowed one free carry- on bag but it needs to fit under the seat and must meet the dimensions set by Spirit we each had computer bags and were just fine. Checked baggage must weigh less than 40 lbs - 10lbs lighter than most airlines. There is no wifi on board. There are no inflight magazines bring a book or buy a magazine. The seats are smaller than normal coach. If you are uncomfortable in coach seats on Delta don't fly Spirit. I'm 5'5' and 6 months pregnant with an aisle seat on a 3 hour flight I was fine.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,J Wang,United States,2014-02-21,Round trip on Spirit with one-way duration of 3 hours. The reason I chose Spirit Airline was price. On the outbound trip I had to pay $45 because my suitcase was 0.5 inch wider than their measurement. This suitcase has been used all the time for carry-on baggage with many different airlines never with any problems. Once on board the flight attendants one male and one female never smiled. Neither did they provide a single complimentary drink not even tap water for 3+ hours. They simply force you to buy their merchandise. Before the end of the trip the do-not-know-how-to-smile male attendant made three announcements to urge travelers to sign up Spirit credit card and how many benefits you would get with those cards all within half an hour. On my return trip things get worse. Though I gave away my half-an-inch-larger suitcase to avoid the $45 fee and my stuff in a plastic bag fits well in the free personal item measurement. The Spirit gatekeeper insisted I pay $100 for my things by calling out to close the gate - he knows perfectly well the mentality of a weary traveler and he hits them right on spot. I was the last one there trying to avoid this $100 expenditure out of nowhere. But I don't want to be left behind so I gave in. On board again not a single drop of complimentary water. At least this time the flight attendants smiled. They simply paraded with an empty trash bag to walk back and forth.

Aircraft was filthy but on time. Was quite concerned when airline staff took our passports to be returned in Aleppo - to identify domestic passengers or give us an incentive not to stay onboard for the long flight to Sweden (and civilisation). Return was on decades-old Tupolev 134 although this aircraft was very clean. Day two was a round trip on the same aircraft to Deirezzor and back to fly on a Yak 40 (very unusual old Russian commuter jetliner gone from service everywhere else in the world). While the Yak was a novelty I am sure for a regular airline passenger it would be quite scary as the plane was in fairly poor condition. Our flight unlike the previous day's ALP/ARN service left from the domestic terminal a real third world mess with puddles of water and ash on the floor no signs or shops or anything. Smoking was encouraged though. On arrival at Deirezzor my travel partner and I were arrested because (we assume) it was unusual for pax to fly-and-return in the same morning. Released and allowed to rejoin the flight back to Damascus but on arrival back at DAM were arrested again and spent the entire day being interviewed by scary ""security"" officials who were not only sinister but also incompetent eg: photocopied our passports but inadvertently gave us the photocopy then searching their own paperwork for the photocopies etc. Perhaps our travel plans were out of the ordinary but if it was an itinerary unfavourable to Syrian security concerns why sell us the ticket in the first place? Eventually released shaken. Day three was a day trip to Latakia beach resort. Old Yak 40 again shabby service smoking cabin crew smoking refuellers etc. Waiting at small Latakia airport for return to DAM many plainclothes cops pacing like circling sharks due to a VIP passenger. Same at international departures (TK to IST and on to LHR) - circling security agents in shiny suits everywhere hanging ceiling panels frayed wires broken luggage belts broken destination indicators with hand-written signs taped over them (complete with spelling mistakes! our flight was to Astanbul).

Trip down was average flight was on-time leaving and we even landed a little early. Flight attendants were alright on the way down but on the way back was a different story. Flight was 4 hours late getting to the airport but even before that the complementary service that took us from our resort to the airport got us there another 4 hours early. Spent 8 hours in the airport waiting for the flight. Once we finally were boarded we took off promptly I understood that everyone was tired but it is the flight attendants job to still be courteous and friendly which was not the case. The food was what we expected it to be on a plane and the ""champagne flight"" was actually a 1/4 cup of champagne in a little plastic glass that was only served on the way to our vacation not on the way home.

Crew was efficient enough until we landed but then things sort of fell apart. When the plane briefly stopped taxiing still far from the gate many people stood up to get their bags to get in line and be among the first to disembark. When the plane continued moving with many people still standing in the aisle crew did nothing. Did not even make an announcement over the public address system. When we disembarked to busses to go to our gate airline personnel disappeared for a while. People continued to push onto the first bus in line.

I called the company and they told me it would not be possible. The unavailability of online check-in led to problems on the flight namely many passengers being unhappy with their seat assignments. I was asked twice to switch seats. I also overheard 3 other passengers asking other passengers to change seats. They were also very adamant about the weight of carry-on baggage being under 8 pounds.

To add insult to injury on my later visit to the toilet I witnessed a crew member unwrapping and consuming a hot bacon roll. It's ok for some!

Apparently the seats have been changed on Alfie in Premium and having the screens in the back of the seats was a better idea than the previous seats. I had to actually lean forward to touch the screen to access the entertainment that's how much room there is. The in flight service there and back was first class and the drinks never stopped for a moment. The food wasn't bad either considering its airline food and it was nice having a menu to choose from. The electrically tinting windows are an excellent idea rather than shutting of the light totally we had two windows in our seating position so we could dim the farthest window to watch a film whilst retaining some light. Being Premium you are boarded first and off loaded first which is nice but I did not see any resentment among economy passengers which has been suggested elsewhere!",NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1

Other than having to limbo in and out of the window seat very nice. I consider myself to be fairly nimble but who's idea was it to put that monstrosity of a centre consul between the seat's! I mentioned it to the staff after landing at Gatwick and was told that their had been a considerable number of complaints and that they were going to change this. We fly to Mexico again in August this year in Premium on the Dreamliner but not looking forward to limboing in and out of the seat again!,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

The aircraft has been reconfigured to a 2-4-2 seating plan. We were seated mid cabin in the 2 seat starboard side.

I carefully booked in advance seats on all legs so I could choose seats with a lot of space (27J on the routes from Europe to Brazil and back). 27J has a lot of extra room for legs since it is near the emergency exit and is the first to be served. It is also close to toilets. The A340 is old with practically no IFE and food is very basic. However I found seats to be reasonably comfortable and could sleep in both flights. In the leg from Lisbon to Rio the flight was practically full; in the way back less than 50% of seats was occupied. European legs were also fine: food served is also very basic (including an uneatable sandwich) but at least there was some IFE with flight information. Overall all flights were not that exciting but always on time and transfer within Lisbon airport is pretty fast.

A man took seriously ill approx 3 hours into the flight and we were subsequently diverted to the Azure's. We were stuck on the plane for approx 2 hours whilst Thomson considered their options with the pilots offering little correspondence to the customers.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,T Ward,United Kingdom,2014-09-14,EMA to Madeira. August 2014. Positives: Both flights departed and arrived on time. Both planes new. Negatives: Seating - cramped / uncomfortable. I'm 5ft 10 so not overly tall but 3.5/4 hours really is the limit. Food: You book a five star hotel but the experience on board is far from five star why on a 4 hour flight can we no longer order / pay for a proper meal? Being offered chips at 7am just doesn't work in my opinion / neither does a Kit Kat. East Midlands airport is an absolute joke and by the time you've 'dropped your bags off' and cleared security you have no time to buy something half decent to eat for the flight. Crew were OK. Miserable on the outward flight and to be honest they looked liked they'd had a rough night previous. Thomson flights aren't cheap but the level of service doesn't reflect this. I've booked this trip for my family independently for next year and booked TAP flights to Madeira. Just a note: why do people feel the need to say how bumpy their flight was?

thai-airways,/airline-reviews/thai-airways,Thai Airways customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2013-07-19,BKK-SYD-BKK Business Class on 747-400s as part of a longer itinerary from LHR to/from NZ. In both cases placed in upper deck of 747 which was a quiet but pleasant cabin. At BKK it is always a delight to be able to use the Royal Orchid Spa in advance of flying C Class on TG and that proved to be exceptional although the lounges themselves are looking tired. Boarding was reasonably orderly with a warm welcome. The angled lie-flat business class seat was fine for the SYD-BKK afternoon-evening flight as it is comfortable for relaxing reading watching movies and snoozing but found it difficult to get much of a sleep on BKK-SYD between the cabin being too warm and sliding down the seat. Service from cabin crew was friendly and efficient. The meals were adequate although not outstanding. All but one of the main courses and desserts were mediocre but the starters and range of drinks were quite good. Inflight entertainment system had a wide range of movies and reasonable TV and music selections enough to keep me occupied. Only downside was an excessive level of high volume announcements so loud that it is deafening through the headphones. Thai's Business Class is ok but the angled lie-flat seating has had its day and it could do with a bit more effort in quality of catering (certainly the quantity and range of choices were reasonable) which would complement the excellent cabin crew.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,2,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1

thomas-cook-airlines,/airline-reviews/thomas-cook-airlines,Thomas Cook Airlines customer review,M Hunter,United Kingdom,2013-10-07,Manchester to Jamaica found staff to be unfriendly rude and not very helpful. They had ran out of chicken at row 20 and we were row 26 we heard them state to one another that no chicken left and never enough are packed. When they reached our row we were not informed sorry no chicken only sausages left they just sat a tray down with no explanation or conversation. This was our first flight travelling with Thomas Cook and despite reading reviews before travelling was prepared for not as good air experience as others in past but were very disappointed. They spent most of time trying to sell you food drink and bingo cards! Bearing in mind it was an 11 hour flight not much offered free in respect of fluids. The earphones were another rip off but luckily after reading reviews had taken our own but sound quality was pore as was the choice. It was like watching the big TVs from years ago that we're on the wall only they were on seat back they run same movies and programmes over and over. On return we were delayed 4 hours but luckily were told to remain in hotel until picked up. Had a choice of meal on way back. The staff were all very unfriendly and not approachable at all. Only plus point was the hotel and rep were first class but flights were less than acceptable for a major tour operator.

thai-airways,/airline-reviews/thai-airways,Thai Airways customer review,Shane Walker,Bangladesh,2013-07-01,I have only recently started flying with Thai Airways between Dhaka and Bangkok as their flight times are much better than that of Bangkok Air. Flights are always on time departing Bangkok but are occasionally delayed out of Dhaka. Most of the time I find the crew friendly and helpful (I have experienced a few grumpy one). Aircraft's are clean and well maintained. The food is OK but nothing special and they have a very limited range of alcohol in Economy Class. The thing I like most about Thai is the amount of leg room in Economy and they have a great selection of on-board entertainment (movies music TV etc.),NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

Plane was old and not great for legroom but cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Outward was an hour late for which they apologised and didn't try to blame anyone else for it which was refreshing. Inbound flight was on time and actually landed early. Inflight entertainment was overhead screens with a couple of films an you could rent headphones or buy adapters.

Only to get onboard to be told we had another 30 minute wait due to missing our slot. Once we finally got into the air the crew did a chaotic drinks service which seemed rushed and unorganised. It must have become all too much for three of the crew as they decided to take a seats in row one for 20/25 minutes taking about their children. Just before landing one of the crew members did the most pathetic congratulation to a just married couple I have ever heard she even put the tannoy down before finishing the sentence.

Also the plane was very old now it works and got us there and back but was rather tatty in places and could do with a re-furb or replacement!

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2014-06-02,Gatwick - Cancun - Gatwick. This was in the new 787 Dreamliner. Premium Economy has a 2-3-2 configuration and a 36â seat pitch. All flights on time. Meals rather ordinary but drinks dispensed generously. A good selection of films and other entertainment on the IFE system stored in the armrest. Two toilets in the Premium cabin one in the forward galley and one at the rear of the cabin; on the outward leg I was rather brusquely asked to sit in my seat rather than wait in the galley for the toilet to become available this seemed a bit unnecessary and over assertive for the sake of it since I wasn't in anybody's way but other than that service was generally good. Regarding the Dreamliner cabin air is apparently of a higher quality than other aircraft due to greater cabin pressure and humidity difficult to say for sure how much difference this made but I disembarked both flights feeling in good shape. The cabin ceiling is comparatively high and the overhead baggage compartments are generously sized. A few issues though. As many others have noted there is a serious problem with the design of the seats / armrests; even with a 36â pitch if the person in front has reclined their seat then it's very difficult unless you have an aisle seat to exit your seat without climbing over the passenger next to you. Also although the aircraft have been in service less than a year the seats are already looking the worse for wear; some of the plastic trim in the armrests is coming loose some of the IFE screen mechanisms were also very loose (on the outward journey I noticed that someone had needed to jam bits of cardboard in the mechanism of my IFE system to keep the TV screen upright) and on the return journey the footrest on the seat of one of my party was jammed in the extended position. Finally although we were given a nice printed menu of all the beverages supposedly available on the return journey we were told that several of these had been withdrawn so the variety of soft drinks is actually rather less than Thomson were advertising. On the whole pretty good and I think the 787 sets new standards but for the extra we paid for Premium seats we expected a bit more.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1

I am a gold card member and would add that I am 6ft and 20st. My main gripe is that since the A340-600 has been introduced the level of service has gone downhill in my opinion due to the increase in seat capacity but same level of staff. The importance seems to be on serving rolls steward comes round numerous times whereas the wine serving is sparse and never served with the meal which is a shame as it is very palatable especially the white. The Thai lounge is much better than the London lounge. Films can vary a lot but in the main tend to be American. Seating at my weight is never going to be that comfortable.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,K Hughes,United Kingdom,2013-11-10,My husband and I travelled on our 5th flight in 3 years with Thomson from Birmingham to Rhodes and the outbound flight was a complete shambles. We purchased extra leg room seats at the airport and these were located at the front of the plane. Immediately upon boarding the cabin manager exclaimed that Thomson really shouldn't sell those seats as they were in her workspace so we could get a lot of disturbance - very professional of her! 30 minutes into the flight a cabin crew member was taken ill and was seated in the kitchen area in front of us and opposite the toilet. We were then all told we could no longer use that toilet because it impinged on her privacy and had to use the one's located the other end of the plane. Okay but the way the crew spoke to passengers who were queuing was an utter disgrace they were so rude. We had paid over Â£1000 for our seats and were spoken to as if we were just a complete nuisance for wanting basic needs to be met. There were 2 crew members looking after the one taken ill and service in the cabin was severely inhibited because of this and passengers were unable to obtain food and drink and told to stay seated. The Cabin manager told us that the reason her colleague had been taken ill was because she had been doing a fasting diet - very irresponsible when she had duty of care to hundreds of passengers at 37000 feet! When we were due to land I was told I needed to move from my seat so that the ill crew member could be seated near the exit for landing and I was hurriedly escorted to a crew seat at the back of the plane and told to leave my belongings because I could get them later. I was given no assistance to get back to my seat my husband and my belongings when the plane landed and this was virtually impossible to do with all the passengers blocking the aisle. My husband did not realise I had put the books purchased at the airport to enjoy on my holiday in the overhead locker and subsequently they got left behind. My complaint to Thomson took 2 months to get a response and their reply was inadequate. It appears that customer service comes way down the list of their priorities and we will not travel with Thomson again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

My husband is 6ft tall and he sat in the window seat because I tend to fidget and like to move around - yes the armrest sticks out but no one seemed to have a problem! The crew were absolutely brilliant and couldn't do enough for us the food was delicious compared to some other carriers - it was lovely to be treated like adults with proper cutlery etc and it gave it that special touch. It's obviously a personal choice to go premium to pay that bit extra for the extra service and I wouldn't have been impressed if the rest of the aircraft passengers would've come through to use the toilets in premium cabin. We came back on the dreamliner a week later on the 11th October - we had different seats on the way back but still no complaints.

Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable I'm an average 5'8'' in height and was having difficulty moving this onboard their A321 and Boeing 737. IFE was average not much new movies and quite unresponsive the touchscreens you'll still have to use the remote. Information from the cockpit came only twice before take off and before landing. Food - their lunch and dinner are good above average servings are large plus Turkish delight is distributed prior to take off. Drinks were served frequently which was good amenity kits were given which was a plus!

For what is only a 2-hour flight you'd pretty much expect to get by with anything. Wrong. Despite moving our flight time forward by 4 hours so it was a 4am check-in we arrived at 3.50. After the usual ski-queue wait we checked our bags only to be told that only 2 ski bags (instead of the 4 we booked) were on their system. We showed them the tickets and the invoice which clearly stated 4 ski carriage paid for but they said they could not take the other 2. The supervisor was called and clearly knew no better - checked the system and confirmed only 2 bags were showing. Basically we either pay Â£90 for the other bags to be put on the flight or leave them! No help to get through security and arrived at the gate to be told the gate was closed. After reasoning with the gate staff they got a bus and got us to the plane. The whole lack of awareness appreciation or any semblance of customer service means unless there is no other option we'll look elsewhere for future flights.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,2,3,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

From reading previous reviews on this site and others it seems TA passengers can be separated in 2 categories: Everything went as scheduled and the performance is highly rated or something goes wrong and TA customer service is at best non-existent. Luckily I was in the 1st category. In CDG TA is in the old terminal 1 (not their fault!) which is completely outdated. Departure was a little delayed due to late arrival but we recovered most of it during the flight. Very recent A321 with IFE (choice not outstanding but OK for a 3.5 hours flight). The crew spoke good English (1 stewardess spoke French) the seat pitch is comfortable (at least 10 cms / 4 "" more than AF) the food is fair both in quantity and in quality with a hot meal and a choice of drinks including wine and alcohol. A much better service than their French competitor with bus-type cabin and no IFE. The domestic flight was done on a slightly older A320 with even better seat pitch and here again crew spoke English and served some sandwich and drink. Return was of a similar standard fresh Turkish breakfast in the domestic flight good service and acceptable meal in the international flight.

Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes. Very frustrating! Finally they figured out a work-around and we were able to board.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,4,1

At Cairns the demeanour of the check-in staff was very ""in your face"" - when we asked to speak to the supervisor - this only made things worse. Documentation is a ""very touchy"" aspect of booking in for any US airline these days.

As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty.

United has rules concerning the size allowed for carry-ons. Many passengers were allowed to bring full-size suitcases on board and of course the overhead bins rapidly filled up.

The seats in economy are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The United staff - who were long time Continental employees - were very embarrassed and said it should never have happened. And of course it should not have. A deal should be a deal or the airline should warn people in advance that their accumulated miles which they tout as being very valuable are really not so valuable and can become worthless if the airline chooses.

United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music. An hour before landing we were offered a snack consisting of a chicken empanda fruit salad cucumber salad and chocolate. We landed 1/2 hour early and were the first off the plane.

This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers. My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge.

Having previously flown Virgin, we were very much looking forward to this trip and we were not disappointed! Both flights were served by the airline's refreshed boeing 747's, and they were very comfortable to fly in - the new economy seats on this aircraft are without a doubt some of the most comfortable we have ever used on long haul. However, I did notice that both planes seemed to echo an eerie sense of flying back in the 1980s/90s, despite them both having been refreshed - eg: old style overhead fittings and noisy cabins. Moreover, the touch screen IFE was quite tedious to use, depite it's generous offering of films and music. I would suggest that the airline deploy their newer airbus A330-300s on more of their Gatwick routes, as they are, in contrast, quieter, more modern and comfortable. However, both sectors had excellent crews who were eager to engage with their passengers, and it was clear that they took a pleasure in their duties. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Virgin have retained some thoughtful touches, such as amenity kits. However, the meal service is a big let down. The catering quality is fine, but portions do need to be bigger, especially on a long flight of 11 hours. Moreover, the snack service could also be revamped, as it is still very limited and has not improved since our last flight with Virgin two years ago. Clearly, the Virgin Atlantic economy experience delivers a solid product, but still leaves room open for improvement. We would certainly consider flying the airline again, but would try to avoid flying the 747 in favour of the airbus A330-300, due to it's enhanced comfort.",Boeing 747-400,FamilyLeisure,Economy,LGW to CUN,7,4,5,3,3,4,NA,4,1

B777 (FRA-SGN) and A321 (SGN-BKK) Positive points flights were all on time crew friendly and welcoming toilets were kept clean. Transfer Counter at SGN very efficient. Negative points for bland tasteless food lacking completely in presentation along with tiny wine glasses. The fantastic cuisine that Vietnam is famous for did not reflect in the catering. The entertainment system wasn't worth watching. Poor selection of films. The seats are not lie flat but I was aware of that beforehand. Did manage to get some rest even though it wasn't the most comfortable of seats. The aircraft interior looks shoddy and needs refurbishing. VN has the potential to become a better airline but they appear to be cutting costs in all the wrong areas. They totally lack the finesse that their competitors in the rest of S.E. Asia offer.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,3,3,2,2,NA,NA,3,0
virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,M Rogers,United Kingdom,2015-03-17,Flew from LHR to SFO in PE not impressed food not as good as either BA or Air NZ both of which we have travelled recently. Found seat uncomfortable especially when the person in front fully reclines their seat you need to be a contortionist to get out from the window seat. The worst thing from my point of view was that there was no Audio music available due to problems with performing rights issues as some one who always listen to music on a flight I found this disgusting that this had not been sorted out. Virgin could at least given passengers the use of MP3 players or similar turned out being a very boring flight.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,Paul Higgins,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,Used Virgin Atlantic twice on one trip. First been London to Tokyo. The plane was ageing and a number (including mine) of inflight entailment systems over worked instead we got old DVD players that run out before the film finished. My seat didn't work and not once stayed in any position apart from upright. Apart from the staff I can't think of anything on that flight that should stay even the food tasted like it'd been used a few times. The second flight was San Francisco to London. The entailment system worked however it was very old compared to the Golf airlines more than me had problems with the seats on the flight.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,3,1,1,NA,NA,2,0
virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,C Knapman,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,Flew from Manchester to Hong Kong and returned Shanghai to Manchester via Heathrow both ways. The little red service is great quick efficient and perfect for connecting it's a shame this service is being discontinued as even though BA service is fine enough connecting from Terminal 5 is always a nightmare I find terminals 2 and 3 much more comfortable. As for the long haul service I struggle to understand how Virgin can put an ancient A340-300 on a 12 hour long haul route the entertainment was shocking the old Vera Reel system should of been replaced years ago. I could tell they had put there most battle hardened cabin crew on this route obviously to deal with this I have never seen a cabin manager talking to so many passengers mid flight though it must be said she did a great job. Luckily the return flight from Shanghai was on a newer A340-600 and the on demand entertainment was much better. The crew on this flight though were clearly struggling with the majority Chinese passengers and while there were Chinese crew to help there was no communication between the British and Chinese crew. I find the crew on Cathay Emirates Qatar and other long haul airlines to have a much more professional attitude. Overall though the flights were on time comfortable enough for an economy ticket and I would fly Virgin again luckily they are retiring the old A340s because flying on one of them again would be the deal breaker.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,1
vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,J Rose,Australia,2014-01-08,MEL-SGN-MEL on A330 in Economy. Undoubtedly two of the worst flights I can remember in recent memory. First time on VN and will be the last time. Can't think of anything particularly positive to say other than one of the two flights was on time. Other than that it was an awful experience. The A330 equipment is dated and falling apart. Masking tape used in several places to hold together broken parts. Problems with IFE on both flights which required resetting the screen - unsuccessful on all occasions - so no video either way. Food was unfit for human consumption. But even worse was a compete lack of warmth or professionalism by the cabin crew or ground personnel. Very few smiles cabin crew disappears for long periods at a time is gruff when approached with a small request. Having flown several of the carriers throughout Asia most of which are models of efficiency and great service VN sits rock bottom in my opinion. This is an airline from the dark ages. And to make the experience even worse we did a 'go around' before landing at MEL on a beautiful calm clear morning which didn't inspire much confidence from a safety perspective. Would avoid at any and all costs.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

First time using a full service airline domestically after mostly using EasyJet for couple of years and this Little Red offshoot of VS didn't disappoint. Aer Lingus should given a massive pat of the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic. Flights were on time and inflight service was more than one could ask for a short-haul domestic flight with friendly and attentive staff. I was delayed inbound back from Edinburgh but that was due to a security scare at that Airport and I was notified with plenty of time via email and text and allowed me time spend a few more hours with friends in Edinburgh. The one Achilles heel is Heathrow I haven't used Heathrow in 16 years - and I have to say it didn't leave me want to back in a hurry unfriendly and poor management of queues for security - for Britain's premier air gateway it is shambolic particularly when you see the improvements that have been made at Gatwick. Virgin should be proud of the service they are delivering here though I am using them again in January on this domestic route and will be sad to see this end in September 2015. Great service and excellent value - highly recommended.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1
virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Tung,United Kingdom,2014-12-04,London Gatwick to Cancun return in VS economy. First time with this airline. Check in at both airports were easy and stress free. I purchased âseat plusâ on the way out so had to use the check in counter. There was no queue in Gatwick. On the way back I did online check in so just needed to print out the boarding pass then proceed to bag drop. The airplane was a refurbed B744. It has a nice interior. Seat was comfortable and was better than I expected. However pitch and width were tight if the passenger in front reclines. The entertainment is up to date although the choice of movies / TV not as good as other airlines. The on demand system with a touch screen will keep you busy throughout a long journey. Personally I still prefer the touch screen but with a remote/console so that you donât feel the person behind you is constantly âpushingâ your seat back. Food onboard was a weak point. It was a nice touch to be given a menu but the food quality was poor. On the way out I pre ordered low fat meal but was served normal food. I noticed the crew who said they would try to see what they could do but then disappeared entirely. There was no sandwich or drink in the galley so in my case it was a 10 hour journey without food. On the returning I was served normal food again and I had to remind the crew that Iâd pre-ordered special meal â that didn't seem normal in my experience where all other airlines will give passenger their special meals before others so they don't get confused. Breakfast was also poor â an orange juice a yoghurt and a very dry croissant. Service was overall friendly but not as professional as other airlines. Toilets weren't cleaned and some were out of order. Overall an acceptable flight experience but I will still choose BA over Virgin.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,2,2,4,NA,NA,3,0

Good flight from Adelaide to Melbourne - on time. Comfortable seats and very polite cabin staff. Melbourne to LAX left on time. The service in business class is very good and the staff are wonderful but the seats are not the most comfortable when compared to other airlines in that class. The seats aren't much wider than economy seats and are a little hard on a 14+ hour flight. I was in a window seat and was trapped when the person on the outside went to sleep. They squeeze a third seat into the middle group which I'd never seen on other international business class flights. Your pay more for business class to get comfort and privacy and unfortunately the seat configuration doesn't give you this. The inflight entertainment system could do with a revamp as there aren't many choices. The lunch services was great but the breakfast food was most odd and everything seemed to taste of five spice which was a little off putting - sometimes plain and normal is better than over the top. I like that they have a ladies only bathroom!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,2,5,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

To be fair the flight was not so bad but I have to agree with other passengers that Virgin should really consider using a larger aircraft for this popular route as the whole journey took 6hours or so. Otherwise it was not bad at all. The seat felt big despite the standard 737 3x3 configuration. There was no inflight entertainment but most passengers had iPad/iPhone/Laptop etc to keep themselves occupied. The inflight magazine was actually quite a good read.

The seats are hard the armrests would not fold up the leg rests dig into your legs when folded up particularly the aisle seats have a metal box underneath them which further limits the leg space. The inflight entertainment either does not work or is very limited. The food is very bad.

A330 for the flight to Sydney had a broken APU so had no ground air conditioning until engines started. It was a sauna until 20 minutes into the flight. Obviously old video system individual screens but continuous loop (not AVOD) with poor vision and sound. Food OK and complimentary beer/wine. Return flight much newer A330 with good AVOD. Once again food fine and sufficient along with beer/wine. Significantly less legroom on this aircraft. Check-in for both flights was OK despite being busy days but check-in staff could show some enthusiasm for the job or find another one. The biggest disappointment was the lack of even a casual smile from any of the cabin crew except when first entering each aircraft. After that it was glum faces for the entire flight. The odd smile makes the journey go so much better for both passengers and crew. I normally fly QF but gave VA a go this time based not only on price/schedule but also looking for an alternative to QF for regular travel needs. VA did not stand out as any better than QF I'm afraid.

Arrived at the island airport to travel home and the check-in line went out the terminal down the ramp and into the car park. After about 35 minutes we made our way up the ramp and into the check-in area. One person to check-in 150 passengers. I did notice another Virgin staff member coming and going waving a radio around check a passenger or two and then disappear again. We had now been in line for 1.4 hours and it was apparent there was no way this plane was going to leave on time. 30 minutes before scheduled departure the staff member waving the radio around and another staff member arrived and the check in intensity increased. The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crÃ¨che. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight. We downloaded the app but alas the entertainment system on board was not working. Being in the 2nd back row the food cart eventually arrives and there is only a few crumbs left that that the other passengers didnt want. All the decent food had gone. Maybe they could start the service at the back of the plane and then move forward or carry enough of the good stuff for all. We were offered a complimentary noodle dish but it was too spicy for the kids. Once the food service was completed they started the rubbish collection I tried to hand over the rubbish to the flight attendant as they passed me but was told to hang onto the rubbish until they got to me later.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,T Maddern,Australia,2014-01-06,We flew to Newcastle from Brisbane yesterday in Economy. Virgin got us there on time and safely and the seat was comfortable enough for the 1 hour flight. When choosing your seat do not go for seat 9 a b or c in the Boeing 737-800 aircraft - these do not have windows. The cabin crew did their job efficiently but they weren't very warm. The aircraft we flew on had seatback TV which we didn't use but it's nice that it was there. I have flown in business on Virgin and there are no TV's there they just give you a portable DVD. For economy passengers - it's buy on board we didn't buy anything but prices were reasonable. Things I do not like about Virgin Australia is that when pre-selecting your seat when you make your booking the only seats that are available are the seats in the rear section of the aircraft. If you get one of these you may be lucky enough to change to a seat at the front of the aircraft when you do the web check in. I feel that Virgin Australia do treat saver fare passengers like second class citizens by only allowing seats at the rear of the aircraft when they make their booking. At major airports the jetbridge is used for business class full fare passengers and passengers lucky enough to get seats up to row 16. The rest of the passengers have to walk down the stairs outside and up the stairs at the rear of the aircraft.

First flight was on a 737-800. Very clean interior but seat pitch is tight. Second flight on an E-190.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,A Kattula,Australia,2013-12-16,Booked connecting flights MEL-SYD-OOL and OOL-ADL-MEL with 3-4 hour stopovers in Sydney and Adelaide via Virgins website as flights were actually cheaper than direct non-stop. Had plans to do things in Sydney and Adelaide. Trip was a disaster! At check-in in Melbourne was given another persons boarding pass despite girl checking my ID. Baggage labelled with other passengers name. I had to point error out and girl attempted to get bag retrieved. Promised it had been fixed. Luckily other passenger also going to Gold Coast as on arrival bag not on carousel. Found it at baggage services still with other passengers name on it. Meant I spent 45 minutes waiting for bag. Flight to Sydney delayed nearly an hour by fog but no delay information. No entertainment on any flight and food very poor! Has anybody actually been on a Virgin aircraft that has their mysterious entertainment system? A very small cold chicken pasta salad with a revolting chocolate mousse is not what I would call a Gourmet meal as Virgin describes it. Email then sent to my home address whilst away rebooking my flight home as direct at different time with arrival into Melbourne 5 hours before connecting bus home to regional Victoria. No phone call despite Virgin having my mobile number. Had to ring them to get flights changed. Would not put me back on flights I had booked and very insistent I flew on flight they wanted me to! Ended up being rebooked on flight via Sydney but still had to wait over 2 hours for bus. No way would they offer any compensation such as an upgrade to business class. Made to feel that it was all my fault. Sorry Virgin but you have a long way to go in Customer Service!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

This was our first flight with Virgin and the three of us (2 adults and 1 seven year old) enjoyed it. The staff went out of their way to treat every one as if you are their only passengers. Their friendly and jovial attitude as well as the flexible dining options are something to be commended. I have bad memories of the old CX herringbone layout who based it on Virgin's but in the a340-600 at least the cabin was light and airy and the walls of your cubicle are not as high. The lounge in HK is great but the clubhouse in Heathrow is fantastic. It appears as if every member of staff from check-in to cabin like their job and are happy to do it.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Scott,United States,2014-06-08,"We flew flight VS 10 from JFK to London Heathrow mid March. We called the airline three times before traveling and waited on hold for 2 hours each time. The desk agent at JFK was extremely unpleasant and borderline rude. We had booked seats on the upper level of the plane one of the calls was to confirm that this was allowed with a child also traveling in the party. We were told to go to the desk at the gate prior to the flight to have her seat assigned with ours. The gate attendant gave us a glare and informed us that this was not allowed. After being spoken to condescendingly several more times we were eventually reassigned to our original seats. Once on board service was sub-par. Drinks (including water) were not offered for over 1.5 hours into the flight and we sat at the gate for an hour prior to taking off due to a ""minor"" problem with the fuel pump. When the man sitting in our aisle asked for a glass of water about 1 hour into the flight he was given a look and told that he would need to be patient as they are busy. I understand that they are busy but he was extremely polite when asking and a simple response with the same polite manner would have been more appropriate. Dinner was served with the drink cart trailing behind a drink was offered shortly after dinner arrived and then the drink cart was not seen again. The meal was standard economy fare the roll was frozen solid but the main meal was edible if not 90% rice. They came through to clear meal trays and offer hot chocolate or tea then the lights were turned off. They never came through to offer water during the flight which would have been nice (and was done on flights with another carrier). I could have hit my call light (as I had a sleeping toddler on my lap) but really didn't care to interact with the staff any more than absolutely necessary. The staff never smiled or looked even slightly pleasant. I was extremely disappointed in the service. They should be less concerned about their attractive uniforms and more concerned with providing standard pleasant service to all of their customers - including economy. We did arrive safely - which is their first priority - and I respect that.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,2,1,1,3,NA,NA,2,0

My colleagues on the 7:20 flight didnât take off until 10:30. Upon boarding the fokker 50 the cabin crew (just one person) may just have been wearing a sign saying âIâm having a bad dayâ the attitude was absolutely terrible. It would be unfair to name this person but she did not smile once during the flight and was stern and just so unfriendly. There were no pre take off sweets. I do not understand how anyone can say VLMâs food is good you get offered half a brown sandwich in a plastic wrapper or fruit not even both and no plate.

The food wasn't as good as usual tiny portions and fairly overcooked. Good choice of IFE and although the bed lets you get some sleep they seem to be getting harder and harder. Temperature control was cranked right up so it was a hot and sweaty snooze. On the return leg the FAs were friendlier but it seemed quite slow getting drinks served and there was no welcome drink on boarding. I managed a decent night's sleep but breakfast took a while and for once was really unpleasant; undercooked bacon overcooked egg sausage with negligible meat content and baked beans with the highest sugar content known to man. I've had better at motorway service stations! The decaf coffee was served in a mug (nice touch especially as the mug turned out to be made by someone I know) and was fantastic. Reasonable croissant but no hot towels offered. Cabin temperature was better this time. The planes seemed a little tired and the bathrooms were clean but nothing special.

vueling-airlines,/airline-reviews/vueling-airlines,Vueling Airlines customer review,A Sahni,United States,2015-07-24,On par with all the reviews for Vueling. We flew Vueling from BCN to VGO domestic flight with in Spain the OB flight was on-time and no issues with taking carry-on bags on the plane. On return from VGO the flight was delayed without sending notices via the Vueling mobile app. Arrived at the airport on time and proceeded to check-in and was stopped by Vueling agent to pay for carry on bag. Informed the Vueling agent that coming from BCN Vueling did not charge me for the carry-on agent could care less. Anyways paid with trusted credit card so I could call them once back home in the USA. Got to the gate and notice all the locals with the same size carry-on bags as mine were not made to check them in. Some had bigger carry-on bags that could be classified as checked in luggage. While at the gate no information that the only flight flown by Vueling on Saturday was delayed by two hours. As the night went on in VGO we went back to Iberia which was handling the Vueling flight as the Vueling ground crew left the airport. Told flight will come but if it gets cancelled you are on your own for hotel. Note Vigo is small town lacking hotels. Finally the plane arrived from Barcelona with a fresh crew and made a quick turn around. Since the flight was delayed 2+ hours by the time we left Vigo it was now 11pm. We arrived back at 1am having to wait for Vueling to located ground crew in Barcelona as most the Vueling planes had already returned for the night and the airport while it is open 24 hours keeps limited people on hand after 12am. The hold in Barcelona was not acceptable being that Barcelona is Vueling's hub. I would fly Vueling again but I will fly them with being sure to take morning flights in case of any delays also keep my trusted Credit Card on hand to dispute carry on charge for not being local.,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy,VGO to BCN,6,4,4,NA,NA,3,NA,5,1

Both flights were on time which was good. However you only get a bottle of water on these flights and the crew did the minimum. On both flights once they had handed out the drinks the crews disappeared until just before landing. I also thought that their attention to ensuring passengers had seat belts on and had stopped using their electronic devices at the time requested was minimal.

I had checked in online however whilst the bag drop queue was short it was very slow moving. Boarding not particularly organised but a fairly warm welcome on boarding. No magazines or newspapers available on boarding. Main meal was really poor - crew accidentally forgot to give us a menu our preferred food option was not available portion size was very small and the food was low quality. I would happily have paid extra for more/better quality food. I would strongly recommend eating before boarding (as we had). Reasonable drinks selection. Decent range of inflight entertainment but handheld control had one broken button which made it very difficult to select options. Overhead locker space limited due to failure to enforce baggage rules (very large trolley cases allowed on board). Amenity kit blanket and pillow all provided and all decent quality for an economy cabin. I managed to sleep for several hours. Overall the experience was passable as I had booked on a virgin miles discount offer - however I would have been disappointed (even for economy) if I had paid full price for this booking.

Good points were the service and friendliness of staff and the food was actually quite good. Ticket didn't include any pre-paid meals but everyone on board got complimentary hot lunch which was appreciated. No bottles of water were served but staff were happy to provide re-fills or sealed 100ml tubs. Flight time was supposed to be 6.5 hours but we were forced to circle Bali airport for another hour due to traffic congestion. In Flight Entertainment wasn't available. I thought this was very poor. No blankets available either. Virgin is using a domestic plane (B737-800) which is designed for short 2-3 hour flights for an international flight. Plane was very cramped and hardly any leg room for someone of my height (1.8 m). The layout was 3 seats each side with two toilets at the back for economy which is not enough when the plane was full.

We expected terminal 4 at JFK to have some breakfast facilities for the 07.30 flight but the choice was McDonald's or a coffee stand. Chaotic boarding but a friendly crew and an OK daylight flight to London apart from being very hungry. We were served a cereal bar a muffin and tea or coffee after take off and then a small hot meal (chicken tikka) 2hrs before we arrived into Heathrow. Many passengers asked for food mid-flight as the limited breakfast options at JFK together with a sugary snack after take off didn't really match up to Virgin's advertised ""dining"" experience. We accept that we travelled economy but I'd rate the catering service and quality on this flight as poor. Anyone taking the morning flight from New York should consider taking their own food as you won't get much on board. The entertainment worked well and the crew were friendly but the meal service was extremely disappointing and certainly doesn't match the website adverts.

A pleasant surprise to find we could sit on the upper deck which is very civilised compared to the busy economy section on the main deck. Friendly crew and some OK food and drinks with a generous selection of pretzels with the first drink round. The service was quite messy the starter and main were handed to us first and then the crew cleared the trays before offering dessert but no one had any spoons; maybe easier if VS presented the tray in one piece.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,A Davies,United Kingdom,2014-01-03,I took a flight from Las Vegas to London 3 months ago. Virgin is on a clear downhill path. The cabin and seating configuration is very much style over substance it just does not work ergonomically. Too cramped and irritating 'intelligent' lighting. The seat remains far too clever for its own good resulting in electronic and mechanical glitches on almost every flight I have taken over the past 18 months or so. Main problem though is the cabin crew who for some reason behave these days as if they are doing you a favour. The one exceptional element of this airline at present is the departure lounge at Heathrow which is peerless in my view.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,2,1,2,2,NA,NA,1,0

Check-in was effective staff attentive and friendly I purchased extra legroom and there was enough space. I am based in Budapest and travel on business frequently. When flying within Europe I prefer to fly budget airlines - primarily Wizzair Ryanair to a lesser extent over legacy/full service carriers: 1) Wizzair flies early and late during the day allowing a full day of work at destination. Hate flying into destinations where budget airlines do not fly e.g. Zurich where the first flight from Budapest arrives after 11 am and the last one leaves at 5 pm. 2) Wizzair breaks down the difference between economy and business into specific services that you can purchase individually (priority boarding extra legroom lounge more luggage etc.). Thus you can travel effectively on business within Europe picking what you want for prices lower than economy ticket on legacy airlines. 3) They are cheap (for the most part). 4) They have some of latest bag drop-off times allowing one to start off for the airport later and time is money. Flying from smaller airports also means shorter check-in times (although sometimes offset by these airports being farther from cities). 5) Their policies actually make sense: I have no sympathy for those who wish to bring on board their wooden trunks and carpet bags on boards. They take up precious on space on board and slow down boarding. You should pay dearly for this or check them in! Also having no reserved seats encourages passengers to finish boarding fast.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,0,NA,NA,5,1
virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2013-12-29,LGW-UVF-LGW. Both flights serviced by Virgin's brand new A330s. Boarding for both flights was well handled by gate staff in both LGW and UVF and both flights departed and arrived on time with very little turbulence en route. Contrary to many comments I was very impressed with Virgin's new long haul economy seating as it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom. In addition I even managed to sleep for 6 of the 8 hours on the inbound flight to LGW which was great as I usually never manage to sleep on long haul flights. Amenity kits were also given out on the UVF-LGW night flight which was a nice touch. I especially liked the new IFE system offered on the new A330s as it is touch screen operated and is also very simple and quick to navigate with a good variety of films and music to choose from. Throughout both flights the cabin crew were friendly and were eager to go out of their way for you. Furthermore call bells were answered promptly and the service felt more personal than on previous airlines that I have flown with. However the only thing that is letting Virgin down is the quality of their catering. On both flights the food portions were far too small for long 8-9 hour sectors so I'd suggest bringing extra food with you if possible. In addition there was very little to choose from on both flights unlike other four star airlines such as BA and the snack service offered on board was very limited. All in all our first experience with Virgin Atlantic was by no means disappointing and we would certainly consider flying with them again. The new A330 is an excellent aircraft to fly on as it offers Virgin's latest long haul product and is also extremely quiet compared to similar long haul aircraft.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

wow-air,/airline-reviews/wow-air,WOW air customer review,M Hartt,United Kingdom,2013-07-07,KEF-LGW return. Totally different experience than the (very enjoyable) outbound. My flight was on a very old (25+ years) MD-83 owned by SwiftAir a Spanish charter airline with some scheduled service I believe. In all my years of flying I don't think I've ever been on a plane in worse condition inside. Ripped carpet tons of places where serious scrapes and dents had been painted over shabby seats loose interior panels and just a general level of dirt and grime etc. It was a huge contrast to the nearly new A320 on my outbound and really does a disservice to WOW Air because it felt entirely bargain-basement. Crew was half-WOW Air and half-Spanish and the Spanish side was fine but rather brusque. No in-flight entertainment. Check-in was pretty slow - about 100 people in line maybe 8 agents. They moved quickly but still a fair bit of waiting. I'd recommend WOW Air as I'm sure that this plane won't be around long. I'd certainly think about avoiding them if more of these MD-80s are going to be part of their fleet on a regular basis.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,4,1,NA,NA,3,1

For some reason they tend to shout orders rather than talk to people. Very curious cabin luggage policy. Arrival to Budapest at a remote station and long walk to terminal.

vueling-airlines,/airline-reviews/vueling-airlines,Vueling Airlines customer review,Alan Mackenzie,Denmark,2013-04-16,CPH-FLR-CPH. April 2013. Vueling has recently (Dec 2012) introduced direct flights between Florence and Copenhagen. I had expected an Airbus 320 as they have a large fleet of that type however the aircraft used was an A319. The craft was fairly new with Recaro slim-line seats â very comfortable. Although the flights were very good: on time/early with very light loads a lot of Spanish was used for announcements despite not flying a Spanish route and some very irritating music played during takeoff and landing â however overall one of the best low cost airlines.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,4,0,0,NA,NA,5,1
wizz-air,/airline-reviews/wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2013-07-21,LTN-OTP / TSR-LTN. LTN-OTP on new A320. However Wizz Air urgently needs to restructure their boarding system at Luton people were pushing and shoving and there was a lot of confusion and mis-communication as to where we were supposed to line up. I think Wizz Air would benefit from establishing a seat allocated boarding system like Easyjet as this would put an end to the 'free for all' pushing and shoving issue. If you travel through Luton there are delays to almost every flight there are far too many Wizz Air flights leaving and arriving at the same time and as such this airport cannot cope with the huge surge in early morning traffic. Cabin crew were helpful as always. As usual there is now very little seat pitch on their latest A320's so you might want to consider paying for an extra leg room seat as there is virtually no room for your legs. TSR-LTN: Flew back to Luton on a new A320 as on outboard flight. The way boarding was handled in Timisoara was noticeably better than we experienced in Luton. Departure was on time and like before the crew were excellent. All in all Wizz Air is a good low cost airline much better than the likes of Ryanair and we will definitely continue to fly with them on our future trips to Romania. It's a real shame that they have chosen London Luton Airport as their main UK base I seriously hope that they will consider flying from Stansted Airport in future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,0,0,NA,NA,4,1

Flights were on time in both directions and were promptly boarded with the minimum of fuss. We found the baggage allowances adequate and staff were not checking other than a few people who were obviously over the limit. We had paid for priority boarding which worked very well and extra legroom although the standard legroom looked perfectly adequate. If I was travelling alone I probably wouldn't bother with either. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous. There was no hard sell as with Ryanair and some of the other low cost carriers - for that reason alone I would fly with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,3,0,NA,NA,4,1

The food out was passable (just) but the return leg from Chicago was inedible. Bread rolls that resembled a pet rock a lump of gristle the menu said was beef and breakfast was some lump of coloured sugar called a breakfast bap another lump of sugar called oat bar and a frozen lump of sugar called orange juice.

Arrived at 8.30am for our 10.55am flight was told our flight was cancelled and put on 3pm flight. No apology and treated it as a matter of fact. It wouldn't be as much problem if we didn't have a connecting flight to catch in Nairobi to Dubai at 4.40pm. So what was an easy connection with more than 4 hours to spare originally arriving NBO at 12pm became 4pm leaving 40mins to catch our connecting flight. Apart from the extra 4 hours spent at JRO which had nothing much to offer we had to stress about whether we could catch our connect flight to Dubai (and later the Maldives). They didn't have the courtesy to contact us beforehand in which case we could alter our subsequent flights. No explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled. While we were there there were a few passengers showing up with news of their flight to Zanzibar being cancelled as well so it appears this is not rare occurrence.

The seat (2K) was reasonably private and reasonably quiet. Useful wardrobe with enough space to put various items and shoes but the seat has almost no other storage space. Things have to be left loose in the foot-well area. Footrest doubles as a buddy seat although his would be rather cramped I'd imagine. Seat itself fine and comfortable. Good enough to get reasonable sleep on a 12hr journey. Cabin lighting and temperature perfect. View of outside restricted by the angle of the seat - just when it is interesting (t/off and landing) you are strapped in and cannot see all the fun outside - the child in me I guess! Food and service excellent. The toilets - wow - a flimsy concertina door poor water supply into small bowl so not really good for brushing teeth. Middle-eastern airlines are so much better - BA really has to re-think. Overall BA First Class is equivalent to others Business class.

Paid extra for Elite Plus - seats are not wider nor is there extra leg room. We were seated in Row 1 next to a single bathroom and galley with people lining up for the bathroom. We had passengers banging into our legs and chairs as they made room for the flight attendants to go by. Do not bother to pay extra for Elite Plus seats. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 5pm it was delayed and did not take off until 9pm. Sunwing Staff did not bother to apologize once for the delay to all the waiting passengers nor bothered to provide an explanation for the delay. Unacceptable. We arrived in Cancun at 1.30am and waited for our luggage for 1 hour! Again no apology or explanation from Sunwing Staff. We arrived at our hotel at 3.30am when we were supposed to be there at 9.30pm. Our family was exhausted and the following day was spent recovering and catching up on sleep and as a result we lost a day. The crew were unprofessional and rude.

I suppose to summarize I would categorize this as a fair airline. If you are planning travel with them make sure you take note of all the charges as basically everything (including advance seat selection etc) has an a la carte separate charge. Also the departing flight was two hours late and there was no explanation given by Allegiant staff as to why. The advantage of this airline is it flew out of a small general aviation airport that obviated the need for me to travel to St Louis.

This took a while to explain and eventually I had to telephone our insurers whilst at the check in desk to gain confirmation again for them to find our booking.

I asked if the plane was a full flight to which she replied no. When we boarded I again asked if I could upgrade irrespective of the price and flatly told no. At one point during the flight I walked from the rear of the plane to the front into business class completely unchallenged but when I sat next to my wife in one of the many empty seats in business class I was told to return to my seat in economy class as I was upsetting the rest of the passengers. I offered to pay any price for one of the empty seats in business class and especially the two that were next to my wife. I was flatly refused and ended the entire flight separated from my wife for the 11 hours. The captain made his announcement to welcome all of us on board 9 hours into the flight. This is the first and last time I will ever fly Eva Air as I would rather pay extra to fly with any other airline as their customer service is non existent in addition to the extremely poor command of English.

The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying. US Airways used to be a good airline that I enjoyed flying with, but since the fusion they are just a shadow of what they used to be and even worse than their partner American Airlines.

These flights were okay - standard mainland business class. Food was average. Service was good and attentive. What is lacking is a seat with better pitch foot rests and pillows or blankets. Hawaiian Airlines give you a seat with about 140 degree recline leg and foot rests and pillows and blankets. Both airlines are attentive to needs but Hawaiian has the edge with unsolicited water drinks etc. Costwise Alaska charges about $300 less than Hawaiian.

We boarded at about 5.00. When we entered the plane, it was extremely hot with 150 passengers. It was 95 degrees on the plane and there was no air blowing from the overhead vents. We waited on the tarmac to pull away from the gate for an hour in that heat. Flight attendants kept claiming the air would start as soon as we got up in the air and would cool down. Everyone was hot and complaining. Finally, the pilot said there was an error message and we had to get off the plane for maintenance to work on the issue. Maintenance showed up and could not fix it, we could not get another plane that night. After two hours they announced that we could find our own hotel up to $225 and would be reimbursed. The flight was rescheduled for 2.00pm the next day, which was inconvenient as the whole day is gone. We had plans for the next day just like every other passenger. The next day, we check in and I ask how to get reimbursed for food and hotel and the airport representative says she does not know if Allegiant is even reimbursing for food anymore. We show up for our flight and once again we donât start boarding until 1.40. We notice that itâs the same plane. As we get on the plane, we realize itâs even hotter than the day before and even more uncomfortable. Once again, we take forever to board and we start to pull away from the gate. We are waiting on the tarmac for close to an hour as everyone is miserable and uncomfortable. I am pregnant, there were infants and toddlers that parents had to undress down to their diapers just to try and stay remotely cool. The flight attendants started to bring out complementary waters, but only made it halfway through the passengers, so not everyone even got water including myself. The pilot finally starts to take off and then we pull back into the gate. We are told an emergency plane will be there at 6.30, we will receive a $150 voucher per person, and we will receive food vouchers to eat in the airport. Our food vouchers were $8 each, which hardly covers any meal at the increased prices of food at the airport. We reluctantly decide to wait for the emergency plane.

The aircraft was an older version a Boeing 737-300 which was just fine for this 1 hour route but I'm unsure if I'd be willing to fly longer routes onboard due to a fairly small seat pitch.

sas-scandinavian-airlines,/airline-reviews/sas-scandinavian-airlines,SAS Scandinavian customer review,Steve Kohler,Sweden,2014-09-17,Stockholm to Dublin flight (SK0172). SAS is saving money whilst ripping off and inconveniencing their passengers at the same time. It's not until one flies the same leg several times that the pattern becomes clear. I've flown this leg several times and every single time SAS uses the Ryanair gates of the terminal and parks out on the apron with no skybridge. It's the furthest possible distance to the arrivals hall 10-15 minutes walk and they do it because its the cheapest for them. SAS prices are the same if not more expensive than the other carriers yet they use the cheapest gates. Most national carriers provide free food and beverages which one should expect when paying premium prices. Not so with SAS. You pay the full airfares with them but get nothing except a cup of water or a cup of coffee (which they are proud to say is free). There is simply no difference in service between Ryanair and SAS on this route except one. The Cost. Ryanair will charge you around â¬50 for this flight. SAS will charge you around â¬300 for the very same flight and service. It's an insult to passengers. I've never been a huge fan of Ryanair but at least they charge appropriately for the limited service you get. As Scandinavia's National carrier SAS should be ashamed of such miserly no-frills service when they are charging their passengers full fare. Imagine how much they are saving by parking on the apron instead of using a gate. And then add that saving to the full fares that their 200 passengers pay even though Ryanair does it the same way and charges their passengers only around 15% of the SAS price.

No phone emails or pager to distract me. The aircraft was clean seats reasonably comfortable food was fine and the entertainment was good.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,Sandra Lavigne,Canada,2014-04-08,People who complain about the fees and whatnot must not read before booking their flights. The site is very clear about the various fees all the way through the booking process. With the membership we saved a ton of money on our flight even with baggage fees and the extra fees to reserve big front seats it was still cheaper than flying a major airline even if we cashed in airmiles. As far as customer service goes we had no issues. Staff at Niagara airport were fine we had no issues and because it's such a small airport we got through check-in and security in record time. The flight itself was fine. There was a technical issue with the gate but even after having to switch gates we still departed on time. Big front seats are worth the extra money for sure. On the way home we had very friendly staff at Ft Lauderdale airport. There was an issue with the cleanliness of the plane on our return trip. Our seats weren't spotless but not gross but it seems that the cleaning crew didn't notice that someone had been sick in the row across from us. A passenger unfortunately put her hand in it while getting to her seat and had to go back out to the terminal to wash it off. The flight attendant was very sincere and concerned apologized to them and everyone in the area got the cleaning crew back in asap to take care of it sprayed some air freshener apologized again and again and had the passengers from that row seated in another row for the flight since there were some empty seats. It was unfortunate but the attendant handled it perfectly and we still left on time. The rest of the flight there were no issues. Even with major airlines I've almost always found garbage in the seat pocket that got missed it happens. Overall I would fly Spirit again but maybe not for a long flight. I recommend it if you want to save some money and don't care about inflight meals and movies (you can purchase snacks and drinks this is pretty typical of most airlines now anyway not many provide a free meal or snack these days). If you're a tall or heavy person definitely pay the extra for the big front seats. Generally speaking you get what you pay for.

I highly rate BA for families. On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1) To be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants. They have offered quiet areas during service (on the A380) to help settle our baby. Left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) Friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. Crew are not servants to passengers. They have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but I find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak times. They are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. It figures. I am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach Silver tier on an annual basis. Having BC check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. The greatest perk is that as Silver I get 2 bags at 32kg each. Not only that but when I travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as I do and our infant gets 23kg bag. Plus car seats and pram free. That is a huge allowance and makes packing less stressful. BA are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, I have no issues with them and find them value for money.

us-airways,/airline-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,Stine Caden,United States,2014-09-19,Over the summer my family and I flew to Fort. Myers on US Airways. On the way there we flew from Indianapolis to Charlotte to Fort. Myers. The flight was pretty average. On the way back though I have some complaints. We flew Fort. Myers to Washington Reagan to Indianapolis. On the flight back to Indy from Washington we were on a smaller Embraer jet. The Plane's condition was terrible. Multiple overhead bins were broken and at my seat the wall panel was falling off! I could see the insulation of the plane. Also all over my seat belt was gum. It was very disgusting and I could not change seats because it was a full flight. I'm willing to give US Airways another chance though. I would also recommend them to a friend because 3/4 flights were alright.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,3,2,NA,NA,3,1
royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,Angelito Lawang,Australia,2014-10-01,I flew to Melbourne from Manila via Bandar Seri Begawan on 28th September 2014. The service from Manila to Bandar was very poor. The flight steward took 15 minutes at each row serving food - he informed each and every customer what food he was going to serve. He would spend a good 3-4 minutes serving each passenger. The process was so simple and yet they cannot systematically do it in a simple way. We were sitting on the 46th row and by the time they were able to serve us there was no selection of food and no option but to get what was left. This experience becomes more unbearable upon arriving at the airport - only one toilet each for male and female is in operation - the queue from the ladies toilet nearly reached the check-in station. Not enough signage or instructions and you see passengers walking around the airport like headless chickens looking for their departure gates. I consider Manila better than this airport.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,1,1,3,NA,NA,1,0
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,K Hindle,United Kingdom,2015-01-19,Just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to Thailand flying to and from Bangkok with BA on 777 aircraft. I definitely would choose another airline next time. We flew out on 31st December 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. Asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. One of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. Outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. For most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. My inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldn't be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. Return flight crew on 16th Jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. Two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didn't work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. Again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was broken in seat 27b also. The crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what I call a night flight. I used to love flying BA as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and I am sorry to say neither my partner or I enjoyed the experience. Will look to EVA Thai or one of the Middle Eastern airlines next time.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,1,2,2,NA,NA,3,0

Flight attendants were very helpful and appreciate the light refreshments which were factored into the bill. The trip back was even better because we were given the very front seats at no extra cost. I was travelling with my parents who are senior citizens and the ground staff were very alert and upon looking at the I.Cs I gave her at the check in counter she quickly asked if they needed help getting to the aircraft. When I said they were very fit she double checked if they were okay being seated right in front because they had 'to walk a bit further' in a plane which is actually very small. I found it a bit amusing but the politeness and concern is what matter most. Will definitely fly again.

No apology given and no explanation only found out later that they did not have a pilot to fly the plane back to Islamabad! Even though Airblue has acquired bigger plane for this non-stop route the seat width and comfort is still same as before put simply its uncomfortable for such long haul flight. There is no inflight entertainment as they have taken the Seat-back TV screens off every seat so 9 hour long flight is pretty boring unless you take your iPad or a book with you. Got served two meals firstly a very minimalist dinner with rice chicken and some salad. About 2 hours before landing they served second so- called meal which was just a chicken role and a drink. Staff seemed clueless and not very helpful. Return flight on 20th October from Islamabad was again delayed by 3 hours. Airblue staff checking-in the passengers on their laptops so it seems that they are not allowed to use proper airport facilities either or could it be a cost- cutting measure. After the announcement for boarding all the passengers were filled into mini buses to be taken to the plane. When reached near the plane the buses took U-turn and came back to terminal without any explanation. Staff then told that due to catering service delay captain has asked them not to start the boarding process yet! They lack service commitment care and are a very poor value for money.

Service and comfort excellent as good as many airlines' first class. The seat turns into a flat bed and wide enough for a comfortable sleep. Good food very well presented by their very friendly and competent cabin crew. I just have a few points to make that could improve their service. Limousine service should be part of the deal when flying business class dining should be on demand and flights to Kuala Lumpur should give a choice of Malay cuisine. The short connection time in Muscat can be a source of anxiety as passengers need to go through security again and there is no priority lane for business class passengers. The last few times there was hardly any wait at security so that was fine but should there be a delay I hope Oman Air can guarantee that passengers will not miss their connection flight. If you get time to visit their lounge it is usually quiet and comfortable but they need to provide more shower facilities.

By jointly selling their flights with Air France China Southern has fully demonstrated just how below average their service actually is. CZ seriously needs to reconsider their service on their shorter sectors (CAN-BKK-CAN). The language skill for their cabin staff on these sectors were laughable. Food is virtually inedible. Drinks served warm only red or white wine and on the return flight - a male flight attendant simply handed out meals without asking what the passenger would like (despite there being choices of chicken or fish). Transit in Guangzhou is efficient however the quality of ground staff seriously needs addressing. I had a slight issue with my booking when checking in at CDG and was strongly advised to check with customer service once landed in CAN. At the counter the staff simply wrote down the phone number of the call centre and was told to go away. The long flight (787) was comfortable and food marginally better than shorter flights.

I pre-booked seats together and selected seats 11A and B. Thankfully both flights were short as space was very cramped - my husband is 6 ft 5 and his knees touched the seat in front (I know we could have paid for extra legroom but this is a rip-off especially for a short flight). On boarding at Gatwick we were bussed out to the plane and boarded up a set of steps getting soaked as it was pouring with rain and instead of calling us by seat number they boarded everyone together causing a queue out on the aircraft steps. Late in leaving although no reason was given. As it was a short flight the choice of food was extremely limited - although there was enough time to bring around duty free. On return by the time the food service reached us they were pretty much out of all hot options just managing to rustle up 2 bacon baguettes for Â£3.90 each - these tasted synthetic and had a measly bit of bacon and nothing else in them. Don't bother to buy food on board either take some from home or buy at the airport - much nicer. On the return flight there was chewing gum stuck to the seat in front of me and a couple of wrappers left lying around.

At Zante airport an announcement came over the tannoy saying that all those in seat rows 1 to 29 to board at the front of the plane and the rest to the back of the plane. We were in row 29 therefore obviously we would board at the front of the plane. When we walked in to the plane we got greeted by an unhappy air hostess who told me off for boarding the wrong end of the plane even though this was what we were told. This made us feel very unwelcome onboard. After take off we waited a very long time before drinks and snacks were bought round. They then said we could all fill out a questionnaire regarding Thomas Cook. The air hostess started distributing these but when she got to about row 28 she just walked straight past and ignored the fact that I would have liked to complete one. She seemed stressed and far from happy and lacked customer service. I asked one of the other air hostess's if I could have a questionnaire to complete and she was more than happy to get me one and apologised. The unhappy air hostess then came round collecting rubbish but once again missed us out so we sat for the rest of the trip with cups and wrappers on our tables.

The reason we chose the airline was price and being a new member on Star Alliance. Overall the flights were okay nothing too bad but also nothing to be very excited about. BKK- LHR we sat in 20A/C - first row of Premium Economy. The seats are comfortable and recline very generous. In the Bulkhead rows monitors are in the armrests of the seats making them a little less wide than the normal premium seats. Legroom was also slightly restricted due to the dividing wall with business class. I could not stretch my legs completely. Food was is best described as okay. I have to agree with other reviewers and say that drinks services were very poor on this 12 hour flight. 2 rounds of drinks during the meal followed by two water runs until the snack before landing was served. In Premium economy passengers get a half litre bottle of water after take off which in theory can be refilled by crew. I walked to the galley in economy mid flight and was told that they had run out of water. I did get a refill from the business class galley. On the way back to BKK we sat in 22A and C which was much more comfortable than the bulkhead seats. Food and drink services on this flight were much better. Cabin crew was also genuinely more friendly than on the outbound flight. Overall we were okay with the product particularly given the good rates we had for our trip. We will use them again if rates are favourable.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,4,2,3,4,NA,NA,4,1
etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,Kate McDonell,Australia,2013-10-23,We travelled first class Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi and return in September/October. We had 2 previous experiences with Etihad on this same flight both in Business Class. The first time in 2009 was excellent. Service meals attention to detail was second to none. The second trip was a little less so less attentive the calibre of meals had deteriorated somewhat and service was definitely in decline. So this time we thought we would go First Class. Such a disappointment. From the check in at Sydney Airport - where apart from not being in a queue we could have been anyone for the level of attention and reception received. Thank heavens for the Express Passes to get us quickly through customs and immigration. The cabins in First were excellent the flat beds long and as comfortable as you could get and the beds were made up with sheets. Cabin crew were efficient but certainly lacked the warmth of previous flights. The chefs advised that they could prepare anything for us where in fact the meals were very ordinary and unimaginative. It also took a long time to be served. I know they were striving for a 'dining experience' but when you are tired and hungry you don't want to wait nearly 4 hours as we did on our flight home. I also don't want to hear how tired the staff are how busy they are or any other excuses as we did on several flights. I think we have given Etihad every chance to prove themselves but we may not fly with them again.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,3,4,3,2,2,NA,NA,3,0

We had pre-printed our boarding passes and paid for our additional checked luggage. We simply need to check the luggage at the counter. Our party of five - along with several others were redirected out of the line to some type of ""domestic"" holding area as they attended to an international flight. About a half hour into our wait the redirection stopped. However those of us in the holding area were left to stand there for another half an hour without further direction. There must have been twenty travelers that arrived well after we did that found their way in front of us in a very long line. My son- in-law took matters into his own hands as it was obvious that the Frontier service reps had no intention of returning for us. Had it not been for his negotiating with the people in line we all might still be sitting there. Upon arrival at our destination we sat at the gate for a half an hour before de-boarding. Despite this wait we waited an additional 40 minutes for luggage to begin flowing at the baggage claim. I am a well seasoned traveler for both business and pleasure.

Check in at Pearson was a bit delayed (only one counter open 2-3 hrs before departure although it is advised that passengers arrive that early). Premium economy cabin inside the Boeing 787 (Dreamliner) is very pleasant and the flight from Toronto to London was very comfortable. Transfer at LHR T5 takes time is something I learned on this trip. 1hr connection is for sure pushing it and you're likely to miss your onward connection with anything less than 1.5 hrs transfer time. We missed our connection to ARN (our connection was only 1hr) because of the long line ups at the transfer centre. The fact that you go through security again in LHR takes some time as well. On my way back to Toronto check in at Stockholm's Arlanda Airport was easy and very smooth. The flight to LHR went fine and I had to spend almost an hour lining up at transfer centre going through security. This is the part of the transfer that for sure takes time. After a train ride to the C gates and a fairly smooth boarding I was onboard the flight to Toronto. I had been upgraded to Business class which was pleasant. Service onboard was professional and courteous. Landing in Toronto was a bit delayed due delayed take off from Heathrow. My overall w BA was good. However transfer in LHR is probably one of the more lengthier ones in Europe I think. I preferred the short transfer at KEF on my last trip to Sweden a few months ago.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,7,4,3,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

Porter Airlines is one of the few airlines you can count on to be delayed every single time you fly them. It is completely unacceptable that they constantly make their customers late and offer nothing to make up for any such inconvenience. Even just while sitting in the lounge for several hours waiting for my flight as other airlines had no issues getting their flights off the ground on time Porter cancelled two flights and suggested that those customers fly with another airline (and pay the exorbitant fees they were charging at the gate) just to get home on time for Christmas.

Terrible experience very dirty flight and extremely disorganized passenger service and operations. This airline having know the fact that it takes time to go through border control and homeland security gave us less than 1 hour at Fort Lauderdale airport to go through the security and immigration check during peak hours with over 300 odd passengers in a queue. This was at 18.45 hrs I was supposed to be on my next flight unfortunately with Spirit at 20.00 so we had roughly 35 mins. As a result I missed my flight. In spite of the fact that the airlines knew that so many passengers were stuck in the queue with immigration they didn't bother to delay the flight by few minutes and left us in limbo. I went to the service staff and they said they could not ud to Las Vegas that night but the day after. They wouldn't provide a hotel but said they could get me to LAX airport that night and I could make my way to Las Vegas by taxi (at my own cost ). This flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours and I reached LAX at 2.30 in the on 15th leaving me no way whatsoever to reach Las Vegas by 4 am to board my next flight.

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,M Ihantola,Finland,2013-10-22,"HEL-JFK-HEL in October. A333 OH-LTT on both flights. Flights on time boarding efficient. Spacious cabin leg room surprisingly alright (especially if there was no IFE box under the seat in front of you). Online check-in so-so: had to try 4 times to get one of our party of 3 checked-in with the other two there were no problems. Got to choose our seats from what seats were still available which was fine. We also had quite a lot of trouble with their online services before the flight. Cabin crew very nice on first flight on second flight a bit brusque except one male FA who was working at the rear of the galley and proved to be both courteous and funny. Finnish accent quite heavy in all the PA announcements made in English. On return flight the First Officer gave a humorous ""welcome to Helsinki"" by describing - very accurately - the currently lousy weather conditions. Pre- ordered gluten-free meals had to be personally asked for onboard but once delivered were tasty. Although the gluten-free breakfast with Finnair is an insult: a banana and one dry rice cake wrapped in plastic. The regular economy meals seem to come with a choice of two (a vegetarian pasta or chicken etc.) but on second flight there was no choice left when the meal service reached the rear rows of the cabin. Wine beer and sodas are served free of charge spirits you have to pay for in economy. IFE perhaps a bit limited with choice compared to other airlines but we found it sufficient enough. Bonus points for Finnair for their exciting ""Front camera"" view as a part of their IFE service especially if it's available during take off. Before landing on JFK FA's announced that when returning to Finland make sure you have enough time for the long lines to security check. Well at bag drop at JFK the Finnair desk doesn't open until some 2 hours before boarding time. A bit mixed messages perhaps? All in all Finnair does it's job: takes you safely there and back with decent food and some entertainment. Don't expect anything spectacular I'd say Finnair is a pretty decent airline.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,3,4,NA,NA,4,1
airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Terence Verney,Netherlands,2011-01-20,"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

condor-airlines,/airline-reviews/condor-airlines,Condor Airlines customer review,Morten Jensen,Denmark,2012-06-18,Premium Economy from Frankfurt to Fort Lauderdale. The bad: Check-in at Frankfurt was somewhat slow and no smiles were given during the process. Boarding was a bit delayed with no explanation given. Boarding message was very hard to understand due to lousy speaker quality. We were told to board in different stages but people ignored this and everyone went on the buses at the same time. Hand baggage limit is only 6kg which is nothing (my hand carry suitcase is fairly light but still weighs 3kgs without anything in it). Luckily this wasn't checked or enforced on this flight. The good: Flight was actually quite good. Seat on Economy Premium had plenty of leg space. I'm 1.95cm and still had 30cm of space from my knees to the seat in front of me which in my case was a wall. Seat leaned back a lot which made it somewhat comfortable to sleep something I otherwise find hard on flights in general. No individual screens but a few common screens showing comedy music and ads. On the promo clips they showed for Condor all the flight crew were young and hot (probably hired models) the real crew were old and looked like something out of an 80's movie. But the service was friendly and professional. Food was actually quite good. I've had better but I've certainly had worse as well. Overall the experience on Economy Premium was like flying on the luxury class of old low cost airline.

tap-portugal,/airline-reviews/tap-portugal,TAP Portugal customer review,Stephen Henden,United Kingdom,2015-07-02,"TAP are charging shockingly high business class prices on their route from Lisbon to Sao Tome. The flight time via Acra is almost 7 hours and in my ignorance and bearing in mind we paid more than Â£2000 per seat I thought I would get something approaching reasonable seats and service. TAP are using A320's on the route in European configuration. This means that business has little or no more leg room the only benefit being that the middle row of three is not filled. They maintain that the seats are wider but on both our flights were not. This may be OK for a 2 hour business class route in Europe but not on a long haul flight like this at the prices that are being charged. The service was lacklustre and staff seemed to have little interest, the food was OK but inadequate for such a long flight and I arrived at the end of the SAO-LIS tired, hungry and feeling that I had been badly ripped off. I appreciate that an aircraft the size of an A320 is ideal for this route but there is no reason why TAP cannot invest in re-configuring the aircraft into a more suitable layout. BA for example use the same aircraft on a 5 hours plus run to Beirut yet have proper business class sleep seats at the front of the aircraft. If they really cannot do this then charge a small supplement but do not con passengers into thinking they are getting good comfort and service. This is one of the worst airline experiences in relation to value I have had and frankly would have rather flown Ryanair. From the moment we checked in in Lisbon the approach was lackluster.

What I've also found is the passengers here cannot wait for the plane to stop before they're out of their seats and there is no admonishment from the staff. The food is always bland and as cheap as possible they can't even be bothered buttering the sandwiches and the excuse for dinner is laughable. There is zero inflight entertainment.

We will never fly with them again! The middle of July comes around and we receive a phone call from US Airways saying they cancelled the flight we booked so we needed to choose a different flight. The only two options available were to either leave and come back the same dates but the travel time was 2 days worth each way or to leave a day early and get a hotel to be able to make it on the next flight leaving the following morning. The second option was our only reasonable choice out of the two. By leaving a day early this meant that my husband and I were going to have to miss an additional day's worth of work. We asked the agent if we could be compensated with a free hotel stay or for our bags and her answer was no. When we get to the baggage check in counter they tell us that we still need to pay for our bags. We stood there arguing with them that we already paid for our bags online. 30 minutes later this was finally straightened out. On our way back from Aruba we ran into the same issue with baggage fees (which we ended up having to pay for twice). We fly into Philadelphia to find out that our flight to Chicago has been delayed 5 hours which puts us getting into Chicago at around 2.00 am.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,G Thompson,South Africa,2015-07-01,"Was curious to try Qatar, having flown Emirates numerous times between S Africa and Europe. Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat. Other than that, I can't fault Qatar.",Boeing 787 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy,Johannesburg to Istanbul (SAW) via Doha,8,2,3,4,4,3,NA,5,1

I arrived at Johannesburg airport 3.5 hours before take off and went straight to the check-in desk. The queue was already substantial - only one check in desk open for international passengers it took me two hours to check in. I complained to two senior personnel both times they were rude and unhelpful. When I arrived at passport control there was a similar problem. I eventually got to the plane 10 minutes before we were due to take off. We then had to wait as a passenger did not arrive and their luggage had to be removed I realise that was not SAAâs fault but more was to follow. The next delay was due to missing paper work when that eventually arrived we started to taxi to the runway only to stop. We were told there was a problem with one of the engines and had to be towed back to the docking bay to wait for repairs. Running 1.5 hours late we eventually left but the problems did not stop. Early the next morning I called a stewardess as the toilets were not flushing the captain announced some time later that everyone had to use the bathroom as they were going to be locked the mechanism wasnât working properly. The return trip wasnât much better the seats very extremely cramped I dropped my book and due to the seat in front being in a reclining position I couldnât bend down and pick it up.

We flew Economy (Dublin-Toronto) and it was a great flight. The flight attendants were friendly and smartly dressed. The interior cabin fabric seemed new. The seats weren't too roomy but they didn't feel too small either. The meals were standard fare for my family, decent, although my vegetarian meal (an Indian vegan dish) had to be the best meal I've ever had on any Economy flight, domestic or international. We were pretty much on-time departing and arriving. The in-flight entertainment was a bit laughable, but we had read up on it and knew that going in. It was funny to see such old Hollywood movies available on the Rouge Player (one of the movies was Never Ending Story!).

Due to a weather delay our initial flight out of KC was delayed-this is not Frontier's fault. I asked the ticket counter clerk if I needed to be put on a later flight and that I was even willing to purchase a flight on another airline because I had to be in Seattle before 8 pm. The counter clerk told me this delay would cause a 'ripple' effect and that my flight out of Denver would be delayed. The flight out of Denver wasn't delayed and we missed it - and missed out on all of the flights that we could have booked when we were in KC. The only available flight was on a partner airline and arrived to Seattle at 11.15 because it had to go through Phoenix first. On the way back our flight was delayed again - this time it was not weather and we were automatically put on a later flight out of Denver to KC. This meant that we had to start our drive home 3 hours later than originally planned. Somehow we made it to Denver before our original flight left. They wouldn't let us on the plane. The ticket counter told me I had to change my ticket at customer service. Customer service called the ticket counter who told them we could not board the plane - that plane was actually delayed until 7.45. We sat and watched the plane we had purchased tickets for take off.

If my original flight had left on time I would have missed the weather delay that started at about 7pm and lasted for an hour or so. The weather delay did mess things up and flights were diverted to wait for the weather to pass. Our incoming plane was diverted to Rockford IL for a ground stop and then never made it to Chicago. We had 7 official delays several noted only after the original delay deadline had passed and then the delay was only another 30 to 45 minutes so not much time to go get food etc. We had 3 gate changes during the process the last of which brought us back to the gate where our plane for Flight #518 was still sitting still with its mechanical problems. Our inbound aircraft never made it no alternative aircraft could be brought to the gate even though there was an alternate aircraft available and the flight crew timed out at just before 2am when they cancelled the flight.

Unfortunately the Jeddah - Khartoum route is completely neglected by Saudia in terms of quality standards (even though they are profitable routes) and i can't wait for the free-skies policy to take effect so that the competition either forces Saudia to raise its standards or to disappear.

tap-portugal,/airline-reviews/tap-portugal,TAP Portugal customer review,J Nombro,United Kingdom,2014-07-20,Booked a TAP flight from LHR to Fortaleza Brazil for the world cup. Received a call from TAP the day before flying that the second leg from Lisbon to Fortaleza would be operated by Windrose (a Ukrainian company working with TAP) so no time to change your flight (rebooking or cancellation as you need to get to your destination). 1st leg from Heathrow was OK. The second leg operated by Windrose departed 1 hour later than scheduled from Lisbon including a wait of 30 mins inside the bus taking us from the gate to the aircraft. The aircraft was an old A330. It had no entertainment system (No movies no music no games - nothing). What do you do on a 7hr journey like this? Although the Windrose crew were friendly and should not be blamed for anything this is a real disgrace for TAP selling a product that is below current long haul travel standards and not playing fair and transparent with the customer about the product which they are selling. Return trip left 1hr 30mins late but I'll leave this complaint for a different day. Will I fly TAP again? I'd rather pay for a direct flight from LHR to Brazil next time.

garuda-indonesia,/airline-reviews/garuda-indonesia,Garuda Indonesia customer review,Tony Hall,Australia,2014-08-03,Brisbane-Bali return business. The problem with this service is that a 737 is too small for a 5-6 hour flight. The seats have good pitch for the size of aircraft but they are very old style. The business cabin was only half full on the way out but full on the ways back. The FAs were very pleasant and really did their best but the equipment was not really up to the job. Only one full meal was served and on the return overnight it turned out to be breakfast. There was no warning of this as the standard pattern for air travel is usually a meal one hour after take off and I had expected dinner. We left at 23.30 were given one small corn tartlet (nothing else) at 00.30 and breakfast at 03.15. The wines with the corn tartlet were however excellent!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,3,4,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

I have flown many airlines internationally and Qantas doesn't even come close. Poor level of comfort in business on the A380. Emirates business is first class compared to Qantas business. The meal (dinner) was ok pretty basic but after 2 hours in the Hong Kong business lounge I wasn't overly hungry. The service was poor. Not a lot of attention given to individual passengers. Awoken a full 2.25 hours prior to landing for the worst breakfast I have ever had. Filling out a breakfast order form ala room service is just an aid for the staff to get it over as quickly as possible in the morning. No other airline requires this just poor class. I was looking forward to the relaxing flight home in the flagship plane. Never again for me. No wonder the National Carrier is in trouble financially. 4 of us going to Europe in June yes with Emirates even though Qantas are now sharing the route. Be worth paying much more to go another airline even if Qantas are more expensive. Service with a smile..yes but not much service though unfortunately and definitely a cheaper all-round experience.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Check in was kind of a slow process and they do need to learn how to prioritize their lines. Not once did we get a final check in or express check in at the check in counters. By the time I got to immigration we had 20 minutes until our flight left luckily enough the immigration let us cut the line. It didn't really matter because we arrived at the gate to basically stand there for 15 mins. Our departure was at 10.50am we are boarding at 10.50am. Onboard the aircraft my seat was cracked. Staff were quite rude constantly asking us to sit down while they played who to blame for the delay. Captain didn't say anything which I found rude. It was only after 30 minutes that he informed us we missed our time slot. Cabin was quite hot. I never seen such picky flight staff in my life asking anyone who moved seats why they were moving and to proceed back to their seat. For dinner there was no stock left no meal no sandwich no coke.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Sean Terrell,United States,2014-04-28,My wife our 10 month old and myself flew from Columbus Ohio to Richmond VA with a stop in Cleveland. Our plane was late getting into Columbus which made us late for our connection in Cleveland. The next available flight wasn't until 8pm that evening giving us a 9 hour layover in Cleveland and causing us to miss the wedding rehearsal dinner we had planned on attending that evening. However when we reached our destination nearly 10hrs from our original arrival time we found that our luggage was lost. We received the same explanation from customer service while our bags flew from Cleveland to Charlotte to who knows where. On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

For some reason, I was not able to complete this for my sister. Once we arrived at YVR, the agent could not explain why there was a problem. Departure was on time. Leg room was non-existent, and I'm only 5'2"" tall! Seats cushion reminded me of those foamies we used to sit on in 1978 for a football game. Seat only reclined 1.5"" for an red-eye flight. Only purchased a chocolate bar for $3.50 so no idea of food quality. Only 2 drink services on a 6 hour flight seemed a little poor (and hot drinks were not available one way). IFE was non-accessible because we weren't told about the app until 3 minutes before we had to turn off our phones - no time to download.

Similar weather conditions days later in Liverpool and not a single easyJet flight was cancelled. Full ticket refund on their website was straightforward so no complaints about that. Staff at Manchester airport were very patient they could not do much about it and had to face all of us frustrated passengers. But equally it was clear that the company had not a clear plan to bring their customers to their destination their advice was more like go home. In spite of all that easyJet when it operates their flights they tend to be very good only when things go out of the ordinary they tend to be very bad.

airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,P Elliott,Australia,2014-03-30,March 2014 Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur and from KL down to Perth a week later. Air Asia has had a number of excellent promo fares. In general $200 out of Australia and $100 into Australia. We paid $15 for seat reservation in the quiet child-free cabin. That was an excellent choice as the cabin is kept for people who booked seats in it. The curtains are drawn and the staff police it from anyone wandering in. On the Adelaide - KL sector we got a middle seat free. On the KL - Perth sector we could spread out on 3 seats each. I wouldn't bother with a premium seat unless on a night flight. We took extra food and our tablets loaded with entertainment. The meals we pre- ordered were ok. The flights went smoothly and we arrived early each time. There's an in-flight magazine in the seat back and you can always watch the stewardesses. Their uniform is world famous. The low cost terminal in KL is a shocker so you need to put on your blinkers and deal with it. There's banks a duty free shop water to drink and toilets. The new low cost terminal will open soon and it looks wonderful. We pre-purchased a SIM card and that was ready and waiting on arrival before the duty free shop so I could make calls immediately. Taxi vouchers are sold after luggage collection. And within an hour you are at your KL hotel. The departure to Perth was of a morning so we stayed at the Tune hotel near the terminal. So it was easy to make the early flight. Oh I did online check-in for both flights. Baggage drop was quick and easy.

I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem. Bags in SFO took ages mitigating an on-time arrival. Sorry Hawaiian but serving sub-standard complimentary food does not allow you to rip off passengers with extra charges and poor service.

I read that on intercontinental flights lots of tall pax struggle I was just fine and picked an aisle seat as precaution. Seat comfort - just normal. Flights were departing little late but arriving on time. Check in luggage arrived with me into destination.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,M Lawrence,United Kingdom,2015-01-05,I flew VS043 UC on Monday 22 December 14 and returned Wednesday 31 December. As soon as you enter the terminal the whole experience is exceptional; from check in to collecting your luggage at your destination. Check in at LGW was quick no queues and hence you are directed to the lounge. The lounge at Gatwick is a haven of tranquillity away from the general hustle and bustle of the terminal. You want for nothing and everywhere you look a happy smiley face in smart red uniform is on hand to attend to your every whim. I also took advantage of the complimentary treatment in the spa with a scalp message. The call to board came all too soon as I could quite easily have stayed in the lounge a while longer. Turning left on the plane and walking through premium you are met with ambient mood lighting and a glass of champagne. What is striking from the very moment you board is the exceptional service which is proactive. I can't remember ever asking for anything during the 10 hour 45 minute flight because of the dedicated staff. 11/10.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

They gave us an old ipad for entertainment. Food was horrible and the flight attendants went up front and closed the drapes. Impossible to get even a drink.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,R Atkins,United States,2015-01-14,I bought a ticket with Spirit Airlines due to their low price. However I didn't factor in the enormous amounts of extra fees that I'd be paying in the end which is my fault for not having thoroughly researched an airline. After purchasing my ticket we paid an extra $170 in fees. For a one way trip. $80 for two checked bags $20 in government fees (this is normally included in the ticket price I assumed). Then we had to pay for our seats for both the initial flight and the connecting flight so four more charges totalling $70. They have a random generated seating option which is free but then my fiancÃ© and I wouldn't have been sitting together for our vacation which I think is absurd. Overall the base fare is cheap but with the nickle and diming that they do afterwords you're better off finding a different flight. I would recommend JetBlue.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

I could tell this flight would be good and it was. After take off menus were given out and then a drinks run and the wine options were explained by the personable cabin crew guy. The the purser came round with lunch hake or beef and it was service with a friendly smile. A further drinks round was provided with a smile before a 30 minute early landing into Heathrow. So the simple conclusion is that the cabin crew can make or break a flight win over or loose customers. This twosome won me over.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,3,5,4,0,NA,NA,4,1

jetairfly,/airline-reviews/jetairfly,Jetairfly customer review,C Rainbow,Ireland,2014-02-25,22nd Feb 2014 Tenerife South and Brussels Charleroi. I considered the price to be quite expensive. Check-in consisted of 2 lines operated by a combination of uniformed TUI staff and an Iberia uniformed agent too. The lines moved quickly and efficiently. I had reserved my seat online and paid extra for a seat the front of the plane. The cabin crew were very pleasant polite and multilingual. However passengers were allowed to take far too much hand luggage on board and this was a problem both when boarding and when exiting the flight. There had been a catering strike in Belgium and so the catering I had paid for online was not quite what was served. I was offered an exceptionally watered down cup of stained milk otherwise known as tea! This was additional to the very disappointing meal I had paid â¬8 for online. My seat was wafer thin at the back and I could feel every kick from the screaming baby behind me. The aircraft used was a 737-800. It included two small screens at the front of the aircraft near the door on which an interactive map chartered out the route from Tenerife to Brussels. I saw during the flight the cabin crew seat aside food for themselves. I also noted that the crew had poor discipline over the passengers. Disembarkation was one of the worst I have seen in years as the crew were oblivious to the couple with the screaming baby who blocked the aisle and also prevented passengers from removing their belongings from two of the overheard lockers. The young cabin crew attempted a polite farewell to passengers and did their best under a grey Belgian sky.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,3,2,0,NA,NA,3,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,A Mueller,Germany,2015-01-05,Flew HAM-DXB-BLR and returned BLR-DXB-HAM in mid-December 2014 with Emirates. Before taking this flight I'd heard the hype about Emirates being one of the best airlines so was looking forward to the trip. How far could the reality be from the hype? A long way. Where to begin? The seats are not comfortable stewardesses missed me twice when bringing drinks around and once when bringing meals (I wasn't asleep they just didn't ask and were looking away from me so I couldn't get their attention until I had to practically shout at them - which got an angry- looking glare). On the return leg from BLR to DXB I got a nosebleed in flight and wanted to ask them for tissues - I used the call button but nobody came. Waited several minutes then tried again this went on until the bleeping stopped after about 15 minutes. Not one attendant came to repeated buzzing over that time. Finally it stopped and I got out of my window seat and to the toilet to take care of it myself. I noticed during the flights to BLR and on the return that there were plenty of other people who also got no responses to their calls - they finally gave up or I saw a couple of them get up from their seats and find an attendant themselves - so ignoring passengers seems to be corporate policy. Meals are also average.

Arrived at MAN about 1hr 45mins before departure and had to wait about 20 mins for check- in to open. I tried to use the self-service machine but couldn't get it to accept my eTicket number. Once check-in had opened a friendly agent spotted that I was only carrying hand baggage and pulled me out of the queue and successfully got me checked in using the s/s machine. Gate (03C) was announced about half an hour before boarding. Gate area is on ground floor directly opening onto the apron and was very poorly heated! Boarding was by bus to the aircraft at a stand. The plane a Fokker 50 was very cold on boarding but soon warmed up once the engines were started. Internally it looked a little tired but who cares on such a short trip? Seat pitch in row 8 was excellent. Inflight magazine said 32 inches but it felt more than that. Cabin crew did an excellent job of serving lunch (cheese or ham rolls) drinks and a chocolate to the quite full flight in the short time available (they also handed out boiled sweets before pushback). The flight continues from LCY to LUX and continuing passengers don't have to disembark - virtually everyone who boarded at MAN disembarked at LCY though. All in all a very pleasant experience. I usually only ever fly between Manchester and London at times like Christmas when there's no/poor train service but the convenient location of LCY for me (living in Kent) means that I would consider this route again - especially if I can't get a cheap advance ticket on the train in which case VLM's fares are often a quite reasonable alternative.,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

flybe,/airline-reviews/flybe,Flybe customer review,R Mendoza,United States,2013-01-08,MAN-CDG-SFO via FlyBe/Air France. FlyBe's online check in system messed one of our party's booking due to this current Air France/FlyBe partnership. In fact it showed (second experience for us with this) the CDG-SFO journey as not having been checked in only the MAN-CDG (FlyBe's portion) journey as being checked in. System is therefore very inaccurate. Although one buys and flies Air France as well as checks in online using Air France's website from the States it's the reverse from the UK. Thus when doing online check in from the UK one is directed from the Air France site to the FlyBe site which does not make sense. Getting to the airport the check in agent claimed the booking was not to be found in the FlyBe system. Told we had to wait until their office opened in order to have management sort out the problem. Thankfully we arrived two hours before departure but I cannot believe that passengers are at the mercy of the office being opened to sort out any booking issues. This almost caused us to miss our flight to Paris in order to connect to San Francisco. The agent then forgot to issue the complimentary drinks voucher and we forgot to ask due to the confusion. Onboard we were refused drinks due to lack of the voucher.

The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase.

singapore-airlines,/airline-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,J Lee,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with Ã¢stuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with.

Flight out on time however two passengers in particular who were quite obviously drunk at boarding were asked by staff to step aside. Relieved thinking that they would not be allowed to board but to our amazement they were allowed on and on top of that the cabin crew still served them alcohol on board. A very tense flight knowing that they could cause a problem at any time. Had a fantastic holiday but on our arrival at Zakynthos airport it was a complete and utter farce. We had under 20kgs each going out from Glasgow and no problems. On our return our cases were actually weighing less than when we went out yet they were saying that we were 3kgs over and were telling lots of people that they were over. The farcical bit was when we emptied from our main luggage into hand luggage which quite obviously was then over 5kgs each - they allowed the cases! To top all that you then had to take your cases back to stand in another queue to put them through a scanner. Completely and utterly a pointless exercise other than to extort money. Be very careful on your return journey as they want 18 Euros for every kilo over. We made the decision to empty items from the cases into our hand luggage but some people were being stung not realising that you could simply take stuff out and put in back in once you had left check in. Utter madness! Flight back left early which was good but not particularly impressed with Thomas Cook staff either. They were pleasant enough but were not particularly professional. We didn't particularly want to listen to their ailments what curtains they were buying for their house and what they were getting up to on nights out.

It had been a round-about 48 hour visit to an ill relative and I was exhausted from having to rise in the wee hours AM to board coming and going on the only non-stop flight. It has been many years since I have seen flight attendants so ""up-beat"" and kind with a sense of humor in the face of a fully packed jumbo jet.

kuwait-airways,/airline-reviews/kuwait-airways,Kuwait Airways customer review,Taylor Adam,United Kingdom,2014-03-31,FCO-CDG on KU165 onboard an old but very classic A310. Boarding was prompt as only around 30 passengers needed to board. Once onboard the flight was full with inbound passengers who were staying onboard from KWI for the next sector to CDG. Departure was on time and we took off from Runway 25. The inflight entertainment is non existent but for such a short flight do I really care. The food and beverage service was done well and quickly however the standard of catering was very poor. Seat comfort was ok considering the age of the aircraft. For this flight I was satisfied but for a 4-6 hour flight which this aircraft is used for I would perhaps not be so satisfied. The crew were very professional throughout the flight and also came across polite. My conclusion is for the flight I took which was short I was happy and at Â£82 one way I could not complain. The reality is though KU are still a long way behind the airlines that they compete with in the middle east region (QREYEK) and with this in mind I would always choose one of these airlines on long haul before selecting Kuwait Airways.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,2,2,NA,NA,5,1

When weighting the hand luggage the CSA employees claimed that the allowed baggage was 8 kilos not 12 as stated at their website. Some passengers were already sorting out some of the luggage. Later the women checked the flight details again and admitted that the hand baggage is 12 kg. Cabin crew did not speak German and only poor english although most passengers were non-czech. Only a small sandwich was handed out unfortunately the cabin crew did not know whether the meat included pork or not - the vast majority of the passengers were Turkish so almost no one could eat the sandwich (no vegetarian alternative provided). Prague airport was nice and the three hours of waiting were enjoyable. An old Boeing used for the flight to Turkey. Seats were not clean.

Lady at the gate told me I'd have to wait an hour till she could answer any of my questions. Went back to the desk an hour later and told that the man at the check in desk must have made a mistake and that I had not been put on standby.

Flight down was good with the exception of the meal. Cold egg and bacon sandwich. Why offer a warm towel before the meal? Couldn't understand the point of that. Our return departure was moved up by one hour due to time change. We were sitting in our room. They did not call us. The biggest part of this problem is the way the Sunwing rep handled the situation and told me I'd have to take a taxi to the airport. Made it to the gate just as boarding was starting. Sunwing needs to provide more time to get through the airport - seat designation as well as security takes a long time - there are a lot of people going through these vacation spot airports! Flight home was better for food - hot beef sandwich - yes I said hot - wonder how it didn't cool down while being handed out? There was one flight attendant who was unpleasant the whole trip - another passenger said she remembered her from a previous flight.

Plane is so large takes a long time to board and disembark. We flew Premium Economy, seats are bigger and have leg room but they're not comfortable for some reason. Flight crew was fine and professional. Inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  They offer pillows and blankets. But although the seats are wider, they weren't easy to get in and out of, and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. The meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot of choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. Roll butter and dessert but I'm not sure I'd say it was what BA's advertisement claims. It didn't feel it was a premium meal. They also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. The entire plane was dark. The second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return to LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. The flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. Not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday, we weren't notified by BA until Saturday afternoon. We ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. Poor communication on their part.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,J Forsythe,Canada,2014-10-22,We recently took an Air Canada Rouge flight from Edinburgh to Toronto . We had read many negative reviews but decided to try Rouge because it was a direct flight. For the most part we were pleasantly surprised. We found the flight attendants to be very efficient and professional. As far as the seats and configuration we agree with others that it is pretty crowded and there is not much legroom. The rented iPad worked well for the inflight entertainment system. While our overall experience was positive we think that there should be a far greater fare difference for Rouge flights compared to regular Air Canada service. If this is to be a discount airline the fares should reflect this. Because of this we would prefer to use full service carriers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,2,3,NA,NA,3,1

druk-air,/airline-reviews/druk-air,Druk Air customer review,Keith Angus,NA,2008-01-08,Bangkok-Paro return - via Kolkotta on the way out and Gaya on the way back. Business class. The overall experience was good - food drink and FA service was of a very good standard. It's worth paying the little extra for business class ($40 per person each way) as the seats are roomy and comfortable plus you get lounge access at both Bangkok and Paro although the Paro lounge is a bit quaint. The other reason for booking business class is if your flight gets delayed as ours did on the return journey for around five hours. There's little in the way of facilities at Paro airport so it's worth the extra for a more comfortable place to wait (and enjoy free drinks of course). Make sure you sit on the left hand side on the flight into Paro as you get the best views of the Himalayas. And finally don't be worried about the descent into Paro as the plane does get worryingly close to the mountainsides.,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The attendants were serving the coffee/tea at the same time they were serving the meal and beverage. Flight attendants were ignoring flight attendant call signal/buttons.

My flight was 20 minute delayed from Portland our plane landed in Phoenix and had 20 mins to spare to get on my next flight to Milwaukee however I missed my connecting flight. The man next to me said he was there 15 minutes early and the door was already shut. US Airways knows when their plane touch down and no way they should shut the doors unless they oversold their tickets on a regular basis. I felt so bad for the staff that they have to go through all this chaos of passengers missing their connecting flights. This is absolutely the worst airline I've ever flown.

They don't clean their cabins either. We were informed 6 hours before departure that our flight from Brisbane to Melbourne had been cancelled. It took us 2 hours on the phone with the call centre to book a flight later on the same evening. They then booked us on two different flights - one for the evening in question the other a few days later. It took another hour to convince them to fix this. The plane was about 2 hours which meant that we arrived in Melbourne after 7pm and consequently wasted an entire day. The in- flight crew were pleasant enough. The return flight was also cancelled and re-booked for earlier on in the day - meaning we lost the 2nd of our 4 day holiday in Melbourne. My seat was full of rubbish and sopping wet with alcohol - and they couldn't give me a fresh cushion instead wrapping the soiled one in a garbage bag. It was slippery and uncomfortable.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,M Gents,Netherlands,2015-02-11,Flew AMS-LHR-JFK return 26th Dec - 31st Dec. AMS-LHR-AMS on A321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. Although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. Nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. Service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich would be nice on a mid-morning flight). They are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. LHR-JFK-LHR on B744 totally different experience. Transferring through T5 at LHR easy enough although I got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max - but hey this is the UK after all. Also BA advertise T5 as like it's one building - not the case. All this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. They actually board a fully booked B744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. Given all the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges I felt this was totally unnecessary. Turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly Club World and First seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. How to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. Prime example! Service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. Seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. IFE well just bring your own tablet. So dated it's just not worth switching on. The cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. Arriving early morning from JFK of course we parked at a hard stand. Waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. BA this is not acceptable. Disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. But a fully loaded 744? Come on.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,4,3,1,NA,NA,4,0

There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end. The crew were friendly and bilingual but once meals were served they did not really appears. I wouldn't seek to fly with this airline again unless there were no other options. I had an internal flight in Argentina on LAN Chile and they appeared to be a more polished act.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,1,3,2,1,NA,NA,3,1

condor-airlines,/airline-reviews/condor-airlines,Condor Airlines customer review,Margot Senula,United States,2015-07-22,"I have been flying for over 50 yrs and this was the worst airline experience. This flight was scheduled to leave at 8.45 pm on June 27th, 2015. Approximately six weeks prior to departure our travel agent informed us that the return flight would be later which we were ok with. When we received our new itinerary on May 9th we were shocked to find that our departure had also changed to 11.45pm on June 27th. This delay, which our travel agent said she was not originally informed of, of course negatively impacted our travel plans and hotel reservations. Six weeks prior to departure it was of course also impossible to find a reasonably priced flight for the same date for eight people. The plane arrived at the gate late (no passengers disembarked) but we watched through the window as large crates of cargo were unloaded from the plane. As midnight came and went we asked the gate staff if we were going to make our connecting flight in Frankfurt â they reassured us we would. We asked multiple times over the next hour and each time got the same assurance. They then informed us that the flight was delayed because they needed to clean and provision the plane for our flight. The time approached 1 am (technically the next day June 28th) before boarding commenced. The pilot and head flight attendant at the plane entrance again reassured us that we would make our connecting flight no problem. They then informed us that the delay in the flight was due to refueling. We didnât take off until 1.30 am. Upon arriving in Frankfurt there was no direction on how to catch our connecting flights we had originally scheduled an hour and 25 minute to make our connection â but of course we left an hour and 45 minutes behind schedule. We parked at Concourse A and unloaded. We had to board the airport buses which took us to the other side of the airport â Concourse C. No one met the 15-20+ passengers who had our connecting flight to Munich or provided direction. We found our departure gate, back at Concourse A, and ran through the airport to try to make our flight â other passengers were with us. They rushed us through the security checkpoints but we were still delayed. We arrived at the gate to have Lufthansa inform us that the flight left 5 minutes ago and it was not their fault. Apparently Condor had not communicated with them allowing the 15-20 passengers to make our connection. We felt the Condor staff who promised we would make the connection had lied to us and worse yet made no provision for the connection. We then had to go across the whole airport once again to the Condor desk. Where upon the desk staff made us feel like it was our fault we missed the flight, were unfriendly, unsympathetic and made little attempt to find a solution except for a flight to Munich 3+ hours later â which again would have interfered with our hotel reservations. Unwilling to wait or delay any longer our family discussed the situation and we made arrangements with our rental car to start our trip and drive from Frankfurt. But Condor then proceeded to lose our bags for an hour and a half and said they would not forward our bags if they could not find them. We got to our destination at 1.30 am. We had issues on our return flight as well - a gate change less than hour before the flight with no notice.",NA,FamilyLeisure,Economy,Baltimore Washington to Munich via Frankfurt,2,3,3,2,2,1,3,1,0

We even boarded the plane and were later asked to de-board due to mechanical issues after waiting in the plane for 2 hours. Due to the delay we did not have a ride home. Therefore we had to pay for a very expensive cab ride. Of course they refused to compensate us claiming that any delays are not the responsibility of the airline. The only compensation was a meal voucher which we had to use within 45 min or we were out of luck. And good luck speaking to a live person at customer service. There is no such thing.

The only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane. Being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets. It was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight. We were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through. An other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements.

There were no changes made and they acknowledged there was no change. When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,D Porter,United States,2014-04-24,I booked a flight from Santiago Dominican Republic to Chicago Illinois. This was booked with reservation because I traveled through Spirit a couple of years ago and had a horrible experience. At that time I vowed to not travel with this airline and when asked about the airline I spoke of how horrible it was. I booked Spirit this time only because it was the most economical not the best flight accommodations because I had 2 layovers Santiago to Ft. Lauderdale Ft. Lauderdale to Orlando and Orlando to Chicago which Orlando's layover was approximately 10 hours but for the price why not. I went online to pay for baggage which Spirit happens to be one of few airlines that charge for first bag when flying internationally. I was confused that when I pay for baggage from Santiago to Chicago I had to pay double. I spoke with representative she stated once your bags are paid for the charge is from Santiago to Chicago. When I arrived at the airport in Santiago I spoke with Customer Service Representative for clarity about the bags and bag charge. She stated my bags were paid only through my second layover which was Orlando but from Orlando to Chicago the were not paid for. I explained to the Representative that I spoke with someone over the phone stating it was paid through Chicago. She spoke with her Supervisor the Supervisor made the adjustment and I was on my way. Lines at Security once I arrived at Ft. Lauderdale and Orlando were long but moved very fast. Staff were friendly and helpful. My bags made it to my final destination Chicago without incident.

Entertainment was at a cost (except for one movie and three TV programs) - even music was at a cost. Staff were pleasant but not interested - so different to the resort staff and other tourist staff in Fiji.

Both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy. Great addition to both flights were the FAs who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack - either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either tea/coffee/water. On the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems. The weather in Byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion. Staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon Virgin flight. I'd recommend REX over Virgin and Jetstar.

However there were 4 desks open for just 1 flight which meant the queue moved quickly. Boarding process chaotic with people unsure which rows were boarding (unclear announcement poor organisation by gate staff) so only a trickle of passengers boarded for quite a while meaning the whole process took twice as long as it needed to. Other carriers have much more efficient and streamlined boarding procedures which Norwegian needs to learn from. Last 30 passengers to board had their hand luggage put in the hold because there was no more space in the cabin (no-one checked size of number of pieces of carry ons). Onboard seat pitch good seat comfort acceptable for a short flight. IFE shown on screens (cartoons etc). Free wifi available but extremely slow. Cabin crew very friendly. No pushy selling (in fact no announcements were made after takeoff until just before landing). Lights dimmed for people to be able to rest. On-time arrival. Norwegian on the ground are somewhat amateurs however onboard experience was very good. I would use them again but they need to improve their ground experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,0,4,NA,NA,5,1
virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,J Goldstein,United States,2015-04-10,This was a 6 hour trip from San Francisco CA to Newark NJ with no entertainment because the inflight entertainment system did not work at my seat. I asked 2 different flight attendants to restart the unit but they each gave up in one second leaving me with nothing to do or watch for this long trip. The girl sitting in front of me reclined her seat so violently that she knocked the lunch that I had paid for in the airport off the tray and into my lap and the floor. When I demanded that she sit up so I could at least pick it up and dispose of it she complained to the flight attendant that I was keeping her from reclining her seat. I could not order something else to eat because you need the in flight entertainment system to see what is available and order it. Apparently now that there is the in-flight entertainment unit there is no back up in case it doesn't work for some reason.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

However check-in staff in KEF did a good job and with plenty of counters it was a relatively painless experience. Not direct ramp boarding. So you'll get to experience the 'fine' weather in Iceland first hand. Flight was operated by Air Via from Bulgaria. Excellent operation and plane in great condition. If Wow continues their co-operation with Air Via I have no hesitation in flying them again. Service on board exactly what I expected from a low cost. The usual assortment available for sale.

I have sworn to myself to never fly American again. The horror started at the check-in at JFK. You'd think if there was a merger between American and US Airways that passengers could check in anywhere. No the quite literally 60 open and manned desks were for US Airways passengers only while the AA passengers had to get in line somewhere off to the side where there were two people working. On the plane a stewardess was sitting on the jump seat in the exit row and could not stop talking to a passenger in a very loud voice. Returning from LA the check-in procedure was hands down the most inefficient system I've seen in my life. Once boarded we had a plane from I don't know when but practically no one's baggage fit in the overhead compartment everyone had to check their bags and the whole thing delayed us by about thirty minutes. The stewardess must have elbowed me in the head at least a dozen times and woke me up once to ask if I'd like to drink something. No thank I was fine just sleeping.

The next day's flight from B.A. to Sao Paulo was also delayed, with at first no annoucement at all (we had already boarded), then very late an announcement with differing details in Portuguese, Spanish and English, then an announcement that we would be offloading some passengers to re-book which turned out to be correct. Very chaotic, and the crew disappeared during this time. Finally I did make my final connection, and on this one (the 12-hour flight), my entertainment system didn't work, this included my call button, so I couldn't even get assistance and the crew didn't bring around drinks once during the entire flight (except with the 2 meal services).

On board the satay was excellent but my chef on call meal was accompanied by very hard vegetables. Dessert had no choice and was not exciting. Wine choice was excellent. The seat is better than economy but the angle made me feel like I always had to prop myself up so thank goodness for the footrest. Economy food was lacklustre and the wine is just palatable. Service not happy no menus and it took more than an hour for drinks to be served on a two hour flight. I did not see the staff come through with water or other drinks once. IFE is OK but it takes some time to get going and the collect the headphones a long time before landing and then show arrival videos. OK for a first time flyer but annoying for more frequent travellers. Overall it was safe online check in 48 hours before flight is good safety not an issue. MH just needs to elevate staff attitudes and encourage a bit more friendliness and the perception of their product will improve even if the hard product does not. Good prices make MH a decent choice but they are not as good as other one world carriers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,2,2,3,NA,NA,4,1

More importantly I can't understand why Aer Lingus make you check-in in Terminal Three and then make you walk the whole way back to Terminal one to board plane to Dublin - this is a long trudge from Terminal three through terminal two to terminal one. You would need a up to an hour to do this walk. (including long security check line). When you fly into Rome you go into terminal one and can exit there. When we finally got to gate the staff insisted on taking carry-on bags from some people (but not all) because the flight was full. In the end the overhead lockers were half empty but some people had a long wait for their luggage.

I ordered a Gluten free meal but clearly their catering department cannot be bothered other than providing a gluten free roll. The side dishes are usually given in a separate box. My OH has desert cheese biscuits etc. In mine one gluten free roll that's it. Nothing to replace the pudding. Tea time came and once again the food was served. The cabin staff could not be bothered firstly looking up who had ordered special meals so was firstly given a pack of sandwiches and a box again with something sweet. On correcting them they delivered mine. No alternative for the sandwiches instead a box with a gluten free roll and a banana. Nothing else.

And for an extra $35 per passenger each way you can get a bulkhead or exit row seat with tons of legroom but to get this you have to do online check-in pretty darn close to 24 hours before your flight. You can actually call the airline and talk to a customer representative without waiting more than a few minutes. If you fly in the evening you get a free tasty although small real hot meal with veggies and meat salad and dessert. (The breakfast service is also free but not as nice as the dinner.) Also when I asked about wine the steward mentioned the half bottle (375 ml) of red as having pleased other passengers so my wife and I bought it for $16 and it was a nice pinot noir.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

tap-portugal,/airline-reviews/tap-portugal,TAP Portugal customer review,L Montenegro,Portugal,2015-01-14,Flew business from Lisbon to Recife return. On the way to Brazil we flew on the old A330 which wasn't too bad apart from the IFE which were very outdated and you had to basically follow the films on each channel as you could not pause them and there was a poor selection of films. The seats on the old A330 were quite good taking into consideration the aircraft's age - the only downside of the seats was that they didn't convert into flat- beds. On the way back to Lisbon we flew on one of the recently acquired A330's which had an upgraded IFE touchscreen and basically the same entertainment system of all other European airlines except from the fact that there were no options to watch the external camera - which for me isn't too much of a problem; the selection of films was quite good this time. Couldn't see too much of a difference from the old seats on the recent aircraft apart from a more modern design and the fact that it had a massage function and reclined 180 degrees but nothing compared to the seats on other airlines. Staff were quite friendly and always present (they would show up in less than one minute after pressing the button) - far too different than in economy. The food was indeed very good with a good selection of wines and main courses. On the way back from Brazil they served typical Brazilian dishes though breakfast was too simple for business class. The lounge in Lisbon is very good though avoidable on peak hours; the lounge in Recife is a joke: terrible!

Booked main cabin select for extra leg room (+ one free case priority boarding priority check in and some free food / drink) - 6 hours before (in the middle of the night) we upgraded to first for $160 each. The money was well worth it due to the luxury of 2x2 seating for the first two rows only. However like a lot of flights you're at the mercy of your neighbours - in our case a mother and child who were loud. 1 hour delay announced at the gate at JFK where staff were indifferent beyond belief. They didn't really know what was going on and in the end we left over two hours late. There were some nice touches- lighting in the cabin music in the rest rooms pilot doing his briefing from the cabin. The flight attendants were very pleasant quite informal and helpful. The food in first wasn't really up to scratch. A salad main dessert. (and free drinks on request) followed by nothing - I'd expect a second snack at least. Although the seat was roomy there were no obvious instructions for the seat and it was trial and error to work out the best config to rest in. WiFi was NOT free and cost $11.95 for a laptop - good value with pretty good speed for 39000 feet. The negative comment really was on safety. A mediocre briefing poor checks of the cabin and lead flight attendant despite making the PA for all electronic items to be switched off continued to use his iphone! Main Cabin select seemed worth the money at the time of booking (and the people in our original seats looked comfy).

We flew from Manchester to Cancun with Thomas Cook and against these other poor reviews it was a faultless flight. I've come to the conclusion that people only review if they have an unpleasant experience. I advise anyone reading this to fly with Thomas Cook long haul. It's a comfortable and friendly airline: Check in - no queues with many desks open and ready. Boarding - very fast and organised immediately onto plane. Plane interior - We flew on the new refurbished A330. The cabin was a 2-4-2 configuration and at the back a 2-3-2 configuration. Seats were comfortable and reclined slightly. There was a large amount of leg room and overhead lockers also. We flew economy but in premier economy at the front there was a 2-3-2 configuration. There was no significant difference. Slightly larger seats with a pillow and amenity kit but not much benefit in upgrading. Inflight entertainment - absolutely fantastic entertainment. Touch screen 8 inch screen on the back of each seat. Economy came with 5 films and around 100 different music albums which was fantastic ranging from pop to country all free. if you paid Â£4 you gained 20 films and 30 TV shows which most people did. Films could be paused forwarded etc. There was also a USB port and headphone plug in. There was games and a map saying how far you had left and time at destination etc. As well as immigration details and Thomas Cook videos. Staff - Cabin crew were all very friendly. Food - Cooked by James Martin and I did not eat but others said it was average. We received lunch and afternoon tea. Toilets - were more roomy than usual and fairly clean. I highly advise flying long haul with Thomas Cook. It had no delay great service and entertainment. The journey back was a different story. The seats were squashed dirty and impossible to sleep on. unless I was flying on the new refurbished cabins I would not fly with Thomas Cook. The new A330's are flawless but the old ones are disgusting. There was no entertainment and the cabin was old.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

I have recently flown with them for the first time Long Haul from LGW-JFK out on 7th August 2014 returning overnight on 12th/13th August 2014. I have to say that apart from a small delay on the outgoing flight the all round experience was excellent. 787 Dreamliner planes were comfortable and actually felt less cramped than larger planes on other UK airlines flying the same route. I had booked the extra legroom seats (rows 7 and 24 respectively) grab them if you can! Inflight entertainment system was like having your own ipad state of the art and more reliable than other systems I have experienced with alternative British carriers. I actually managed to sleep a little on the return overnight flight which is a first for me on a long haul flight and I had little jet lag as a consequence. Cabin crew were efficient and friendly and the ambient lighting and windows which have automatic filtering depending on the external conditions were remarkable. On this experience I would be more than happy to book again long haul with Norwegian London to New York for Â£365 return (including the extra meal checked luggage and advanced reserved seat package) in August beats all other airlines hands down and offers as good as any other economy offering by other UK carriers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

In both flights (but especially in the Vienna - New York one) I need to point out the excellent service friendly attitude politeness and efficiency of the cabin crew. We were excellently treated in a clearly new aircraft with very comfortable and roomy seats large touch-screen personal TVs very neat toiletry bag and a very interesting well cooked and well served menu. As my wife needs help to move around and go to the toilet the response of the cabin crew to help her and make sure that she was comfortable was really exceptional. Although it was a very long ""night"" flight and the business class was sold out  the crew were always on their feet and did a perfect job in keeping everybody satisfied. We had an excellent 9-hour flight to New York and I would wholeheartedly recommend the business class of Austrian Airlines to friends and family.",NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1
tam-airlines,/airline-reviews/tam-airlines,TAM Airlines customer review,Alan Madison,United Kingdom,2014-05-01,JFK-GRU-LHR. Unable to get on any US carrier out or BA back I had no choice but to go TAM. I'd flown previously with them within Latin America and hoped things would be better long haul. Now Oneworld they have a lot to do to meet that standard. At JFK they didn't recognise my Emerald status. Eventually got into the right American lounge usual there. The plane boarded very late. But with no announcements so 90 mins at the gate standing. Queues were chaotic. Lots of staff ignoring passengers. On board got champagne just as well as we waited a further 50mins to take off. They held the flight for two very late passengers in Business class. Surprised me until when they arrived it was obvious that they were off duty crew! Seats are very poor. Not only do they go nowhere near 180 degrees but they are far from flat. Extremely uncomfortable. If you end up in the middle seat of three you are in for a very bad flight indeed. AVOD screen large but they should have spent the money on seats. Food mediocre. GRU the usual chaos on landing late. On the London leg the lounge at GRU is appalling. Nowhere near enough seats for everyone few sockets for chargers. Many people standing like it was a bar. Too hot. Drinks selection OK. Boarded late again after a lengthy wait standing. On board experience similar. I fly long haul 50+ times per year. Ok I am careful about which airlines I use but this as bad a Business Class long haul experience as I have had.

The seat is an old cradle seat they are switching in the future to flat seats. IFE was poor and I could hardly see a picture on it.

A simple chicken pastry for breakfast rather than a full hot meal. And the movie selection was dated with mainly B-grade or older films.

Even though I saw bad reviews I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it out. I booked online through Orbitz and my reservations never made it into the Frontier online system. I could not access my info so I had to use their 800 number for dealings. I paid $40 to upgrade my seat selection and another $20 for my checked bag at check-in. The only part of their online system that worked was online check-in but I had to try twice before it actually worked. At my departure I waited 45 minutes to drop my bag. The customer service was unorganized and rude. Why check and pay ahead of time if I still have to stand in the same line as those who haven't? At the departure gate it got worse. The screen displayed the flight information and they announced boarding so I naturally proceeded to the line. I was zone 1 and when the agent scanned my boarding pass he abruptly informed me that this was not my flight. It was in fact a delayed flight that was supposed to already be in the air. The screen continued to show my flight info and half the people in line were misinformed about where the plane was actually going. We were told that our plane was at the airport and would arrive at the gate once this plane had left. Meanwhile our captain co-pilot and flight attendants were also sitting in the waiting area and had no clue where the plane was. They were laughing and joking (rather loudly) about the delayed status and disorganization of the airline. Everything was very unprofessional.

When arriving at the airport I lined up in a huge queue in order to check-in there was only 1 check-in desk open. It took about an hour until I finally was checked-in. I do not recommend this airline as the customer service is rather poor the seat space is tiny and the aircraft didn't seem to be well-maintained because an air vent fell off the ceiling when landing.

Seat was adequately comfortable however the legroom was limited it would be a bit uncomfortable on a longer flight. Crew were especially good on this flight very welcoming and helpful. Didn't purchase any food onboard or entertainment onboard - no need to spend the extra $$ on a short flight. Arrived early. JQ793 - 18th Jan 2014. Aircraft A320 VH-VQQ. Seat: 28F.

In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise.

The in-flight entertainment is ok but not spectacular being too limited in content for long haul. Emirates are better in this context. Abu Dhabi is not one of the better airports to change through and isn't well organised. Each time involved a bus trip to the aircraft.

Because of this I reserved and paid extra for one of the extra-legroom seats on the emergency door seat 18F to be exact. Air Canada Rouge happily accepted my money and emitted the corresponding receipt but on obtaining my boarding pass I discovered I had been reassigned to 15A which on boarding the plane I discovered was a normal ""meat packer"" seat while someone else had been given 18F. It turns out that their business practice is to sell those seats to anyone but they only actually assign them to passengers at the check-in counter. To avoid a repeat we showed up for our return flight 10 minutes before the check-in counter opened. We were first in line yet my reserved and paid for extra-legroom seat had already been assigned to someone else. This is shoddy way to do business. I can understand that seats on the emergency aisle should only be assigned to passengers who will be able to help if they are called upon to operate the emergency door (something which I am perfectly able to do) and therefore should only be assigned at check-in but that being the case why allow someone to pay for and reserve one in advance when the reality is that they are assigned on a first come first serve basis by the staff at the check-in counter?",NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

In 5 years the process has not changed no kiosk confusing check in as counters are shared with other airlines. My flight was late getting into Vancouver. We all had to line up to get reassigned to other flights. They seemed completely bewildered and disorganized. There were 4 counters for check in. There was a gentleman who was asking people where they were going and several of us found ourselves in the wrong line. Check in was slow and tedious. Waited in line for over 1.5 hours to be asked to stand to the side. For some reason I was not already rebooked on another flight. The co-ordinator did give me food vouchers so added points for that. The flight attendants on all flights were excellent so points for that. The check in counter at HI took off points as they seemed confused.

Food and drinks were high standard as usual. Main issues: seat was comfortable enough but lacks the essential for a business class seat: horizontal lie-flat. More privacy would be appreciated as well and there is not enough personal storage room. The cabin was brand new and features the new 2-2-2 seats plan far more pleasant than the 777 2-3-2 configuration. Use of the inflight entertainment system is not really easy and it takes time to navigate through categories and pick a movie. Options are nonetheless plentiful with a good selection of English and French-speaking blockbusters. The Qantas lounge in HKG is definitely not up to the usual AF service in the company lounges around the world. AF should definitely find another partner to accommodate its priority passengers.

PER- CBR: The return trip used a different plane. IFE was from the top panel rather than individual AVOD.

Flew from Manchester to Izmir over 4 hours. You can get away with this sardine container for short haul but is inappropriate for longer flights.

In order to get to the Big Island the same day in the hope of still being able to utilize the condo we rented I quickly ran over to the Hawaiian Airlines terminal.

So I grabbed that flight changed my rental car from the Kona airport to Hilo and then had to retrieve my bags from Go and get them onto that flight. Hawaiian Airlines was great and everything went very smoothly. But then I had to retrieve a rental car in Hilo and drive over two hours to get to my condo. Like I said - what a mess.

Seats were comfortable space was good and the stewards were friendly accommodating and provided excellent service. Individual entertainment screens were located at each seat. Each passenger selected their own mode of entertainment (movies music games or following the flight via a map). Both English and Spanish was offered. Earphones were provided when boarding the plane. Blankets and pillows were waiting on each seat. Very comfortable with a thumbs up for Copa for my 1st experience with them. Returning to the States was a nightmare. Copa used very old outdated aircraft. They needed extensive cosmetic repairs. The flight leaving Costa Rica at least had pleasant stewards. Stewards flying from Panama to the States were not. They did not assist to keep the plane clean on a 6.5 hour flight. If garbage found its way into the aisle they stepped over it each time it was encountered. By the end of the flight the floor was overcome by trash including the bathroom floors. They spoke and understood English when it behoved them to do so. One entertainment screen existed every 3-4 seats. Three movies were shown all in Spanish and all without English subtitles. Earphones were passed out after the first movie started. There was not enough blankets or pillows for the number of passengers. Very uncomfortable environment for a 6.5 hour flight.

We did our homework ahead of time reviewing bag weight limitations seat assignments and we did come prepared with our boarding passes printed. All of these instructions are available to you when you purchase your ticket online. There are no hidden surprises as long as you read and go through all the instructions when booking your flight. Once we boarded the plane we were once again greeted by the attendants and they were very well dressed and represented by Spirit in a professional manner. We received professional service on the plane by the staff. On our return flight we received the same treatment as our first flights. Our savings were $ 350.00 per person by using Spirit Airlines. Our group had a total of 27 people flying together and that added up very quickly to a huge savings. I'm not sure where all the negatives come from since our group experience was very well received by Spirit Airlines. My suggestion to those reading reviews and thinking about booking with Spirit is when you are booking your ticket is to take the extra time and read thoroughly through all the instructions and options and you will have no problems once you get to the airport because you will be prepared as we were.,NA,NA,NA,NA,10,3,5,3,1,NA,NA,5,1

allegiant-air,/airline-reviews/allegiant-air,Allegiant Air customer review,C Lee,United States,2014-07-15,"Oakland CA to Provo Utah. Initially I was very excited to use this airline as I saw that the price for the trip was much less expensive than the usual commercial airlines flying into SLC. However I was disappointed as I continued the checking process and realized that I had to pay additional money for seats and for carry-on luggage. I then realized the total cost is not that significantly cheaper than Delta or another big airline. However I bought my tickets only 3 weeks in advance and may have saved significant money if I had purchased the tickets much earlier. I arrived to OAK 2.5 hours early in case there were any problems. Security clearance was a breeze. I am happy to say that there were no issues with delays or cancellations on this leg of the trip. The service was very good. Yes all beverages/snacks must be purchased but it is only a 1.5 hr flight and really who needs to drink/eat in that time. I can see why customers complained about the comfort of the seats as the backs are very thin and do not give a lot of cushion support. Anyway I had paid for a first row seat and I'm glad I did as I could easily get off the plane without waiting. I'm happy to say that I had no problems with my flight but I do wish the total price of the trip was much more of a ""deal"" than what I got in reality.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,0,0,NA,NA,3,1

Flights were on time baggage arrived perfectly the colors and atmosphere on the plane was bright and cheery. I flew economy so like any other airlines you get what you pay for as far as cabin space however in all other respects Aeroflot was superior. Cabin crew were professional and polite food was quite good. Entertainment was superb with 100's of great movies and shows to choose from as well as games wifi charging stations and all the works! I travelled with my children 4 and 7 and had no trouble keeping them busy for 12 hours. Children's meals can be pre-ordered and were well thought out although my picky ones didn't eat them. Kids got tons of goodies from the staff. The value was great and I will fly with them again in the future. My only complaint were the tiny and rather dirty bathrooms.

Aircraft apparently dates to 1990 but was in pretty good condition although the seat back in front of me was torn. I paid for extra legroom which wasn't too expensive and was definitely worth it as Monarch manage to squeeze 352 into this aircraft apparently. Seat width could have been better but it was slightly squeezed in Row 2 as the seat tray was folded into the arm rest. Staff were efficient and polite which was impressive given there were an awful lot of people to deal with. I should have booked food in advance as you can only buy sandwiches on board. Monarch say you can book a meal up to 24 hours before your flight but not if the flight is part of a package holiday you can't  at least not if it's Saturday or Sunday as the call centre staff pack up on Friday afternoons. Sandwiches were pretty poor and had I not been running late I would have bought something at the airport. No inflight entertainment but on a 2.5 flight that's not a problem for me. All in all a pretty good experience. Punctual and professional and a generous baggage allowance of 20kgs if you needed it. Throw in the classic Airbus A300 which is not seen in Europe anymore at least not in passenger airlines and I was more than satisfied.,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,3,5,2,0,NA,NA,4,1

The seat was comfortable and well designed the crew were attentive friendly and professional the catering was delicious and the entertainment was of good quality and fairly good choice. I can completely see why this product receives such rave reviews from most passengers. My only real complaint is the ridiculously limited baggage allowance. 30kg total is barely acceptable on economy class but for business is it a disgrace.

The only reason we take Allegiant is because we live near Bellingham and Palm Springs and they have direct flights. The seats don't recline and couldn't be much closer and they charge extra for everything. But today on the flight from KBLI to KPSP was really miserable the plane left an hour late but worse because the floor and my feet were freezing the entire time we sat on the tarmac and during the entire 2.5 hour flight.

avianca,/airline-reviews/avianca,Avianca customer review,Hans Roloff,Germany,2012-01-24,Four flight segments all in Y-class two pax senior age. MIA-BOG and BOG-SCL. We picked them because of convenient departure times out of MIA and due to a considerable price difference compared to LAN Chile. All 4 flights - domestic and international - were in almost new Airbus A320 and A330 planes thus impressively clean. Departure procedures at MIA and BOG international airports were chaotic the domestic terminal in BOG plus the terminals in Cartagena and Santa Marta are acceptable. Inflight service is ok for the domestic part - the service on international flights is probably the worst we have ever experienced. The only thing they care about is selling onboard duty free items. If you want to save money take Avianca into consideration their planes will still be pretty new in 2012 - if you want/need more quality and service you have to pay the higher fares of LAN!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,0

Boarding relatively painless performed according to row from back to front after Elite status and Business class passengers. Plane was a pristine Airbus A330 Enhanced wide body with 2-4-2 configuration. Seat pitch generous for economy and seemed to afford an extra 1-2 inches of leg room. Inflight entertainment was state of the art for Economy class with a USB outlet and a decent variety of film music and gaming options. Operational immediately upon taking my seat. A novelty at least for me was the exterior camera that allowed views of take-off and landing. Seats were comfortable with fully adjustable headrests. Economy meal was actually quite tasty with pasta or chicken options. A full selection of beverages including wine were served at no extra charge. Apart from the plastic cutlery and plates the meal rivalled some I have been served in Business or domestic First class cabins. Crew professional polite and efficient with no surliness.

The truth is the Juneyao employee in Shanghai was much more polite and they changed my flight with a different company (China Eastern which I recommend never had problems with them) and no additional charges but I got to Qingdao with more than 6 hours of delay (that is later than midnight).

Entertainment was old drop down TV but that wasn't a problem as slept and read. Food and beverages plentiful and served at regular intervals on our 11 hr flight. If flying with them they are very strict on stored and cabin luggage weight which we think is great as people bring on far too much cabin luggage. We witnessed many people having to re-pack or pay the excess fee which is very expensive. This problem is well documented on reviews so we were well aware of this before we booked with Condor so had no problems at all. Condor was very helpful with obtaining our Visa for Cuba which we purchased at their counter at check-in time. Check-in desk was easy to find at the Frankfurt airport after arriving by train.

These seats are nothing like the nice new modular units in their B777-300ER aircraft. The video remote control intrudes into the 18"" wide seats making them clamp-like seats.

There were only five passengers that day in Business Class on this flight and I had the single row area behind First Class to myself. The tray table is too low when the seat is even slightly reclined. These are old cradle seats not flatbeds.

Very smooth flight, we were told that the flexible wings smooth out almost all but the worst turbulence. What excuse will the crew now use to get a break? Food was a choice of Shepherds Pie, Curry or vegetarian. The Shepherds Pie was tasty but was tiny, a very thin layer of minced lamb covered by a very thin layer of potato. The blackberry sponge had sunk at one side and was cold and clammy. Seats were the biggest problem. Yes they are wider than economy and have 38"" pitch, but the one in front still reclines into your face and if that person reclines fully then your entertainment screen does not hinge enough to allow you to watch it without you also reclining your seat. Some airlines now have seats were your seat base slides forward so you recline within you own space. They even supply small packets of mints giving you tips on how to ""surreptitiously"" recline your seat without making it too obvious.

The cabin luggage dimensions are treated extremely strictly - 3 cm more depth at the bottom of my trolley suitcase was the reason for forcing me to check it in. But what really crossed my red line was the minimum distance between the seats on the flight from Glasgow Prestwick to Warsaw - taller people had no room for their legs only the really slim ones could open their tables in full and any movement out of/back onto the seat was a fight.

We tried to go to Hong Kong but had to return to Helsinki airport due to a faulty hydraulic pump. I guess this is something that can happen. However having to sit in a very hot airplane for a whole night before being told that the flight is cancelled is not very pleasant. Neither is the treatment from the ground staff more or less ignoring everyone but the business class passengers. We eventually got some help and were rebooked for a flight the next day. The flight back home was on time but the plane was very old with an outdated entertainment system and very cramped seats.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,S Bramwell,United Kingdom,2014-10-05,NCL-LHR-LAX / LAS-LHR-NCL. NCL-LHR A320. Comfortable enough for only a 1hr flight. Crew did a great job serving a full flight in such a short space of time. Overhead bins were full and was a bit tricky finding space. Some passengers had put very small bags overhead and not under seats and refused to take them down it did seem people have more carry-on than allowed. Took off on time and arrived early but this meant no stand available for 15mins. LHR-LAX on A380. Paid to get two economy seats on the upper deck together and was worth the money as no stranger next to us no moving for loo breaks etc. Aircraft excellent IFE great (games were good moving maps etc also great) crew superb food was nice (first meal very good!) and the ice lollies were a great touch but did think an extra drinks service would have been good. We were close to a galley so easy enough to go and ask for drinks which we did two/three times. Seat was good but equal space to the earlier A320. Extra bin beside seat was useful. The arm rest doesn't go all the way up which was a bit of a pain. Take off delayed by a fault on the airbridge but arrived on time - takes a while to get off due to number of people. LAS-LHR on a B747. Older aircraft and compared to the brand new A380 it showed Again paid to get two seats together which was worth it. Seat ok but not as comfortable as previous flights food was ok IFE was ok but my PTV was off centre so had to watch sideways. Overall just an ok flight. Crew were friendly and didn't hide away all night which normally happens on late flights with other carriers. My only problem was the arm rest didn't go up and when the seat in front of me reclined I couldn't get out. LHR-NCL on a A319.

Flight slightly delayed and I got bitten by the Changi Airport habit of misinforming people of the start of boarding. Boarding started 30 minutes later than the flashing signs indicated. Boarding was a little bit chaotic and started before an announcement was made. As a Star Alliance Gold member I like being able to board earlier than other passengers. Got a choice of newspapers. Luckily headphones were handed out during the long wait for departure and the entertainment system worked the whole time during landing and take-off. We got the choice between fish-rice and chicken-noodles. I went with the noodles. Easily the best dish I've eaten on a flight (business or economy). A simple dish yes but excellent executed. Service was good with the only remark that the second offering of drinks came from behind and took me and other passengers by surprise. The stewardess was apparently in a hurry. If you ask people if they want another drink please wait for an answer and try not to break the 100m sprint record. But this was the only remark for an otherwise very pleasant flight.

The airline offers excellent value for money although the planes I flew on were a little old and tired looking and the electrics in the seats and headsets were faulty. The quality of the staff were outstanding (business class) and very well groomed. Seats were lay flat beds and very comfortable although a little extra leg room for those over 6' would be a bonus. Flights were on time and ground staff were friendly and helpful. The entertainment system was OK but a very annoying feature was the car ads which play at the beginning of every show and even if you change your mind and don't wish to watch a show that you have started watching you have to watch the ads again for a new selection.

Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,2,5,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

The food is nothing to write home about but the option of Korean dishes is welcome. The entertainment selection is decent. The seats are very close together and the space is cramped. The only good seats are in the back of the plane but it is hard to reserve those. In previous years once one booked a ticket it was possible to call the airline and book the seats. Now they cancelled this option and one can only select seats 30 days in advance. They also tend to overheat the planes so plan to take your layers off after you board.

The cabin attendants a bunch of young women better groomed then Iberia classic but less 'cool' and professional. The English announcements were so bad that words can't describe. How can this airline be part of an airline alliance such as one world. The worst on this flight was the sound that played each time they made a public announcement.

With a layout of 3-3-3 there was no room when seated I had to be bolt upright as my elbows would have no room.

There were no free drinks or snacks but most of the time there was a trolley in the way selling scratchcards or duty free. Just a painfully uncomfortable flight. Also when we got there we were told that we were responsible for the airline departure tax on return was several stressed out staff taking cash only payments.

The flight attendants were cheerful especially on the international flights and were very attentive to detail and answered the call button almost immediately which made the journey much more pleasant. A few times I saw flight attendants cleaning the toilets which passengers don't normally get to see on other airlines. Both international flights were red-eye but I got a fair bit of sleep which refreshed me coming into Shanghai and being quite tall (185cm) I found the seat pitch very good. However the meals were a bit meagre and not up to the standard of for example Qantas. Also they need to improve on in-flight entertainment as on half of the flights it was the drop-down TV and the other half was personal TV.

Between baggage fees and airfare my ticket cost more than if I'd flown Lufthansa. I flew Air Baltic from VNO to LGW via RIX. The people on the Vilnius-Riga leg were friendly enough but the system for check in was ridiculous. I was traveling on a business class ticket which meant I was allowed 2 pieces of hand luggage even according to the sign at check-in. Yet the woman insisted that I was only permitted one. I also knew I might have to pay for my checked bags. Fine but simply printing my boarding passes took roughly 35 minutes from the time I got to the counter. The woman at check in had to call someone else to get prices even though I knew it was â¬40 per bag. Then another woman had to come down to take my payment. She came but then had to leave before taking my payment. I was asked to wait for her to come back. I finally got my boarding passes but was still waiting to pay. After waiting for about 15 minutes they told me to go up to the ticketing office to pay there. So I went upstairs and stood in line for another 45 minutes. There was only one woman working. I felt bad for her but she was incredibly slow. There was no priority given to large number of people who had to pay and still get through security. Instead she handled lengthy non-time sensitive matters first. By the time I made it out of the ticketing office the security line was horrendously backed up.

korean-air,/airline-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air customer review,D Brown,United States,2014-05-23,SFO-ICN-PEK XIY-ICN-LAX. Due to the many changes in itinerary aircraft equipment and seat assignments made by the airline I had 45 mins minimum connection time in Seoul which did work barely as the flight was on time and the connecting passengers were escorted from the arrival to the departure gate. The return leg departure time for the flight from Xi'an to Seoul was brought forward without previous announcement (although this is part of their terms of service). I had previously been obliged to change my itinerary to return to LAX instead of SFO when this flight had originally been re-scheduled to depart later. Now I find with the revised earlier departure that I could have taken the SFO flight after all and made my connection back to SFO. I did get a free pass though for the Prestige Lounge for the 3.5 hour layover. The return flight to LAX was on a packed A380 and the cabin staff were completely disorganized rushing individual meals from one end of the main cabin to the other. The meals were okay but not served up to the standard of their competitor Asiana Airlines. The traditional decorum of the cabin staff wore thin dealing with a huge Chinese tour group who had probably never flown before. The leg room is restricted by almost 2 inches due to the thick airline sales catalogues that they cram into the seat pockets. I was further delayed at immigration since the airline somehow had omitted to tell the US authorities about the changes in flight numbers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,3,3,4,NA,NA,4,0

Supposed to depart at 09.30 hrs I awoke at 05.30 hrs to find an SMS stating the flight was delayed 1 hr. Got to the airport and checked in and went through security by 08.00 hrs and waited until 09.30 only to be told flight was again delayed. Come midday again told flight would be delayed to 13.30 hrs. Given a $10 voucher for lunch which doesn't even buy a snack at airport prices. Staff finally opened the gate at 12.50 hrs with a mad scramble to board. Once on board we waited another 45 mins for a 2nd engineer to be found to sign off on the repair. Finally departed at 13.30 hrs and arrived at 17.45 in Denpasar.

It has been 5 years since I flew domestically although I still fly internationally a lot. The planes were very clean and comfortable. FA's were excellent although perhaps lacking a lot of the spark they used to have. Flights were both on time and very efficient. What shocked me was the food offering. Since when did flying Qantas become a no frills airline in terms of food. Served in cardboard boxes the food was uninspired. Breakfast was a hard cold cake/bread type of ""thing"" along with yoghurt and granola. The coffee was dreadful. Dinner was a cold chicken and potato salad. What shocked me was that you used to get a proper breakfast and dinner hot and quite tasty for airline food. The food was delivered so quickly and taken away so quickly it was like being in a cheap cafeteria. While Sydney Airport is immaculate and very well presented Melbourne Airport was dirty and looking very worn. Sydney Airport was renovated for the Olympics and is well maintained and updated. Melbourne looks like it did 10 years ago and like it hadn't been touched in 10 years especially in terms of maintenance.

finnair,/airline-reviews/finnair,Finnair customer review,O Schulz,United Arab Emirates,2015-02-06,I flew DXB-HEL-RVN and return 23-26 Jan. Outbound DXB-HEL was almost 2 hrs delayed but not due to AY's fault. Most of that delay was spent on-board an A321 extending the stay on this inappropriate aircraft for such a flight from 6 to almost 8 hrs. 8 hours on an aircraft AY uses for domestic flights in the very same seat configuration. Luckily I had 2 empty seats next to me making things reasonably comfortable since the leg space is ridiculous. The 1 round of juices served whilst waiting on the DXB tarmac were the last free cold drinks served ever since even the water had to be paid for! On a 6 hour flight with a supposed 4* airline they charge for water unbelievable! Despite my delay into HEL I made my connection for the 1 hr flight to RVN on an A320 with the same poor leg space (but adequate for such a short hop) and on this domestic flight they served free water and berry juice same on the return. I didn't look forward to the return HEL-DXB since I already figured out it would be a full flight. Already expecting the worst in discomfort and catering I bought sandwiches and water at HEL for almost EUR 20.00 but the reality exceeded my fears. Once again it was the A321 and it was full of Finnish holiday makers although it was sold as a scheduled flight. The only free drinks were the tea/coffee after the meal. Wine was sold at EUR 6.00 for tiny bottles of less than 200ml and what they called lunch was a farce in size and disgusting both in terms of looks and taste. However the worst of all was the ridiculous leg space especially sitting in an aisle seat close to the only 2 toilets at the back of the aircraft. All except 8 business class (if one can even call it that) passengers had access to 2 toilets on a 6 hour flight with an almost permanent queue in the aisle of up to a dozen chatting people. I take around 100 flights a year on various airlines but HEL-DXB must have been the very worst one over the last 10 years. I don't mind flying low cost at least I know what to expect or rather 'not' to expect given the price but an airline like AY should be ashamed of operating the DXB route in this disgraceful manner and with such inappropriate aircraft.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,3,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

Wonderful experience compare to airlines in/around Indian sub-continent. Apart from an hour delay (unavoidable technical glitch) the A320 flight experience was superb and commendable. Wish to congratulate the Crews for their presentable personable manner in which they served the passengers (a mixture of business class passengers - I mean some are freely upgraded from Economy) but all received that warm welcome and sincere services. The FA's keep smiling and all requests are met and well attended too the food was delicious and in good quantity with plenty of softies and drinks served without hesitation. The minor lags to point out is no IFE and seat non-reclining to a half bed to keep up with modern luxury of travelling but its ok for a four hour trip. Even the toilets were kept clean and full of amenities stored and presented a personal amenity kit to Business Class passengers.

The seats we were given were the middle seats no 15 and my son and I discovered that there was a USB charger. And because I prepared for our trip we were armed with our ipads complete with the apps. We also noticed that our seats had bigger leg room unfortunately the ones behind us had less. Why this is I don't know. Did we pay a bit more so that we were afforded this comfort? We were also assigned no 13 seats on our return flight so we were anticipating a comfortable ride but we were fortunately upgraded to premium Rouge so it was even so much better! Can't explain this either but I'm not complaining! Food was not the best but reasonable the premium rouge was not that much better but was ok. Drinks were constantly offered in our outbound journey no alcohol though. In premium alcohol was free but it was the cheap kind. Nothing different from what other airlines offer. Air hostesses and stewards friendly and helpful the toilets were relatively clean so nothing to complain about really! Check in both ways were easy boarding was ok. The plane was late 1 hr coming back but we had a 6 hr wait for our connection so no worries there! I'll fly Rouge anytime but maybe pay the high(ish) fare?,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

On all other flights the trays were presented in their entirety with offers of a first glass of wine along with tea or coffee - this on an 11 hour daytime flight. Still the cost was cheap and much lower than other airlines.

srilankan-airlines,/airline-reviews/srilankan-airlines,SriLankan Airlines customer review,Juergen Weich,Germany,2013-03-19,Return flight FRA-CMB-BKK-CMB-FRA in Business. Booking process very smooth online was looking forward to their new business class at least on part of flights but all 4 flights were in the old business class. Nevertheless it was a surprisingly good experience. Priority check-in/priority lane on security check and boarding worked well on all 4 flights warm greeting from crew all flights were on schedule. In FRA they use the One World lounge in Terminal 2 ok but nothing special. Serendib lounge in CMB is easy to find (small airport) and only a few steps from/to the gate what is very convenient compared to some other airports. Not the newest but excellent food service drink selection and Internet access working well. Lounge in BKK on flight back was ok but again nothing special. Flight experience basically the same on all 4 flights older business seats that do not recline flat but are still very comfortable. Inflight entertainment is outdated. What makes the difference is the friendliness of the cabin crew. Food and drinks were very good as well. The downgrade is due to the old seating and no IFE although that was not bothering my very good experience flying with them but for others it might be an issue. Highly recommended will fly with them again on next occasion.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,5,1,NA,NA,5,1

They were far superior to Qantas. While selling as a LAN business class package there are actually no business seats for flying within Argentina or Chile so business is only for the International component. Flight attendants generally did their job very well and were friendly. The pisco sours from Lan were the nicest I had and food was always of good quality. The problem and this is a big one is with the scheduling. LAN schedules daily flights Santiago to Auckland but seem to cancel them quite easily. Our flight on the 21st March was cancelled and I believe a second flight was also cancelled that week. Obviously this causes major inconvenience and although we had plenty of notice we still had nothing else to do but spend time in the Santiago Airport holiday Inn. Some of the Argentine regional airports could have used a third check-in counter going (El Calafate Ushuaia) as there were long queues.

There were toilets but - the economy ones in front of the business toilet where there were always several people waiting. We were seated in the almost the last business class row economy passengers got their food served earlier than we did. Not all dishes were available for our row. A problem with the electric's caused a delay of approx. 40 min but was handled properly. Entertainment system was quite old-fashioned compared to other airlines only a small selection of movies was offered. The overview-map did not work at all. Headsets were not really noise-reduction ones. Seat was slide-version. Food I found satisfying. Personnel very nice and supportive.

On the ICN-JFK leg dinner is served after take off and nothing else for 11 hrs. If you ask you can get a bag of potato chips. Leg room is ok on the 777 but really didn't feel like 34 inches and width is narrow. AVOD works well but the choices are limited. The 777 is also poorly designed without enough toilets so there is always a line for the two in the centre. The seat belt sign was only partially enforced and even during heavy turbulence when the crew was told to be seated there was still people walking around. Upon landing at JFK no fewer than four people got out of their seats during taxiing and had to be told to sit down. The A330 was more comfortable particularly from HAN-ICN which was completely empty and everyone had their own row.

I gave a glare to the cabin crew only to receive a tut from them. Food was ok but not worth paying for. Highlight of the flight was when we landed back at Gatwick the cabin crew said the usual 'thank you for flying Thomas Cook we hope to see you again in the future' and then everyone in the plane shouted together 'As If.',NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,1,3,1,NA,NA,2,0

Being bumped from the allocated seat I had purchased 6 weeks before my flight. I took my 86 year old mother for a family holiday. Because she is frail I am 190 cm tall and my wife needs to care for my 8 year old son we delayed our holiday for several days in order to secure the 3 aisle seats we needed. Can you imagine the humiliation I suffered in front of my mother and other passengers when after we had taken our seats the ground staff came into the cabin and demanded I move to a middle seat or else the plane's takeoff would be delayed. In order to avoid a fuss my mother agreed to move to the middle seat. However as soon as the meal service ended the passenger who demanded my aisle seat fully reclined the two seats in front of my mother so his 3yr old and 6 yr old daughters could relax. Because the armrests on the StarClass seats are fixed in position mum was trapped in her seat until the next meal service 7 hours later! To be fair the aircrew were great and handled this unpleasant situation very well. I do not understand how an airline can advertise that you can pay for seat allocation and then not honour the terms of their contract. Let alone humiliating myself and making my mother very uncomfortable during the flight. Unfortunately because of the limited number of StarClass seats on these long haul flights we were unable to fly StarClass on the return leg or rent an ipad to entertain my son because they only load 47 units on long haul flights from Honolulu even during school holidays.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,1,4,2,NA,NA,3,0

My complaint concerns insufficient overhead luggage space. As you know the passengers board from the back of the plane. I was in aisle #23 about mid-way on the plane. Yet by the time I boarded all the overhead space was taken. This is due to the incompetence of airline personnel who routinely allow people to take luggage on the plane that clearly exceeds the size limits. I flagged down a flight attendant and insisted that she find room for my luggage.

Finally everyone was processed and flight on time 12.50 to Gatwick confirmed. 12.30 arrived and we were told boarding on time proceed to gate 26. By now there were rumours the flight would not take off from Venice till 4pm. Gate 26 showed delay till 1.15 questions asked of Monarch reps and were told French air traffic control problems so new take off time 3pm. Manchester flight just the same. We were told no person from Monarch was in the airport. Vouchers given out for drink and snack but with huge numbers affected cafe could not cope. Take off time now 4pm. 3.30pm told to board at last. Got onboard at 3.45pm then told by captain we would take off shortly as there was a dispute of Italian workers which would end at 4.30pm. 5pm we finally took off staff would not honour the vouchers of the people who had not been able to redeem them in Venice. The captain then informed passengers that they knew of this strike at 6am as did most of the world.

The entertainment had a terrific selection of movies and music. If you are a tall person you are better off purchasing the emergency exit seats as they were so much more comfortable for someone 6'. Connection in Moscow which I was a bit fearful of was actually a very nice experience. They accepted US dollars. Most sales people spoke some English. Free wifi in coffee shops. The cleanest airport I have ever been to with janitors cleaning the toilets constantly wiping down all chrome pillars in hallways. Sparkling clean. Connections were smooth where my check in luggage went straight to my destination without having to recheck.

We told the lady working there and she said that you have seats and you should be happy. I have children and they were seated in different parts of the plane. Eventually we began to argue with the worker because they ignored us and we had to beg with another for our assigned seats. Once again the plane and food were fine but the blankets were dirty and smelt terrible.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,3,1,3,2,NA,NA,3,0

Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean.

It was suppose to take 18, or so. My confirmed booked tickets, for my wife and I had two transfers. One in Dallas and one in London. In the end it was 3. Our plane to Heathrow was late and we missed our transfer, so when we got off our plane at Heathrow an American employee gave us new transfer tickets and told us to hurry to our next gate to catch it. So we ran to the next gate which took 30 minutes (Heathrow). When we got there my wife looked at the tickets and the layover was 4 hours. So why did the employee have us run? Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place? They work with British Airways to get customers to Pisa! Since we got back I contacted American about this issue, they sent us a voucher for $200 for a luggage mess up on the way home.

Second time using this Little Red offshoot of Virgin and extremely happy to have received the same fantastic service I received the first time. Inflight service was the usual Little Red complimentary offer and was again nice to be offered a Tiger Beer and Tyrell Crisps which was part of the joy last time - the additional round of Love Hearts distributed was a nice touch too! Staff on both outbound and inbound flights friendly and attentive outbound my seat had been changed from the seats I pre-selected online flight wasn't full however and staff were happy for me to move to another empty row by a window. Inbound flight was on an Aer Lingus branded plane substituted for a faulty VS one which was fine although that plane did look a bit tired - I think if anything Aer Lingus should learn a thing or too from running this service on behalf of Virgin and the polish and joy that they manage to pull off - if they applied it to their own service I think they would be to an industry leading product especially by European airline standards which have lacked somewhat in comparison to their Middle- Eastern and East Asian counterparts. Once again however Aer Lingus staff should given a massive pat on the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic - Purser on my Inbound flight was the same gentlemen as the last time I went to Edinburgh and his enthusiasm and attentiveness should be commended. I am still not enamoured by Heathrow but do appreciate the improved Terminal 2 and on this occasion it wasn't such a bad experience due to it being particularly a quiet time during the day. Virgin however should be proud of the service they are delivering here though will be sad to see this end in September 2015 it is a real shame.

Cathay staff all over the place and did not direct passengers to correct queues especially after call to gate was issued late. Design of Hong Kong Airport doesn't help as queue snaked all the way to the next gate (and thankfully that gate was not open otherwise it would have been a complete mess). Flight departed 20 minutes late. I think Cathay's on ground service at their hub can be so much better if there's better co-ordination between Cathay and HKIA. Anyway once on board the service was much better. Attentive cabin crew served drinks promptly after takeoff and decent early dinner was served one hour into the flight.

However travelling from San Diego on April 20 we were concerned with the lack of communication about gate location. Since we printed the boarding passes the night before we expected no firm boarding gate at that time. When we arrived at the airport without checked in baggage we went directly through security as we usually do. However past security on the airport monitors there was no reference to our flight at all. All other airlines had the gate and time of departure clearly listed. We walked the airports 40 plus gates looking for any indication of which gate we should depart from. We then asked airport staff and they could only suggest we find an Allegiant agent which we could not. Again all other airlines were clearly provided with gate and departure time but not Allegiant. Finally we called Allegiant customer service and were on hold for 30 minutes. The person we finally talked to was after some delay was able to provide a preliminary gate assignment but suggested it might change. When we finally did find it even the monitor at the gate indicated gate closed. Rather than relaxing before our flight the time past security was quite stressful and at time we wondered whether we were at the right terminal. Communication is very important to passengers. All it would likely taken was a quick call the airport staff to get the monitor situation corrected. We will fly Allegiant again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,3,0,0,NA,NA,4,1

Nice flight but seats very basic and only really bearable for a short flight (I wouldn't go to Turkey or Tenerife with them but Rome was fine). Decent leg room though. Basic buy-on-board service (which I didn't utilise) was as standard for a low cost carrier; prices weren't too bad.

The good experience ended there. Punctuality reared it's ugly head once more. I've recorded this repeatedly. Departure was delayed 45 minutes. Not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly I can pretty much count on it. It's a shame BA can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. Once on board BA is like a tale of two airlines. Some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. Possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. But whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. When we landed at Newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule!

We were fed twice on each 12 hour leg of the journey. We were also offered plenty of drinks and were given snacks by the cabin crew who were all Chinese polite and spoke good English. My only disappointment on the way out was that my entertainment screen was broken but instead of asking to be moved I just shared my boyfriend's screen as there were two headphone sockets. There was plenty of choice of new classic Asian etc movies music games and so on to keep us occupied. In comparison to other long haul flights I've taken the seat belt signs did go on quite a bit due to mild turbulence but I appreciate being safe than sorry! Lastly the toilets were fine and clean the connecting flights were fine (received another meal then) and the ground crew were helpful at Guangzhou.

The problems started when I had to catch my connecting flight to Auckland - operated by JetStar - and what a difference! Middle of the night flight and no pillow or blanket no seats where one could even attempt to sleep on as they do not have head rests that would keep the head where it is - no food either (unless one pays for it and then it's only sandwiches or crisps) - On my online tickets it says by meals (Qantas) - ""we offer a wide variety of food"" - nothing!

kam-air,/airline-reviews/kam-air,Kam Air customer review,Rex Frummell,NA,2007-05-04,Have flown Kam Air and Ariana Airlines for years and notice very little difference between the two in regard to their poor customer service tendency to cancel or delay flights without notifying customers leaving hours earlier than scheduled or making unexpected stops in random destinations (like Tehran on a flight from Kabul to Istanbul recently). Most recently was kept waiting in terminal at Kabul for 9.5 hours to finally leave for Istanbul only to then make a stop in Tehran that was unexpected even for the Iranian officials that boarded the plane on the tarmac asking the flight crew why they had stopped there. The flight attendants give very little customer service particularly to those in business class (unless you are paying for just the extra space dont bother wasting the money) and usually spend most of their time applying makeup or talking to one another while they make each other drinks (but neglect their customers who are watching). Have had office staff give incorrect flight schedules to me resulting in extra days of layovers in various locations and when I complained about this to management we were openly laughed at by counter representative. It is this type of poor customer service that I had grown accustomed to from Ariana (and never cared for) but had hoped for much more from a non-government owned airline but I have been disappointed time and time again with Kam Air's lack of regard for its customers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Took off a few minutes late and the flight was uneventful for the first 2.5 hours with the exception of the worst possible seats providing no comfort and space. Did have to ask the lady in front of me to keep her seatback straight to prevent injury to my knees. The pilot came on the intercom to tell us we have a ""situation"" whereby we lost our left engine and were diverting to Denver to get it checked. He assured us the 767 could fly safely on one engine and he did a good job getting us on the ground without incident at about 9.45 local time. Met by the firetrucks on the tarmac and they checked out the engine and determined it was ok to proceed to the gate. Got to sit on the plane for an extended period without air conditioning and little information forthcoming about our situation. We were finally told another plane would be dispatched from Toronto to pick us up and get on our way to Vegas at 5.30 local time. When we finally got off the plane they gave everyone $20 worth of meal vouchers and then the waiting began. Went to the gate in plenty of time as we had a lot of it to kill. There was no representative at the gate and when we checked the departure schedule discovered that our time had been delayed to 6.30. Suddenly the departure time changed to 7.30. How long does it take a 767 to get from Toronto to Denver even considering a new crew was needed? After changing gates we were told by an announcement that the plane was on the ground and would be at the gate by 6.30. Finally things were looking up. Started boarding about 7.00 and then we sat. The crew kept walking around the plane checking seats for some unknown reason while the passengers were getting restless and looking for answers as to why we were not leaving the gate. The pilot finally came on to tell us the plane needed rebalancing - I believe there were 6 people who made other arrangements and were not continuing on this flight. Finally left Denver after 8.00 and arrived in Vegas just before 9.30. Plane arrived in Terminal 1 and our bags were in Terminal 3. Again no information given by Air Canada staff so people basically had to figure out for themselves that you have to grab a shuttle bus for a 5 minute ride to Terminal 3 and then try and find the right carousel.

While this was our first experience with Rouge having had tremendous negative feedback about the very limited leg room my husband and I decided to upgrade to preferred seating before we left on our trip. The preferred seating was better than the regular seating for sure. However while we paid $160 extra to upgrade our seats our boarding zone did not change. This meant that we boarded the aircraft last because our reservation was booked using points. When we actually did board the aircraft the overhead bins near our row were all full. It seems reasonable to me that when a person upgrades to preferred seating at an additional cost they should board right after business class passengers and before regular seating. Until Air Canada discontinues the practice of having passengers pay for their one checked bag onboard storage space will continue to be a huge problem.

Bottle of white wine was clearly open for a while the glass was taken away and after my comment about the bad taste no more wine was offered nice way of solving that problem. Transfer in YYZ was easy and good and shortly after boarding the CRJ for Nashville the plane was grounded for technical issues. Had to run to the other end of the airport to get a spare plane 2 hours later and had to wait in a small waiting room with no water or communication on what was going on.

air-china,/airline-reviews/air-china,Air China customer review,Jiyuan Zhou,China,2013-04-18,Hong Kong - Beijing - Moscow Sheremetyevo with Air China on their A321 and B777 because their more competitive price than any other airlines. Check in staff in HKG not polite due to early morning flight or maybe seeing my Chinese passport? Ground staff in PEK was polite . HKG-PEK arrived on time while PEK-SVO delays 4 hour because of waiting for transfer passenger (not sure if it is the real reason) but CA distributed foods and drinks to us with no extra cost. Compare to unfriendly cabin crew on Air China I have seen before cabin crew on these two flights were friendly and attentive with limited English ability on both segments. I found my no-lactose special meal tasteless and asked for another regular one which was tasty and good. Seat on B777 PEK-SVO is very comfortable with good recline. No IFE on both segments.

We sat in row 25 and by the time the crew made it to that row much of the food selection was sold out however the crew offered the few items left in the carts and were very accommodating. My key issue is seating space. I am 6 foot 1 inch tall and thin. As you can imagine getting into those Rouge seats was an issue and sitting in that cramp space for over 5 hours proved to be very uncomfortable. They really need to put a âwarningâ on the booking site to say that âRouge seats will not accommodate passengers over 6 feet tallâ.

royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,Daryl Schliebs,Australia,2013-02-13,The main reason for selecting Royal Brunei was the competitive price of $5000 for a business class return European flight. Being very tall I needed the legroom which I hoped their business class seats would provide. Staff really appeared to have little training in how to manage the needs of passengers on a long flight. The quality of the food when they remembered to serve it - sometimes the food was served over 2 hours into a sector - was very poor. They sometimes forgot to serve a course. When a course was served they sometimes did not serve the selection which we had previously made. The selection which we made on several legs seemed to become unavailable quite quickly. During the first sector out of Melbourne our attendant took 3 attempts to get a normal glass of water correct. The main expertise of the flight attendants was the handing out of hot towels which they did on a very regular basis. Our business class seats did not recline on 3 out of the 6 sectors - we had to change seats on 3 sectors so we could have seats which were able to fully recline. On the return leg from Europe there were some 5 seats which were marked up as being unable to be used. This meant that my wife had to accept a seat which was not able to fully recline for 3 of the return sectors. The Aircraft was also old and the quality of the entertainment was poor with most movies being pre 2005 and earlier.

It wasn't just my seat my colleagues was the same and I could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of TVs in your cabin not just a problem with mine. The tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. The table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight - it wasn't even turbulent. Power sockets on a flight originating in the UK and run by a UK airline should be UK sockets not US sockets! The food was adequate but nothing special I've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this! Furthermore my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold but frozen solid! It had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit! Finally when the Club World cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry there's none in this trolley so you can't have any.

The internal electric's were not working so our section could not turn on or off personal lights contact service crew etc and to make matters worse one light was permanently on and could not be turned off.

Service was very good as was food and general view is that this is great value for money. The planes are not that new but they seem well maintained and comfortable. My only gripe was that there were at least 3 passengers with young children and solo travellers such as myself all got asked to move around the aircraft to accomodate these passengers to have ""nicer seats"". I am usually happy to do this but one wonders why these people could not have got seats all arranged well in advance (particularly as the flight was not full).

The seat layout in Royal Laurel (biz) class is a reverse herringbone which is actually much better than a traditional herringbone configuration. At least you face into the window and not the aisle. The service was ok but sub-par for An Asian airline. I also feel that they have to do a big revamp of their branding for the greens that they use for their corporate colours is very drab!

Received lowest Group Boarding number because the gate agent said they order group number based on where you sit. Windows higher middle lower aisle lowest. But if you fly stand by you get to set in premium seats with better group number getting a better chance to have overhead space because no one wants to pay $84 just to sit closer to the front of the plane which gives you a better group number.

It was my first time on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 in upper deck economy. Boarding was quick and efficient for both sectors having it about 40 minutes before departure and with boarding queues ending quickly. Legroom was excellent (I am 170cm tall). Food on the Beijing sector was delicious however it was not served hot thus making it a little disappointing. Service was great as the crew smiled gracefully during meal service. However a crew forgot to refill my orange juice (She did not have enough orange juice so she told me she was going to get some for me but did not come). The entertainment was spectacular with tons of movies and music. However the movie tends to lag when viewed. So I settled down to listening to music instead. The seats are comfortable but the pillow is too big so I feel they should make it smaller thus having it to use lesser space. The return sector was much better. The crew were more friendly and efficient compared to the Beijing sector. My dad's luggage had some issues so he told me to board the plane first. As I boarded the plane the steward welcomed me warmly and kindly guided me to my seat also helping me to find an available container to store mine and my father's large carry on.

We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices.

Firstly cabin crew are excellent as friendly as BA on a good day although a bit less attentive. The first plane the 767 was as old as 767s tend to be. My IFE wasn't working but it was a night flight and I wasn't fussed. Plane was fine overall had the newer style overhead lockers. ADD was a bit basic. Bizarre duty free mostly very small shops. 3 flights went from the same gate but when they announced over the intercom it was impossible to hear and they seemed to send me to the wrong gate. I was the last person on the flight for the last leg! This was a 737. Brand new seats are more basic than Ryanair but otherwise it came with the interior pack and was pleasant enough for 3 hours.

It was very frustrating. We were to fly at 10.55am but after several delays we lifted off at 8.45pm. The most frustrating aspect was there was no one in authority who could tell us what was happening or when we would actually fly. It appeared that airline employees were avoiding us as they knew we were getting frustrated and they had no good information. Occasionally one of the passengers would find an airline employee who would give them information which was always contradictory and always wrong.

They gave us the meal voucher but didn't tell us that all the restaurants had closed so that was useless. When I did finally board it wasn't a 787 as it said on my ticket but an older plane that had no air conditioning was dirty with trash in the magazine holder and none of the entertainment screens worked and the food was disgusting. My return flight was also booked on a 787 but was on the same plane I flew over on. I switched to the Vegetarian meal which was pasta with spinach on top.

Check in transfer at Helsinki and baggage collection was fast since it was business class. Standard seats from LHR to HEL with the middle seat vacant. Fully flat seat from HEL to DEL (Airbus A330). Business lounge at Helsinki is very spacious. I must say the cost and staff service was good but the real problem was with the food and entertainment. In business class you expect better quality food. Though I had pre-ordered vegetarian food it was not up to the mark. I think rather than quality they give more stress on quantity. Also for entertainment only some boring old movies were available.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,3,4,2,2,NA,NA,4,1

One World Mileage Redemption Award through AA. JFK check-in was excellent and CX uses the BA First Class Lounge that has room for improvement to be more like LHR T5. Boarding was not well organized but First Class on board was outstanding as always though the menu selections aren't quite as good as a few years ago. The wines and other beverage choices were excellent. Hong Kong's CX Wing First Class Lounge was excellent and their Cabanas are great for rest and showering/bathing. The non-stop flight from HKG to CMB had the new Business Class seats while the flight back from CMB to HKG had Regional Business Class seats due to a one hour stop in BKK therefore not considered long haul. The new Business Class seat (was also on the plane from HKG-JFK) is very well designed with much storage space though the cushion is not the softest and there is an awkward angled step in the foot well floor just in front of the footrest. Meal service was good and the staff was efficient while most were friendly and helpful. All the planes were clean and the toilets were maintained well throughout the flights. I used the UL Serendib Lounge in CMB due to my OW Emerald Tier status knowing that the Araliya Lounge used by most airlines is very average.

Got it on the outgoing journey in seats 1A/B/C/D. But there was some complaints behind us as 8 people had booked extra legroom in rows 12 and 13. But the aircraft was changed since they booked and rows 12 and 13 were no longer extra legroom. I was a little concerned as I had booked those extra legroom on the return journey ! I thought it was a blip but you guessed it - the aircraft was also changed on the return journey and our seats were no longer extra legroom. There were 8 other people who were disappointed to. Now interestingly the cabin crew confirmed to us that this was not a last minute change of aircraft as it was shown on their schedule since they were issued some considerable time before. Therefore it seems obvious to me that if Easyjet can't fill a larger aircraft then they put on a smaller one and ignore those passengers who have paid for extra legroom seats which don't exist on the smaller plane. So beware booking an Easyjet flight and booking seats too far in advance because they seem to change aircraft a bit more frequently than you would think.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,2,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,0

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Rohit Thukral,United States,2013-10-25,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown.

In the 60s to Luxemburg when it was the best and cheapest way to Europe from North America. Later to Scandinavia at which point I could afford the Business Class. Occasionally in Coach when the other grades were full but I needed to get there better than SAS could provide. My last flight to Reikjavik from Toronto was hell. Only economy was available when we booked in January although our preference was for the better seats or business class. When we found our seats they were the non-reclining row ahead of the wing door and as a very tall person this was not a good sign. After about an hour into the flight the agony in my legs began. My estimate is that this particular row had a seat pitch of 29 inches as opposed to the claimed 32 which would have been ok. Having an aisle seat I stretched out but was sternly forbidden by officious attendants. I apologized for being in their way and asked about some relief from the 29 inches which was not available since the plane appeared to be sold out. What concerned me  beyond the obvious personal discomforts was the continuing attitude of the flight attendants. We are returning on our flight back tomorrow. One of our party experienced a slight injury to an ankle in Iceland and we have requested wheelchair assistance within the airport in Stockholm and Reikjavik.

Our flight on 2/5/2015 from Maui to LAX was UA417 an ancient 757-200. We paid a total of $4924.40 for two round trip tickets. Flight 417 was more like riding an old dusty city bus. Keeping in mind that we were in first class we were offered only a small bag of potato chips. That was it. We were told that there were no more snacks and we could have only one bag of chips. The flight attendants mainly sat in their jump seats the whole time just chatting or snoozing. The purser was pretty snotty when asked any questions. We had the old style seats that didn't recline much. And beyond our belief on the ongoing flight from LAX to DEN we had lay-flat beds. For a flight lasting less than two hours. We sure could have used those lay-flat beds for the over-ocean portion.

air-transat,/airline-reviews/air-transat,Air Transat customer review,Alan McIvor,United Kingdom,2014-10-22,In the past 2 years I have travelled with Air Transat 26 times. In the early days I would buy an upgrade to club at the check in and at Â£100 pounds or so it was well worth the better seat comfort which was my main concern. The food and beverage is way above the economy standard. These days I only book economy as the rate for club is much more (Â£300) plus and you are not immune from the frequent screaming brat brigade behind the curtain. Now I take pot luck and get my seat allocated at the check in. I don't think I have ever been on a flight that has left on time - always 30 mins plus late as a minimum and on one occasion we left over 2 hours late! No apology coming from the crew and some missed the ongoing connections. To be fair the staff have been overall good given the standard of some of the passengers expectations. So why do I keep using Air Transat? Simple they are the cheapest and Gatwick is much better than getting round to hideous Heathrow. My advice for what it worth is if you can manage 7 hours get fed and watered before you go. Expect screaming kids and if you are lucky you will be far enough away not to worry about and in any case get some noise cancelling headphones they help a bit! Check out the cost of club over econ and to be honest it just don't add up. Personally I wish they would give decent seats no food and water/drinks available at a cost and I would gladly pay an extra amount for that.

From the time of booking to when we flew several changes were made that negatively impacted our trip greatly. We were not notified that because we had an economy ticket our carry-on bag would be $50 a bag to take on the plane along with no food or beverage except water. Also Frontier Airlines has implemented a new policy that if your boarding pass is not checked in 45 minutes prior to your flight you are not allowed on the plane and are to be rebooked. My family was traveling in a very small airport turned in our rental car and got in line about 50 minutes before the flight. Please note that there is no one in the security line and that it would take about 10 minutes to check in and go through security at this airport. As we are standing in line it is announced that my family along with 15 others will not be allowed on the plane and that we will need to rebook. Because it is a small airport the soonest that Frontier Airlines could get us to our destination was 2.5 days later. My family rented a car drove to another airport 7 hours away paid for new tickets on another airline and got home late that evening. Frontier Airlines is known as an airline for value however booking with them cost my family an additional $1200 and left many of their patrons sitting in the airport stranded.

Frontiers Denver flight was delayed 3 hours which caused me to miss my connection to Reagan Airport so an agent booked me on a United flight from Denver to Dulles. While at the gate I was told I needed to check my luggage because it may not fit in the overhead bin although my carryon luggage met the requirements of a carry on. Once I arrived in Denver I was told by a United agent that they no longer have a contract with Frontier and I was unable to board the plane. So while I did not board the United flight my luggage was on its way to Dulles. I then had to stay over night in Denver and pay for my own hotel. When I finally made it back to Oklahoma I was told my bag was located and it would be sent to my house.

I have nothing negative to say about Cubana at all and as far as their planes the ones used for trips from Ontario to Cuba during the winter months are an Avion wet lease which are in partnership with Thompson so no worries as to who maintains and looks after the fleet of planes.

Cabin is colorful and not very trendy but the retro feeling inside is loveable. It was clean and neat. Unparalleled service started right after taking off. Do&Co Vienna restaurateurs' on board chef convert the cabin into an ultra-class restaurant above the clouds. Best cuisine I have ever had on an airplane. Cabin attendants did their best to make passengers feel great throughout the flight. Those criticized angled flat sleeper seats are not that bad not worse that of Lufthansa.

Easy connection and my son knows DFW very well and can get around pretty easily. While tracking the flight it was diverted to Charlotte. Reason was weather in DFW. Delay after delay now became a mechanical issue. So arrive DFW 2 hrs late. Needless to say he missed the connection and with Christmas there are no other seats the rest of the day until 9am the following morning. If I had not acted quickly and did some pleading with AA I was able to get him to XNA 7 hours late. So all in all AA is just nothing but a band of misfits and poor maintained aircraft.

LHR to Hong Kong leg was with Cathay and the HK to AKL leg provided by Air NZ as code share. On the whole Cathay was superior with the exception of the food which was excellent on Air NZ. Cathay business class seating provided excellent space and storage and the configuration 1x2x1 with each seat angled away from the aisle ensured privacy. This contrasted with Air NZ which had less storage and not as much privacy as seats have lower screens and are angled towards each other. The Air NZ lie flat bed with mattress was comfortable but requiring the crew to make up the bed was an irritation. The inflight entertainment was far superior on Cathay Pacific. The Air NZ controls were very dated and the screen was small compared to other airlines. Overall service from flight crew was very good with both airlines. Disappointing that a lounge pass was not provided at check-in because of the codeshare status and I was instructed to use the Air NZ lounge at Hong Kong but on arrival discovered Air NZ shares the Thai lounge which was disappointing to say the least. Codeshare also meant that I couldn't check in on line for the non Cathay legs. I chose the code share flight combination as it offered the opportunity to experience two different business class services. Next time I would select flights only from Cathay pacific as Air NZ was disappointing. I understand that the Hong Kong to AKL route is provided by older fleet and it felt like it.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,3,1

However the flight attendant promised to let me choose first for the second meal. I wouldn't say the food was delicious but it's okay for what I paid for the ticket.

There was a quick security screen before check-in at RUH. As I was about to place my luggage on the belt a worker told me that he would do it. After it went through the scanner he rolled it about 30 feet to the check-in line. All of this took about a minute. I tipped him a dollar US which was the only small bill I could find quickly. He informed me that this was inadequate so I dug into my carry-on and found a bit more. This was very irritating. Other passengers also were annoyed by this and an elderly Saudi passenger who joined me in line used his cane to send his ""helper"" away when he requested additional tip. Check-in was quick and went smoothly. Boarding was not announced; it just happened. There was ""open boarding"" in coach (meaning seat assignments were ignored). Seat pitch was very good.

etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,Brian Fisher,United Kingdom,2014-01-03,All four legs were in business class taken during November 2013. The boarding process following a restful hour or so in the Airline's dedicated lounge at Heathrow was smooth efficient stress less and punctual. Aircraft (a Boeing 777-300) was as expected clean and in pristine condition. Although the seats in this cabin class were somewhat narrower than many other major carriers they were well appointed and functional as was the in-flight entertainment system. Food was of a high standard and served with a smile. My few requests (via the button) were answered promptly and I did not feel that they were in any way considered to be a nuisance. Arrival at Abu Dhabi and transfer to the next flight was seamless and I was soon on board. Cabin attendants were as professional as had been on the first leg as was the food. My in-built clock nudged me to operate buttons and turn my seat into a bed. It was time for some sleep. This was when the narrowness of the seat became more noticeable a pity really as a couple more inches would have given much more comfort. Following my tourâof Vietnamese culture and cuisine I returned to Bangkok - placed the top layer on and prepared for my return to London. This time after check-in I was directed to the airport's Apricot Lounge prior to boarding. Although quite a peaceful refuge its facilities fell far short of the Airline's own lounges. As expected the journey times against the prevailing jet streams were much longer but they were offset to some degree by the good service and ambience of the aircraft's business class cabin. Overall my experience of Etihad Airline certainly falls into the to the 'Very Good' category and if I had to give it marks out of ten it would score a solid nine.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,4,5,5,5,NA,NA,4,1

For example, it was clearly printed on my e-ticket that prepared meals would be provided, but what they do not say is that you first have to ask about the meal (flight staff never mentioned that food was even available), and then you are told to look at the menu if you want to purchase any food. The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US. As for entertainment, I am sure that you could have a great selection, but they charge you for watching everything and anything, including TV programmes. Inflight staff were rude beyond belief.

It appeared they were following the company line when they lied to us about it. Reluctantly we can understand and forgive the stupidity that would allow a strike which of course hurts the economy of Iceland and causes people like me to say never again and consequently in the end hurts the airline and its personnel. But what we don't forgive is the lying to the passengers telling us that this was a mechanical problem. They lie to us and then want us to trust our lives to them.

turkish-airlines,/airline-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,C Watson,Switzerland,2013-10-20,"GVA-IST-KTM return. Inconsistency is the hallmark of Turkish Airlines. It was very nice to have free drinks a nice dinner and an in-flight movie (screens above the seats) on a 3 hour European flight. However on the next leg to Kathmandu there was no seat-back IFE and when they played the movie you got English in one ear and Turkish in the other. (I would have liked a movie to block out the sound of the 3 infants near my seat.) On the way back there were seat back screens all the way even on the short-haul flight back to Geneva. The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation. On some sectors the pilots didn't address the passengers at all and other times they did. Finally the complementary tour of Istanbul for transit passengers (including food) is a nice touch. Clearly Turkish have the right idea they just need to standardise their product.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,5,4,NA,NA,4,1

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,S Metrie,Canada,2014-05-20,"We flew Toronto to Chicago; paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff; it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates; at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times; and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening; she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way.

I called customer service three times for clarification of water food luggage and check in questions. They were very professional and helped me understand how this airline works. We brought our own food and water. We did not book for seats in advance. Didn't order food. Did check in one piece of luggage and brought one carryon. They do weigh and coming back to US they weighed my carry on. My carry on was a bit overweight and so I took one item out and placed in my backpack. When we checked in we got an aisle seat and middle seat flying to Gatwick. Coming home we got an aisle seat and middle seat and no one sat in the window seat and so we got an entire row . Movies were updated and we brought our own air phones. They charge 3.00 if you need one. We bought our own meals from Gatwick airport 7.00 US and it came with a bottle of water.

Airport check-in was good. The China Southern Lounge is far below the standard for 4 star airlines. It is very small and only has tables and chairs. There is food available including 2 freshly made hot dishes to order. The beverages are average. This is not to say that it is not comfortable and there is wif-fi. But compared to what I would consider 4-star ""standard"" such as ANA United etc. is does not come near that. There is only one row of First Class seating on the 787 and the seats were semi-pod. They did go fully flat and were comfortable for sleeping though if you are over 6 ft. tall you might find them a bit short. In the non-bed position they were comfortable though they do not really have foot rests - the leg rests stop mid-calf. There is a small shelf at the far end of the pod that does work so I would say the seating is quite adequate. VOD was in my opinion quite good with a large selection of Hollywood European Asian and Chinese films and lots of TV music and games options. The only negative is that the screen is fixed at the opposite end of the pod from the seat so it's a bit far away. The English proficiency of the cabin staff is not great so asking for anything that isn't in a narrow band of expectations can lead to confusion or your not getting what you wanted. This was as basic in my case as asking if they had any type of drinks beside red and white wine. Ends up they did but it took the purser to recognize my request. She then provided an extensive list of the drinks available on board which was very good. The food was good as well - no complaints. The staff was also quite attentive and ready to please.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,M Hay,Australia,2014-06-20,SGN-SYD. This flight was part of an itinerary from Paris to Sydney. Vietnam Airlines offers a free transit program to eligible ticket holders (you need to book it 72 hours beforehand) - which we used and strongly recommend - we had a 14 hour transit between flights - we were met when we got off the plane and our visas were arranged we were then taken to an inner city hotel and had lunch and dinner and a tour of the city and then we were taken back to airport. It was a very pleasant way to spend the day and a nice break between the flights - also there was no extra money to pay and it took care of the hassle of organising a Vietnam visa. The A330-200 flight was half an hour late (all the flights I have taken out of SGN have been late) and was about 40% full in business class which was just as well because we had problems with three seats - entertainment not working necessitating multiple seat changes. Food was acceptable (not as good as the SYD-SGN leg) but the champagne was nice no refills were ever offered but the friendly staff responded quickly to the call button. The seat doesn't go completely horizontal but is pretty comfortable and sleep was possible. Entertainment options were pretty much limited to a reasonable selection of movies and not much else. No priority card given for customs/security at Sydney airport. Overall the flight went quickly and I was comfortable enough. I will fly Vietnam airlines again.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Flight was great no delays however when the drinks trolley came round I asked for a tea for my husband and a boiled water and lemon for myself and was told that I could not have a boiled water as I had my own tea. An assumption was made that I was going to scam them out of paying the cost of a cup of tea. However that is what I drink. I was then given a boiled water and a tea bag separately and told that it would cost Â£2.50 the cost of a tea even though that is not what I wanted.

On the first flight to Muscat from London, staff were quite miserable and didn't seem happy to help (unlike budget airlines I've used in Europe, anyway). Dinner was great, but breakfast wasn't great. The layout of the plane was quite good, and entertainment was good. On the returning flight home, staff were friendlier. I don't know if this is a cultural thing, but I just didn't find the staff very helpful or smiley, which is odd, as there is such a huge emphasis on friendliness for airline staff. Perhaps they were just having a bad day, which I understand. For the price of a return flight to Zanzibar from London flying directly to Zanzibar after a quick transfer in Oman, I would travel with Oman Air again.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Jon Morgan,Singapore,2015-07-25,"I recently flew Cathay Business Class from Singapore to London and back, via Hong Kong - a total of four sectors. While three of these flights varied from acceptable to quite good, the final leg from Hong Kong back to Singapore was awful. Having arrived late (see below) from London, we boarded yet another delayed flight only to find that, without any prior notification to us, they had switched the aircraft from the one on which we had booked our seats to one with the old A330 series 2-3-2 Business Class configuration. Not only is this more like sitting in Premium Economy, my wife and I were now separated by a passenger in the centre seat between us, with whom we had to negotiate a swap. With the flight already twenty minutes late, it was then announced that we had to wait for connecting passengers from yet another delayed Cathay flight, and we eventually pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. Once airborne things didn't improve. While the crew were courteous enough, the food was an absolute disgrace for Business Class. We both had to send our dried-out, tough and tasteless fish entrees back, and the replacement noodles had all the attributes of a convenience store offering. The toilets, which began the flight having seen better days, were filthy by the end of it, with discarded paper overflowing from the rubbish bin and the floor wet. I will avoid flying Cathay Pacific in future for fear of encountering another flight like this one. It's a shame, because their new Business seat is actually very well thought out, and the touch-screen entertainment system excellent. But for me there's just too much risk of delays, poor food, and encountering the outdated 2-3-2 Business Class cabin to warrant the asking price. Out of our four sectors, push-back from the gate was delayed on three of them by 60, 40 and 50 minutes respectively. I hope we were just unlucky, because these statistics don't make good reading: 75% of our flights delayed by an average of 50 minutes.",A330 series,Business,Business Class,Hong Kong to Singapore,2,1,3,1,4,3,NA,1,0

My husband was one week post knee surgery and although ground staff were very helpful and had moved us to seats with extra leg room on board it was a completely different matter. Staff were nothing short of rude and insisted we move back to our original seats - leaving the row where we had been due to sit completely empty. Came out with all sorts of illogical inconsistent excuses - cannot help but feel it was because the front seats attract an increased fare and they don't want to give them up for nothing.

Flight was 99% full and ground staff and FA's were efficient with the boarding process and managed to get everyone seated in time (despite the large amount of duty free items brought on board). There were a lot of Chinese/Thai flight attendants to deal with the Chinese/Thai speaking passengers. Hand luggage size rules were (generally) obeyed by passengers. Flight arrived about an hour early. FA's were friendly and had good English. Good selection of beverages (and generous amounts). Food was also good. Leg room and seat width was adequate. Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service. Overall good for an African airline and has improved over the past years but needs a few more finishing touches before it is on par with a lot of other major international carriers.

Overall performance has improved a lot compared to 2012 when delays of 2-3 hrs were common. They now use ex-US Airways B-737-400 for their international routes including Miami and Panama-Tocumen. FA's are average or above depends on the crew you got on your specific flight. Food in Business Class is below average but you can eat it. Drink service is way below average only soft drinks and water offered in Business Class. On return flight MIA-BLA they give you Whisky no wine no sparkling water nothing. Check-in in PMV takes an hour or so since they fill out the passenger list for MIA manually. Transit in BLA is quite easy no long walking distances BUT broken escalators for over a year now disgusting. On your return flight you have to claim your luggage in BLA what is kind of funny since there is no luggage belt. Suitcases are thrown through a hole in the wall into bag claim hall.

Only later in the flight when I asked a senior member of the cabin crew to confirm Continentals seating policy in writing was I advised that if I sat in the empty seats with my partner they would not ask me to move back! The seats in question were extra leg room emergency exit seats over the wing. I noted the emergency seating row in front was occupied by a teenager sleeping across all three seats and wondered if it was company policy to allow this? Other than my seating problems the flight was good and economy seats had plenty of leg room - just don't expect Continental staff to be helpful and assist with seating requests apparently it is company policy not to upgrade customers into empty seats even if this means you will be seated away from your partner & next to strangers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

Return flight had FAs present in the cabin. On both flights despite there supposedly being a selection of white wines there was one white wine option only. Outgoing 1st meal was overcooked bland and poorly presented. The 2nd meal was equally unpleasant. Return flight 1st meal was up to TG's former reputation but the 2nd meal option consisted of some greasy pork sausages on cabbage with boiled potato. It looked like someone had run down to the 7-11 and bought some of those hot dogs that are a mainstay of Thailand 7-11s. Seriously sausages as a meal in business class? The other option was duck. Gate staff in Brussels are contracted out and they were rather unpleasant. Bangkok TG check-in and gate experience was excellent.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,B Piper,Canada,2015-03-17,We flew Air Canada Rouge on a red eye from Honolulu to Vancouver on December 15th. We had booked the flight on Air Canada and were moved to Rouge without consultation. I have always maintained that while the staff on the ground were neither helpful nor happy the staff on the planes were brilliant. This was not true of Rouge. It was reminiscent of flying Ryanair but more expensive. The seats were unbelievable narrow with next to no leg room and I'm only 5'2. The elbow rests were small as well. The lights on each side of the aircraft were not turned off even though it was a red eye. We asked the staff who told us that the lights had to remain on as a safely concern because the reading lights weren't working. We weren't able to get a logical explanation as it seemed absurd that the reading lights would have anything to do with safety. At about 1 am the seatbelt light was turned on and an announcement was made to do up our seatbelts. The staff than walked down waking every covered up customer up to ensure their seatbelts were fastened. While I appreciate the safety factor I question the need to wake up every customer in the middle of the night. They offered water once during the flight. No other drinks were offered unless you wanted to pay. They also came around and offered food for pay; no snacks were offered. We're not sure what they did with all their time. We had spoken to an attendant on a previous flight who advised us that none of the existing crew members had been transferred to the Rouge line and that they were paid less. It showed in every aspect of this flight. We have been flying AC for years despite our but our ongoing problems getting off the ground because we maintained that once in the air Air Canada was excellent. This is not longer true. Our relationship ended on this flight. We will not be flying Air Canada again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Got the opportunity to fly Business Class or should I say Cloud Nine both ways! Plane was a fairly new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Flight ran an hour late due to ground issues. Food was great. Staff were friendly. Inflight Entertainment could have more choices instead of just 85 channels. But I wouldn't complain as I only used it once and would be on my laptop or asleep for the entire flight. The nice lie-flat seats were my favorite part of the airplane. On the way back it was via Rome another Dreamliner. We left on time from Addis Ababa but for some reason left late from Rome. Wish the flight attendants could fulfil passengers request for turning on the A/C because the plane was smoking hot when in Rome. Same thing as the flight to Ethiopia good food and friendly staff.

Our first trip was a bit hectic because we had very little time to catch our connecting flight. We had to run to our gate and once arrived there was a big queue. We were assigned 2 seats apart from each other (15 rows in between) so despite the big queue we went to the Air Canada desk at the gate to ask if it was possible to change our seats. The lady was friendly and she did manage to change our seats on this very short notice so that was positive. During the flight the food was good you could choose from different soft drinks (cans not just a glass) and the flight attendants came by with water quite often. The inflight entertainment was good as well (touchscreen). On the returning flight we had a newer airplane but the experience was not as good. The seat configuration was different as they added an extra row of seats which made 3-4-3. Because of this the seats were very small and less comfortable. Also the food was quite bad and the flight attendants were not as friendly and less skilled. The inflight entertainment system however was even better (latest version) so no complaints about that at all. Overall impression of flying with Air Canada was good.

No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it.

Having read the various customer reviews prior to my trip one of the most pleasing thing was to see that various complaints had been addressed by the company i.e. the toilets onboard appear to have been refurbished; ambient temperature onboard certainly was not too high; leaving Newark we had use of the fast track security channel. I found the flight times very convenient. Furthermore there are few flights arriving into Terminal 2 Newark at the same time so security was a wizz. Similarly we arrived back into Luton after the early morning rush so again no waiting. I noticed that a good proportion of the people on the return flight had been with me on the outward journey and i think that this is where Silverjet really scores best as the alternative full fare economy or premium economy is far inferior.

The flight leaves very early in the morning at 01.30. Singapore Airlines should really change the meal service concept on this flight. Having to endure a full service this early in the morning is just cruel torture when passengers would actually would just want the lights to go out and go to sleep. Why not hand out meal vouchers to passengers with plenty of time in transit to eat at a restaurant at SIN airport and then serve only a light snack on the plane after takeoff. Seats in business class look impressive but are unsupportive in the sitting position and too hard and too short when used as a bed. F&B service as well as inflight entertainment were very good. Crew were also doing a good job. Service overall however was slower at the rear end of the business compartment.

I arrived at the airport at 0530 which was the check in time written on my ticket by the lady at the TAAG office only to find that check in for the flight will only start at 0630. When the check in eventually started I was confronted by a security guard who told me to go to the back of the economy class line despite my business class ticket. Two hours later I was checked in and besides the customs official who wanted to confiscate my camera because it had rechargable batteries in it and the fiscal official who demanded a detailed explanation for the $1100 I had with me I went to the business class lounge. There was no coffee no tea and only four bottles of water in the refrigerator and four bunched up sandwiches with what looked like ketchup on it. I asked the lady attendant for some coffee. She did not reply disappeared and I never saw her or the coffee again. Boarding late due to some delay (B747) went fine and I was in my seat with no trouble - which I had to clean and get rid of a handful of dried bread crumbs. The cabin staff were an unfriendly bunch of which only one could speak a very broken English on an international flight. I fortunately speak reasonable Portuguese which helped. Service had a taste of rudeness in from most of cabin staff. Food in the business class was appaling. The beef was cold and served in exactly the same holders as economy class and with plastic utensils and cups. The bread resembled good old fashioned rusks as I suspect that it came from the previous day and coffee was cold. Passengers needed to request the attendants to remove meal trays after an hour had gone by in which they were giggling away in the galley area and not attending to passengers. The toilets on the aircraft were filthy. Onboard entertainment was a movie with no earphones available. When disembarking at Jhb - Oliver Tambo - the one air hostess rudely refused an economy class passenger a quick exit before business class passengers as he was running out of time to make check in for a connecting flight - even though he produced his ticket to the air hostess and the TAAG flight left Luanda 45 minutes late. TAAG should pull up their socks if they want to become part of global economy in the airline business. Their business class service at the airport is poor to say the least and onboard service even worse. Their cabin staff need a course in manners and professionalism and quality control on the aircraft needs to be addressed. Passengers pay extra for business class service but plastic eating utensils and poor quality food and service hardly justifies that.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I may have mis-understood the airline info (but there is so much of it) and had understood that if we missed our flight we could re-book with a penalty fee. Apparently this only works if you check in. Well if one misses their flight they likely haven't had a chance to check-in. What is the point of all this check-in etc on domestic flights.

philippine-airlines,/airline-reviews/philippine-airlines,Philippine Airlines customer review,Steven Blanchard,United Kingdom,2015-03-20,March 2015: LHR-MNL-LHR on A340. Despite the poor reviews on this site I experienced a quality level of service from PAL and felt compelled to write a glowing review. Yes the A340 is somewhat on the old side yes it is a bit worn in places but the seat was comfortable there was ample legroom it turned into a flat bed there was power and whilst I have had better inflight entertainment on other airlines there was enough choice and it was AVOD. But where PAL really excelled was in three areas. 1) Value for money 2) Inflight service 3) Meals. All in my opinion were better than you receive in Club World. At LHR you have access to the Etihad lounge we left on time PAL now flies over Russia and China so we arrived in MNL in 12.15 hours rather than the previous 14. On the return leg we left on time and with a journey time of 14 hours. Nothing was too much trouble for the crew. Would I fly with PAL again? Absolutely. Any grumbles?

The seat reclined well and the crew were friendly and helpful. The on-board service was a very nice surprise: great food and a reasonable variety of beverages - hot and cold.

Remains a solid product with a friendly professional crew. Seats: comfortable enough suggest centre aisle. Good duvet and real feather pillow so able to get some sleep. Meals: excellent quality for airline food and adequate portions and complementing wines. Movies: Did JFK-JNB-JFK in the same month so I was hard pressed by the end of March but it is a good on demand system. Value for money: SAA has monopoly on the routes to South America from SA so they can and do charge what they like. Worst Part: SAA continues to use low grade cheap instant coffee in Business class which is not acceptable when so much attention has been paid to other aspects of the product. Additionally JNB-EZE is day time flying during comparatively 'normal' hours either side of the south Atlantic yet SAA insists on blacking out the cabin with all window shades down. 11 hours is too long to sit in artificial blackout especially since I have never been in SA226/7 when Business class is more than half empty. Rows 15/16 in their own 'cabin' are very nice to sit in if the crew are not using it as a bedroom.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,4,5,4,4,NA,NA,4,1
darwin,/airline-reviews/darwin,Darwin Airline customer review,Susie Williams,United Kingdom,2014-02-25,I booked a trip from Cambridge to Amsterdam in October 2013 to fly March 2014. In Dec 2013 they changed the flight times significantly and again in February they tried to change them again wanting us to fly one day early. When I refused this they offered a flight out later on the original date but I lost patience with them and cancelled. I think we got off lightly not flying with them having now read the other reviews here. It's such a shame that Cambridge Airport has not managed to find a competent airline to open up these destinations I think many people were looking forward to the convenience of using such a local airport.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

We were 1.5 hours late taking off. They said it was because they were waiting for people to get through customs but why should we reward people for being late and punish the people who left on time to get through customs. Rouge's website states you only need to be there 90 minutes before your flight this is wrong you need to be there at least 2-2.5 hours before to get through customs. Arriving late in Phoenix they had us waiting at the wrong carrousel for our luggage and never did tell us. Onboard entertainment is non existent you have to bring your own. The TV and movies on the Rouge app are so old you cannot find anything to watch. On return flight we were 30 min late leaving. Arrival back in Toronto we waited for over 1 hour to get our luggage. I will say that there is one thing they do well.

Whilst I travel frequently to Spain I can only express my complete satisfaction and have not personally witnessed any dissatisfaction from fellow-travellers. I do wish travellers would show restraint in their urgency to depart the plane once landed I hate the pushing and shoving as they retrieve overhead bags but how do you deal with that.

The only eatery open was TGI Fridays and the only vegetarian option there was soup which I ordered with a glass of orange juice.

The portions were small and you got the feeling that this was the cheapest meal that Virgin could order. The 'breakfast' coming back was 'muffin tops' granola bar and a small bit of juice. So basically sugar sugar and more sugar. I don't expect bacon and eggs in economy but even a good quality croissant with some butter would have been better. Served no tea and coffee as they said there was a 'problem' out of Manchester. This flight left Orlando so not sure why they couldn't order supplies out of Orlando. The only thing good I can say was that I thought the inflight entertainment was good and that the crew were attentive. It's not their fault that they were serving the cheapest of cheap catering.

I was pleasantly surprised perhaps due to my own lowered expectations and was compelled to write this review as I don't think this airline is getting a fair shake. The plane itself was clean and in good condition and the crew was friendly courteous and helpful. The flight offered meal service which was no better/worse than any other airline I've flown. Regarding the leg room I found no difference between AC Rouge and coach class on other airlines. By comparison I've flown transatlantic on Air Transat Air France and United and frequently use AC main line within North America. If there is a difference it's negligible. Overall I'd say the leg room was ""industry standard"". For instance during this same vacation I took a short haul flight with Vueling which I would say had ""no leg room"". Regarding inflight entertainment I consider this a non-issue. Yes there is no inflight entertainment other than the movies shown on the main cabin screens. However in this day and age of smartphones and tablets I was more than satisfied to watch movies of my choice on my phone. The only thing that would've been nice would be to have had USB chargers for devices (my daughters tablet ran out of battery 3/4 way through the flight).

What was even more infuriating is that Vueling representatives assured me that the flight was waiting for us at D10 gate. The transit desk managers could offer nothing better than the next flight at the same time tomorrow! Such situation was unacceptable for me so they gave me a boarding pass to Paris-Orly flight in the early morning. The flight to Orly was not good - the plane was extremely old and dirty. What I can say is that Vueling is not so cheap but has very convenient schedules from Moscow to Barcelona and back. To sum up could be an option if you are flying without baggage and with at least a 3-hour connection. Otherwise stress is guaranteed.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Andrew Gibson,United States,2015-01-19,MAN to EWR RT BusinessFirst. I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years.

On our way to Sweden the trip was OK. Landings a bit bumpy. On the way back the entertainment system from Stockholm to Reykjavik was not working at all. The second leg of our flight I encountered a similar situation. The seat I was sitting at the touch screen was not working properly. The flight attendant reset it to no avail. It was not working. I was given a blanket to cover the screen because we could not even turn it off! When they crew were passing out the US Customs forms they missed us and we missed them. At some point we asked them for a form for our family and we were rudely told they had passed by twice already. At no point did anyone make an effort to make sure we had the form.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,P Morrison,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,Virgin Cape Town to LHR UpperClass Disappointment. My wife and I spent 3 weeks in Jan travelling around S/Africa and Mauritius for my 50th. Our first leg from LHR to Jo'Berg was in premium economy which was comfortable enough but the plane was just a little tired and where had all those lovely girls off the TV ad gone ? Anyway we completed our travels and were looking forward to a great trip back especially me as I'd upgraded us to upperclass when I'd first booked so it was going to be a lovely surprise for my wife. Having travelled with Virgin years previously in their prime I was expecting something pretty lush. Alas yet another 'tired old donkey put out to graze'. Don't get me wrong it was certainly a step up from premium and the staff were excellent but it certainly didn't warrant the prices being charged (luckily I'd picked them up 11 months previously at almost the same rate as premium so it wasn't such a loss) and it burst the balloon quite a bit. The audio/video system needed a little bit of a makeover too. However the biggest disappointment was the food. I have eaten better quality food on budget airlines within Europe it was terrible especially for upperclass I even politely rejected the breakfast run (In fact it was only a slight improvement on Air Mauritius which was absolutely appalling). I will travel with Virgin again only simply due to the amount of air miles I have amassed for upgrades but I'll make sure I've got my Ipad full of music & movies and a few bags of crisps to eat. For me Cathay still has the edge.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,4,5,1,3,NA,NA,3,0

The food layout was average nothing to compare with BA or Emirates they are superb. LHR-DEL menu card given and then taken back saying sorry it was the First Class Menu please read the Business Class now. The crew were a lot older and I guessed that might be the reason for not apt customer service barring 1 or 2 crew members.

thomson-airways,/airline-reviews/thomson-airways,Thomson Airways customer review,D Wood,United Kingdom,2015-05-20,We were telephoned by First Choice to upgrade to premium for our flight Gatwick to Jamaica 20th May. We were told we would get extra leg room fast track for security and check in up graded meals and free drinks. This was the first time we have upgraded on a flight and my husband bought it for us for my birthday present at some Â£500+. The check in and fast track at London Gatwick was good and fast. The seats had good leg room and were quite comfortable. The staff were good. We had already seen most of the films - poor small selection. The drinks were free but then so were the drinks for economy. The food was not good. The passengers from economy used premier toilets so I had to queue. For the flight home to Gatwick there was no fast track system for premier even though we had been told by First Choice that it was included so we had to spend more money and buy VIP lounge tickets for MOBAY at Grantly Adams airport (the lounge and system was excellent). The flight home meals were not good and upon arrival at Gatwick economy passengers were allowed to disembark before Premium. We feel that the Â£500 was a waste of money overall and that we were misled by the sales team at First Choice wjo sold us the upgrade. The flight felt safe with good time take off and landing.

I have always been proud to fly this Calgary based Airline in Canada. I fly frequently 5-6 times a year and it was on a flight from Calgary-Toronto that I was bumped into Plus Seats which was great. However on my return flight from Ottawa a week later I was back in economy seating as I had purchased economy for both inbound and outbound but when I sat down I had to squeeze myself into the seat. This has never been a problem before and I was sitting at the bulkhead on the 737-6 so I requested to move from a flight attendant. I am 6'4"" so flights have always been a little tight but this was like nothing I have experienced. The flight attendant accommodated my request to the seats in front of the exit row that don't recline. Same problem when the person in front of me put their seat back. I again requested to move into and the only seats available were in the exit row mid-cabin which was empty but I was told I couldn't sit there as they were Plus Fare seats. I was shocked! I can't help being tall and had I known I would have purchased a plus fare in Ottawa. The flight attendant did not allow me to sit anywhere else and it was by far the worst flight I have been on. I contacted Westjet with my disappointment and received a standard auto-generated letter back. If you are over 6ft tall and/or have legs longer than 32inches BUY PLUS FARE. I however will be flying another Canadian Airline (AC) from now on as their seat pitch is what Westjet's used to be in economy and are no extra charge.

He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated.

No such luck the cabin crew told me the roll-out on the 777's won't now start till October. The old business class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration simply isn't what you expect on a premium airline.

I booked through Travelocity and Condor would not allow me to directly upgrade or reserve seats. They referred me back to Travelocity and Travelocity said they couldn't do anything go through Condor. The limits on baggage weight are a mixed blessing as there wasn't a big hassle loading the plane with filled overhead compartments. Check your carry on weight as you check your luggage so you don't have to pay extra when at the gate as I saw several other pax doing. I appreciated the rule much more during the trip than before the trip. I had read about the advantages of the Premium Economy and Comfort class and I believe it would be worth it but I was comfortable in my aisle seat in Economy and I'm over 6' tall. I can imagine others that wouldn't be. On board the service was exceptional in comparison to the price I paid. The food was better than most airline meals I've had in the past few years. If you're flying on business I'd recommend a different carrier though. Another issue is that the Condor hub at Frankfurt is in Halle C so it's a long jog from the feeder Lufthansa flights and another security screening. Part of the low price is that the pre-flight services are minimum. They don't start processing for a flight until immediately before it departs. As far as the entertainment my iPad had more than 75% of its charge when I arrived as the inflight system was interesting enough though really dated.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,5,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

No explanation was ever given for delay warm soda and bags of chips were provided at the last minute for the weary hungry passengers. On return trip from Terceira I requested a window seat but was disappointed to find that I was given a center seat instead. Cabin was extremely warm seats were crowded overhead air vents were not working earplug jacks were non- functional. Flight attendants were grumpy.

The check in counters were not open when we arrived at the airport, and when they did open the self-checkout ""helper"" had no idea how to help us and sent us to a counter. My traveling companion was told that she had a standby seat, even though we booked months in advance. It took the staff 30 minutes to figure out how to get her a seat, and instead of reassuring us they were flirting and chatting the whole time. Even though we booked our flight together, we were not seated together and when I asked to switch seats the staff very rudely told me no, that the flight was full, too bad. We had heard of an exit refund for passengers flying out of Colombia, but when we asked several staff members they pretended they didn't understand even though they had been speaking English to us seconds earlier.

thomas-cook-airlines,/airline-reviews/thomas-cook-airlines,Thomas Cook Airlines customer review,Ankers Graham,United Kingdom,2013-11-14,Travelled to and from Turkey at the end of October - holiday from heaven but flights from hell. Paid extra for the extra leg room seats but I wonder why as these were of an inferior quality and actually seemed narrower than the normal seats. Don't get me wrong I didn't expect plush seats but I did expect a little more than we got and certainly expected that I would be able to put the table across my knee to eat my meal. The extra legroom seats were also made pointless as the cabin staff were constantly blocking the aisle so they could sell their wares thus causing passengers wanting to get to the toilets to congregate in the space that was sold as the extra leg room. Inflight film looked like it may have been worth a watch apart from the fact the screen was so far away you would need binoculars to watch it and to hear it would be impossible in the extra leg room seats as to plug in the over priced headphones would mean sawing your leg off. Food was hot but pretty much inedible (to me at least). Luckily the food was included in the package as it is definitely not worth bothering with. No choice in what you are served up - just get what they have left. Yes I will fly again with them but only because the hotel I like in Turkey can only be booked through them. Yes it is a budget airline but they don't half fleece you when they take Â£30 each way off you for the extra leg room seats that are not fit for purpose.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,3,2,1,NA,NA,2,0

The reason everyone lines up 1 hour before the flight (we didn't figure this out until too late) is because seating is not assigned. That being said our seats were fine and flight was great. Only complaint was that the flight was 3 hours late in arriving. In their defence they had emailed our home email address a day or so before to notify us but we didn't have access to our home email so didn't find out until we arrived at the airport.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

As with most flights in Europe seats were economy seats with the middle seat left unsold LX uses the Recaro slim seats which are rather uncomfortable but again ok for this short flight and leg room was ok. ZRH-GRU (day flight) was on-time and an excellent experience on all levels modern and clean plane (as one comes to expect from LX) with a 1-2-1/2-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD movie selection was fine but has room for improvement. FA's were brilliant professional attentive actually charming and regularly present in the cabin with drinks sandwiches snacks ice-cream etc. Meals served were tasty and with a Swiss touch. Lunch was Salmon Tarter (and two other choices) and Swiss Sturgeon (or Beef Tenderloin or Swiss Style Chicken Breast or Vegetable Curry). The second meal was a less interesting choice of Penne or Ceasars's Salad. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Wines served were also nice including some Swiss choices. LX uses the shared Servisair lounge in AMS which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a neglectable food selection. Due to the short connection time in ZRH we did not use lounge in ZRH. Transferring in ZRH is fast and easy. Border Control was friendly and with no waiting time also no additional transfer security control for passengers arriving from other Schengen countries a breeze. Terminals are roomy and well designed. Probably one of the very best airports in Europe for a transfer connection. Excellent long-haul product by LX and clearly recommended. LX is truly the gem of the Lufthansa Group of airlines (LH 4U OS SN and LX).,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1
spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,V Ng,United States,2014-10-28,"Took a flight from Phoenix to Lima Peru for $650 (beating the $1300 on United - the next best option). Took every precaution and planned ahead (pre-paid carry on printed tickets at home brought my own snacks etc). Didn't pay extra for assigned seating and still ended up sitting next to my travel partner. Had 2 layovers - one in Dallas and one in Ft. Lauderdale neither one was delayed nor got cancelled. Maybe I just got beginner's luck and had no issues with my flights and didn't have to deal with their customer service? Seat comfort (or lack of) will be my biggest complaint - domestic flights are extra firm and do not recline but the international flight to Peru and back was like any other economy seating you'd find on regular planes that have more cushion and do recline. After my flight experience to Peru I opted to pay for a window seat on the return flight so I can be slightly more ""comfy"". I do recommend this airline for short trips - I probably won't make another 10+ hour trip because seats are just too uncomfortable. Do your research and read the small print on the Spirit website. The website clearly states exactly what you will need to purchase ahead of time and what you will get charged if you don't.

Recently flew indirectly to Havana via Madrid. Going out we had a 45minute delay which was nothing compared to what we experienced on the way back. The plane was as expected - not much legroom but comfortable enough for the price paid. Flying back was a disaster - flight from Havana to Madrid was delayed by 6 hours meaning we missed our connecting flight to London. The worst part was not knowing what was going on. Air Europa were unapologetic and couldn't answer our questions about what would happen when we got to Madrid. They did nothing to reassure us and left us feeling completely vulnerable. When we arrived in Madrid a representative told us that the next flight they could get us on would be in 24hours they did offer to put us up in a hotel for the night but we'd had enough by this point and paid 200 euros to get on an EasyJet flight home.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked.

Shanghai-JFK on an A340 was very good. However there was no in-seat entertainment systems and the communal movies that were offered were not very good. In every seat however there is an electrical plug. I saw quite a few passengers plug in iPads and PSPs and such so CEA is allowing you to bring your own entertainment. The food throughout both flights did not offer any non-Chinese food options. On the return flight everything was fine and the food and drink seemed to be of better quality.

The main motivation to use this airline was the affordable price and a direct flight to desired destination. We did our homework and were mostly pleased. This airline asks you to sacrifice comfort and charges less for it. If you demand extra they charge you extra. Have your boarding pass ready and be at the airport early. Print out your boarding pass as early as you can to get the best seats it is very important if you would like to sit with the person on the same reservation. Pack light. We just used the carry on allowed bag that has to fit under the seat. This also allows you to go straight to your gate. All check in bags and bigger carry on ones will be charged extra. The seats do not move but bring your own neck pillow. They allow a lunch pack and I had it with me so did not have to buy any food on the plane. Well I did buy a can of ice tea for $2. Bottle of water was also $2. Make sure you have an acceptable credit card for that. Restrooms are free! I did not like that the flights I took were both late. 30 and 45min. Not sure why. Seemed like that the first flight had been placed with the different plane (new airbus) since the seating arrangements were off and the second flight had some turbulent weather. Second plane was really old Douglas 80. Staff were nice and helpful. People do forget that this airline is different and demand the same service as on other airlines.

Interesting that they promised to upgrade us to Business Class if it was available but when the time came they said they could not - even though seats were available.

Airplane was new flight attendants were professional and courteous and though the seats were a bit closer than some other carriers they were still reasonably comfortable - and I'm 6'2"". I think much of the concern voiced with Spirit is for those who may have not fully read all of the charges/fees that are broken out. This is definitely a different business model; however even with paying for some checked bags and seat assignments we still saved more than $400.00 as a family. Yes they charged for a coke however it was still cheaper than at the airport stands/kiosks. As a family of 4 we only had to check/pay for one bag and we each had a backpack that was free. It may take a bit of strategy in your packing; however we stayed in Orlando for 8 days and did not have any problems with what we brought. I can certainly understand how shocking it might be to see all of these fees - but you must consider the final cost in comparison. I had never flown Spirit before but was positively impressed. I think the real key to flying Spirit is to engage in a ""Spirit 101"" course by really examining their website for all costs and services so that there are no surprises. I also noted that things like car seats umbrellas food reading materials and so forth can be taken on the plane with no additional cost and these items do not count against your personal bag/backpack.",NA,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

Aside from the price there is nothing I can recommend about this airline flying this sector.

airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,P Elliott,Australia,2014-11-12,We flew from Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur on 25th October. We've used Air Asia X before so knew what to expect and what to book so as to be comfortable. We booked a long time ahead during a sale period so got our tickets at a very cheap price. For extras we pre-purchased luggage quiet zone seats 2 meals each and a sim card on arrival. The travel insurance offer and local bus transport offer wasn't for us but for others it might be good. The quiet zone economy cabin was about two thirds full so most had an empty seat between 2 people. In the main economy cabin it was full. That's where you'll be put if you don't book a seat - you're not allowed to sit in the quiet zone unless you have booked. So it was money well spent. If you pre-book your meals you will be served what you prefer. If you don't book you will pay more and might not get the full choice. I did a web check-in a few days before the flight. At Adelaide airport all we needed to do was drop in the luggage and we were ready to go. The lines for normal check-in weren't too bad though. You can take food and drink onboard and also take your tablet filled with books and videos. We arrived early into KLIA2. A lot of flights arrive around 4pm KL time. Immigration is quick but there are a lot of people waiting for bags. We were out of the luggage area and into the terminal shopping area in about 40 minutes from arrival. You can collect your sim card in the shopping mall directly in front of you. If you have an early flight the next day as we did the Tune hotel is an easy walk from the terminal.

After reading the comments here I did not want to expect much but I was pleasantly surprised that on- board service is better than my previous business class experiences on other airlines. I have to say the cabin crew did every possible thing in their capacity to make all passenger's feel comfortable. I expected much more from the IFE considering its RAVE but it was adequate enough for the 4hr 15min flight to Dubai. On the BOM-CMB sector I flew 4R-ABK (A320) no IFE but superb legroom and great comfort. However in comparison to the cmb-dxb flight smiles seemed forced on the crew's face which disappeared mid-flight and it was noticeable that they wanted to just distribute food except for 1 or 2 of them. It was however a short flight and did not bother me much. Transit Time was 13 hrs and I stayed at the Goldi Sands Hotel Negambo 15mins from the airport with a transit visa all courtesy SriLankan Airlines. Very Impressive and Great value for money.

I decided to go to the airport the day off early and asked where I could change my flight. This is where the unfriendly cold staff interactions begin. When I asked where I could go to change my booking the lady proceeded to hold up a finger telling me to pause while she scrutinized carry on bag sizes for passengers then when she ""had a moment"" pointed in the general direction of a service desk and said ""there!"". A short walk and 10 minute wait in the line led me to another miserable lady who told me I should be in the international terminal since I'm flying to LA but in this case ""she'd make an exception"". I proceeded to ask her if there were two different operating companies for domestic versus US flights knowing the answer. The lady gave a short and concise ""no"" response and proceeded to tap away at her computer for minutes without looking up or saying a word.

Not a bottle of water, a glass poured out of a large bottle. I guess this is the new craze of overcharging for everything on LCCs. But I really knew I had been traveling on a inferior airline when my luggage did not show up in Oslo. It had been left behind in Hamburg. Even Eurowings did not handle the missing bag.

I've been a loyal customer to Korean Air for the past 3 years. Despite living in Japan I would fly to Incheon just to fly with KA whenever I returned to the US. However I'm extremely disappointed with my most recent trip. I'm not sure if there was an internal reorganization or a cutback of some sort. From check-in to the business lounge all staff seemed irritated and overwhelmed and it wasn't even that busy. I always fly business class but I was certainly not treated as a business class customer.

Travelling in business class connecting via Casablanca because of a delayed onward flight I was forced to change flights and wait there for 24 hours. These things happen fine. A key measure of service quality is how the airline then reacts when things go wrong particularly for premium customers. I have rarely witnessed such complete disinterest. It took me six hours - from 9pm to 3am - to get the airline to rebook me find my baggage and promise me a hotel. The guy who was issuing hotel vouchers then disappeared for hours without explanation or apology leaving myself and 20 others stranded. Eventually I had to take a taxi to stay in a hotel in the city 30km away at my own expense. Upon return to the airport the next day I asked to speak to someone senior to file a complaint and request reimbursement and was waved away.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N Hammond,United Kingdom,2015-04-17,My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything. We were told that we cannot collect our luggage as 'it has gone to BA'. We were given vouchers for an airport hotel and forced to stay overnight without luggage and they reluctantly gave us two sets of very basic things such as toothbrush and toothpaste for us three. The next day at AA check in desk we were told we need to collect our luggage at luggage collection No 5 after which we needed to bring it back upstairs and check them in. They could not locate our luggage. As the time for our next flight was approaching my husband ran to the check in desk to let them know that our luggage never materialised whilst I waited at carrousel No 5 in case it does. We asked if we could be upgraded if there were any spare seats in the premier class and the staff member said 'we do not upgrade for such a reason'.

Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy.

When you're travelling with a 5 month old this situation can create a lot of stress. Once we boarded the situation became worse. The seats were dirty and clearly very worn. It was evident that the planes climate control was broken. We sat onboard the aircraft at the gate for what seemed to be a very long time with aircraft engineers trying to fix the problem. The pilot claimed the problem was fixed we began our taxi away from the gate and then the plane just sat there. We went back to the gate and tried to get it fixed. After a lengthy wait (again) we taxied and took off. Of course once airborne the cooling system still did not work and the pilot informed us that we were going to be diverted to Vancouver to potentially switch planes. Told a new plane was being readied and we would be boarding 7pm Vancouver time. When we went to our new check in gate the situation went from worse to downright awful. Ground staff had no idea on seat assignments and couldn't figure out where to seat everyone. We thankfully got our bassinet seats but other passengers were told to board and to find a seat ""anywhere they could"". We finally got in the air 9 hours after our ordeal. I will never fly Air Canada again.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,3,NA,NA,1,0

After check-in we were hurried to board the plane and was one of the last to board. Upon entering the plane I was disappointed with the interior flowery seat covers and it looked like something from the seventies. This was the Airbus A300 the National Express coaches in England look a lot smarter! There was a lot of confusion with seating and my family was split up they wanted my 4yr old daughter and my 3yr old son to sit some distance away from us the crew constantly saying let us take off then you can swap seats with anyone. In the end a compromise was found with another family. The flight was ok and surprisingly on time. Entertainment was nothing at all food not bad all I can say is they should improve the look of the planes interiors and modernise things or they are going to lose a lot of business to other carriers.

When we tried to print boarding passes at the Fort Myers airport we were told that we needed to pick new seats because the seats we originally chose in September 2014 were no longer available to us. We were told we could fly first class for $150+ additional charge (each of us and there were 3 of us traveling). We could also take the last row of the plane but I strongly opposed this due to a flight we were on in December when the rear seat smelled of rest room odor. Our last option was to take the exit row but pay an additional $25.00 to sit there. I strongly opposed this because we had chosen row 18 when we booked our flights. But Sun Country said that was only a choice on that day and the airline has every right to take away the seats. We had no choice we had to pay the $25.00/person to sit in the exit row.

However our booking experience was horrendous. In October we booked a flight to Sri Lanka for 3 weeks returning on an evening flight (7pm) from Colombo on 22 Dec. On 3 Dec our agent advised us of a change to our return flight which would involve us arriving in Bahrain at 07.40 on 23 Jan and leaving there on 24 Jan at 02.00 - no offer of hotel. After protest this was changed to another flight leaving Colombo at 04.45 on 22 Jan. This meant we would lose a day of our holiday. After another protest this was changed (on 6 Dec) to the same time but on 24 Jan now 2 days more than planned. Finally on 3 Jan we received yet another email changing our return flight offering us to either return on 22 (as previously suggested) in the early morning flight or on 25 on the same flight. We now had a choice of losing 2 days or gaining 2 days and had no time to reply as taxi was waiting (and hotels etc were already booked). We had to sort this out at Heathrow where they were very helpful and we finally agreed to return on 25 Jan 3 days later than the original plan. All these changes were attributed to cancellations by Gulf Air. We frequently tried to contact them by phone but without success. We thought at first it was an excuse from our agent but have since discovered that Gulf Air had cancelled several flights the previous month. I shall certainly never fly with them again.

Pretty cramped leg room. Once on the French Polynesian islands I was not able to change my return flight to Auckland with my standard Y fare which I don't understand.

The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ.

Because the planes were so old, the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There is no option to push your seat back because there was no space! Even if you had that option, it would be almost cruel to the person sitting behind you. I am 5â1 and my knees were almost touching the seat in the front. So if you are taller than 5â3, the economy ticket of this airline is not for you. I had to stand up a few times during the flight in order to have some blood circulation though my legs. Also, if you are a person who likes air conditioning, their planes are room temperature. Meaning, for me, it was hot throughout the whole flight. The food was decent, but the flight attendants were rude. You are only allowed to get water or coffee with your meal, for everything else, you have to pay extra. $4 for a can of coke!

We were issued their digiplayers. Fair selection of movies to view but really no place to put the player when the meal arrived. A bit cumbersome. Meal offered was one choice only. It was tasty but portions have certainly been scaled back. Flight attendant disappeared after the meal service. Arrived on time.

As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,J Wilton,United Kingdom,2014-04-14,East Midlands to Tenerife 6th April FR3152. Returned 11th April FR3153. It's great to see that they are finally trying to improve customer service and it was definitely better on the way out. Having allocated seating now is much better although it was not clear when I booked that seats are allocated free at online check in so I unnecessarily paid Â£40 to do this in advance. Also what on earth is going on with the 'only the first 90 bags' can stay in the cabin idea? Great that you can now take a small bag (handbag laptop bag etc) and put it under your seat. However only the first 90 passengers are allowed to take a correctly sized and weighted wheeled case on board. At Tenerife they decided that everyone had to do this before they got on the plane and it was chaos with people trying to work out what they needed to take out. Strange also that they only pick on wheeled cases even small ones. My partner had a rucksack the contents of which were about the same weight as mine yet my bag was tagged for the hold. By the time I'd taken out all the valuables - camera iPad Kindle etc there was very little left in it. Also there was plenty of empty space on the overhead compartments once we got onboard. All completely pointless. I do think they are trying but they really don't think these things all the way through! All that is going to happen is that people's 2nd bags are gradually going to get larger and larger and there will be the same old rows at check in and the gate as there have always been! Other than that it's pretty good value for money I guess although I agree with other comments about flights times. Lots of them get into Stansted too late for the last trains which prevents me booking with them. Oh and the seats not reclining and no pocket for belongings continues to be tedious. Especially on longer flights. Still punctuality is very good and it is cheap I guess!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,2,3,0,NA,NA,NA,3,0

Food rather poor From Istanbul tiny portion of hot pasta arrabiata with muffin served inedible. To Warsaw - tiny sandwich. The best part of service was a chocolate. The only downpoint is Swiss' obsession with cabin baggage. They fly the same airplane type as any other airlines but their fights and constant quite unpleasant arguments with passengers to check-in cabin bags are horrendous.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Blackwell,Ireland,2014-09-17,Business plus plan: Smoke and Mirrors. I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,3,0,NA,NA,NA,1,0

I was attracted to the airline because of the lower fares which is great for my family of 5. We no issues on the flight to MCO. Fast forward 3 days later on our return flight from MCO to CVG. We arrived at the airport only to find that our flight had been delayed for 2 hours because of maintenance issues. Understandable. From the time we left the main terminal to the gate the delay went from 2 hours to 9.5 hours. Again we were told it was a maintenance issue. The delay changed again to 10.5 hours. It turns out it wasn't a maintenance issue at all it was a crew issue - they don't have a crew to fly the plane. Supposedly the do now (thus the delay). I'm not sure where the plane is - CVG or MCO. The attendant at the gate told me planes are delayed at least once a week because of no crew but usually the delay is shorter than 10.5 hours. I only wish I would have read the reviews before I booked my flight. It can only be a matter of time.

In all fairness the Captain did the correct thing and didn't take off - he kept us all up updated via the loud speaker. Finally took off 2 hours later. Missed my connecting flight - then had to go on stand by - what a joy that was. The actual trip back to Aust was a very smooth flight - very little noise. Cabin crew were quite good. Food was very good. Far better than I received on my outgoing Qantas Business Class flight. Star Class seating was fine - have to keeping mind its a budget carrier. Would I Fly Star Class Internationally again? Most defiantly - Its far cheaper and you still get the feel that your special. I would sooner pocket the savings I would make on traveling with Jetstar B/C to Qantas B/C. By the way my outgoing flight to Tokyo was on a very old rattly 747- although they have upgraded the Business class to flat beds.

Flight back out of TAS delayed more than 4 hours and left at 3.28am. The attitude of passengers was again identical - and the cabin crew once again were helpless (or unwilling to intervene).

My biggest concern and the main reason for the low rating is the training and comportment of the cabin crew. They were all young and obviously inexperienced. The boarding through two doors was completely bungled chaotic because proper procedures were not followed. I heard ""boarding completed"" reported twice at separate times so obviously there was confusion. They giggled their way through the safety announcements as if they were a private joke. I was left with a very distinct feeling that in case of emergency this crew would be no help at all in evacuation or other procedures. I have never felt that way on a commercial flight before. The Rouge design seems to be on the ""hipster"" model with banter such as ""you will get busted!"" referring to smoke detectors in the washrooms. Fair enough I guess flights do not have to be sombre to be safe I know from experience. But this needs to be better delivered in the Rouge case. There needs to be an adjustment of crew conduct related a better show of competence. The presence of a more mature (but cheerful!) crew manger would be a big help. I'm sure these are nice deserving young people who work hard and they are trying to make a cramped flight feel lighter.

My flight from Southampton to Newcastle was cancelled half an hour before we boarded due to a technical fault again! The flight before me to Manchester was also cancelled due to a technical fault and after speaking with many irate customers it seems that this is a regular occurrence with Flybe. This being my second time I thought I would share my experience. After cancelling my flight we were told to collect our bags and proceed to the Flybe check-in desk long queue eventually offered two options - wait 5 hours until the next one to Newcastle or go to Gatwick for a slightly shorter 4 hour wait. Upon complaining at the desk I was told by a very rude member of staff that ""this happens with all other airlines not just us and we are not the worst"". No manager on duty to help explain no empathy or consideration for how I or anyone else felt. I then spent 2 hours on a coach to Gatwick only to make it with 10 minutes to spare no one to meet us at the other end to help direct us or make sure we were given priority to make the flight. I had planned to only take hand luggage on the flight and had purchased a bottle of spirits at Southampton. I was told this would have to be checked in with my hand luggage and was then cheerfully told ""that will be Â£40 please""! Then I was directed to the customer service desk to request that they waive the charge - why could this not be done at the Check In desk? Again a long queue with many other ""happy"" customers eventually they waived the charge had to go back and queue up again to check my bag in then through security to just make the flight.

Flight from Brussels left with 20 mins delay but this was not a problem as there was enough layover time in Warsaw for my connection flight to Larnaca. Arriving in Warsaw and going to the gate there was already announced 15 mins delay in boarding. It seems that most of the people don't respect the hand baggage allowance rule and also the airline itself shows much tolerance on this. I could see many people (all in economy) boarding carrying 2-3 handbags and ground staff and flying attendants saying nothing about it. This gets annoying because besides onboard safety it is the space issue in the overhead cupboards not enough space for everybody. After boarding and being seated we had to wait in the aircraft for 50 mins. Pilot informed us after 30 mins we had to wait for baggage and that is why there was a delay. In any case flight left with almost an hour delay and arrived in Larnaca at 3.25 am instead of 2.55am. Service was average (as usual LOT doesn't offer onboard meals and you have to buy your food).

asiana-airlines,/airline-reviews/asiana-airlines,Asiana Airlines customer review,N Robjohn,United Kingdom,2011-01-27,Return business class flight with Asiana Airlines Heathrow - Sydney via Seoul. Not usually a business class traveller but due to distance etc thought we'd spoil ourselves. Have to say what a professional efficient outfit Asiana run. Inflight service was brilliant a joy to see cabin crew happy in their work. Nothing was too much trouble. Business class connoisseurs may comment that you don't have a flat bed (on these routes) but the fully adjustable reclining seat didn't disappoint and was found to be very comfortable. Inflight entertainment could be updated (which I'm sure it will be) but was more than adequate for our requirements. Menu was quite extensive which should cater for most tastes if not sandwiches/snacks and drinks were available all flight. The stopover in Seoul on return flight to Heathrow was not a problem although the journey into Seoul took some time in heavy Friday night traffic but then what's new. No complaint about the hotel booked by Asiana. All in all a very pleasurable experience at a sensible cost.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Jeddah is a lousy experience. It took so long to clear passport control that I got bumped from my connecting flight and had to buy a ticket from another airline. The transfer desk is a clamouring horde and you have to fight your way to the front. No information is given out at Dammam Airport either in Arabic or English as to departure gate numbers. Flights are labelled ""free seat"" at the last minute even when you've got your seat number and Saudis like to play musical chairs so that you aren't sitting next to their womenfolk or so they can sit in family groups. The ticket sales staff are rude and indifferent and lack the language skills necessary for the job. The ground staff likewise. They invariably start shouting at you if you express any disagreement with them.

On the inbound flight it was a beautiful big 777 and frankly much better. This 2-3-2 configuration was crowded on a long haul flight and there are only bathrooms in the back of the plane. Our seats at the front - you get it. I do have a few issues with this flight- the bathrooms had not been cleaned and smelt terrible! I think a flight attendant did a good clean up mid flight as it seemed to improve as the flight went on. Surely not appreciated by her. My other issue with Air Canada on both flights is that the cancelled their pre dinner drink run. Cost cutting? Maybe. And the food was pretty lousy too. My children's meals in particular were terrible. Finally our IFE had a glitch and the first 40 rows had their programming interrupted about 20 times. I know first world problems - but when you pay for it. On a brighter note 'some' flight attendants were friendly (others not at all). We will go back to our regular Air Transat route across. Cheaper cleaner and more bang for buck. Friendly too.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,2,1,1,NA,NA,3,0

The night before we were to leave Maui I tried to see if I could book a later flight online and my confirmation number 'didn't exist'. I contacted Island Air and after waiting on hold for 20 min was informed that my family had been reassigned to Hawaiian Airlines and the flight was leaving an hour earlier than our scheduled time. When asked why another flight had been changed again I was told 'equipment problems'. Had I not called the night before leaving Maui we would have missed the flight and it would have taken us 12 hours to get from Maui to Lihue a one-half hour flight.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Dick Ziegler,United States,2014-03-17,My wife and I recently flew JFK-DXB-BKK and I returned BKK-DXB-JFK. My wife will return next week. Going out we had a pretty good trip to Dubai although the plane left late. Waited in transit in Dubai but were delayed again. Onboard told the problem had been fixed and we would depart shortly. When we got to BKK we waited for our luggage (3 pieces) only to be told it was still in Dubai. We found out 300 passengers from JFK had the same problem. On my way back check-in at BKK was a nightmare due to the fact that over 500 people were checking in. The Airbus A380-800s are just too big to handle the necessary ground operations to support them. Flight was OK to DXB nothing special. In transit at DXB I checked on which gate I was to board at and went to wait. After an interminable wait and seeing nothing I checked the board only to find out that they had changed departure gates but posted no signs or made no announcements about this. I made a mad dash to the new gate and just made it before they closed it. I was in a three-seat row with a window seat and one other passenger in the aisle seat. Behind me was a family with 2 little kids. From the minute I sat down until the time I got off the plane the kids yelled and cried. There was no problem resolution from the stewardess although there were a number of options that she could have implemented.

hawaiian-airlines,/airline-reviews/hawaiian-airlines,Hawaiian Airlines customer review,Borg Karyn,Australia,2014-09-28,I flew business class from Sydney to Honolulu. Getting through Sydney airport was a dream no queuing for check-in and expedient trip through both customs and security with priority. The Air New Zealand lounge was adequate clean and comfortable. It is not the best lounge I have spent time in but having said that there was good selection of food and drink. Boarding was effortless and again done with priority. The plane was old and it showed in the console and to a lesser extent the seats. The seats were comfortable plenty of leg room the seat recline was not sufficient enough for a comfortable nights sleep. The leg and foot rest mechanism in my seat was faulty. The staff were wonderful and very attentive both food and drink were plentiful and a good variety to choose from. The entertainment selection was good but a few more recent release movies would have been nice. I had a window seat once the seat in front of me reclined I literally had to climb over the console to be able to go to the toilet. The USB charge facility did not work so don't rely on that. All the above pertains to the trip home as well with the Exception of the Hawaiian Airline Lounge at Honolulu Airport. If your idea of a business class lounge is a cup of coffee or a soft drink then you will be happy. Not only did they not provide anything other than a packet of nuts they do not allow you to take any food or drinks in. I would not bother using it again the point being the lounge facility is part and parcel of flying business and first class and Hawaiian need to lift their game. Again I must say I could not fault the flight staff or the food and beverage services on the aircraft.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,5,5,4,NA,NA,3,1

I thought Rouge was supposed to be a discount carrier but all 3 flights were over 1000 bucks. The seating is absolutely horrible - the worst I have seen in years and I have been a super elite traveler for the past 3 years. Wifi entertainment is extremely buggy on my iPad. Half the shows stop playing part way through and you can't even select individual songs from an album when listening to music - It always defaults to the first song in that album. The worst part about this whole experience is that not one time over the last 3 trips was the plane on schedule. The 2nd trip coming back to Toronto on the redeye flight was eventually cancelled at 3am keeping everyone waiting around the airport when it was known that the plane's broken windshield would not have been fixed that night. The next day was a nightmare the noon flight was delayed by 4hrs and they just couldn't manage the people waiting around very well. Put them on the next United flight out! But of course that means taking responsibility and taking care of the passengers something that Rouge and Air Canada seem incapable of doing lately. I have to say that the staff were friendly. I have been a loyal and frequent traveler with Air Canada for the past 9 years and I have to say that this is it for me.

During the transition they are still using Awards which was the mechanism by which you reaped the reward of a free flight. But do not convert points into an award - if you do so mistakenly you will never get them converted back into points. Found this out trying to book a flight by converting to award first which was akin to the previous protocol but the flight had ""no"" award seats available. You could buy a seat with your points but after conversion to award I didn't have enough points available and Southwest has made their system physically incapable of correcting the conversion not even during this period of new learning for their customers. They make no statement that I could find that such conversions are irrevocable. In other words if you make a mistake too bad - you can pay for a ticket but Southwest won't help you correct your points v. award error and you have to wait for another flight within the coming year to use it.

MH 726 Jakarta to KL: The 2 female flight attendants serving were friendly and managed to address passengers by name. Although upon boarding neither were smiling. and indeed they look most unhappy. The forward toilet was dirty. I was also surprised that my cutlery had not been properly cleaned. The issue of MH's Nasi Lemak has received a lot of media coverage and yet the product on the flight from Jakarta to KL was not complete - it was only rice with prawns in a sauce with an egg. MH 129 KL to Melbourne: Boarding was efficient crew friendly and generally service was good. However the purser did not seem to do anything except look unhappy and did not interact with more than a couple of passengers. Surprised to be told that champagne could not be served while the aircraft was on the ground! The selection of newspapers and magazines needs to be less myopic. Similarly a better selection of world business and general interest magazines would be appreciated. MH 146 Melbourne to KL: Flight was much less enjoyable and probably only saved by the efforts of the female flight attendant in business class who made up for the poor service from the two other males and flight service director. She was the only person who addressed me by name. No menus available. The two male flight attendants went about their jobs with the minimum of interaction with customers service was very off-hand. The chef-on-call dish of beef was very tough. Most times when I went to use the toilets at the rear of the business class cabin they were occupied. As there were only 10 passengers in business class and they were all in their seats it suggests that the flight attendants allowed economy passengers to use the business class toilets.

With the way Qantas have changed their redeeming of FF points it seemed like a prudent investment of 60000 points to upgrade (from Premium Economy). Going through the Express passport control at JFK is so much easier & the BA lounge is quite decent. The lounge at LAX is also good - albeit a little crowded when I was there. Both legs of the flight were really well done (very good crew) and good food - the omelette with fetta and smoked salmon at breakfast before landing in Sydney was especially good. The bed worked well - it is the first time I have slept solidly on a plane (and I have flown in Business many times). It was quite amusing seeing the mature FA wrestle the bed cover on with such vigour! I reckon she could take down any recalcitrant passengers easily!

The herringbone seat layout meant that window seat passengers could not look out of the window without turning their heads at an awkward angle and aisle seats could not talk to their neighbours at all without physically getting out of their seats and if you put your feet on the stool they were liable to get knocked by anyone passing. The FA's were excellent very attentive helpful and very pleasant. The food and drink was very acceptable and the in flight entertainment also very good with lots of choice. Having flown with Virgin since the late 80's I still recommend them although I do not like the seating arrangement on the A330 much preferring that on the 747 hence only 8/10.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,5,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Bulkhead seat with lots of legroom friendly crew who even offered hot towels on departure to economy passengers because business class was so empty. In flight entertainment relatively extensive and food was okay - offered a curry meal plus a hot chicken wrap later on. Drinks were offered several times. Seat was comfortable and overall a great flight. BOM-HKG night flight was packed full. Had a seat near the back with pretty bad legroom. Served ice cream upon departure and breakfast (which was vile) before landing. Return flight a few months later to BOM was 100% full. Bulkhead seat again so leg room no problem. Entertainment and food were still pretty good and crew were as friendly as ever on Jet. The cabin was absolutely freezing though. Final flight BOM-LHR was pretty poor. Seats and entertainment still good crew still friendly. But absolutely no drinks or food offered for the first 8 hours! Breakfast eventually served but I passed having experienced the horrors of breakfast on Jet a couple of months ago. Biggest problem is Mumbai airport - the transfer process is confusing and unorganised and the airport itself is horrible. Not really Jet's fault though I guess.

Decent pitch for a guy who is 6""4 such as myself. The better of the two AVOD systems in Canada for sure. Only gripe was an extended period of ""turbulence"" where there was no communication many passengers stood up to use the facilities as did I. About 3-4 hours into the flight. The senior flight attendant rudely remarked ""you know the seatbelt sign is on!"" Not exactly highly service oriented. But still worth the trip from Calgary.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,D McKenney,NA,2007-09-17,Dulles to Stansted return. We booked our tickets well in advance and paid $1000 each for the roundtrip flight. Check in at Dulles fine. They give you a ticket to go through the priority security screening which is nice. Maxjet uses the Northwest Lounge along with a couple other airlines so the lounge can get crowded. The lounge had the typical selection of drinks and snacks available. On entering the plane I thought the interior had seen better days. The flight was about half full so everyone was able to spread out. The seat was comfortable and a lot of space. I wish they had given a short brief on how to use the seat because I didn't know the leg rest could extend back and forth to fit the legs until the return flight (it's the big black lever in the armrest). My nine year old daughter was able to figure it out and she slept the entire flight. They handed out the digi players shortly after takeoff and started a meal service. I can't comment too much on the outbound service because I tried to sleep. The return leg from Stansted is where Maxjet shines. The check in was quick and fast track through security is great. We made it through security in about three minutes. Maxjet lounge in Stansted outstanding - wide selection of snacks/food as well as drinks. The service on the return flight was fine but it didn't seem as friendly as the first flight. The food was good but it was definitely airline food I think Maxjet is a little liberal using gourmet to describe the food selection. Maxjet is a great value for the money. The seats space lounge and priority security are well worth the price. It looks like they are upgrading the lavs. The interior of the planes are nice with new carpet and the seats are good condition.

Plane OK and cabin service pretty much what you would expect from a low cost airline. Return journey absolutely dreadful. Arrived Bacolod in plenty of time and checked in. No mention at check in of any delays. Passed through to airside where indicators showed the 19.15 flight now scheduled at 20.25 No explanation offered and no staff visible to ask. Around 20.00 finally an announcement that the aircraft would arrive at 20.30 and depart at 21.00. No apology or explanation offered. Eventually boarded after 21.00 and took off around 22.00. Attempted to ask gate staff why the delay and received the meaningless response 'false alarm at Manila'. After 3 hours in an airport with no food outlets cabin service amounted to a dry biscuit and some water. On arrival at Manila all the usual arrival announcements were made and only as an afterthought was an apology made for the late arrival but again no explanation given. We then parked at a remote stand. Not an issue except that no steps could be found for about 20 minutes. De planing then seemed to take an age. The reason for this became apparent as we reached the top of the stairs. A flight with about 120 people on board was being serviced by a single bus with capacity for around 30 at a time.

Extra legroom seats well worth the extra money especially now they seem to get priority boarding.

When I told the girl at the desk she told me I was lucky - some people wait 3 hours. Then we waited almost 2 hours on board to get anything to eat or drink because we had not paid the outrageous fee for meals! Since being in Hawaii I have spoken to several of my compatriots who swear they will never travel Jetstar again. Personally I am dreading the return trip to Melbourne on Friday morning. So much for Qantas Frequent Flyer card which I have had for 20 years. A very dissatisfied customer.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,2,3,1,NA,NA,1,0
turkish-airlines,/airline-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,Rustem Gode,United States,2015-01-23,I took a trip from Boston to Adana in business class. I find them very hospitable service was very good. Airbus's could be newer and Istanbul Ataturk airport could be more efficient passport police were very polite. Very affordable $600 around trip can't be beat.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,3,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Clare Alan,United Kingdom,2015-03-25,GRU-LHR 15 March 2015. Returned to BA this last 3 flights solely due to Avios companion coupon but purchased this tkt. Bossy cabin crew in the like of BA as we remember its glory days. G&T always welcome but skimpy and only one and no nibbles! Wine was good this flight. South America routes still dogged with ageing 747 as opposed to Lufthansa's modern or upgraded fleet. Outbound from LHR my TV didn't work but they did credit me 3000 avios. Food okay but snacks for such a long flight poor. KLM and AF do it better.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1
air-malta,/airline-reviews/air-malta,Air Malta customer review,Philip D Schmidt,Denmark,2012-05-21,FRA-MAL on Airbus A319. Flight on time crew were very friendly and smiling. The food was very tasty and consisted of chicken with mashed potatoes and a delicious cake. All in all I was very impressed with Air Malta.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
brussels-airlines,/airline-reviews/brussels-airlines,Brussels Airlines customer review,David McInulty,United Kingdom,2015-05-31,27/5/15 - SN3722 MAD - BRU then SN2177 BRU - MAN. First problem was poor organisation at the airport 1.5 hours until connecting flights and final destination Brussels passengers were separated. This could have been done immediately and would have reduced the delay to passengers. Problem two we were lied to by the assistants at the help desk after 2.5 hours waiting. We were told that no flights left Madrid for the UK in the afternoon then when we complained we were offered Newcastle as our only option rather than Manchester then the passengers next to us were offered a flight to Manchester so we complained again and after 3 hours were offered a flight to Manchester. We arrived 5 hours after our original flights. While the issue was not the fault of the airline the poor organisation and lying of the Brussels Airlines was the fault of Brussels Airlines. Totally unacceptable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,NA,NA,0,0
american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,S Gibbard,United Kingdom,2015-04-20,8th April AA57. Return on AA56. This was our first and last trip with AA. We were told we would be flying on the new AA planes. This simply was not true. Why should one pay the same price if you are going to fly on a dirty broken old plane in business with a ridiculous 2 3 2 seating arrangement and the entertainment system broken. We will never fly AA again. They seriously need to up their game to compete with Emirates Singapore etc.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,1,4,3,1,NA,NA,1,0
japan-airlines,/airline-reviews/japan-airlines,Japan Airlines customer review,Peter Goldsbury,Japan,2010-08-21,Narita-Amsterdam return B777-200ER. Boarding very smooth at both airports. Inflight service reasonable though flight attendants used very basic even rude English with customers whom they believed could not use Japanese which was a sharp contrast to the elegant Japanese used with Japanese passengers. The economy class seats are terrible unless you are a dwarf. They do not properly recline. The seat slides forward as the back reclines so the legs hit the seat in front: quite unsuitable for a 12-hour flight. Magic III was fair with a rather limited selection available.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1
