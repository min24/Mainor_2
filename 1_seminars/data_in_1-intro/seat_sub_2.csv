Seats were thin and as hard, legroom was tight but the worst part was that when you reclined, the seat base slid forward, causing less legroom. The plane was amazing, though, and it was quite an experience to try out the new Dreamliner.

We had chosen seats 52J and 52K bulkhead seats in the first row of the second economy class cabin which did offer more leg room. They are located next to the galley so you get a lot of noise from that area. This did not bother me at all but on a much longer flight if you wanted to sleep may have been a bad choice. The hot towels were very welcome and also the drink service was efficient. When the evening meal was served we seemed to wait ages for the cart to appear at our row. We were offered the choice offered on the menu of Beef or Salmon and then immediately told the Salmon had run out some time ago. Then why offer it? Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service. Just prior to landing the female flight attendant decided to tidy her hair and apply make-up in the galley mirror which took some time she should have done this out of sight of passengers.

Had standard legroom on outward flight. As soon as we sat down realized that these seats were narrower than the standard seats due to the fact that the entertainment remote is attached to the side of the seat rather than in the armrest. This was very uncomfortable sticking into my hip for the whole flight.. Also with no seat in front you are limited to where you can put items.

So I changed from 14A to 22G. This was a major mistake as 22G has a large metal box directly adjacent to the anchor stays of the seat in front so it means that leg space for 22G is reduced by about half. Of course this does not appear on the seating chart at check-in but had I known this I would have stayed in 14A. That said I watched a film directly after the meal service (the second Narnia film) and then woke up just before breakfast. So I must have slept for about eight hours.

lufthansa,/seat-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,Ian Oliver,Finland,2014-07-24,While Lufthansa has better leg room than most it isn't great and sleep in is just awkward. However the A380 does give much more luggage space above the seats so you can avoid putting things under the seat in front which is better. The seats have an ethernet jack and USB port but NO power sockets. Wifi is available at a small price; but using Wifi uses much more battery power in your laptop. Unless you're very lucky with battery life having no power socket is a serious disadvantage especially for cost conscious business travelers - but then again Lufthansa would like to see those in Business class anyway which isn't always possible. This negates the advantage of having Wifi available. The inflight entertainment system has an OK range of films and programmes. You can normally find 4-5 hours of viewing from the selection. The system however is quite slow and the touchscreens very temperamental. If you want more then bring a tablet computer with a long battery life loaded with films and avoid Wifi.

qantas-airways,/seat-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Alan Mackenzie,Australia,2011-04-17,I fly to and from London from Melbourne about 10 times a year and try to fly premium economy or business as much as I can. With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins. Unfortunately not. The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control. The food was pretty ordinary as well.

singapore-airlines,/seat-reviews/singapore-airlines,Singapore Airlines customer review,R Woodward,Australia,2013-04-20,First of all if you are planning on flying the A380 with SQ I would suggest you get in early and book an upper deck seat. The cabin is much quieter than the main deck making it easier to sleep etc on long trips. The aircraft appeared to be new and was very clean and tidy inside. As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777-200 that flies from Singapore to Manila. The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights. Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class. In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil). Changi airport is always a pleasure to use and as mentioned before the customer service with SQ is very good on and off the aircraft.,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,3,3,2,5,NA,NA,1

The seat width was the same width as the Virgin Australia domestic plane and the leg rest was almost impossible to use if the person in front of you reclined their seat. And once they do recline you can't get your bag from off the floor and it's almost impossible to get out of your chair.

Do Not believe the sales job on their website. The notion of paying premium price for two adults in three seats to be able to lay down is a joke. This would accommodate one adult at the most. This is being marketed for adults and families to lay down on long-haul flights. It is frustratingly cramped and the expectation set by the marketing makes it worse. The flight attendants have obviously dealt with this before as they started apologizing before we took off from LHR to LAX. We should have known something was wrong as the LHR ground staff wouldn't look us in the eye when we asked about the SkyCouch seating.

qantas-airways,/seat-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Charles Hartwell,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,We travelled in the 'green' section and in seats 38 DEF which were at the back of the section with a wall behind us. My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable. On a 13+ hour flight! there were no goodie / activity bags given out to our 5 year old and the choice of children's movies was quite limited. On our first leg a Emirates flight my daughter thought Santa was on the plane due to the huge amount of stuff she was given. We had a lot of turbulence and no warnings etc from the captain. On the Emirates leg the captain warned us in advance and then after some heavy bumps came on and reassured everyone that all was well. If I had the choice I would chose the Emirates A380 over Quantas' A380 on a long flight purely due to the much more comfortable seat better IFE and great goodies for kiddies. Thus outweighs (for us) our experience that Qantas have more friendly and attentive cabin crew. If we were to fly on the Qantas A380 it would be in the same seats or upstairs (review of our return trip to come).,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,4,4,4,3,NA,NA,1

I had thought that Turkish Airlines was a good quality airline but the experience was similar to flying on easyjet. We had seats in row 8 which has no row of seats behind it - seats B C D and E I would definitely recommend especially if you like to recline. Seats A and F I would not recommend as they couldn't recline at all - though my seat seemed not to be fully upright with a very curved seat back and I got a bad headache halfway through because of the inability to sit up straight. I wouldn't recommend paying for business class as the only difference was seats were 2x2 and food was served more regularly. There was only a flimsy partition to separate from economy. Overall the seats were okay width-wise and seemed to have a good recline (apart from mine).

Re- entering the seat required major acrobatics as well. Legroom was insufficient and recline minimal.

I'm only a 5'4"" tall female and I had a panic attack when i sat down in my seat next to where the window should be- there was no window I could look out of just the fuselage. I can't describe just how restricted the seat was- it was the sort of seat you would expect to sit in on a budget airline short haul flight not a supposedly reputable airline's long haul flight. The chairs in front were practically on top of us and our chairs hardly reclined so needless to say we didn't get any sleep. We had no idea how small these seats would be. Passengers then tried to go and sit in the empty extra legroom seats as the plane was taxiing towards the runway and some minor disputes occurred. The cabin crew did not have a handle on the situation and to our surprise concentrated on taking extra payment from these customers so they could sit in these seats with apparently extra legroom instead of directing them to return to their seats whilst the plane was moving! Overall this was the worst flight we have ever flown on and we are sorely disappointed that Virgin's standards have plummeted.

The seat width could've been a bit wider. I had some room but if you are a larger individual you will fill up the seat. With my seat reclined and my feet on the leg rest in the top position I was almost all the way stretched out. (I am 5'6"") I found it very comfortable. For 2 people the side rows are great. They are just two seats and we felt like it was our own little area. Getting out of the window seat was pretty good. The VOD system was pretty good. They had a seat-to-seat text chat feature and games you can play against other passengers. The movie selection was good. They provide noise-canceling headphones and they worked very well. Welcome drink menu for meals attentive crew and self-service bar is awesome! There was always water juice beer wine rum and soda available also bags of potato chips.

GRU-MUN flight of June 5 on Lufthansa's A340-600 was ok. My friend and I managed to get joint seats on one side of the plane. Legroom was fine though the seats were kind of narrow and thinly padded. Our flight back on a Boeing 747-8, however, was a nightmare all thanks to the seats being even narrower, the legroom non-existent, no to mention these metal boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you, which reduced your legroom even more. Initially I got bulkhead seat (18F) in the 4-seat row. If you think the regular seats are narrow, wait until you see the bulkhead ones. Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed. I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off. But that didn't do it either. I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros. So my colleague, who had an aisle seat on the same row, was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room. But sleeping is out of question on such seats. I practically got no sleep at all, just like some passengers who'd rather stand up during the whole flight than being squeezed on a seat.

etihad-airways,/seat-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,Jamie Sykes,United Kingdom,2011-07-28,The 3x4x3 lay out is just so bad it's untrue. If you have a full flight like I did on my AUH-BKK-AUH legs then get ready for pain and suffering!! The seats have so little width that you end up hanging out into the aisle with your back twisted. It also makes you fair game to me smashed into again and again with drinks/food carts. Avoid Etihad and any other airline using this B777 layout (that includes Emirates!).,Boeing 777,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,1,2,2,1,2,3,NA,NA,0
us-airways,/seat-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,Paul Joseph,United States,2011-04-30,US Airways has two versions of the A330 the A330-300 used on many European routes out of PHL and the A330-200. The A330-300 version manages to cram in 30 more seats than the A330-200. A330-300 Economy seat 25E - hands down the most uncomfortable airplane seat I have ever sat in. GI basically had to sit with my knees and legs bent sideways the entire 8 hour flight. Overhead bins barely seem to hold an average sized rollerbag. Return on A330-200 version which had much more room I could actually sit properly in the seat!,A330-300,2X4x2,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,2,3,NA,NA,0
turkish-airlines,/seat-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,M Moffat,United Kingdom,2014-01-12,This aeroplane was much nicer than the A320 we'd flown on one week earlier. Seats were wider headrests moved up and down recline was good there were individual screens - though only one movie which started about an hour into the flight. Economy seats began at row 11 and both rows 11 and seats 12 A and F have good legroom. The person in front of me had his seat fully reclined the whole flight which was annoying but not as bad as some flights I've been on. It was difficult to eat my meal that way too. The aisles seemed especially narrow and I had to walk sideways to get to the toilet. Everyone had to move their legs/elbows/etc when someone walked down the aisle - doesn't seem very good. Couldn't they make the plane 20cms wider?! Business class had a slightly sturdier partition on this plane though still a flimsy curtain separating them from economy.,AIRBUS A321,3x3,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,2,4,NA,NA,1
lufthansa,/seat-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,James McGuire,Ireland,2013-04-20,Apart from the fact that it took absolutely ages to get out of the aircraft after our 12+ Munich-San Francisco flight sitting at the very back of the aircraft had a lot of advantages. Basically the seats were very nice and there was no issue moving in and out. As in every aircraft in economy class - if you are very tall you WILL get problems. If you are of average European size you will be ok on this aircraft. The good thing was that although seats reclines fairly much you could still move and you could use your tray table if the seat in front was reclined.,AIRBUS A340,2x4x2,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,1
emirates,/seat-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,R West,Thailand,2014-01-06,Seat was narrow as many other people have mentioned. Legroom was okay but I was never comfortable - fortunately my flight was only 7 hours (MEL-SIN). The squab seems to move when the seat is reclined meaning most people didn't try to recline their seats - which helped with room for the knees.,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,3,1,3,3,NA,NA,0
emirates,/seat-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,R Rajan,Philippines,2010-05-26,The lack of a footrest made it uncomfortable even for a tall guy like me. I am lean but I think these seats will be uncomfortable for a stocky person. The 3x4x3 is a bad idea for long haul economy flights (mine was a 9 hour flight) - you end up feeling like really being packed in a can of sardines. The service wasn't the best either.,B777-300ER,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,2,3,NA,NA,0
us-airways,/seat-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,Larry Myers,United States,1970-01-01,By far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced. We went 1 leg on an Airbus 320 - that was great. Last leg on the 757 - that was horrendous. I'm only 6' tall but my knees hit the seat in front of me the entire trip. There was so little room between that seat and mine that I wasn't able to use the lap tray for my computer. The distance between adjacent seats was minimal so buckling seat belts was an arduous task. This plane is probably fine for 1 hour flights but on 7-8 hour flights it's horrible. This plane is billed as 188 passenger; it needs to be about 150 to give people an opportunity to relax on their flight.,B757,3x3,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,3,2,2,3,NA,NA,0
