aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,France,2011-05-22,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,S Ritchie,United Kingdom,2014-08-26,"I find trying to book flights virtually anywhere out of Aberdeen nigh on impossible. You used to be able to get to many destinations with one stop in London - technically impossible now thanks to BA dropping Aberdeen to London Gatwick. The only route to Gatwick is EasyJet which has two flights a day as far as I can see which will fleece you for your long haul cases and not give you any guarantee for your onward flight. This level of service to a supposedly international airport is a joke. The international arrivals ""area"" is dirty cramped and there is nowhere to sit. You have to try to stay out of the way of the crowds waiting for their luggage. You can't see people coming you have to loiter around a small corner. It's truly bizarre and the most unwelcoming arrival area I've ever seen in an airport. The luggage belts are in desperate need of an addition. It's all well and good have a nicer departures lounge and fancy coffee but where precisely are we meant to be flying? Having to walk onto the Tarmac in wind and rain or even better snowy conditions to haul your case up a flight of stairs does not exactly make for a modern airport facility. The check in desks are under-served and the security slow at busy times. The only good thing is that security and customs are actually nice here unlike everywhere else!",NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,T Collier,United Kingdom,2012-02-15,I really do wonder why Aberdeen have so many check-in desks (for BA flights) when they don't bother opening them! Had to wait near enough 30 minutes to check luggage in for it to go in the hold and made me wish I hadn't bothered! Security was very quiet thankfully so that was easy to negotiate. Ordered a burger at the bar post security and it took over 20 minutes for it to arrive - very frustrating when the place was dead and you can see the plane you are about to get on come in to land!

Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd. And if you're connecting to the US, then you have to repeat this farcical performance. A new terminal is being constructed, and while I suspect it will be posh and modern and beautiful, it will still be burdened by these transit procedures.

Terminal 1: This is where all the other airlines (not low cost) flies out to and out from. Small considering its Abu Dhabi, where all the money is at. You are required to scan your luggage prior to check in and 'apparently' only passengers are allowed to go there, even if you're just there to buy flight tickets which is located inside. Only one small coffee shop before the immigration check for you to hang with your loved ones before you say goodbye. Inside the terminal past security, only few stores available, and all are tiny. Terminal 2: This is where the low costs airlines such as Rotana Jet flies in or out from. Terminal is tiny, looks like a ghost town with only one coffee shop that surprisingly has good food. Coming in to the terminal was another nightmare. I've flown in twice here and both times were jam packed. It's as if the queue is never ending. Terminal 3: This is where all the Etihad flights come in and out from. Much better than the other 2 terminals and you can actually check in at the counter with another person accompanying you. Shops inside the terminal passed immigration is better than Terminal 1, although still not as amazing as Dubai Terminal 3 or Doha airport. Still, not recommended for transit more than 3 hours.

Well pretty soon someone will realise that AUH terminal 3 is wrong… It is narrow cramped with a ceiling that makes me (6ft’2”tall) uncomfortable. If you are using or planning to use Etihad and AUH as your hub please understand: this is not DXB Terminal 3. Not even a poor version of it. It feels like a toy airport. Quite unbelievable how bad it is. Even DMK (the old Bangkok airport) feels more spacious. Hope you will not need to use the toilets. They are disgusting.

There are long queues everywhere check in passport control security and even toilets. Staff are stressed and grouchy. There are at peak hours no seats anywhere in or near the gates.

The airport website tells you it takes 20 minutes walk but it was more like 10 but I travel light and move fairly quick. Terminal 1 was chaos! It simply is not big enough to house the traffic in and out. Long queues and very little seating. It is also very expensive even for just a drink. Inbound leg both flights arrived and departed from Terminal 3 which is much better. Still the queues into the gates are too long.

In a way I'll be sorry to see it go as its tiled doughnut satellites have stood the test of time architecturally speaking. Compare this with the monstrosity at Charles de Gaulle which seems to have aged in less than 10 years. The biggest problem in landing at the international airport is it take about 15 mins to taxi to/from the runway as the new airport terminal construction means that there are a series of contraflow taxi ways.

The process was so slow with staff leisurely processing customers at a rate of 3 minutes per person that it took 3 hours to get through.

I travelled from Turkey to Australia with a stop-over in Abu Dhabi and it was not a pleasant experience. Apparently 1.5 hrs hour is not enough to catch your flight - unless it's delayed which mine (luckily) were. It took about 25-30 minutes to get out of the plane onto a bus and drive to the airport. Then you had to walk to the transfer gates and stand in line for another 30-40 minutes for another security check meaning you are left running for your gate because boarding closes 20 minutes prior to take-off. You do not get to skip line because boarding for your flight had already started - quite frankly they make a huge deal out of stressing the difference between economy and first class passengers - only the latter are treated nicely. The information boards are not updated so only once I had arrived at the gate was I told that the plane would be delayed. At that point you're stuck in a gate with no access to any facilities.

However as previous travellers note at peak times the security clearance for transit passengers can be very poor - I saw the longest line yet all the way back to T1 nearly on the way out but no queue at all for the return flight.

T1 is a crowded dump. Signage is poor in both terminals and T3 is a 10-minute walk. Transit Security seemed pretty disorganised but only took a few minutes. T3 had plenty Duty Free Shops with prices similar to DXB. Eating options were adequate and no problems finding toilets. Air conditioning was a bit brutal and there appeared to be plenty of cold people in the middle of the night. Biggest criticism for me were the dreadful flight information screens which are tiny and only covered departures up to 45 minutes ahead - you didn't know which gate to go to and the single information desk wasn't even manned.

Arrival at AUH Terminal 3 - this is the first time in many years I'd passed through Abu Dhabi and T3 was new to me. Fairly typical modern airport terminal - clean spacious lots of steel and glass. 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 for connecting flight - while still architecturally eye catching showing its age and feeling a bit sticky. 10 or so free internet terminals several of which weren't working. On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg). Once through security the route inevitably winds it's way through a huge shopping area before reaching the T3 departure gates. As is the case with T1 there were several free internet terminals.

However seating is limited food choice is limited and the place is kept over-airconditioned.

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,A Fleming,Ghana,2010-06-13,I have been through Kotoka International Airport more times than I care to remember and the attached domestic terminal a couple of times. Against most other African airports I have passed through (around 30) it is at the top end and there is an evident desire to improve. The airport is relatively small has only two gates for international departures and there are an ever increasing list of carriers adding Accra to their routes. Departure is not usually too bad security keeps the majority who may bother travellers at bay. Many first time passengers do not realise the need to go to the extreme right end of the airport for a customs check before going to their check in queue. This can result in additional queuing for the uninitiated as there is no signage. There are well in excess of 20 counters so whilst it can be crowded in the evening as others mention it is not unmanageable. Passengers must go upstairs for immigration and here is the best eating place in the airport - the only problem is that is security are doing their job they may not allow your friends to come and eat with you. In this case there are a few outside eating options within a short walk of the departure area of which Airport Landing is probably the best for a full meal. Once through immigration the shopping options are limited and overpriced but there are places for drinks snacks or even small time gambling. Business passengers will according to their carrier be assigned to one of two lounges - whilst neither is spectacular the lounge used in the main by Skyteam partners is my preference. It has a view of the runway and usually some kind of food as well the usual drinks. This lounge is close to the departure gates for intercontinental flights but there are times when African flights including Kenyan are from the gate located at the other end of the airport. The other lounge is used by BA Emirates and also Star Alliance partners (South African Lufthansa and United and apparently soon to be Turkish). This has minimal food no natural light but is nicely decorated and probably has the better drinks selection. The main x-ray security is before you go to your gate and you then sit in an often poorly air conditioned room awaiting boarding - it is rare for boarding to start when they first announce that it is. These areas often have passengers from multiple flights at one time and there is some small risk of boarding the wrong plane in the chaos that can ensure. It is not the best end to the departure experience but with the limited space and an expanding range of carriers it is hard to overcome this and as others state staff are for the most part friendly and polite. On arrival immigration is normally not more than 10 or 15 minutes bags can be quick or slow like most places (though I find very slow for late night flights) and you must then go downstairs where you are likely to have your baggage tag checked to confirm you have picked up the correct item(s) of luggage. Beyond this point it can be a little chaotic - people will almost certainly offer you a taxi and try to carry your bag then put pressure on you for a tip. If you do not want any of these services it is best to smile and say so - personally I would always favour trying to arrange a reliable pick up at any unfamiliar airport and in Accra most hotels can arrange for this. The domestic terminal is fairly spartan but perfectly adequate.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

addis-ababa-airport,/airport-reviews/addis-ababa-airport,Addis Ababa Airport customer review,C Williams,NA,2008-06-23,Addis Ababa's Bole Intl Airport is a new 5 gate terminal. On arrival immigration does take some time but you are dealt with in a courteous and professional manner. Although there are signs on the queue's - (Ethiopians Visitors Diplomats etc) you can use any queue. The visitor queue was quite long so we walked up to the diplomat queue and we were stamped in with no questions asked. Luggage collection & customs are swift although all bags are x-rayed by customs. The terminal is beautiful with Ethiopian marble all over the ground and a lot of cultural artefacts throughout the airport. Departures/check-in is fairly swift immigration is a quick stamp out. Note that you are security screened immediately upon entering the airport and before entering your gate. The duty free areas have a nice selection of Ethiopian artefacts.

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,D Butler,Australia,2014-07-17,I wonder why the Adelaide airport design layout features an access ramp up to the departures level that is not used. It was in use when the new airport was first opened and worked brilliantly as I am sure it was designed to. So why the decision to abandon it? The current system of every single person and vehicle congregating in about 50 meters of kerbside is bordering on stupid. I was told it may be for security reasons.

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,M O'Connor,NA,2010-09-14,When the new Adelaide airport was first opened they had a great system of long term car parking where a friendly guy in a van would pick you up after you parked and take you the terminal and vice versa with very little waiting time often from the car and back. In recent years they have introduced a bus that goes every 20 minutes. Most of the time we walk to and from the terminal because inevitably the bus is not in sync with the arrivals of planes particularly at night and the bus just sits at the car park and waits until the 20minutes is up and comes over the terminal so you are at your car before he has even left. They also used to have an area that was undercover for you to sit and wait at the car park so if it was raining you didnt get wet. Well last night at 7.30 we arrived back in Adelaide. it was pouring and we waited 25 minutes for the bus (he must have fallen asleep) and then he dropped us off at a point with no shelter and all the passengers and bags got very wet. No one was happy with the service and when you pay $50 to park your car I think it is reasonable to expect something better. First of all it there is no point in having such a large bus it is mostly empty and most people dont have 20 minutes to spare to catch the bus when the arrive at the airport and don't particularly want to wait 20 minutes when they arrive back from their trip. They want to get home asap. Why did the airport change a system that was exceptionally good to something very poor? It is such a shame as everything else about the airport is great.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,Henry Tib,NA,2006-05-24,"Had my first experience travelling on a regional airline from the new Adelaide terminal. It would seem that when they designed the new terminal they forgot about the regional air passengers. The departure ""gates"" for both the regional airlines are situated at the extreme end of the terminal requiring a fair walk although you can enjoy for part of the way a 50metre travelator ( though not sure it works) . When boarding you have to be escorted by the flight crew down a number of stairs to the exit for boarding. Regional air passengers returning to Adelaide airport again have to be escorted by the co-pilot to the terminal building through a concrete passageway then go through airport security and return to the upper level departure area through a door that is well away from the designated arrival area shown on the monitors to depart the terminal. nterstate passengers have to walk down two ramps to the aircraft and it would seem for speedier boarding passengers seated at the rear of the aircraft are directed to walk across the the tarmac to the rear steps of the aircraft.

OK the new terminal was conceived during boom times (and is far too large for current needs) but they obviously decided during construction work to cut the budgets and many of the finishes (loos being the biggest area) are cheaply done and showing wear already. The public address system is useless and they are clearly saving money by not using the air-conditioning as even in October the place was like an oven.

The flight was late (probably airline's fault) half the passengers could not hear the local announcements there were 4 staff members at the desk 1 working and the others looking bored. Overall a tiring experience - and compared so badly with Helsinki Airport which is brilliantly laid out chilled and courteous.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,Dmitry Kuzin,Russian Federation,2014-07-12,I didn't like anything about my layover in AMS. Moreover the terminals were under construction. At night it was chilly there because of A/Cs working all the way. Crowded everywhere. Cars carrying disabled and seniors go very fast and almost run over people walking on foot making them step aside all the time. Not many seating areas. Duty free shops are ok. Security checks should be passed right by the boarding gate. Staff do not seem to be efficient. Add weird navigation to that and you will get a bad airport for a long stop-over.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Things are crazy enough when 300 plus people are lining up to board. And talk about rude security people. Coming in from Manchester and connecting to Portland OR we had to pass security again at the boarding gate. We put our things on the x-ray conveyor and proceeded to the whole body scanner. When I exited the scanner I was met by a young man who begins by saying ""Did you not hear my colleague tell you to empty your pockets."" And from then on he was sarcastic and demeaning about my ability to follow ""orders."" I admit that I had items in my pockets (wallet passport pen and my mobile). In all the chaos of the boarding gate I had neglected to remove them for the scanner. If I had had the time I would have sought out his supervisor.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-03-05,I generally like Schiphol it is large and busy but well laid out and has plenty of facilities and never feels particularly crowded. I have generally found queues short and staff helpful. However my most recent experience was rather less than perfect because KLM has introduced some very short transit times. Going out was 55 minutes and on return 40 minutes. The first was just doable but the second very stressful and I only made my flight by jumping a queue (on instruction from staff) and running the last part (I was not alone). The problem is exacerbated if you are on short-haul Cityhopper flights which park away from the terminal and require a bus to and from them this reduces the transit time by at least 10 minutes. On the second occasion my second flight was 'now boarding' as I got off the bus from the first flight and 'gate closing' appeared when I was still some minutes from having my boarding card checked and going through security. This was despite going straight to the gate at a brisk walk anyone unfamiliar with the airport or unable to keep up a good pace would really struggle. In the end Schiphol worked but I found the experience unnerving and I caution transit passengers with less than hour between flights to be ready for a stressful experience.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,S Smith,United States,2014-02-21,Used to be a better place to fly but security is very unprofessional as many other reviewers stated. I don't have issues with the airport itself. Clean decent options for eating (although quite expensive) nice restrooms nice areas to relax and work. On the flip side get ready to be harassed. There is now a full-body scanner at each gate so you are expected to be at your gate an hour and a half early versus the customary 45 minutes at normal airports and even after the full-body scan at the gate you may be subjected to the pat down. For all the things this airport has going it is definitely the worst when it comes to unprofessional and rude security personnel.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,T Whittington,Sweden,2013-12-29,One of the best airports in the world and comparable to Asian benchmarks such as HKG. Most recent time I used the airport two days ago I was late and arrived at the airport 2pm by train and made it at C04 at boarding 2.15pm. Security was very fast think they even upscaled a bit for the expected traffic due to Christmas. Unfortunately there was no time left to grab a bite or do some Christmas shopping but airport has sufficient places for that. In the past I have experienced once or twice (in my case <5% of times traveled through the airport) 45 minute wait for the luggage which was too long don't know what happened there the other occasion customs took too long but apparently it was a sudden peak and it took some time to call some extra staff. These two occasions however are not representing the overall performance. The walking distance are normally fine you can be unlucky when you have a stopover and need to go from H peer to B that will take a good twenty minutes. But that shouldn't be a problem for the average healthy person. Still better than a train or worse shuttle bus.

For some reasons I had to collect my luggage and recheck-in at AMS. There were huge queue on both at the check-in and passport control area. A long walk at this airport is very common. Eventually it was almost an hour from the beginning of my check-in time to the departure gate. My suggestion to those are going to use AMS for their start or transit point have yourself present at least 2 hours at the airport before your departure time. On my departure back to Kuala Lumpur on the 14th of September I was surprised when there was almost no queue at the check-in counter. Especially the designated counter for web check-in service. The agent was friendly. As usual there was a long queue at the passport control and a long walk to the departure gate. In general the airport is clean.

I am an EU-Passport holder my Partner is Mexican and I had no issues passing with her through the much shorter EU Passport holder line at immigration. Security check took 15 minutes.

The extra security check at the gate for the AMS to MSP flight was expected what was not expected was being physically hit by the Dutch equivalent of TSA. The trays for laptops passing through the metal detector are sized to handle pocket change. I was worried that my laptop would fall from the tray. I walked through the whole body scanner all the while pre-occupied with what was happening with my laptop. After exiting the body scanner I walked over to the metal detector to retrieve my laptop. Next thing I know this TSA guy is hitting me on the back and yelling 'I'm not finished with you'. I was completely surprised and taken aback. There were no signs or people waiting just after exiting the body scanner saying I should stay put. I told the TSA guy that I didn't know I had done anything wrong and he yelled again that he wasn't finished. For those Americans who constantly complain about USA TSA try flying through AMS.

Departure is rather chaotic you queue to check-in (about 20 minutes in our case) and to go through emigration (over 30 minutes) though security was cleared quickly. Once in the terminal it was crowded but had (just) enough seating. The snack bar was reasonably priced but souvenirs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the island. The good news (hopefully) is that the new terminal building is complete and due to open in the next few weeks according to locals it is much larger than the present one and looks a better design - there are several dedicated piers for large aircraft.

Very full flight for the cricket so had to queue to ages to clear through immigration. Not helped by the fact that 2 young ladies didn’t know where their accommodation was (why are they so fussy about this?) and one inebriated passenger had lost his passport. Porters were very pushy and hard to get rid of. Departed on 3 Nov - a nightmare. Flights were very full and so there were long queues to check in not helped by the fact there are no self service machines. None of the ATMs at the airport or the nearby Bank of Antigua were working so we ended up having to borrow money off other passengers to pay our departure tax. Not sure what this tax is for given the woeful state of the airport. Again long queues for immigration – perhaps they were wary of our NZ passports? Very few shops not enough seats café inadequate.

From the point of view of arriving at this airport it is mediocre at best. Once off the plane you frantically search for the baggage claim signs. This could be improved upon greatly. Once getting downstairs to the shuttles between concourses you are rushed to the baggage claim efficiently. The rental car facilities are well maintained and usually staffed. Leaving the rental car facility is simple then you enter and head directly into the hell that is baggage check-in. If you are fortunate carry-on you are in luck not much waiting. Typically we travel with odd engineering tools which can be a hassel to explain to TSA ""agents"" who apparently moonlight as Walmart employees. So a carry-on is usually in favor. When you approach the desk and I've only struggled with Delta check-in agents are often discourteous. Many stand around under signs which indicate that terminal is open and when you approach them they are quick to inform you to choose another line. The lines are long because only one person usually checks bags per every 25 people standing in line. Once through this heading for security is simple. There are many places to chop and eat both inside and outside security. The frustration here is their ""expert traveler"" security point. Located at the end of the hall quite often you get stragglers who miss the main security gate. I have no problem spending a few minutes in security if means I get home safely. My frustration is with those who are completely unprepared and think the world has to wait on them. Once through heading to your gate is simple - at the gate the shops and eateries throughout the concourses. But there isn't enough seating in the gate area for those on each plane. Often crowds and lines form into the main aisle putting you harms way of being run over with impatient shuttle (golf cart) drivers chauffeuring loads of elderly and morbidly obese people. Grab something to eat if there's room and if you have time to stand in line. Do some shopping or find a seat four gates away.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,David Brown,United Kingdom,2010-10-19,This is a crazy airport departing out of Atlanta was fine but arriving from overseas was ridiculous. Once you have waited for an age at immigration and then waited for your baggage you start to think you are home free but no. The signage and information is very poor and before you know it you have security personnel shouting at you as they take your checked baggage off you and it disappears. Then for you it's shoes off x ray the full routine as they do another full security screening. Then it's on a train that takes for ever to get back to the main terminal and another wait for your bags to appear. But don't believe the carousel number it's a lucky dip at this stage. We arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 3pm from Europe. It took 2 and half hours before we got out of the terminal. We shall avoid in the future.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2010-07-15,Big and seemingly always crowded but with lots of facilities including many many shops and eateries. We were fortunate enough to be traveling international Business Class so got free use of the Delta Sky Clubs. There are several in the airport but only the one in Terminal E (I believe) has showers and there are only two so there can be a wait. The train between terminals can get crowded but they are frequent. Lines for Immigration moved quickly though they didn't open until 5:30 a.m. so when our flight from Brazil arrived early (about 5:15) we had to wait on the plane until 5:30 until we could even disembark (and then there was the long walk to actually get to Immigration). On our return (again for a connection) we could not find our flight leaving 2 hours later on the departures board and the agent at the airline customer service desk said that sometimes flights don't make it onto all boards at the same time.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,Rich Jenkins,United States,2010-01-08,"ATL's major function is providing domestic connections for Delta passengers and it does this fairly well with an efficient train system between concourses. OTOH the concourses are long and Delta customer service (such as it is) has been greatly cut back. Earlier this year I encountered a situation where the wrong type of aircraft had been provided (after a long delay and cancellation of flights before and after ours) and the ticket staff were less than gracious in dealing with the fallout. The food selection remains relatively unhealthy and the largest food court (outside of the main terminal) tends to be crowded. The selection of reading material is generally pretty awful but typical of Atlanta in general. CNN is loud and inescapable and the airport generally provides even less opportunity for peace and quiet than the average. Departure security is centralized and unpredictable but not quite as timeconsuming as it was 2-3 years ago. The ""secret"" North terminal alternative to the main terminal security has been closed--this had provided much faster screening because it was known only to people using the T terminal and carriers other than Delta. Baggage areas have been remodeled but there no longer is security to check tags. Beware of taxi operators who approach you in the baggage claim as they charge more than the ones in the queue outside. Expect taxi drivers to not know anything other than major hotels - bring mapquest-type directions to your destination. Long time Atlantans don't know much of the area either. Marta rapid transit service has gotten slightly better although the process of paying for fares with cards is cumbersome compared with the old token system. Marta is the best way to reach major hotels downtown in Midtown and Buckhead. Customer service is generally horrible in the airport although better with carriers other than Delta. Despite many years of living in ATL and much international travel I always cleared customs elsewhere (my int'l travel was mostly to Asia and on United so ATL was rarely feasible) my understanding is that international arrivals are variable and often unpleasant. The international terminal which used to be dismal is apparently being redone. Delays are common at this airport - the weather in the Atlanta area is volatile with downpours and thunder storms being quite common in Spring and summer plus Atlanta gets the back end of hurricanes in the fall. Often things will seem mild or only drizzly at the airport but will be violent somewhere in an nearby flight path and this will cause delays. Some delays occur because of problems elsewhere in an airline's hub/spoke system and this is particularly true of Delta which dominates the airport. Morning departures are more predictable and less prone to delay than afternoon or evening flights.",NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Auckland is a good airport and is a breeze to use polite helpful staff and a large departure hall plentiful food outlets and you don't have to walk miles to get to your gate. You also don't get ambushed by staff trying to sell you things as you do at many American airports as you walk through duty free to reach your gate. The arrivals hall is attached to departures so if you need to transfer its a 2 minute walk.

On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon.

For most of the day it's fairly quiet with REX operating its 36 seaters 3 times per day. However within a 2 hour timeframe both Virgin and Jetstar operate their 180-seaters into and out of the airport which causes it to almost reach breaking point.

You walk into the baggage collection which consists of a small room with the smallest conveyor belt of any airport I've seen. Once you have retrieved your luggage you walk past a small desk which I think was customs you are then outside and ready to be hassled by numerous dodgy taxi drivers. When departing from Baneasa ensure you arrive early as the queues are appalling. Our flight had 2 check-in desks but only one was open. Long queues to get through security before the departure lounge. There are 4 doors onto the runway and 3 or 4 screens which are impossible to read.

I've flown in and out of BLR both on domestic and international flights several times and I find the terminal building to be light airy and very pleasant. My domestic experience is first rate. Our bags are always out within 5 mins of arriving at the belt - never the case in the UK or the 'Western' world. Departure - numerous security lines and clear signage plenty of shops and restaurants. Genuinely no complaints. International - arrival security check is cumbersome and time consuming and the immigration process can be bureaucratic but after that the bags are out quickly and getting a cab is safe easy and well priced.

Then after a few days I used this airport for the Bangalore - Chennai domestic leg via Jet airways as well. The airport has got good facilities and offers a reasonable first impression of the city. All the immigration counters were open and it helped the passengers to move out of the section quickly. However the space between the steps / escalator leading to the immigration hall and the counters is not large enough which makes the queuing a bit difficult than it should otherwise. The on-arrival visa counter had good signage with helpful attendant being present. The customs was a breeze and the carousel worked adequately well.

bangalore-airport,/airport-reviews/bangalore-airport,Bangalore Airport customer review,S Sankar,NA,2008-09-05,Used BIAL 4 times within 2 weeks for 3 domestic flights and one international departure. I found the whole experience very good. Everyone cribs about the distance of the new airport to the city centre. Over time people will forget about the old airport and will factor the distance to the new airport into their overall journey. Once the Namma metro is complete the journey will be even more convenient. At the moment one has to travel either by taxi or take the city bus. The city bus transfer is clearly signposted and very efficient with around 8 different routes into the city departing every 20mins or so. My journey to/from Indiranagar took just over an hour on all occasions. The airport itself is finally the first international standard airport in India (I haven't been to the new airport in HYD) with decent shops the Kingfisher bar cafes lots of immigration and security queus and clean tiolets! My personal overall experience was very positive. The only issue I could see was with the size of the international departure lounge. My BA 747 was full and the 350 passengers took up around half of the available seats in the international departure area. I imagine that at around midnight when AF LH TG SQ and KL all operate 777s or A330s that the departure area will be bursting at its seams.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,I've been a regular traveller (10-15 times/year) through Suvarnabhumi since it opened in 2006. It's a large airport and it's busy - always. Rule #1 - check in early. Rule #2 - if you have to wait for check-in baggage don't expect to be in a taxi less than 1.5 hours after landing. If you manage 45 mins you've done pretty well. Check-in can be slow but that's down to the airlines. (I always check-in online). Most of them seem to have enough counters available and international flights will typically be open 3 hours before Departure and occasionally 4 hours - so check in early. Upstairs Security Screening is usually only a few minutes wait I've never waited more than 10 minutes and I can think of many worse airports in this respect. Immigration both in Arrivals and Departures is poor and can be the longest wait of the trip through the airport but if you've allowed enough time it is what it is - chill and bring a book. The Baggage Hall is big enough belts are well sign posted and the longest I've ever waited on a bag was a Domestic Flight from Chiang Mai (about the same length of time as the flight). 20 mins in the baggage hall would be more typical. You very rarely get stopped in Customs and queuing times for taxi's is not bad. If you have to wait around there are plenty lounges Airside and seating in the lower levels both Landside and Airside. The Terminal Hotels are expensive and there are better options locally or in the city. Food is expensive and the choice isn't great but there is a food court Landside which is good value. (Burger King seems the busiest eating place). I rarely bother with Duty Free Shopping in BKK - I can shop better in the city. Distances to and from the gates are lengthy in some cases but they're pretty good at keeping the travelators working. Toilet cleanliness may not be at the standards of the best airports but they are cleaned regularly. Signs are OK and Flight Information Screens are very good. Touts still congregate in Arrivals and I still ignore them. The Airport Rail Link isn't the blast to and from the city which was envisioned but it works adequately. Unfortunately it's pretty overcrowded at peak times because of stops at intermediate stations. BKK is a better airport than it was 5 years ago but the Immigration 'experience' is poor and is a major bottleneck. Security is much better organised than before and the budget airlines moving to Don Mueang has taken some pressure off BKK. Given the space they have and passenger numbers they handle BKK should be a better airport than it is and as a passenger it's not a good airport to be in a hurry to get through. Lots of problems go away given enough time.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Only problem was that some of the signage is far from clear several staff who we asked were unsure one even directing us to the right gate but to where arrivals were processed when we eventually found the right route 300 people were kept locked out of the gate and had to stand or sit on the floor in a corridor.

There's not much seating in Departures so it's best to arrive around the time your check-in opens (typically 3 hours with International Flights). I always check-in online for shorter queuing times. The upstairs security screening is reasonably efficient as is Immigration with somebody usually managing the queue system. Check-in early and kill time airside rather than checking in late and having to rush. I don't bother with Duty Free in BKK - it's expensive as are all the airside restaurants. There's not much seating in the main concourse but there are quiet areas 1 level down and obviously out towards the gates. Arrivals usually commences with a log walk from a remote gate but plenty travellators to help you on your way and highly variable queuing times for Immigration 20 minutes would be typical most times of they day but an hour not unusual at busy times. The baggage is pretty efficient in BKK and it's unusual to have to wait more than a few minutes for luggage. Plenty of taxi touts in Arrivals but just follow the signs downstairs for Public Taxi or Airport Rail Link. Also the lower levels are quieter if you have to spend a few hours between flights. There's also a food court with better Thai food than the airport restaurants. Now they have Security Screening out of the way upstairs in Departures the whole flow of the airport has improved.

Journey out of BKK was a bit of a nightmare the woman at the check-in desk was quite rude. I was looking around for the resealable bags for the liquids in my hand luggage and none were to be found despite various empty desk slots for them and signs reminding you about the security procedure.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,A Snelling,United States,2012-11-21,Arrival - Fine experience even after 30+ hours en route from the US. It only took five minutes to clear immigration. The bags took awhile to arrive but this just meant that I had time to exchange money at one of the many (competitive) vendors in the arrivals area. Departure - Horrible airport. It hard to believe that it is only six years old. The design seems like something from another era. Up through security I have no major complaints but then the entire experience really goes downhill. The first priority does not seem to be getting you to your gate but rather making sure you are exposed to every single one of the very high end shops. I did not see one newsstand or bookstore anywhere although I did finally see a great drugstore. There are some normal food options toward the end. The gate situation could not have been designed by anyone who travels much. You sit outside the gate area in a place with few seats until shortly before boarding. It is a crowded miserable experience. Your boarding cards are submitted as you enter the (secure) gate area where more seating is available.

There are now better arrangements in both Arrivals and Departures Immigration (10 mins and 5 mins) in early evening which a few months was anywhere up to an hour or more.

I noticed that the toilets are more well-maintained. Taxi queue is also efficient. However on departure horrors! First the Customs Office was not manned at all (I arrived at 10am) so I was not able to have my VAT Refund validated. I couldn't wait any further after seeing the extensively long queues to passport control and subsequently to security check. I must have queued for almost an hour. Naturally since my refund forms were not validated I was not able to get my refund back (was told I have 60 days) to claim my refund (if and when I return to Bangkok during this time frame). After reading a lot of reviews re duty free prices I decided to skip shopping. Most restaurants are filled with customers so I was not able to grab a snack and decided to wait for the inflight meal served at almost 2:30pm. Overall Suvarnabhumi Airport is comparably better with other airports in Asia (except Changi HKIA and KLIA in that order).

They've also done away with this ridiculous system where Landside some of the travelators were restricted to Airport Pass users (ie to get between floors you had to use the Elevators). BKK airport management have finally come to realise that the airport is there to serve the needs of the customers - not preferences of the employees.

It looks as though it will have a very nice landside terminal when the the work is finished and once through security the (I hope) temporary shopping arrangements will improve once the new units are finished. Things must have moved on quite a bit since October because the airside waiting areas at the gates seemed adequate with four wide-bodies on the stands and no sign of overcrowding. Improvements could be made in the way that check-in queues are managed with handling agent staff positioned at the entry to the queues rather than down at the desk end. On the second occasion I used the airport the signage above the desks clashed with airline information displayed on the monitors above them and resulted in some annoyance among people in the wrong queues - hence the comment about need for agents at the tail end of a queue. The public address system could also be improved (they REALLY need a good sound engineer to sort out the audio). There also seems to be a problem with the way airlines access the PA system. It would be better if there was a single person making all the announcements. That would reduce the variation in announcement ""styles"" (some barely decipherable) and techniques (some too close to the microphone and some to far away) and would ensure that all announcements were aired. One last improvement would be the change of access to the business lounge so that it was from airside rather than landside. That would make it a much more relaxing place because users would already be through security and not have to judge when to join the security queue so that they would be on time for boarding. I suppose the down side of that would be that the lounge would need to be bigger to accommodate a greater number of users.

Bus line 50 connects the airport to Basel central station every 10 mins - reliable service at CHF5.80 one-way travel time around 20 mins. On the French side more limited service - no direct connection to Mulhouse: a shuttle bus brings you first to Saint-Louis railway station from there you can catch a regional train to Mulhouse. Upon departure check-in at the self-service machines hassle-free. No queue at security but staff prefers speaking French than English. In the public area large terrace with nice views on the apron. The restaurant on the Swiss side is truly delicious with decent prices; but I would rather avoid the bistro on the French side - gloomy with only basic food. Boarding gates are lacking proper airconditioning so that it can quickly become very warm there. French domestic flights are cheaper when entering MLH Mulhouse as destination - on the opposite international flights are cheaper with BSL Basel as destination.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Arrival with LH was easy and pleasant with quick baggage and laid-back passport control. Departing a few days later with BA was the same although I wouldn't fancy going through security if the airport was very busy - few channels and slightly officious French staff with little or no English.

The shuttle bus in Paris are something organised but when I arrived there I had to queue and so many people were waiting there that I feared not being able to get in. At 10 AM no bus were at the starting point but at 10.15 AM 13 buses had arrived. In Beauvais low cost companies have this tiny box where you have to put your luggage to be able to get in the plane. There are people who check and ask every passenger to fit their hand luggage in the box and if it doesn't send you back to the company. The security people are nice and welcoming it's just a pain to queue for 100 meters going along bags' check identity check and security check.

Instead you must transit through dusty tired old Terminal 2 with very limited food and shopping choices. Lounge areas for premium passengers are equally drab with old furniture and lacklustre food. The good part is that T2 is uncrowded most of the time since most all other airlines except Skyteam have moved to T3. Hence there are almost no lines for check-in security and customs and baggage claim is speedy. Departing international flights out of T2 will often get to enjoy a virtually deserted concourse with the fellow passengers on your flight the only others in the building.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

This place is huge dreary inefficient and wreathed in a toxic smog. Had a 3-hour connection window which was almost not enough. As an international transit passenger I had to queue for a passport check and transit visa then I got dumped into the general security screening which was chaos. This happened on the way back too. Both flights out of PEK were loaded using buses out to the tarmac. This when several terminal gates were available. So a big plane loaded via one stairway in the cold and smog. Not nice and unacceptable for a big newish airport and its national carrier. Even the Air China lounge to which I managed to get access on a 6-hour layover another time is dreary and makeshift.

Beijing Airport is a pleasant and modern airport albeit one that feels a bit like a huge empty cavern. Free WiFi is available. However you need to register in person at the Business Center or a few other airport locations to get a user ID and PIN code that you then need to submit via a rather user- unfriendly web page. Apart from the cumbersome activation procedure I have no complaints about the WiFi service. The staff are generally polite and efficient despite their limited command of English. However there need to be more dining options within T3; currently there is little else aside from a Chinese  Pizza Hut and a bunch of cafes.

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,M Bates,NA,2009-02-16,The new Beijing Capital Terminal 3 is architecturally fantastic especially from the air. The check-in area is huge and not too crowded and generally easy to navigate and I have always found the check-in process to be reasonably smooth whether for domestic or international flights. However things go downhill from there. Although the check-in area is huge all the passengers are congregated into one smallish area for access to the gates. Domestic passengers have it easy in that once through the security check the gates are right there in the same building as the ground side area. But as in the old terminals at this airport it seems like the airport authority likes to bus as many passengers as possible to remote stands which is simply ridiculous in a modern airport. It is even more ridiculous when you are on the bus looking at the airport with most of the gates unoccupied and all the planes parked a mile or so away on remote stands. I have travelled on domestic flights through this terminal eight times since it opened last year and only once have been to a proper gate. As for the international passengers all have to go down two escalators to a train that is often broken. You then get transported out to the furthest of the three buildings at the end of the dragon (the intermediate building is not in operation yet) where you then immediately go into the passport control and tiny queuing areas for security. Once through into the airside terminal be sure to have a jacket as it is always about 10C in that building. There are lots of glitzy shops to spend money in but almost nowhere to eat. For such a grand project there are so many small problems with this airport that could have been fixed with just a little thought. Regardless of this it is still 100 times better than the two other decrepit terminals at this airport.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

""Upgrading"" the security area is currently causing regular 40/50 minute delays-after check-in. Airside insufficient seating had passengers standing and blocking walk ways whilst awaiting their flight departures-and this was mid-afternoon in November as opposed to a peak high season departure time. The arrival of Ryanair and the proposed January arrival of Easyjet (from BFS-Belfast International) has added to the considerable strain this facility was under over 3 years ago yet there are no signs of the expansion of passenger facilities.

Wet windy and feeling decidedly unwelcome particularly having travelled in-bound from Singapore (via LHR). Welcome to George Best City of Belfast Airport. Yes you really are welcome to it! Out-bound my driver was asked for a £1 drop off ""fee"" a few yards from the main entrance doors. He quite rightly refused to pay and I happily walked probably the most expensive 50 yards in the world! At security about 40 passengers queued to use the single x-ray machine (2 were not even turned on). Surly staff grunted at exasperated passengers without as much a courteous thank you or even the slightest suggestion of a smile.

Anyone who is looking for the facilities you find at major German Airports like HAM or CGN (let alone MUC) is in for a serious disappointment but take SFX for what it is - a former communist airfield smartened up to deal predominantly with low cost airlines - and it really isn't bad at all. Seating is definitely an issue both in the Terminal A lounge area and at the departure gates. Like some of the other reviewers I wouldn't fancy being delayed here. On the other hand I found the security and airline staff friendly and efficient although unfortunately the same cannot be said for the passport control officers who were checking outbound passengers at the entrance to Gate 65 when I departed.

Arriving we had learned from a previous disastrous experience when we raced off the plane and straight through the narrow reception area which incorporates an individual belt receiving bags from your flight only. On that previous occasion we were stranded inside the main terminal area and it took an awful lot of time indeed to sort out the mistake and reclaim our ""abandoned"" luggage in a distant corner. This time we made no mistake though it strikes me that this unique element of the Tegel experience does require greater explanation from the airlines on the plane before arrival.The close location of the bus station with respect to the terminal coupled with the outstanding Berlin public transport system which allows routes and times to be discovered in minute detail i.e. down to the nearest specific bus-stop on the net before arriving meant that the trip to our hotel was well nigh effortless even at such a late hour. Naturally the trip back to the airport on public transport was equally impressive but on arrival there things were marginally less impressive; though only marginally. The Air Berlin flight was leaving from terminal C which is a fairly short walk away from the main terminal. C is located on the same level as the runway whereas the main historic terminal is located some 20m higher but there is an excellent capacious lift available. Terminal C is designed on the shed principle aka as the cornflakes box principle viz a cuboid box with the pavement at the front the planes at the back and with check in taking place towards the front. The longest edge of the box is parallel to the runway. One half of the front of the box is taken up with a single large bookstall type business and a single cafeteria style business with standard European airport rip-off prices for drinks. The only seating space before passing through the security screening is at the cafeteria. In other words there is no ordinary seating for waiting whatsoever here. However the piece-de-resistence is the queue for security. All 8 machines are in the same corner and no thought whatsoever has been given to controlling the access to these machines. Anyone wishing to avail themselves of machine 8 at the end of the hall must actually break through lines 1-7 to get there. Just as anyone wanting access to machine 7 must break through lines 2-6. And so on if not quite ad infinitum. Unbelievable in a facility opened in the last 12 months in the European city with the most extensively inexpensively impressive public transport network I have yet seen. Once through the ""Tax-free shopping mall"" (sic) which provides the only route available to get to the plane the next part of the box is at least spacious and does have a fairly good supply of seating beside the gates leading straight out onto the runway with the planes parked within 10m of the terminal. On a quiet Tuesday afternoon in April with the sun shining none of these negative elements caused any serious problems but at a busy time on a wet or snowy winter day I am sure the experience would be much less pleasant.",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Hence the delay. Once through there are only a couple of tables and chairs so you struggle with the largest tray imaginable and have to sit on the floor to put everything back again. When will the airport authorities realise that they have made a huge mistake and address this problem. And don't even start me on charging to drop off airport users.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,David Brown,United Kingdom,2010-10-19,Beware travellers attempting to travel through BHX. This airport has succumbed to a lack of investment in people and equipment. Security is one of the worst manned and slowest there is out there. I now won't even think of turning up with 45 minutes before my flight with just hand luggage for an early morning flight. Even business class travellers beware the priority pass may save you having to queue around the food court and upper atrium but doesn't save you from the other queues once behind the 'security wall'. That said the departure lounge is very pleasant with plenty of choice for eating and drinking and not very long queues as most people have spent so long in security they have had to go straight to the gate. Coming back in to BHX you may have more luck occasionally the IRIS system is working in immigration and you can sail through (but I never seen it) and sometimes the queue at immigration is easy. However if you land just after a 777 from Asia expect to wait a long time. What you see on duty is what they have there seems to be no one in the wings ready to improve the flow. Unfortunately it's my local airport and has good connections around the world but I wouldn't recommend it. Oh and £1 for every 15 minutes just to pick up or drop off passengers.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Birmingham is a lovely airport not small but not huge. Every thing you need is there and the shops in departures are normal not just high end over priced clothes and hand bags! I've only had one 20 minute delay and airport staff have been great. The only gripe is the NCP parking on site although not the airports direct fault the website says its covered and a 2 minute walk to the terminal its open air and a 10-12 min walk at a brisk pace or 5 mins on the free bus (every 5-8 mins or so) still better then Heathrow or Gatwick.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2010-08-17,Birmingham Airport seems to be going down the road of ripping customers off at every opportunity. Firstly you have to pay £1 just to drop someone off. They charge Â£3 per 15 minutes if you dare take more than 15 mins at the drop-off area. It used to be free but according to one of the police officers at the airport due to anti-terror measures the charges were brought in along with a new drop-off area. The airport luggage trollies cost £1 (you don't get your £1 back). The plastic bags cost £1 at the security point. Upon arrival at the airport baggage always takes about an hour to arrive in the baggage reclaim area and you are stung again for a £1 luggage trolley.

birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,Nick Wilcock,United Kingdom,2010-03-07,This used to be a very pleasant airport. But it has slipped in a couple of areas of late. The first impression if you use Long Term Car Park 1 is the bus to the terminals. This used to be for car park passengers only and it stopped at both terminals. Now it is for car park passenger 'set down' passengers using the free 15 minute option and airport staff. As a result it is slow and meanders its way through the car park before stopping at a point which still requires an open air walk to reach Terminal 2 departures. Quite why business travellers should be forced to share a bus with airport ramp workers is beyond me - no other airport mixes staff and passenger buses. The 'priority channel' at security causes resentment from passengers queuing in the 'normal' access - particularly when only 2 out of 5 checking lanes are available. Servisair lounge offers very little in the way of comfort food or beverages and the thumping music from the Tie Rack shop nearby is intrusive. On return the automatic passport readers are a plus - but then it all goes wrong again with the latest change to car parking. You can no longer pay in the terminal; instead you have to drive to the exit gate park pay in a draughty shed with only 2 machines (which do not have clear instructions for use) then back out into the oncoming traffic to drive to the exit lanes. Whoever came up with this stupid idea should go and visit other airports to see how car parking is managed!,NA,NA,NA,4,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

However the majority of the staff at the airport are not that friendly. A smile seems too much of an effort. The airport security staff seem to have the biggest attitude problems. I realize they have a responsible job and take things seriously but I think it sometimes goes a bit too far. Instead of the 20 x 20 cm plastic freezer bag for carry on liquids I unfortunately had a 23 x 15 bag. (Who honestly measures this bag before packing?) I was scolded by a female staff member who obviously wasnt too happy at this time of the morning (0730) and was told to go over to a machine where I could purchase 4 plastic bags of the required size for GBP1.

Our flight was 8.35am and we had to leave home at 5.30am did not have time to buy any mags or newspapers as most of our flight had already boarded. The £10 surcharge for each passenger means it would be cheaper to pay for car parking we have been flying from Blackpool for over 5 years and the improvement fee does not seem to be spent anywhere that we could see so as far as I am concerned it was a con.

blackpool-airport,/airport-reviews/blackpool-airport,Blackpool Airport customer review,A Roberts,United Kingdom,2011-09-20,A basic and small airport which although advantageous at times is also its downfall. On the third time of flying out of here recently myself and my family were booked on one of the two flights scheduled to depart at the same time this showed how inadequate this airport is at handling more than one flight. The sole cafe in the departure was overwhelmed to a point where the lack of staff meant they could only offer bacon/sausage/egg barms instead of the other breakfast offerings such as a Full English. It is unacceptable that the facilities are not geared to cope with more than one flight. The second criticism is the car park. Spaces are effectively unmarked and in bad condition the overflow car park to the side of the terminal building is a large lawn with some tarmac for cars to drive along. The £10 Airport Development Fee - I am struggling to see how this could be justified there is little evidence of this having been spent since its implementation and little/no evidence of development plans with this money.

bogota-airport,/airport-reviews/bogota-airport,Bogota Airport customer review,Richard Winger,NA,2010-08-23,BOG is turning into a total disaster under the twin pressures of increasing passenger loads and a long overdue incredibly slow renovation. Inbound immigration is often understaffed and the wait can be upwards of an hour. Domestic connections on the main local airline Avianca require another long wait for a long ride to their domestic terminal. Because the buses don't run frequently enough they are always packed and uncomfortable. Outbound if you are a premium passenger check in at Avianca is efficient. If you are just a normal person count an hour to get to the check in desk. Security and outbound immigration have improved and are now mostly quick. Avianca's international lounge renovated only two years ago is already run down with minimum food and beverage offerings but blaring TV sets all over the place. The second security check on US bound flights is a free for all. Surprisingly Avianca the main carrier at the airport has except for check in no fast track for premium passengers so regardless of how much you pay for your ticket or what elite status you have you stand in line with everybody else. Very democratic certainly but not very effective if the carrier wants to position Bogota as a hub for business travel into South America.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Presently its like a DIY airport made out of Ikea flatpack. When you check in you have to take your bags round to a separate desk for them to be tagged and sent to the plane. This created a pretty chaotic and busy environment. The queue for security was long and merged with the queues for the bag drop area. Once through security there were more queues that snake round the shopping section whilst people wait to go through immigration and the boarding areas for the flights. This means that its impossible to look round the retail area and food areas. It was all so chaotic and such a muddle! I'd hate to think what it'll be like once peak season kicks in. As i said, i think they're in the process of constructing this terminal, which is called the 'billi' terminal, as it had a very temporary feel to it.

This came and went still no information given no offer of food vouchers or hot drinks. The bar/cafe closed only the goodwill of the staff in WH Smiths allowed us to purchase drinks and snacks. Then it was announced that our flight would be the following morning and hotel accommodation was being sought. We then had to queue to say who wanted accommodation. Still no offer of food the Airport Manager arrived a lot later and hot drinks were made available about 11.45. I was in the first taxi to a hotel and was in the hotel by 00.15 being told to be ready for collection to airport at 05.00. On arrival we had to queue again to collect new boarding cards (this was not conveyed either the night before or on arrival at the airport) no one knew the time of our flight and no one seemed to want to speak to us again no offer of food or hot drink vouchers.

bournemouth-airport,/airport-reviews/bournemouth-airport,Bournemouth Airport customer review,L Joyce,United Kingdom,2014-07-27,I know that the security info for airports from the government must change on a daily basis however the people who work at Bournemouth International Airport clearly don't want their jobs if recent experience is anything to go by. I have had the experience of this by flying out of there twice in a month. Once to Ibiza in June with Ryannair and I have just got back from Corfu flying with Thomson. I remember the days of Bath Travel when flying from Bournemouth was such a luxury. Having an airport not ten minutes away from your home and with happy smiling people was such a novelty. Since it has been sold to Manchester Airports I have noticed a very big decline in Customer Service. Lets start with the airport itself. To pay £2.50 for half an hour drop off is just a rip off and encourages people to be dropped off at the road before the airport. In the grand scheme of things £2.50 is not a lot but when hardly any other airport in Britain does this it makes you feel that you are somehow being scammed. The toilets are fine but there is simply not enough of them especially when it comes to last minute. I do like the Duty Free shop and the WH Smith the cafe is also fine and very clean with a wide range of dishes. When I flew to Ibiza in June I had my trusty clear sandwich bag which I have used at Gatwick various terminals at Heathrow and Southampton. This wasn't an issue here. Fast forward three weeks later to last week where I was stopped and told that my clear bag was too big and I needed to buy one of their bags for £1. (Gatwick and Heathrow hand these bags out for free so yes another way for Bournemouth to make money out of you). When I tried to say that I had used it three weeks before and it was fine the security guy simply told me that the other person shouldn't have let me through. I get the feeling that it depends which jobsworth you have on that day. Now my real reason for deciding to complain is the fact that Bournemouth airport offers online check in. We had reserved seats for both flights but checked in anyway to print the boarding passes. 20 minutes later I have filled in all their questions online with our details etc however unlike the big airports they don't offer a 'bag drop which I wasn't aware of and isn't mentioned online and which also meant that we still had to queue for 40 minutes and then a further 20 minutes at the check in desk while the Check in Clerk weighed our bags hand luggage checked our passports and documents even though we had already printed out our boarding passes. All this was done without a word or a smile. I don't see the point in offering a 'check in online' service if you still have to go through the usual process. The airport is simply too small and the airlines cannot be bothered to provide enough staff I am afraid that this has turned me back to the biggies or even Southampton. The only advantage to this airport is that it is so close to home. I will happily travel the distance to Gatwick again.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty. It took over half an hour to get my bags. Signage to taxis busses etc. is inadequate. Still all in all I'd rate BSB above many other Brazilaian airports.

The fact that this was a Friday afternoon when parliamentarians may have been fleeing Brasilia to return to their home towns may have exacerbated the situation.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,D Collins,Australia,2013-09-12,I pass through BNE international twice a year - out of and into Australia from Asia where I work and usually exclusively fly Qantas. Generally I find the processing outbound good - but I do have Gold FF status so never queue for Economy. QF staff generally good. The Xpress service into Immigration is mostly not open and queues are long but the agents have generally been friendly and polite. Security screening tends to be ordered chaos but again mostly polite. Once inside you are basically at the mercy of retailers of over priced brands and so called duty free that in many instances is way above retail prices at the bigger chains. Seating is poorly distributed and caters mostly for consumers fast food so just finding somewhere to rest while waiting to board is pretty hit and miss. I do use the Qantas Business Class lounge which is usually not too crowded and definitely a bonus and worth it if you are prepared to fork out the fee for the Qantas Club; the priority boarding is also a huge bonus! Inbound I find usually OK even weaving through the Duty Free shop where at least the booze is significantly cheaper than retail. I use an ePassport now and haven't had a problem yet but even when using the agents didn't have a long wait. There's little point worrying even if it is slow because the baggage is going to be a longish time in arriving. Lifts to the various exit points outside Customs in the Arrivals Hall are far too small to handle more than about two luggage trolleys and far to few to move people at any reasonable speed or volume. Parking is obscenely expensive for anyone picking you up. My experiences in the past with the domestic terminal however are poor - unhelpful staff inefficient check-in even with the self check-in kiosks rude staff at the security screens.

This time around I was disappointed. Firstly, the security check. If you've forgotten a small plastic bag for your carry on liquid items you are encouraged to pay out £1 for a bag - don't bother doing this! Once through there were staff handing them out for free. Not sure why they do this, Heathrow and most other airports seem to give the bags out for free. The security check itself was awful. The queue was unbelievable and crawled along at a snails pace. The low ceilinged queuing area was stiflingly hot and the whole thing was just bad. Compare this to my last flight from Heathrow when I zipped through in 10 mins, max. Once through, the facilities on offer aren't too bad, but the terminal building felt very dingy and closed off, there were no windows that offered views out onto the runway area. I'm sure there were last time I flew from here. The walk from the terminal building to the boarding gate for my flight was also epic. Admittedly, that isn't necessarily a problem unique to Bristol. Coming back, again the walk to immigration and baggage reclaim was a real epic, worse than going out. That said, bags came off quickly and the joy of a small airport is that you're out and on your way pretty quick. I've been told that Bristol is undergoing a bit of an upgrade, so be to be fair some of my gripes may be resolved in the future.

The good news is that the new gates require a much shorter walk and there is far more seating than at the western apron. Note however that many flights do still go from the western gates so you may not be lucky. Early morning is always the busiest time but on my last visit the wait for security was about 5 minutes (though getting through took another 5 minutes as I kept setting the scanner off never found out why). Return was OK but could be better the usual lengthy wait for immigration checks but at least one of the officers took the time to explain why using the scanners is often no quicker than queuing for a manual check.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Mark Taylor,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,First the good news. Given this is a small airport averaging around half a dozen departures per hour you are unlikely to face a long queue on the runway for take off or for that matter to have to circle around for ages to land. Also the check in queues were not too bad albeit I flew during the off peak season. But that is about all there is good to say. The whole point of little airports is they should be easy to use very short walks from the plane to the exit. Instead it has been designed without airbridges so you usually need a bus to get to the plane. You will also face long walks with no moving walkways (mine on return was over 1/4 mile) along with going up and down stairs (again no escalators). Anyone with young children and pushchairs or elderly and infirm should take careful note. Access is horrendous as the airport is in the middle of nowhere without any sensible connection to the M4 or M5. Most people will either have to go through Bristol or across windy minor roads. The parking is basically in a dirty great big field poorly concreted and open to the elements so if it's raining you will get drenched. All this for parking prices on a par with LHR and Gatwick despite the airports rural location. Helpfully the short term car park is also sited in a dip so you face a big uphill lugging of your cases while the rain pelts you. If you want a trolley it's £2 per trolley non refundable.

I have never found security staff anything other than pleasant and professional. Returning - again no issues through passport control there was a queue all desks were staffed and the queue kept moving. It compares more than favourably with other regional airports across Europe. I'd like to make an observation on other largely negative comments about walking time to gates and irritating charges for trolleys and car pick up. Probably 80% of the airports landing fees revenue is from low cost carriers who are not prepared to pay for frills including moving walkways and air bridges. Even at airports with these facilities the likes of Easyjet and Ryanair end up in a basic terminal and/or one far away from the main entrance and when you get to the gate you can still be bussed to the plane.

Flights particularly from the western apron are called early. Arrivals were not so good but just acceptable the passport readers were working but very slow - at least once it would have been quicker to queue to see an officer. My main gripe is the misuse of resources my last arrival was typical: the aircraft was parked at the far end of the western apron giving us a 400+m walk to the terminal building (they do at least advertise the distance). As we walked along we saw at least a dozen aircraft parking spaces closer (including 3 in right front of the terminal) none of which was being used.

I requested that a simple chair be provided before the x-ray arch so my shoes can be removed. I have a medical balance problem and standing and/or hopping on one leg is not possible. This results in me having to have a full body ""pat down"" every time I travel. It is embarrassing and causes unnecessary delay to other passengers. I wrote to the airport management making this request and received a reply saying this would be done immediately and that ""security"" had been informed. I travel on average every 2/3 weeks. Security staff are at best surly and unpleasant. The number of toilets in the main lounge are inadequate for the number of passengers.

I was hoping for things to have improved since I last used the airport about 4 times last year. Not a chance. My first gripe is the outrageous car parking charges. £38 for a long weekend in midwinter is a bit over the top. Secondly charging for a trolley is profiteering. Why doesn't the government do something about organisations ripping off captive customers. Thirdly in an attempt to lure passengers into buying something from the shops after going through security the owners have reduced to a minimum the area available to actually sit somewhere whilst waiting for your flight. Finally big queues for immigration. Why isn't this facility given a bigger room and more border control staff? Come on Bristol. I'm even considering travelling up the M4 to Heathrow now.

The duty free shop is oversized there is simply no logic to the flow of passengers and dependent upon the gate allocated to you you may or may not be waiting on the right floor. If you are unfortunate to be using gates 14/15 be prepared for a very long and uncomfortable walk without travelators or escalators to negotiate the long distances and multiple steps and stairs.

brussels-charleroi-airport,/airport-reviews/brussels-charleroi-airport,Brussels Charleroi Airport customer review,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,2013-12-20,Relatively new and shining clean due to the generous use of stainless steel. Epitome for the low-cost airport of the XXI century: Extra long and narrow tarmac to avoid using buses or skyways. Where the similarly long and narrow building can't reach there are long covered walkways airside. Be prepared for possible long walks both on arriving and departing. This is an airport that depends on Ryanair so you can't expect any pity. Asking for a boarding pass (a minimalist slip of paper) for a checked in flight costs 70 euros no matter what. There are two ATM machines in the hall one near the arrivals one at the opposite corner of the building (on the left exiting from airside). Exiting at this same corner you can reach the bus station where you can buy a ticket for Charleroi South Station from the machines (coins notes cards accepted). The bus station is not covered and Charleroi is a very rainy place but lucky enough you get the bus from platform A which is the nearest to the terminal. On departing I was puzzled by the double way in at security apparently doing the same things but working alternatively. Security fast and professional. Duty free looks good but I had no time to spend. After stepping to the gates you are in no- man land: long minimalist bleaky corridors where the stainless steel only adds up to the coldness of the environment. There's a bakery stand before the last hop to the tarmac. In winter I suggest buying a hot drink. The low cost travel industry states that if passengers have to wait they have to do it as close as possible to the aircraft they are boarding and in this airport this means in the open air though under a covered walkway.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Charleroi is popular because the rock-bottom price discount airlines that fly to Brussels are based here rather than Brussels Zaventem. Be warned the security lines at Charleroi do take quite some time to clear around 30 minutes compared to perhaps half that time at Brussels Zaventem. Decent choice of food air side though pricey.

Getting to / from the airport: an executive coach leaves Brussels south station (Gare du Midi) 2h. 30m. before each flight departure. As the average journey (± 60 km) takes one hour the bus arrives 90 minutes before the flight departs - in other words 60 minutes before check-in closes. The bus parks ± 50 metres from the departures door. For the return journey: buses leave the airport 20 mins or so after the flight arrivals back to Brussels Gare du Midi. At weekends I have done this journey in 40 minutes. Cost: €10.00 single payable to the driver. This includes an arbitrary €3.60 tax imposed by the Chairleroi Airport which is the subject of a legal action by Ryanair who charter the buses. Train / bus connections are not so good. I have written twice to TEC (Charleroi) asking why at weekends their ""connectional"" bus #68 from the airport arrives at Charleroi Railway station three minutes AFTER the hourly trains depart to Brussels. No intellgible answer was forthcoming - but they are Francophones and don't ever take criticism - just offer a ""Gallic shrug"". A ""joined-up public transport service"" - NOT! Parking is plentiful and cheap with free shuttle buses to/from the terminal every 10 minutes. The cafe resembles a motorway service station in UK but food and drink are comparatively cheap for the standard offered. Best to stock up here before your 60-90 minute flight so that you don't die of starvation or pay €9.00 on-board for a sandwich. This can be more than the cost of the flight! From the terminal passengers walk to the plane across the tarmac ± 100 metres. Boarding is fronty and rear so very quick. In the new Schengen terminal in Brussels Zaventem airport it can take up to 20 minutes to walk to the most remote departure gate! There are plans to expand Charleroi Airport with a second terminal in 2006 assuming that the European Commission's latest investigation hasn't scuppered the Ryanair operation by then.

There are two terminals; terminal A serves flights within the Schengen zone terminal B serves those outside. Terminal B takes slightly longer to get through as there are passport inspections before you are allowed to pass through to security. Terminal A only needs you to swipe your boarding pass on a scanner but it is a surprisingly long walk from the entrance of Terminal A to the gates. Both terminals have a decent choice of cafes and restaurants although the best restaurants are before you go through security you'll find them on the food court on level 3. There is wifi but you need to buy a scratch card with a password to use it. There are yellow vending machines security side selling them. Be warned that the shuttle buses (number 12 and 21) don't take you to the city centre they go to the European institutions which are a couple of miles south east of the city centre. Shuttle bus journeys are €5 one way or ten journeys for €25 which makes a lot of sense if you use it a lot. If you want a cheap way to the centre the SNCB train on level minus 1 will take you to Gare Centrale for about €7. A taxi is around €40.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

The new layout in the Departures terminal means that check-in security screening and passport control move much faster now. There is plenty of space to sit down and stroll in the lounges ok shopping as well as smoking areas. Arrivals is still in some need of improvement: if you deplane via bus (which seems to be the rule rather than the exception) you have to climb two storeys on an incredibly narrow spiral staircase (and it can be quite difficult especially with a heavy carry-on or a stroller; do not count on the elevators working). Luggage arrives quite quickly. But the biggest problems at Otopeni are the state of the lavatories and price gouging. The lavatories are without exception filthy: nobody seems to bother cleaning them very often toilet paper and soap are frequently missing and they also appear to double as smoking areas for the custodial staff.

We saw one massive mob in front of the KLM counter area going all the way back to the entrance doors. The small, designated line for baggage drop off and boarding pass printing kiosks were not visible. No signage available. We asked a person in line where to start. They pointed to where the boarding pass kiosks were located. There were no crowd control stanchions to designate a line in front of each kiosk. Having no choice, we joined the mob slowly forcing their way towards the kiosks. 25 minutes later, we reached a kiosk. Check in process was slowed by long response times by the kiosk. After scanning our passports, later on we were asked if we had our passport. Really? Kiosk didn't know it had already scanned it. (What we were not told by our travel company, Viking, was could we have avoided this hassle by printing our boarding pass at the hotel.) 4:40 a.m., boarding passes in hand, we joined the other mob moving forward slowly to access a very short line with crowd control stanchions. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6:10 a.m., would we make it? I got the impression the airport didn’t have a clue about crowd control, how to use more crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. At 5:20 a.m. we had our bags checked, headed to the security lines. Was shocked to see the security section had crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. Guessing the airport manager has never seen this, never actually gone on the land side the airport. Passing through security, we go right into a fancy, spacious, shopping area. Wow.

Was amazed at all the open space for retail sales, shops everywhere, no problem finding space for display racks, etc. No professional management, no crowd control, nothing. Airport managers must only live and work on the airside, never seeing the hassle passengers must go through.

budapest-ferihegy-airport,/airport-reviews/budapest-ferihegy-airport,Budapest Ferihegy Airport customer review,J Rudge,United Kingdom,2012-11-19,Terminal 2 takes all flights but has no rail link to Budapest meaning a long bus ride or pricey taxi is the only way to get there. Arriving was fine apart from a ridiculously long queue at immigration despite us arriving from an EU nation. Return - Check in was alright a long queue but it seemed to go down quickly. Queuing at security was a shambles took longer to pass the tiny security hall than it did to check in. Duty Free was alright and the skycourt upstairs for food and drink is brilliant. I have a huge problem with the way they board aircraft's here - boarding 3 Jet2 flights (Leeds Manchester Edinburgh) through the same gate at the same time? Was an absolute shambles. An hour before the flight was due to depart we were told we were boarding through the gate walked down the jetway onto the airport tarmac walked across and into what can only be described as a tent - with 3 queues for each flight. No toilet facilities and no seating just standing room only. Waited in a freezing cold damp tent for half an hour then the doors were opened and all 3 queues boarded 3 identical aircraft - what a shambles. People were boarding the wrong plane and because of it we left 30 minutes late but thankfully made up for it in flight. For the major international airport of a capital city of a European Country this was a shambles. I've flown to Greek Island airstrips and had a better experience.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The public transportation from or to the city was average but worked fine. I bought the 72 hours travel card (works on metro trams and buses) from the airport's post-office.

On the departure day at Terminal 2 Malev check-in agent and BUD's KLM staff were both polite and helpful. From check-in counter until clearing the security check point took less than 15 minutes although the airport had a busy period in the afternoon.

buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,B Diener,Canada,2010-08-22,I arrived and departed from EZE. To fully enjoy this airport you really have to like waiting in line. Upon arrival you have to wait in line at immigration which is normal at most international airports. However when you depart you have to wait in line at the check-in as the check-in kiosks aren't common at EZE yet. In addition you have to wait in line for passport control and of course security. The security check is fairly thorough but they only have a few stations which causes huge line ups. I really appreciated the smoking room in the departure level as well as the pretty large duty free shop. When you depart from EZE in the evening you need to leave for the airport on time.

It can be chock a block when several flights from Europe / USA arrive at once but my worst wait was no more then 30 minutes. Baggage claim straightforward. A word to the uninitiated - do not consider changing money in the arrivals hall or area immediately outside other than at the Banco de la Nacion. BNA offered usd $1 for ARS $390 the going rate. I saw the other places offering $330. Taxi Ezeiza (safereliable and prepaid at the kiosk ) is ARS $118 into town but only ARS $88 for the return.

The domestic airport near the city center is smaller and simpler but relatively modern with plenty of dining options. Do beware of theft: my digital camera was stolen from next to me when my back was turned. There was no place to report this within the security area (woman at the info desk suggested I look for someone outside of security and when I later at another airport asked an Aerolineas Argentinas rep about asking whether a camera had been turned in she essentially said kiss it goodbye). Back at EZE one point is that the most obvious money exchange places as you exit give the lowest rates. The national bank branch giving the best rates is outside of security and a couple of turns to the right. Not at all obvious. Ditto on taxis: those easiest to find are very pricey.

It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal.

I love the fact that they have the friendly greeters in white Stetsons it certainly makes you feel you have arrived somewhere different also love the fact that they help people with mobility problems or young children by giving them a lift on the golf buggies from the airbridge to customs. This was brought into sharp contrast on arrival back at Manchester with the ludicrous up and down stairs long and winding walk you have to do on arrival. The customs guys were certainly abrupt but no more than I had experienced in other parts of Canada - in fact they only asked us 2 quick questions before letting us through - other groups of passengers seemed to get far more of a grilling. Baggage reclaim was really fast signage to rental cars was easy to follow and I'd say we were completely out of the airport within 1hr of landing which is not bad at all.

My main criticism was after leaving the terminal building it was unclear where to go for onward connections using public transport. On the return journey the airport was extremely busy - long queue for check-in although the check-in agent and BA's ground handling team generally were pleasant and helpful. We were very grateful for a short and efficient security process. No BA lounge so used the TGI Fridays which again was very busy but decent food at an ok price as we had complementary BA vouchers. Decent range of shops and managed to find a postbox for my postcards despite being told by several airport employees that there was not one in the terminal.

It took us about 40 minutes to clear immigration which was fine. However when we reached the baggage claim it was pandemonium. The entire room was full and lines snaked everywhere. They were actually using X-Ray machines to screen every bag leaving the terminal. I have traveled extensively world-wide and know of no country that is doing this including the U.S. What could Mexican Authorities possibly think tourists are smuggling into Cancun on already screened Aircraft? It took us 1.5hrs to exit the Baggage area and from what we heard we were lucky. There was more danger created by the shear amount of people crammed into that baggage room than there ever could have been by failing to X-Ray bags leaving the Airport.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

cancun-airport,/airport-reviews/cancun-airport,Cancun Airport customer review,M Keenan,NA,2009-02-04,"Third world airport is a scary sounding phrase but Cancun airport doesn't deserve the scary reputation that this suggests. In several trips through Cancun in the past three years I have never had a problem. On arrival transiting through immigration was reasonably fast and checked baggage always turned up quickly. Sometimes (if your 'number comes up') Mexican customs makes a more thorough search of your baggage (including x-raying) but even this wasn't too much of a problem. On departure I’ve found that the airport processes people quickly and that security line-ups are minimal. There is plenty of comfortable seating in the departure area and many options for the shopper or traveller with time on their hands (including one of those typical Mexican pharmacies that sell just about any kind of drug without requiring a prescription). I only have two issues with Cancun: Firstly the number of time share hawkers waiting to pounce on you right after you exit customs some masquerading as representatives of the tour companies. Just ignore them and keep walking. The other issue is temporary – Cancun is building a new runway and the road network is a little messed up while construction is in progress making it slow driving in and out. In summary Cancun airport is easier to arrive at and depart from than a number of ""First world airports"" that I’ve travelled through in recent times and they should be complimented for doing a good job.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

This time I was on Business. Great car parking and shuttle service. The security experience was horrendous. Staff were aggressive and patronising. As I had some liquids in my case, they quite rightly had to inspect it. However this was done in front of everyone with all personal belongings shown to everyone who was passing. It was an unnecessarily humiliating experience and easily solvable by having a screened area. The security staff were very unpleasant however and seemed to take great delight in ordering passengers around.

We arrived two hours before our flight which we assumed would be ample time but alarm bells began to ring when we saw massive queues everywhere both outside and inside the terminal. When we found the check in desk although the queue was not that long the check in person took a ridiculous amount of time to deal with each party so it took ages to reach the front of the queue. We then discovered that we had to join another queue to have the bags x- rayed! After that we queued again to get through security and this was a free for all with no system at all and the staff again were really slow and didn't seem to care at all. By the time we finally reached the gate the whole process had taken over one and a half hours! Had we arrived at the airport much later we easily could have missed our flight altogether! The airport clearly neither has the staff nor the capacity to deal with the amount of traffic it receives and is a shambles more akin to airports of the 1960's.

The Chennai queue was unbelievably slow. Then came the queues (plural) for security. I understand that they have good reason to take security seriously and I'm glad they do but they kept recalling bags to have another look at them and then someone would search them by hand. One young woman who was just in front of me had her handbag taken from her and put through three times and searched by hand twice - this really can only mean that the staff didn't do it correctly the first time unless it was the result of a malicious desire to make passengers miss their flights. My bag was put through the scanner twice and searched by hand. I saw this happening to other people too.

This year the improvements to the International Terminal main hall are immense more seating gleaming floors and it seemed slightly less chaotic than our previous transit through it. Tea coffee cold drinks and snacks are available and the facilities are clean enough. Even the arrival and baggage collection on our inbound sector was fine.

That said they have a job to do and I have certainly experienced much slower elsewhere. Some of our bags were already waiting by the time we reached the belt. Overall a fairly painless arrival and out of the building within 35 minutes from arrival. Departure was a pleasure. Security check and bag X-Ray as you enter the terminal. No queues at check-in.

Upon arrival in Chiang Mai we waited and waited for our baggage to arrive. After nearly everyone else had left with their bags we asked around and found that our bags had been sent to the international arrivals area at the other end of the airport. Although our arriving flight was a domestic one the baggage had been transferred at Bangkok (we didn't have to claim it and go through customs there; just passed through customs with our hand carry) so we had to go through customs in Chiang Mai.

How are people supposed to get out of the car you are not parking just getting. The time she wasted screaming was very unnecessary.

I stood and watched this idiot for about ten minutes doing the same to other cars. Two minutes is not a lifetime and Midway is getting to be the worst for dropping off and picking up passengers.

However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare.

We did not encounter any rude or indifferent employees. What I liked best about my return through ORD is the passport control process.

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,Stuart Ward,United Kingdom,2013-05-19,We passed through this airport twice in a week once from UK and then from Mexico. On both occasions we were met by huge queues for passport check both times taking 2-3 hours to get through. As we made our way towards immigration we were ordered by a young lady to 'stand against the wall' get against the wall'. We queued there for about 45 minutes before getting to a hall best described as a cattle market crammed with hundreds of visitors. People were taking photos of the unbelievable crowd. Only about 1/3 of passport desks were manned. It took 2 hours to get through the queue plus the 45 minutes in the corridor. Many people were missing connecting flights. When they asked staff what they should do they were rudely told 'stand in line there's nothing you can do you just have to catch the next one'. I guess for some that meant spending the night in the terminal. One parent tried to offer food to their bored child only to be ordered to 'put that food away- no food' because they were using sniffer dogs. There was not a hint of courtesy politeness or helpfulness in any of the staff. US citizens seemed to be getting through in about 15 minutes. This was obviously not an isolated incident since it was the same on both occasions we passed through. This is the worst airport I have ever passed through.

This is the one to avoid. When I landed the plane took 20 mins to taxi to the gate because of the terribly organized runways. I came to find that although the terminal (Terminal 1) was clean and had plenty of eateries most were too expensive. After passing that little conglomerate eateries are next to none so it took awhile to find a decently-priced place. Finding a restroom was nightmare. I had to find Terminal 2 which took even longer than the restroom thanks to an appalling lack of signage. Terminal 2 was far too small to hold all the passengers necessary and indirectly because of that it was appallingly dirty. The flight to Roanoke got caught in traffic.

Finally figured T1 so train it was. Then at T1 crazy long security lineup - why did they have me leave the security zone I was in when I landed in T5 to then go back into the security zone in T1 - job making I guess as it sure is inefficient and wasted 2 hours of my time.

No fast track for F/J class passengers no help whatsoever with flight connections. You just wait in the queue at immigration and take your chances. It's not even logical they had space at the US immigration channel so some uniform opened the barrier for people waiting behind me to go through. One guy tried to join this from near me- probably also had a connection- but aforementioned jobsworth shooed him back. I can handle the idea of needing extra security but if you US immigration can't find a way within this to accommodate the realities of an international hub then come clean and tell people not to try connecting at this or other US airports operating on this basis- which is many of them I believe. To their credit the airport and airline staff are pretty good at managing the situation and getting you on a later flight because they are well used to this farce and ashamed of it too. I know LHR immigration is bad but at least there's an effort to get people to their connection. If this is truly where US government/immigration has arrived at post 9/11 I'm afraid you've conceded a clear victory to the terrorists on this one.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
chongqing-jiangbei-airport,/airport-reviews/chongqing-jiangbei-airport,Chongqing Jiangbei Airport customer review,G A Bray,Australia,2012-12-23,Flew domestically into Chongqing on Sichuan Airlines and for some reason our aerobridge was at the small International Terminal 1. Requiring us to walk 100m around the edge of the terminal concourse and walk down stairs to a shuttle bus to carry Terminal 2 which being winter was bitterly cold especially with the doors opened while the bus waited for a full load. Once inside the proper domestic terminal it was pretty straight forward and standard routine. Once excellent feature was a lady handing out bi-lingual cards listing taxi fare prices to over a dozen destinations around the city to discourage touting and rip offs. For the return I found out the single domestic Terminal 2 is actually split into 3 separate halls A B and C. If you flight is leaving through hall C you can not enter via A or B security points. This also means you are technically shut off from the shops and facilities in the other sections too such as the McDonalds in hall A. However you are able to walk downstairs to the Arrivals level and use the transfer signage to direct you to the other areas making the segregation of the terminal areas pointless. Lastly with the security it was the only place I was asked to take my boots off beyond the X-Ray machine which all passengers were made to do. However with only one seat it meant a longer wait as you could not progress until the person in front had taken off their boots was examined and then re-laced them.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

One small baggage area with an exit for domestic travellers no customs check required and one exit for international travellers with a through customs check result in chaos. The lack of baggage carts and hundreds of people struggling with several large suitcases each all struggling towards the one international exit result in a rugby scrum.

The staff are friendly the facilities adequate for a regional airport of this size the queues managable and it's clean. It just feels like it's missing something.

So yes it is a nice airport in regional NSW that serves its purpose and the needs of the people but I just get the feeling that with a bit of money put in (new floorings lick of paint open up the departure lounge a bit more provide wi-fi) it could be have a certain wow factor reserved for NSW regional airports like Newcastle Albury and Dubbo which have been thrust forward into the 21st Century.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

There are no major international food stalls such as Mcdonalds KFC etc. There is only one small food stall area which offers a limited menu.

colombo-airport,/airport-reviews/colombo-airport,Colombo Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2012-10-03,The last time I came through Columbo Airport I gave it a pretty good review sadly things seem to have deteriorated - either that or the airport is struggling to keep up with increased passenger traffic. Flying into the airport isn't too bad although the pick-up point for arrivals is now as big a shambles as the drop off zone for departing passengers. Departures is a different story. Apart from the scrum at the aforementioned drop off point the check in desks are partitioned off from the rest of the departure hall and you're not allowed to proceed to check in until instructed to do so. Fair enough but the amount of seating in the departure hall is completely inadequate for the number of passengers waiting for their check in desk to open. Also there is only one channel through the partition and when check in for a particular flight opens this is immediately mobbed by the waiting passengers with no attempt by the authorities at managing the process or – heaven forbid – organizing a queue. Once airside things do improve but since passengers have already gone through full security screening at a) entry to the departure hall and b) entry to the check in area why is there a need for a third security check at the gate itself? Still not a bad airport but the management ought to think about making the departures process less painful for passengers.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

First of all  all vehicles approaching the airport are stopped by a guard who exercises a ""face-control"" - looks at the passenger and asks him his nationality.

colombo-airport,/airport-reviews/colombo-airport,Colombo Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2010-09-20,A pleasant surprise the airport now has air bridges connected to a modern pier. This in turn leads to the first floor of an expanded main terminal in which arriving / departing passengers mix freely. There were several immigration desks open even though it was 3.30am and I was processed quickly and efficiently. Baggage reclaim took a long time - bags were added to the carousel painfully slowly and it took about 45 minutes to recover my two suitcases. Once through customs there were several currency exchanges - don't bother comparing rates they're all the same! Departure on the 14th â€“ nothing much has changed since I was last here. The drop off zone is small and chaotic with passengers having to (try to) queue up outside to get through the limited number of security / baggage screening lanes immediately inside. Once through security and into the terminal things are a lot more efficient although CMB remains one of those peculiar airports where the check in area is partitioned off from the rest of the departures hall and passengers are not allowed to proceed until the check in desks for their flights open. Fortunately there was sufficient seating while I waited. Once checked in and through emigration the airside section was spacious and comfortable if somewhat eccentrically laid out.

The one thing which amazed me (positively) was there was no security check for passengers changing planes especially those going between schengen and non schengen services. Yes they check passports but no scan of hand luggage or passengers. Unusual in this day and age.

copenhagen-airport,/airport-reviews/copenhagen-airport,Copenhagen Airport customer review,Alan Mackenzie,Denmark,2013-05-19,I use Copenhagen airport roughly once a month. Passengers are in my opinion well served in this modern up-to-date airport. The airport has over the years developed improved passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting to your gate. The latest development is scanning machines just before security. These automated gates allow entry on reading your boarding card much the same as the London Underground ticket gates. The next improvement due in 2013 (which I'm looking forward to) is 'self-service baggage drop' where passengers can simply drop off their bags without standing in those endless snaking lines. To start with eight self-service bag drops will be opened in Terminal 3 and four in Terminal 2 and the service will initially only be available to passengers flying SAS and Norwegian.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

With only 2 hours time available prior to departure we could not manage to get time for lounge visit as time was lost in packed areas though no queues took more than 15 minutes to overcome. The airport is fantastic as one almost always get direct gate access to flights and do not have to walk far anywhere – i.e. bus transport to a/c are not frequent.

Have to say that we were absolutely disgusted by the total chaos in approaching the security gates. No one minds waiting to get through security as it is obviously essential to safe travel but in T3 it was like a massive rugby scrum and surely the antithesis of security! It started off well enough with a pleasant security officer guiding people into a queue but the queue then approached two information girls who directed people to left or right. On each side there were 6 or so belts but no system of queuing so that everyone was just piling towards the conveyor and security gate in a random fashion pushing and shoving trying to get to the gate. It was actually very unsafe and we were left like this for about 20 minutes whilst trying to get to the security gate. Also counter productive for the airport as when we did eventually get through we were in no mood to look at the shops and just went straight to the departure gate and waited there. In addition it seemed as if the airport staff were totally disinterested in what was happening. Definitely my worse airport experience.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I thought (maybe) that we would then get through the departure gate quicker but no we had to queue again and check in again before going through. Not sure of the purpose of the double check-in?

In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples?

The perceived advantage that Dallas has over LAX is that it places travellers like me geographically closer to my final destination of New York City. After weighing all of the positives and negatives this is the only real edge that I experienced. Immigration took longer at Dallas than any of my prior trips through LAX. DFW had plenty of immigration lanes but unfortunately a very large percentage were closed. My craft certainly was not the only international jumbo on the ground at the time either. People sometimes complain about the supposed hassles of connecting at LAX but again the process took longer at DFW than it ever had at LAX for me. Yes you have to exit and then re-enter the terminal after the international flight here just as you do in Los Angeles. Maybe Dallas' airport light rail is more comfortable and easier with luggage than the internal bus system that Los Angeles has but not really enough to sway me. The real disadvantage for now is the fact that DFW does not have the physical infrastructure to handle the large A380 Airbus which is a leap above the Boeing 747 in many aspects. Until that changes it is really back to LAX for my travels.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,/airport-reviews/dallas-fort-worth-airport,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,L Lehnert,Mexico,2012-10-01,This airport is absolutely enormous. It is very far from one terminal to the next. Both the monorail system (Skytrain) and the Terminal Link bus convey passengers to the different terminals. The terminals themselves are very nice and modern. Security screening involved lengthy lines although passengers in wheelchairs get priority. Unfortunately all the food outlets are airside so it is necessary to go through security screening before getting something to eat or if you are exiting the terminal you must get your food before you leave the airside area and take it out with you. Unlike airports in Asia there are no smoking kiosks near the gates; the smoking areas are outside the terminals. Immigration is in a huge room which was very crowded when I entered. There was a customs officer pre-screening passengers entering the immigration section. Customs itself was smooth and non-eventful.

dallas-fort-worth-airport,/airport-reviews/dallas-fort-worth-airport,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,A Chang,Taiwan,2011-09-20,While it cannot compare to most foreign hubs DFW is a functional airport by American standards. Amenities are on par with other large US hubs but security checks rarely take more than 15 mins of queuing. Customs/Immigration is probably the fastest I have experienced in the US and although int'l transfer passengers must exit the secure area and undergo an additional security check this is not really different from any other US airport. Gate-to-gate transfers can be quite a trek given the size of the airport but are quite simple if your gate is closer to a Skytrain entrance. The biggest gripe is the fact that the baggage system is slow and outdated. Unless you are flying into the newer terminal D expect to wait about 30 minutes before you will see your bag.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

damascus-airport,/airport-reviews/damascus-airport,Damascus Airport customer review,Paul Ross,NA,2003-09-19,I was a transit passenger through Damascus airport twice. On the face of it it appears clean and tidy but as you spend more time there it's seriously lacking. Firstly there's no where to change money or obtain visa advances. I arrived with £1000GBP of travellers cheques and had a 4 hour connection. I was unable to purchase any food or drink and the 1 restaurant that is there only accepts Syrian money. If you are lucky you can pay with euro pounds or dollars in hard cash. Otherwise you have to starve or die of first. There is a duty free shop that accepts visa and sells incredibly cheap cigarettes (I think they were $1USD a packet). However you won't be able to buy any food or drink to consume with your visa card unless you don't mind living off toblerone and whisky. Toilets didn't have any toilet paper in them. I was sitting on the seats and I left my girlfriend. When I returned she had moved because an older Syrian (I presume?) guy had started waving his stick at her and telling her to move. He had then requisitioned the whole seat and sat around 9 burkah wearing women on the seat opposite him. Transfer desk and being booked onto the next flight was efficient apart from competing with Indians for a Delhi transfer was like taking part in a scrum. The airport seriously needs a money changer and VISA ATM in the departure lounge.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Arrival was painless. Immigration looks as if it will take forever at first but as soon as immigration staff realise it's going to be busy they open more desks and the queue soon clears. Customs scan every bag from every person as you leave. When returning you must have your checked luggage scanned before check in otherwise you cannot check the bag. Queues for check in weren't too bad but then I was 3 hours early for the KLM flight. Be prepared before going through security as although the queue looks long it moves fast and security staff get annoyed if they have to ask you to remove your belt watch etc but they are very pleasant if you are ready. The flight I was waiting for was leaving at 1:15am and there were a few international flights but the cafe was closed. The only place to buy refreshments was from a ""trolley"" however the coffee wasn't bad and wasn't too expensive but nothing to eat that was hot. There is one duty free shop with various items for sale (including washing powder?) and prices are okay. I walked from one end of the airport to the other which took 10 minutes at normal pace and only 6 gates had passengers waiting by them. Interestingly there used to be a few Business Class lounges but these appear to have been closed and moved to one lounge such is the under use of this airport.

darwin-airport,/airport-reviews/darwin-airport,Darwin Airport customer review,P Taylor,NA,2008-02-28,If you want slow immigration clearances and unfriendly staff on arrival Darwin is your port of choice. Most flights arrive into Darwin in the early hours of the morning. Staff is always short. And everyone is given the third degree and queuing is not segregated. So if your an Australian behind a family of 5 overseas visitors expect to sit waiting for them while visas travel arrangements and passports are examined in every minute detail even though most residents arriving are a quick once over. I choose to fly into any other airport in Australia if returning from international destinations. The last flight I returned from overseas was a Tiger flight from Singapore. It was full and 90min late. Approximately 30% of the flight were late for a connecting Melbourne flight which was awaiting them. All these 30% were poorly directed to just 1 immigration staff while 1 experienced and 2 trainees looked after the rest of the flight. Most of the transit customers lined up in the normal queue and were returned to the back of the transit queue once they reached the front as there were only a few staff giving verbal directions to arriving customers. In addition the International arrival and departure areas are small. Its not uncommon for arriving queues to snake back through the airbridges. It looks as if the international terminal was added as an afterthought. The only thing Darwin Airport has going for it is free and ready access to smoking areas in departure lounges.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,D Gill,Canada,2014-01-25,DEL T3 is much better than what they had before. It is certainly more pleasant although the carpet color and design seems a bit too loud. The lines did seem a bit longer but nothing that one shouldn't expect. Airport seems to have more choices in terms of restaurants but unfortunately the prices are blatantly high. That is something that they should seriously look at. I think they are using international standards when it comes to pricing. Sadly that is not quite the same when it comes to customer service. I still found washrooms well below par and there were pigeons flying around inside the terminal. If you haven't used DEL before make sure you take the print out of your ticket with you otherwise you will not be allowed inside the terminal. Seems like DEL is the only airport to do that.

Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge).

The same story on the way back to Helsinki: easy and hassle-free. Maybe this is due to the fact that Finnair lands in Delhi in the morning instead of midnight and takes off at 10.45 am when there is not that much international traffic at T3. Moreover there are some pleasant eateries and cafes there plus great views to the runways to do some plane spotting. Cannot understand some very negative feedback from fellow travellers about Delhi Int'l Airport.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,A Sutherland,Australia,2014-09-06,After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took about an hour from landing till getting out of the airport. VOA arrival took about 15 minutes and was easier than I remember. Now the immigration lines themselves were long and slow. With staff talking amongst themselves. That was the bottleneck. The advantage was my bag came out about 2 minutes after getting through immigration and through the x-rays 5 minutes later. Leaving was a different story (shocked at how quick it was). Arrived early took 10 minutes to check in the Departure tax line was 5 minutes and through the security checks and immigration 10 minutes after that. It's like 2 different airports. Inbound dirty and feels grimy. Departures was clean! Needs more seating though. Warning: Australia bound Flights go through a final security check at the gate (looking for liquids). This is not their fault this is an Australian Government Request and ran into this at every airport in the last 12 months (including Dubai).,NA,NA,NA,6,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

What a disgrace: arrived 3pm on a Tuesday in July queued 2-3 hours for visa fee booth and passport control was exhausted after this not-so-happy start for a holiday. Poorly designed and poorly manned. Departure was slightly better but long queues again.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,S Stevens,Australia,2014-05-26,We landed in the New Denpasar Airport early afternoon. We were bus transported to the terminal we then proceeded through the Visa on arrival passports check etc... The process was absolutely hassle free fast efficient and friendly. Every counter was manned and the lines were only four-five deep so it took no time and we were out at the taxi booth paying a fixed price for a Taxi to our Villa in Seminyak (au $10.00). After reading many very disturbing reviews about the airport departure process we decided to get to the airport early. We went to the airport by taxi and arrived 3 hours before our 11.30pm flight. We have travelled extensively around the world and been to many international airports and Bali airport was one of our better experiences. The booking in immigration passport check luggage checks all worked well with very little delay. The food prices in the airport were more expensive than on the streets of Kuta but that is typical of any airport. The shopping section cannot be avoided the walkway winds through the shops this not unusual in airports. Once we got to the departure lounge I found a lot of congestion many people were sitting on the floor. We had not been allocated a departure gate and the flight details board did not have the departure gate numbers listed for many of the flights this caused congestion. We simply walked past all the congestion to another group of departure lounges (plenty of empty seats) and we waited for the announcement telling us which was our departure lounge. The announcements were loud and clear. There were many spotlessly clean toilet blocks throughout the departure lounges in the airport. I strongly recommend once you get to the departure lounge area walk to the left past the congestion and you will find many empty departure lounges and empty toilet blocks. We look forward to going back to Bali and seeing the airport when it is completely finished.,NA,NA,NA,9,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Sad to say no brand new building but the with no improvement in customer service. On departure we where herded through to the old terminal which looked like it had been stripped of anything useful. Stifling hot with 3 flights crowded into the same area. When I arrived back I was disheartened to see approx 400 people in front of me waiting for a visa. There seemed to be more people asking you for express service (fee) than manning the immigration desks. Along with the hundreds of others spent a few hours queuing to get in.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,M Henry,Australia,2013-07-09,Flew from Brisbane AU. It was still organized chaos. Arrived in Bali at 2.30pm which was one of their busiest times and were delayed in the air for an hour. Transferred to the terminal by bus. Buying the Visa on Arrival (US25 each) went fairly quickly but the wait to get through Immigration took much longer. Airport is quite humid and hot with no air-conditioning. There was a delay in getting our luggage took an hour and no signage so confusion as to which conveyer belt was ours. Immigration staff were ok and friendly to our son. Lots of touts trying to take your bags etc but just watch your bags and give a firm no. The pick up area was crazy but we found our pre-paid taxi fairly quickly. Leaving Bali there is a quite a long walk from drop off to the entrance and luggage touts are everywhere. We couldn't find any carts nearby so I gave in and paid a tout 30000 Rph ($3) to carry our bags (for 5 people) to the entrance. Had to wait a while to get past the first security checkpoint which was a pain and a bit stressful. Arrived a little early for check-in (9pm) and had to wait 15 minutes. We then paid our exit fee (150000 Rph / $15) and got through Immigration after about an hour. warm. Airside I had thought we could enter the best of 3 lounges (Premier Lounge) but was told by as we were not affiliated with their partner airlines. So we went to the cheaper one on the other side (Marigold Lounge) but it was only 150000 Rph ($15). Facilities were ok seats reasonably comfortable food choice was a bit limited (rice noodles sandwiches cakes and pastries and coffee free beer but what do you expect - its only $15). Lighting was a bit dark for me. Large flat screen TV to keep you entertained. Free WIFI. Toilets / showers are located at the back outside the lounge and were basic. We spent about 1-2 hours there. Staff were friendly. We had to go through a final security check just before the gates. Limited seating at the boarding gate so we stood around for about 30-40 mins before getting onto our flight. So our experience at Bali Airport wasn't too bad overall just need to be aware of the chaotic environment.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,T Maddern,Australia,2012-08-30,The check-in area for international on the ground level is fine but when you get to the departure area through immigration that's where things go bad. Seating is very poor and rather than create areas with windows the airport management have given priority to making it a giant shopping mall full of overpriced goods and people in the walkways continually hassling you for massage services. There are very few seats in the airport despite many empty seats in the numerous eating outlets. If you want to watch the aircraft coming and going you have to go to the gate lounge but you're not allowed into this area until shortly before your flight departs. The cleanliness of the airport is satisfactory and staff are friendly. One other negative thing about the airport is that it is about a 300-500m walk once out of the terminal to the start of the car park. Unfortunately for those of you travelling to Bali - this is the only airport option. On the positive side - there is the selection of a new airport building and a couple of cranes so hopefully in the next 3 - 10 years this will be completed with adequate windows and runway viewing areas.,NA,NA,NA,2,4,4,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,N Werner,Switzerland,2010-09-01,I was prepared for the worst when I arrived at Bali airport after reading all those terrible reviews. I was arriving on Malaysia Airlines from KL and our flight was delayed for 1 hour. Maybe that was the reason that there was nobody queuing at immigration and we were outside within 20 minutes after arriving. Immigration and customs took no more than 5 minutes as my passport allows for a visa free entrance to Indonesia. Once you leave customs there is a long row of money changers but don't be a fool and change money there. The rates in town are much better. Our arrival was very efficient and I could not fault it except the long walk from our gate to immigration which took about 5-10 minutes as gate 2 is at the far end. Departure was not as good as you already have to pass through security just to enter the building. Check-in was ok and took a while even though we were already checked in online. Paying the exit tax was pretty straight forward and involved no queuing. Once pass immigration there are a few shops but the prices are not competitive if you compare it to other Asian airports in the region. The airport is old but I have seen worse. You pass through security again at your gate and once inside there is nothing much so do not bother going to early. Boarding was civilized but the infrastructure is really outdated. The gate agents set up a microphone and stereo set to announce the boarding calls as the gate did not have a speaker system. I found I was probably very lucky to have this smooth experience in Bali.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,R Koehler,United States,2014-10-22,"Our experience at this airport was very poor. Incredibly slow TSA screening line caused my entire family to miss our flight wait five hours and pay $375 to reschedule. Despite there being maybe 200 people in front of us (two wraps of line) the process took half an hour! Multiple TSA employees appeared to be standing around while only a single screening line operated. Nobody from TSA seemed to have the slightest concern that they were taking far too long and people were at risk of missing their flights. Is there any motivation or reward for TSA employee efficiency? We made the mistake of flying with Frontier airlines. These guys closed the boarding doors 10 minutes prior to departure (we checked our luggage at their counter nearly an hour before departure and that got on the plane just fine). And then happily got $375 to reschedule. As with the TSA what motivation do these people have to actually help passengers? Zero! There are very few power outlets in the terminal (A gates) to plug in phones / laptops. With so many people sitting around (stranded?) it would be nice to have more power outlets!

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,M McManus,United Kingdom,2011-04-27,Arrived from Dulles. Has three terminals (A B C) and they are connected by a train which is very quick. You could probably get from A to C in 5 minutes on this train although I don't know how often they arrive. TSA security line was very long and slow moving although you can sign up to an express security scheme there for an annual fee so this may be worthwhile for people who frequently go through DEN. After arriving you need to take the train to baggage claim which can be a tedious journey to go to the other side of the airport just to collect your bags. Sign posting for this is not immediately apparent to someone new to the airport. Ground transportation to downtown is plentiful but taxis are expensive ($65). Best to get the $20 airport shuttle bus which your hotel can arrange and which you can pay in cash. ATMs everywhere but they appear not to take Maestro cards so be warned. Distance from downtown is quite far and a car or taxi takes just under 40 minutes early in the morning and possibly longer later in day with traffic.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,James Laskowski,Thailand,2013-09-25,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have been in. Mainly due to the archaic use of busses that take over 20 minutes to get to and from the aircraft to the terminal. And then when checking in with the extremely polite staff everyone must hurdle into a 2nd waiting room to wait for the bus. The lack of services at the airport are very poor. 2 or 3 restrooms tops that have a line out the door for men are packed and in locations not convenient to all passenger waiting areas. Since the current airport is so small the food and shopping options are extremely limited and the shopping is limited to duty free items (and over-priced electronics). The 1 great thing about this airport is the ""Quiet Area"" where it is dark reclining seats and very quiet if you have a long layover. Made for nice place to nap.",NA,NA,NA,4,1,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,R Brennan,Australia,2013-09-25,This airport desperate for an upgrade. The big fancy new Doha airport has had its opening delayed for several years and it shows as Qatar Airlines continues to expand its massive fleet despite the tiny overwhelmed airport that serves as its transit hub. A few problems to note: 1) The bathrooms would be a disgrace for even a small regional airport let alone a global hub. You would be forgiven for thinking the bathroom line is for boarding a plane because it stretches across the halls. Once you reach the inside there are more sinks than toilets. 2) During peak hours people are camped out all over the floors due to the lack of seats. Sleep is impossible because of the crowds. 3) Perhaps overwhelmed by it all staff are generally friendly but unhelpful or surly and unhelpful. For far fewer flights this would be a decently modern little airport. However when crammed in with the rest of the cattle it feels like a terrible place to be. When compared to the hub airports of the other 5 star airlines on skytrax (Singapore Hong Kong Kuala Lumpur - all of which I visited in the last year) it is a joke.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2012-10-09,The original terminal which I used to pass through frequently in the 1990’s seems to have disappeared to be replaced with a larger more modern building which is only a temporary terminal pending opening of the new Doha Airport. There are no airbridges so passengers are bussed to and from the terminal. Many connecting flights have short transfer times (mine was 50 minutes) which considering the time needed to travel to and from the terminal makes for a rushed and somewhat stressful transfer experience. I had been given an orange and yellow trimmed ‘short transfer’ boarding pass on check in with instructions from Qatar Airways to make this visible on arrival at Doha and to follow instructions. As it turned out no one was interested and there were no ‘short transfer’ lanes open or anyone offering assistance. Fortunately it was easy enough to identify my departure gate which was only a short walk away. The terminal itself is rather basic and functional and still too small for the number of passengers using it but easy to navigate and seems to do its job effectively enough.

When I arrived the queue for the baggage screening was short so was straight in checkin was fast immigration was not so fast and final security check was okay as the immigration lines were throttling the amount of people trying to get through. Once inside you go straight into the duty free area of which there were plenty of cigarettes but everything else seemed to be lacking for example the only decent champagne was a '98 Dom Perignon everything else was Moet or less. To be honest they did have everything you could want i.e. electronics Mont Blanc Hugo Boss etc but the range they had of each was limited and expensive compared to UK High Street prices. There were a few shops on the upper level but the main shopping was a large single shop on the lower level. Food was also limited no restaurants just 2 food courts at separate ends of the terminal both were very busy until gone midnight then they were almost deserted. Opposite the far food court was a small childrens play area. One thing you could find plenty of was toilets and smoking rooms however some of these are 'hidden' so most people crammed into the smaller easily accessible rooms whereas the larger rooms were empty. At the far end of the terminal were a mosque and next to it a quiet room.

Generally it's not bad although we were locked into arrivals by mistake on one occasion. It's like a smaller version of Liverpool airport and suffers from the same atmosphere. Signs warning the approaching motorist of dire consequences should they not comply with a list of regulations serve as a welcome. Then one is charged to use the drop-off zone even though a few yards away you can park for free for 15 minutes. The 15-minute rule both here and in the drop-off zone adds a little extra inconvenience to the experience as it makes it difficult to be met by a partner with a car (they may be obliged to drive around the airport for a while if your plane is late).

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2012-10-10,Not impressed with the increasing amount of bussing going on in DXB predominantly with Emirates flights - 10 mins taxi-ing to get to some remote stand 10-15 mins to deplane a further 20 mins in a freezing bus and another 15 mins to get through transit security. So that's the thick end of an hour just to get into the Departures Concourse where Emirates expect you to turn up at the gate 35 minutes before departure time and do another 20 minute bus ride back to where you came from. You can just about make a 2 hour transit connection - IF the flight's on time and IF you don't need to go a toilet in the Terminal. Any shorter forget it. The reason for all this? Well it's because DXB has more flight slots than they have gates to service them. And who ends up with all the bussing nonsense? Well Emirates the home carrier of course because if they bussed Cathay Pacific passengers then Cathay Pacific probably wouldn't bother flying to DXB next year.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2011-11-04,I pass through DXB about a dozen times a year on Emirates. I would love to know the percentage of flights where passengers are bussed to and from the terminal because in my experience it's around 30% and it's getting boring. 10 minutes to fill up the busses and a 20 minute ride in a freezing cold box before being dumped into the Arrivals Zoo. Meanwhile back at the gates there are dozens of foreign airlines neatly parked at one of the 200+ gates. So why are Emirates bussing so many passengers at DXB? Well the airport have sold all of these Landing Slots into an airport which is simply not big enough to park all the aircraft at gates so in order to squeeze them all in the national flag carrier is bussing passengers to and from parking areas - at their home airport.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2011-01-28,I transit DXB every month (usually in the middle of the night or early morning) and the previous posts are correct - at some times of the year the queues at transit security are lengthy and at other times non-existent. I came through the other day in 5 minutes but the longest couldn't have been more than 20 minutes. The size of the terminals and the often lengthy walks involved can be a real challenge in making a connection of anything less than 2 hours. Also Emirates seem to be back into bussing mode again - and not 5 minutes either - 15 or 20 minutes bus rides from remote stands are not uncommon. A ridiculous situation for an airline at their home base.

OK so it looks impressive from outside and it is impressive inside but when your inbound flight is delayed and you have to get to your outbound connection in 20 mins it is not easy. The airport is too large and there should have been more thought put into how passengers get around in transit. We had to go from our gate to security then all the way back out to the gates. There were large queues at security and there was no allowance for the large group of passengers who were rushing for the connecting flight. There were very long queues at security. The duty free areas were OK but the stalls in the middle of the corridor/walkway meant that with passengers going in different directions along the narrower walkways it became congested at times. The airport could do with more seating and perhaps reclining/flatbed seats at the gates.

The only good thing is that they seem to be bussing fewer flights from remote stands than a year ago but a 2-hour connection is as tight as you'd want to get. I prefer the Emirates Business Lounge in T1 to that awful place in T3. Also Emirates have a bad habit of going from Gate Open to Boarding and onto Final Call - all in the space of 10 minutes some 40 or 50 minutes before scheduled flight departure time - and having passengers all dashing across this very large terminal only to have to wait 20 minutes before they can actually board.

The new terminal is very welcoming well planned and organised. It was good to see Irish language signs and to have a sense of arriving in a wonderfully welcoming airport. I found the use of art work and the theme of the 'gathering' to be very nice and both professional and sentimental. The airport seems to employ a lot of non-Irish people some of whom are very surly and let the airport and indeed Dublin down. The catering facilities are rather good but it is a puzzle that staff have a poor command of English.

Finally there was no priority boarding for Skyteam Elite members on the KLM flights: boarding was done by everyone stampeding for the gate queue as soon as the flight was called.

durhamtees-valley-airport,/airport-reviews/durhamtees-valley-airport,Durham/tees Valley Airport customer review,Leo Enticknap,NA,2010-06-28,I flew from MME for the first time in almost a year largely because the cost of KLM tickets to a long haul destination have for some reason become more expensive than their equivalents from MAN. This time however there was only about a £60 difference between the MME-AMS-SEA-BUR flight compared to going from MAN and I thought that was worth paying for the convenience and absence of queues that MME offers. On the outward trip at least it was. Apart from the KLM flight I boarded there was almost no traffic at all (I get the impression the loss of charter and holiday flights due to the recession must have hit MME hard) and it remains one of the most stress-free airports I've ever used. There was one irritation. The Iceland volcano business started while I was away as a result of which my return was delayed by four days. While I was away I emailed MME telling them that my car would overstay its paid-in-advance booking in the airport car park asking them not to clamp it or have it towed away and asking if I'd be liable for any extra charge. Don't worry your car is safe and no extra charge came a very quick reply. However when I did return there were no airport staff around anywhere to get my ticket validated and I had to pay an extra £38 in the machine to get out of the car park. I later wrote to the airport enclosing the receipt and asking if they'd consider refunding me. It's now two months later and I've had no reply. Admittedly this is a very minor problem compared to the volcano disruption some people experienced but given that MME must be having real problems retaining routes and passengers (not surprising given how much the cost of KLM flights from the airport have gone up) I didn't find that very impressive; especially given that the volcano disruption would have meant fewer departing passengers and thus my car was not taking up a space that someone else would have wanted and been willing to pay for.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
durhamtees-valley-airport,/airport-reviews/durhamtees-valley-airport,Durham/tees Valley Airport customer review,Leo Enticknap,NA,2006-05-12,Finding this airport can be confusing because it recently changed its name from Teesside to Durham/Tees Valley. Signs on the main feeder roads (i.e. the A19 A66 and A1M) have not all been updated so look out for either. There is a free bus to and from Darlington rail station but it takes a while and is only hourly outside peak times. At the time of writing (12 May 2006) a new terminal building is under construction. The temporary entrance is on the west side of the existing terminal and again is not well signposted. This airport's major strength is that because there are only one or two flights coming and going at any time there are never any massive queues. You'll get through security and (for incoming international passengers) customs and immigration a lot quicker than at NCL or LBA. The long-term car park is significantly cheaper too. There are self-service check in machines for BMI flights to Heathrow and desks for all other flights. If you want something to eat before your flight I suggest getting it at the pub or café BEFORE going through security as the only airside food outlet does pretty grim reheated sandwiches and not much else. Ditto for newspapers/books/magazines - there is a W.H. Smith in the check-in area but not the departure lounge (but it does have a bar and a duty free shop). If there's nothing in it price-wise I would always fly from MME in preference to LBA or NCL because it's a very quick airport to get in and out of; but the facilities are more limited.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
dusseldorf-airport,/airport-reviews/dusseldorf-airport,Dusseldorf Airport customer review,J Prust,Germany,2015-02-12,30 January. First time I've taken an outbound flight from D'dorf although I've arrived here in the past. Fortunately we arrived with over two hours to spare because it took forever to get through security. No good reason other than the staff were very slow and prioritised chatting with each other to processing passengers. We were there the day after they'd been on strike (pay dispute) and it certainly looked like they were still on go- slow. Apart from that you're forced to walk through shops to get to the gates but that's the case at many airports these days. It felt crowded with inadequate seating but we were there at peak time (Friday evening). What was worrying was that our plane was delayed because passengers (who had arrived at the airport in good time) were stuck in the security queue - there was no system for pulling people out and prioritising them if their flight was due to leave.

Had checked in online and had only hand baggage. Went directly to security where we were forced to wait outside closed doors for five minutes. Edinburgh is transitioning to a new security hall. The passengers who have already been through security in the new hall have to cross at right angles the passengers who have yet to go through security in the old hall. Their solution is to close the doors to the old hall let the ""new hall"" passengers cross then close the doors to the new hall and let passengers pile into the old hall. We were told not to go to the new hall but wait there for the old hall. So we waited. On entry we found an enormous queue of passengers and only two security lanes (plus fast track) in operation. This was rush hour at Edinburgh airport. There was no calling of passengers forward for flights that were already boarding it was a case of hurry-up-and-wait (and no information). The passengers were shirty the security staff were harassed and rude. Bottom line - despite being an hour early for my flight and only needing to get through security I missed my plane. I wasn't the only one - three of us converged on the boarding gate at the same time. The only alternative flight was towards the end of the afternoon so my trip was cancelled. Edinburgh security used to be a dream (10-15 mins even during rush hour). Now it's a nightmare. There's no information on the website to let you know to be very early for your flight.

Pretty boring airport for a long wait. Food and shopping alternatives are limited and nearly non-existent once you go through security. Competency of airport staff uneven at best. Wait for luggage can vary widely but usually not too bad. I have arrived only on domestic flights so cannot comment on immigration/customs procedures.

It was badly damaged during the troubles. The only facilities were a partly destroyed hanger. Now the main terminal has been refurbished it is quite respectable. Arrival is easy enough. You will need to be firm with the baggage handlers. They have been clamped down on recently but they will still try there best to relieve you of a few $. If you let them one will carry your bags to the door another for a few more feet etc. Just say no and try not to look as if it is your first visit. Once you have got your bags you have to visit the customs bench. You will now need transport to Freetown which is the other side of a large estuary. There are helicopters a ferry and a hovercraft. Take the Paramount helicopter the other two take too long and are unreliable. It is cheap $37 on my recent visit. You may have to change this into the local Leones before buying the ticket. There is an exchange office which gives respectable rates. The helicopter departure area is the old hanger that used to be the main terminal. It is dirty and hot so try to get the first helicopter. These are old but reliable Russian MI-8's. You will arrive at the Mammy Yoko heliport. Here you will most likely be met by your local agency or whoever you are visiting. If not local taxis are available. A trip to most parts of Freetown should cost no more than Le10-20000. If you do not have accommodation booked go to the Cape Sierra Hotel or Bintumani Hotel which are very close. On the way back the helicopters leave about 6 hours before the time of departure. You then wait outside the Lungi terminal for an hour or more before suffering the long and bureaucratic check in procedure. This is typically African and can take an hour+.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,Geoffrey Wyndham-Jones,NA,2009-04-06,Recently came in from Doha on Qatar Airways transferred through Frankfurt to London on British Airways. QR arrives in Terminal 1B and BA heads out from Terminal 2D. As others have noted unless you know your way around the airport it is very easy to get lost. I would recommend that if you intend making a transfer you google 'Frankfurt Airport' and head into the 'maps' section: here you will find the relationship between Terminal 1 and 2 which will give you a rough idea of where you are headed for. Once you have a rough idea the signage (or lack of it) will not be so confusing. However because I was transferring between airlines I could not arrange for the automatic transfer of my bags at Frankfurt so had to collect them on arrival and re-check them for the next sector: to do this you have to pass through immigration so any passenger in transit between airlines will need either a EU passport or a visa in order to collect hold baggage. Maybe I was dumb but nowhere could I see a Transfer Desk as at other airports where a transfer could be carried out. Also if in transit between terminals using the overhead train be warned that you have to pass through security: as another poster has noted they use hand wands set to the most sensitive setting: watches all small change shoes belts pens etc have to be removed; even the passport in my shirt pocket had to be taken out and inspected. This is all very time-consuming: allow a minimum of 2 hours between flights if you are changing terminals. Overall a very depressing airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Terminal is quite large for a regional airport and of a modern design. Passport control seemed quick and efficient in all queues apart from mine I guess I was just unlucky in getting the fussiest immigration officer in Madeira I eventually hopped over the ropes to the next desk and was processed immediately. Bags arrived quickly and I reckon the whole process from disembarkation to clearing customs took no more than 15 minutes albeit the airport wasn't busy at the time. Departure - no major problems. Just two check-in desks open for my flight so a queue built up quickly and only one member of staff carrying out security / boarding card checks en-route to the airside area. Once airside plenty of retail opportunities but limited seating both in the terminal area and at the departure gates. Passport control has several automated e-passport lanes in addition to good old fashioned immigration officers. Toilets were clean.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,J Long,Hong Kong,2015-01-19,This has to be the worst airport experience I've had. Check in queues are ludicrous - the airport simply cannot cope at busy times and you genuinely need to arrive about 3 hours before your flight. If not you'll queue for about 90 minutes then get pulled out into a fast track queue for those flights that are leaving in 60 minutes or less. Then this will take another 20 minutes which will leave you with no time to get through the horrendous security queues. At least the security people were smiling and trying to lighten the mood when we were there. Once in departures there is a depressing lack of any shops or decent food outlets and if you end up at one of the island gate areas there are not enough seats and barely any amenities. Luckily by this point you will probably not have any time to notice this as you will be running to catch your flight. I better not mention that Geneva also has a unique baggage priority handling system which is a polite way of saying they allow people to check in more than they're allowed and then don't load all the bags on the flight. It then takes 3 days to clear the back log! The arrivals part of the airport is no better with our bags taking over 90 minutes to arrive and the place seemed totally chaotic. Up escalators were not working in some parts so you had to lug heavy bags around and the whole place was drab and dreary. It reminded me of Luton train station in the 1980's which was not it's finest time. I live in Asia and the airports here put this and most in Europe to shame.

Yes the security incident last year was dreadful and people have coped admirably but this should not allow BAA / Ferrovial to gloss over the underlying issues with an airport that is ""overtrading"" until the extension is completed. Until this happens some simple things could be done to make our lives easier and some real bugbears exist. On International arrivals why is the moving walkway always closed for maintenance / switched-off as it was on January 25th? They do not however switch off the message ""you are approaching a moving walkway"" - actually it is not working - first impressions count and this is not good. Why does baggage always take around at least 30 mins to arrive as it did on February 2nd (as usual)? Most airports around the world are much faster than this and BAA have to take a hard look at itself on this one - are the baggage handlers understaffed? It certainly looks like it and if they are they have my sympathy what with the growth of the airport. I recently used the new SkyLounge and overall it was a pleasant experience with nice staff. On a recent ski holiday flight I was subject to the usual crowd of happy skiers all off on their break and Glasgow Airport was struggling to cope. There appeared to be a ""manager"" running around with a walkie-talkie telling check-in staff not to overload the baggage belts - whilst we were all standing there. I am not sure what good this did as in my case it just seemed to annoy the check-in staff all the more on what was clearly a day that they all dread (with some justification it seems). There are some highlights. The ""mature"" gentleman in the whisky area of the duty free shop is very knowledgeable and friendly and the Caffe Nero is very small but has great staff and coffee. All in all this place is saved by the generally good natured attitude of the staff despite some inconsistent management practices and general failure to recognise that people are not likely to accept this mess without having a voice. It's all very well expanding the retail side of an airport but the priority should be a ""back to basics"" campaign from the top down in terms of customer experience in simple things like check-in baggage and moving walkways.

Examples Lufthansa Air France Sabena once operated giving links worlwide. They or another carrier still operate to other Scottish Airports.

goa-airport,/airport-reviews/goa-airport,Goa Airport customer review,A Walker,NA,2010-08-19,It would seem things have improved here. There are armed security people at the entrance to the airport and prior to the car parking areas and only passengers can enter the departures area after providing their boarding pass. Visitors can enter with a visitor pass but have to remain in a small waiting area near the glass front of the airport. The staff are friendly and the security only took a couple of minutes. After security it was pretty much the boarding gate as others have said it's a small airport. Be warned there are no walkways to the planes and all connections are made by bus across the airfield. One concern I had was from the customs where there was a large sign advising passengers not to pay bribes if requested and to report any incidences by calling a number. Not the sort of thing I'm used to seeing but at least the authorities are starting to wake up and tackle corruption in India as it is about time someone did so. Anyway staff here were polite and seemed efficient enough.

Security leads to the departure lounge which is one large untidy room full of passengers and out of the way were some filthy washroom facilities.

They have done a major upgrade since then. I arrived on a Thursday evening and was off the plane and in my hire car in a matter of a few minutes - all good and smooth. The terminal is small so it was easy with the rental cars right outside the front door. However the return journey the next day was the exact opposite. I checked in and went to the Security Screening area. I was flying Business Class and was delighted to note there was a separate lane for Business/Platinum passengers especially as the queues were enormous. However despite the red carpet and gold railings for the priority queue this system was not being manned and this entry point was one of the two that had the enormous queue. I tried to get towards the front to see if the staff would push me through but they were far away and ignored you. I saw several other people try to find the entrance to the ""fast track"" security clearance but it did not work for them either. Normally this would be nothing more than an irritant but on this occasion it was a lot more than that. The queues were enormous and after spending 20 minutes in the queue my flight was starting to board and I had to ask to be let to the front of the queue which the people in front were agreeable to. I estimate it would have taken about another 10 minutes to clear Security otherwise i.e. a total of 30 minutes.

However for international flights it is abysmal. In the mornings there are 4 international flights arriving within minutes of each other. 3 wide bodied dual aisle aircraft from Asian destinations and a smaller aircraft from NZ. The inbound duty free area is ridiculously small and acts more of a choke point for the long queues in immigration with people collecting duty free obstructing Australian passport holders from moving through. There are only 2 baggage carousels despite the 4 flights meaning that the baggage from my flight could not be unloaded onto the carousel as it was jam packed with bags from the slightly earlier Jetstar from Osaka. The Japanese owners of these bags could not collect them because they were stuck waiting for the single immigration official to clear them into Australia.

On the negative side watching many newly arrived passengers wandering aimlessly through the building looking for the baggage arrival area suggests that signage needs to be improved.

I would have gone shopping crazy if it wasn't for the short transit time (only had 1.5 hours of transit). The only downside to this was that, we landed at the airport at gate B2 (from Zagreb) and was told that our connecting flight would depart from B5 (to Dubai). My boyfriend and I were excited because when we were about to leave the aircraft we noticed that the gate was very close to us and that we wouldn't be rushing for our connecting flight. Apparently that was not possible as we were required to go back to the main terminal, go through the security checks and then walk back to the B gate area (despite the fact we already have our boarding pass). Other than that, airport is clean and had plenty to do.",Transit,14-06-2015,Couple Leisure,8,4,4,4,NA,4,4,0,NA,1
hamad-doha-airport,/airport-reviews/hamad-doha-airport,Hamad  Doha Airport customer review,R Clarke,Saudi Arabia,2015-06-15,"It's new with lots of space and seating but truly the big problem here is if you are transferring/transiting as once off the plane you have big vast walkways on the way to transfer but then you turn a corner and are met with a huge bottleneck and mass of passengers as you have to go through a security screening check which is so crowded both early morning and late at night. This needs to be sorted or doing away with as if you come off a plane and will board another one why would you need to go through a fine security check once again. This really needs to be made more efficient as the security staff are arrogant, unhelpful and rude in the cases I observed as I waited to transfer through. They say there is a fast track but its not sign-posted and passengers were just overwhelming the security area anyway. Signing in this area is pretty poor. The gates C-20-29 are downstairs and its like a sauna down there with inadequate A/C overcrowding of passengers and huge queues just to use the one toilet area there which can not cope with the humanity that flows through there even with attendants trying their best. Badly designed sadly and you still have to use buses would you believe to get to your aircraft from these gates. So you build a huge airport and yet you still have to uses buses and crowded parts of this airport to board a plane. Truly not thought out for passengers sadly in these areas.

Arrival was straightforward with bags on the belt in reasonable time. The direct S-Bahn connection to the city centre is frequent and the fare a very modest EUR2.95. Departure was also fine apart from a few minor niggles spoiling the experience. The up escalator to Terminal 1 departures was out of action leaving a choice between carrying heavy cases upstairs or cramming into a lift. Didn't it occur to anybody to reverse the direction of the down escalator which was still working? Secondly the security staff put my passport and boarding pass into the tray to go through screening (why?) but in such a position that they fell out as the tray left the machine. Luckily I noticed this and they were retrieved with no harm done but such carelessness with essential documents isn't good enough. More seriously both male and female toilets at Gate C06 were out of action (and seemed to have been for some time) with only a tiny notice in German to warn you. Since you have to go through Passport Control to reach the gate there is no access to alternative toilets unless you can persuade the Passport staff to let you back out.

hanoi-airport,/airport-reviews/hanoi-airport,Hanoi Airport customer review,J Scott,Vietnam,2013-02-19,Horrific experience during Tet. It seems that the airport management did not make any attempt to deal with the extra amount of visitors during this busy season. Domestic departures are a joke. They run 3 security gates but for the economy class passengers there they only open 2 the third is reserved for business class and 'priority' passengers. As a result the queues are so big that there is no way that the departures hall can cope - especially with no effort to organise a queue instead allowing passengers into a free-for-all scrum. Given that possibly 10% of passengers are business class or 'priority' this flaw in security gate allocations mean that 90& of passengers are squeezed into only 66% of the gates. If there was the slightest bit of common sense among the security staff then they would filter economy class passengers through the business/priority gate to ease the strain on the overly-busy economy gates. It makes no sense for a third of the security gates (and therefore a third of the security staff) to stand there doing nothing whilst the other two gates are bursting at the seams. Even when passengers who were rushing for their flights were allowed through they were forced to jump the queue of the gate relevant to their ticket therefore skipping the economy class queue. I would suggest a through review of security procedures especially considering the staff were more confused by my Vietnamese residence card (which is helpfully translated into Vietnamese) than my English passport - something I would have hoped to speed up the process! The departures hall is bearable with just about enough seats. Thankfully the domestic terminal is moderately priced for food and drink if you are a foreign/expat traveller but I suspect on the expensive side for local travellers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

It was crazy just standing there watching booths closing for the night whilst 100's of people needed to get through to the other side!

The service in the duty free shop was beyond a joke and people panicking about missing flights ended up yelling at the guy on the till to stop chatting to his workmate and get serving people quickly - it was the only place we could get snacks and water to take on the plane as the food and service on the plane was absolutely dire.

This airport has some negative and positive sides in my opinion. On arrival into HEL to connect to a flight to TMP within a very tight schedule I nearly missed my connecting flight due to long queue at immigration counters (all international arrivals at the same time). Airport staff did nothing to help those with tight connection time and were pretty hopeless. I were told that if I missed my connecting flight the airline would put me on the next available flight. Why can't they have a designated line/counter for passengers with tight connecting time? At the end I was running to my gate and was one of the last remaining passengers to board the connecting bus to remote aircraft stand. If they want to become a better transit airport in Europe either they need to look into this or Finnair cannot sell ticket with short connecting time (45 mins).

Shelter should be provided. As the line started to move people pushing in arguments between people it was obvious the stress was taking its toll. Check in staff were rude and unhelpful.

Thank goodness we did not have hold luggage (we live out there) and that we checked in online as the queues were horrible! But despite some other reviews on here the toilets look new and clean. On arrival from Bristol we herded off the plane onto some awful cramped bus and driven at twice the speed of sound to the terminal which wasn't very comfortable as we had to stand up. On return to Heraklion (to fly to Bristol) it was worse. Our easyJet flight was called early but we did not know about this I just happened to go and look at the departure screen where it said in very small letters gate 6 (or something like that) but it didn't say boarding. We queued up at the back with another lady who same as us had paid for speedy boarding. One lady seemed to shout in Greek that speedy boarder's should come and stand by her at the front. She then tore up my boarding pass (no efficient cutter or anything) and then we were told to go and stand outside on the steps. 10 minutes later a bus came for the Gatwick passengers (whose flight was leaving 30 mins after ours!) and then finally 25 minutes later a bus came for us. Awful service at Heraklion! When we got onto the brand new easyJet plane to take us home (very pleased) we sat right at the front so very good legroom.

At check-in counters your bags are weighed and labelled but you have to carry your luggage to a bag drop-off counter yourself which was quite confusing.

heraklion-airport,/airport-reviews/heraklion-airport,Heraklion Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2007-10-29,"We must have passed through Heraklion airport at much the same time as your previous correspondent but our experience was much easier - perhaps things were quieter because of our late evening flights. We last used Heraklion 6 years ago and remembered little apart from the crowding - until we read the reference about the entertainment value of the bottom step from the duty free as we'd been entertained too! Obviously Heraklion has been redeveloped since then because there's much more space and no longer an irregular bottom step from the duty free. On arrival we too did have a long wait for our bags and I would agree that it was not easy to find which carousel was to be used. While I waited for the suitcase my wife went through to process our car rental pick-up and had it all sorted long before our bag came through. Leaving from Heraklion was far easier than departures we've had from other Greek airports. BA check-in opened early so that only took us about 10 minutes there was no queue at all for the separate baggage drop and there was plenty of seating in the pre-security departure area. We didn't even have to queue to go through security either time (more of that later!) though we're not sure how searching security actually was as the visible screen didn't seem to recive much attention. Lots of space in the departure lounge and much cleaning going on. We didn't try to buy anything as we tend to avoid airport food anyway so I can't comment on price or quality. The only problem that arose was when our flight was called - we were in the wrong depature lounge! We had to go back through security right through the check-in area through more security to find Gate 1 at the other end of the terminal building. We don't think we missed any signs or information but most other passengers for the flight seemed to be in the right place so we assume that it is something to do with ""Schengen"" which is a mystery to us who are more used to shorter journeys with low-cost airlines. By the time we reached the gate the buses to the plane were being loaded but we weren't the last by any means so perhaps we weren't the only ones in the wrong place.

Most westerners visit Hiroshima using land routes from other cities so the airport is not as western 'friendly' as bigger Japanese airports.

The food concession stands also cater to Japanese tastes only so you are out of luck if you only like western food. There are also no magazines or books in any language other than Japanese.

Plus points: 1) I stayed at the Regal Airport Hotel connected to landside of the arrivals section. Very good hotel with good service and facilities and reasonably priced. 2) Transport links are sound with bus and taxi options. 3) The terminal itself had all the essential facilities and conveniences. Minus points: 1) All passenger conveyors - escalators and travelators - have bollards that prevent passengers from bring baggage. From a safety perspective this is understandable with escalators - there are always lifts nearby too - but less so with travelators. 2) I did not find HKIA to be the easiest to navigate to my gate - wayfinding itself was fine but there were a lot of directional changes walking and the need to go from Terminal 1 to T2 by train in order to get my flight from T1. 3) The satellite building where my flight was leaving from was not well set-up for food and retail - the main building was but suffered from very heavy queuing which I could not afford to wait in. General thoughts: My experience of arriving at HKIA is generally positive across the board save for the initial feeling of confusion at the sight of high-rising escalators crossing each other in an imposing arrivals area. My experience from check-in to boarding the aircraft isn't one I look back on favourably - at the risk of sounding lazy I felt that a lot of time was wasted on the walking required and the queuing in the main retail and food complex added to my frustrations.

The time it took from disembarking my CX flight to reaching the main concourse was over one hour due to being held up by baggage not coming out. I was particularly frustrated and anxious as I only had a 2 hour connection for a QF flight. As more people gathered around the belt by the time the luggage eventually came out it was chaotic and a matter of push and shove to collect bags. Problem was compounded with long immigration and security lines and 2 of the end counters for immigration were not in use which was very poor supervision by staff considering the situation. Once on the main concourse after 1.5 hrs whilst I couldn't get a thorough look around there weren't many Western food outlets and just lines of shops it really didn't offer much. Departures was just as bad and customs and immigration once again inefficient.

The last couple of times I used the airport which were in Jan 2013 Nov and Aug 2012 the immigration queues were getting depressingly long. Although as a local I got to pass through by the fast e-channel the excessively long immigration lines were worrying and must be unpleasant for visitors.

Once I left the airplane I went to the transit area immediately and was surprised to find a long queue. The security area was not under staffed but they just didn't work effectively. Despite the long queue there was only one line opened (with 8 members of the staff). It took me at least 40-50 minutes just to go through security and had to run all the way to the other end of the airport to catch another flight. This is very similar to the arrival experience where there is always a long queue. On my return journey I travelled from Kowloon to the airport. The Airport Express was still a very smooth journey and the departure experience was so much better than transit. However the airport is starting to show its age and has become less exciting. Expensive duty free limited choice unless if you would like to buy expensive designer clothes.,NA,NA,NA,5,1,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Traveling from here to the other islands has sometimes been unpredictable but I have had no real complaints. But now (2015) the usual difficulties of traveling out of Honolulu have been compounded by construction. Problems include crammed lines at agriculture security, no one to deal with priority customers (in my case American Airlines), a long walk and terrible mash up of a line up at the non TSA checkpoint (curiously my line this time around - June - was almost all females with children), one line for everyone, no faster lane as in almost all medium sized or large airports. I am sorry for older folks or folks with disabilities who might have to contend with this.

Gates are scattered about in a way that makes it difficult to get from one to the other. Transport between terminals via Wiki-Wiki shuttle is inefficient.

Once you deplane you have to walk a long way to the Delta baggage claim and signage is not very good. The airport is old but everything works. I found it quite interesting to leave the gate area and walk outdoors to the main terminal where baggage claim and the arrival hall is. Baggage was delivered within a few minutes after the first pax made the long hike. Once outside I found the official airport shuttle to Waikiki and was on my way. Departure was just as swift with your bags being scanned by the agriculture department before heading to check-in. The departure lobby is really very old and baggages are stacked behind the check-in counter before being transported to the plane. Security was quite quick and if you are leaving on an international flight you have a nice choice of duty free goods but if you leave on a domestic flight like I did there really is not much. I had some Japanese food before heading to the gate area and I was glad that the plane left almost on time as it's pretty boring being stuck in that airport for long.

Out of a possible 30 or so desks there were about six open for international passengers at that time of night. The immigration officer we saw was polite and processed us smoothly. We did not have to line up for very long before being processed but I did note that more people had joined a line once we had cleared immigration. It would I think take some considerable time to clear immigration here if there had been another international flight arriving. I saw the Global Entry kiosks before arriving at Immigration but I did not see anyone use these at the time I passed them. (As a UK citizen I am ineligible to use such a service). Baggage for our flight came off quite quickly. One thing I have now noticed is that when the customs form is handed in you now have to show your passport to them also. The taxi rank was not well sign-posted outside and the dispatcher had isolated himself in a glass box!. Once we had managed to communicate with this individual the taxi arrived soon afterwards.

It turns into a completely wasted day. Management seems to not care about passenger flow. They torture you with long lines with 4 or 5 stations out of 80 (yes 80) open. The appearance of security is there so while they delay you anyone can walk off with your luggage because there is nothing to monitor it at the back end. No nexus pass to speed things up. No priority for connections or smooth connection process. Do not buy duty free perfume or liquor etc. You are a transit passenger but it will be confiscated or taxed because you pass through customs.

I believe the very different appreciations of this airport are in part due to the fact that all terminals are not equal. Arriving from Paris on the AF flight. Quite a long walk until you get to immigrations (no longer at its original place). There some queue and waiting time but it was organized with employees guiding the passengers and it took no more than 20 minutes to go through the control. Luggage already on the conveyor ! All in all not a bad performance. On the return I am not so satisfied.The safety controls are undersized for the number of passengers (and this day a number of flights were cancelled because of weather !) in what looks to be a (for-ever ?) temporary location and it took ages to go through the process while messages kept informing you that commenting on safety procedures was an offence. The so called ""magic"" X ray system does not seem to be an improvement it is long an about 50 % of the passengers need to be hand-checked anyway. Then the terminal itself must be the barest international terminal I ever saw : 1 small duty-free shop (do your shopping in town prices are better and there is no choice) a very limited (US only) newspaper stand no bookshop no electronics shop only 1 bar / snack no plugs for computer it's big and empty.

Transit security check very quick at 04.00 but very slow about one hour at 07.00.

The airport appears well managed with staff who remember that passengers are customers not cattle that are there to be processed.

If I had one complaint about ICN it would be the smoking they have rooms to smoke but either the air handling was broken or not efficient; you could smell the smoking rooms from a distance. The transit hotel was up to western standards however the bathroom was a little dated and needed a coat of paint.

The baggage is often available as soon as you arrive after a short walk from the plane. Quite often I've been outside the airport within ten minutes of the flight touching down. On departures the security queue and process can be a little tedious if there are a few flights departing at about the same time and there's only the minimum of facilities in the departure lounge (although there is free wi-fi). The car park is a bit more expensive than it should be; if you're away for a weekend it seems very pricey (currently the first day costs £11.50 but £3.50 thereafter).

Compared to some others I was quite lucky to arrive at a time where the queues at passport control were limited.

Then the boarding room is small with not enough seats (as in most airports). Boarding by Bus. It was worth on the way back. For some reason Turkish Airlines site would not allow me to print my second (international) boarding card and time was short. There is a ""quick way"" from domestic to international but you need the boarding card! Luckily could find an automate that worked. Safety control was not too bad. But on the international side boarding rooms are much smaller than on domestic with a pitiful number of seats. Plane was delayed with very little information.

The metro transport from the airport to Sultan Ahmet is cheap and only involves one change/connection. Cafes are ok and reasonable choice in duty free. The signage was a little unclear at times.

First a security check has been added after you leave the transfer desk if you are taking a transit flight. Second a number of foreign nationals can now purchase a visitor visa upon arrival at IST if they have a US UK Canadian or Schengen visa or a permanent residence card of those countries. The catch is that if you happen to arrive on flight from the US you can not purchase a visa from the booth closest to your flight. You have to go to the other end of the airport to the other visa booth to purchase a visa.

Ridiculously overpriced cafe (the airside section of which is upstairs no escalator or lift) duty free shop was closed. We were almost forcibly frogmarched into very narrow crowded boarding queues for our Easyjet departure over 1/2 hour before the incoming flight had even landed. Eventually we were loaded onto a crowded bus which pulled out onto the tarmac then the driver got out switched off the engine and left us sweltering (it was a very hot day) for 5 or 10 minutes - only when a riot almost ensued did he get back in the bus and switch on the air conditioning.

Old and Not enough restaurants for an airport this size. I cannot comprehend how this is one of the busiest airports in the world and look this way. Queues for Checks is a mess and amount of checks frankly not really logical. 1st- security check to enter Check-in Area 2nd- Immigration 3rd-Security check at Gate 4th- Collection immigration Card (not sure why the immigration officer cant do that as they collect part of it upon arrival) 5th Boarding Pass to Board Plane. Every single check means more Queues. However the Airport does reflect Jakarta in a glimpse. Surprisingly Domestic Terminal 3 is much more modern cleaner and easier to navigate.

The outer corridor and kerbside felt so crowded and messy that we just wanted to get a taxi as quickly as we could upon arrival. Similarly upon departure we quickly walked through these areas and headed straight away into the check-in hall which was fortunately accessible only to passengers. We traveled with an infant and we were disappointed to find out that a proper baby nursing/changing room was only available past check-in hall and before the immigration counters. Having gone through immigration we felt that backtracking was a hassle. Post immigration we found that the area did not have sufficient seating although the concourse was not particularly crowded and there were not that many flights departing at that time. We then stumbled upon a pay-per-use lounge called Mutiara Lounge. Entry was 80000Rp (approx. USD8) per person which we thought was cheap.

I was in the second queue for another 45 minutes - with 6 people in front of me - but I ended up waiting for this officer to process 14 people before my turn. When it was finally my turn officer decided to take a break he referred me to the other counter he then changed his mind and processed two more passengers who were behind me and left me waiting at the counter. The officers were chatting up a storm during this whole process. The long queues did not seem to bother them at all. To take >3 minutes to process one passenger is simply too slow in any international airport and there is no queuing system in place at all.

kabul-airport,/airport-reviews/kabul-airport,Kabul Airport customer review,Dave Stanley,NA,2005-07-18,I have used Kabul airport frequently since the fall of the Taleban. It was originally built by the Russians many years ago. It is difficult to find any thing positive to say about it. It might have been better if it was destroyed in the war. The moment you arrive you will be greeted by long queues at immigration - the do like to do things very slowly in Afghanistan. You then have the chaos of baggage reclaim. The Afghans have no idea about waiting and there will usually be a mad rush for the hole in the wall where the baggage eventually comes out. The conveyor belt had been repaired last time I was there but will probably have broken by now. You are quite safe in the airport at least as far as security goes. Check in can also be painfully slow. Even African airports are more efficient. The waiting area is not very clean and will be smoke filled. OK a couple of positive things. I have never been hassled for bribes by airport officials and the restaurant upstairs is not too bad if it is open.

It is a well-presented and apparently well-maintained airport with reasonable functionality and transport links.

This applies to both arriving and departing passengers, and the latter seems quite unique to KLIA. Upon arrival at KLIA, it is quite normal to join a queue for foreign passports that will last some 20 minutes or more. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of passenger-flow monitoring and accommodating peak periods. When going through ticket presentation from check-in to security, at KLIA there is a row of Immigration desks for passport/biometrics capture. My experiences over the last 17 years have shown this to be a very quiet area, so I was particularly surprised at the queues that I had to join last Wednesday (24th). I don't know if there was a unique event or incident that contributed to this, but everything seemed normal to that point. My queue lasted 20 minutes, and was the quicker queue as an extra desk opened up towards the end. Up to that point, there were three desks out of 7+ open for foreign passports, with an extra two for ""First and Business Class"" that did not call over any passengers to alleviate the queue when they were not serving anyone. That aside, it was the usual positive experience, if unspectacular. But the queuing desperately needs addressing.",Arrival and Departure,28-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,6,1,5,NA,NA,4,3,2,NA,1

It is without a doubt one of the worst airports that I have experienced. In addition to being very badly designed (many of the gates are 15 minutes or more walking distance from the check-in / arrival hall with very few travelators) it is very poorly constructed and maintained. I used it in the 1st week that it was open and it was obvious that operations had commenced before it was finished. Now after little more than 1 year it looks like a 20 year old building.

Firstly the aerotrain has no announcement that the doors are closing or where are we heading it just zooms off. The terminal was not very crowded when I first arrived and the airport staff are not that friendly and welcoming. There was a long queue to get the tickets on the KLIA Express and in my opinion they should get more staff to work on the sales of the KLIA Express tickets. Once again not much to complain about the arriving journey at KLIA. The departing journey from KLIA was a horrible journey. Check in was slow even though I had checked in online but forgotten to print my boarding pass which will let me bypass immigration and go straight to the gate. Secondly I was quite unlucky to get a queue with only 1 immigration officer while others have two I have spent a total of 30 minutes just to get through the immigration which is a lot compared to other international airports. I was also almost late for my flight. The immigration officers had grumpy looks on their faces. The terminal is not well lit and in my opinion they have chosen the wrong lighting colours. The KLIA Express trains are showing their age and have water dripping from the ceilings. The route from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur has a wide range of transport options.

You need to go through scanning for your luggage first then check in counters. It was so disorganised. Nothing at waiting area not enough seats and dining options and very dirty. Then you will have a long march to the aircraft. Landing experience is not much better. First long march with no signs. Once you are outside the shed another chaotic parking and pick up experience.

Also if you fly to a SE Asian destination you usually use the gates which are above the domestic ones - and there you also have limited duty free. The satellite terminal has a good choice of shops and restaurants although of course the food is airport food. One annoying thing about KLIA are the frequent announcements in Bahasa Malaysia English and Chinese for everything. Also I do not understand why they are constantly changing gates for flights.

Sometimes there is some congestion at the gate area as security checks are done at each gate. Staff is usually friendly but you sometimes come across one or two souls who are having a bad day.

The big lacking of this terminal was that the air conditioning did not seem to function properly causing the whole airport to be humid hot and uncomfortable.

It's never the busiest airport and is now attempting to drive people to electronic log in at a number of terminals by departures.

kuwait-airport,/airport-reviews/kuwait-airport,Kuwait Airport customer review,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,2015-06-17,"I honestly have been to this airport far too many times considering that I have once lived here in Kuwait before (but this will be my first review on the airport). 1) Upon arrival, for some passengers, it is required of us to obtain a visa on arrival before heading to the immigration counter. I have noticed huge improvements with this service as they now photocopy your passport getting your passport stamped at the visa place (which did ease up the whole transaction). I did notice however that there was no information with regards to the price for the visa. Last time I came, I paid 5kd but my boyfriend (on an American passport) didn't pay for any. I actually had to Google up the actual cost and turns out its only 3kd. Anyway the whole visa process was easy thankfully. 2) It was not notified to us that those who already have their passport stamped at the visa application area can just walk through the immigration without going through the queue as you already have your passport stamped. 3) Coming back to this airport and heading out to Abu Dhabi almost gave me a heart attack. This airport has a weird way of organising their check in counters as they would group some airlines in one gate/area (e.g. Omanair, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways would be in the same check in area). Passengers are required to stand out the airport and look at the direction to figure out which gate/area they need to go to check in. Anyway, as I entered the airport, I noticed there was a long line at the luggage check going out to area I needed to get my boarding pass. I have already checked in online and all I needed to do was get my boarding pass. I didn't even have any luggage to scan as I flew in the same day as I am heading back out. My flight was due to leave in 1.5 hours and I noticed that all those that queued up were ones that were flying with Emirates. Thankfully, the security guy at the luggage check allowed me to jump the queue (scan just my handbag) and proceed to the counter. 4) There are hardly any shops in here. Both before and after immigration. I'm happy to see the new coffee shops area at the end of the terminal which is usually less crowded and more peaceful. Overall, it is an OK airport to be at for a short transit.

There was no separate accomodation for Business or First Class at boarding and not even an announcement - everyone just headed for the door when it seemed ready to load. The facility seemed old dusty and tired (like Kuwait in general) and ground staff was not at all helpful.

The Air Canada United and JetBlue gates in Terminal B appear to have changed little since the Nixon presidency aside from the signage and the absence of smoking. Plastic coverings on the ceilings presumably due to leaks also suggest a facility badly in need of repair. Food and time-passing options in Terminal B are limited to three small food outlets a convenience store and a duty-free shop for Canada-bound passengers Wi-Fi is pay-to-use only.

No it does not have free wifi and some of the other up-to-the-minute amenities of competing airports of its size but it is positioned in an ideal location for those staying in Manhattan. With its relatively small size and its frequent bus service I was in my Manhattan accommodation within 50 minutes of my plane touching down and that is after catching a bus and the subway. (The bus stop is literally just outside the door of baggage claim.) I did not find baggage claim to be any more chaotic than my last trip to McCarran-Las Vegas and I did not encounter any real facility uncleanliness either.

In place of the Fox Sky Box restaurant with all the TVs is some french cuisine place that is overpriced. In place of Chili's another very popular and safe choice is some other very high end restaurant that again is overpriced. Forget dining for fun on the run and grabbing a reasonably priced burger chicken or salad. Now you have salmon and steak as your choices. That is the most screwed up decision I have ever seen in airport retail. Starbucks before security - gone. Starbucks after security - gone. In place is some other new coffee that will not attract all the same traffic other than the fact that it is the only coffee joint there. And finally there are so many bags of chips and grab and go items everywhere that it literally looks like a supermarket.

While it is convenient in that you go to just one place regardless of which company you use and there are then just two busses to choose from (depending on which terminal you are departing from) you have a long trip on the bus and need to allow for the extra time (and getting to the rental car facility by vehicle can be confusing since you do not take the same main road as to get to the airport terminal).

I arrived at Terminal 1 on US Airways and had no issues with signage although it was a long walk from the gate to baggage claim. My only issue was the delay in recovering my baggage due to confusion about which carousel it was on and even this was cleared up after a few minutes. The ground transportation area was very busy but problem-free. For the flight back the biggest obstacle was getting to the terminal through the extremely crowded lane for shuttle buses taxis etc on the Terminal 1 departures area. The driver eventually had to let us off some distance from where we needed to be but everything went okay. The lineups for check-in looked extremely long but there were lots of terminals for electronic check-in which kept things moving and after this the wait to check baggage was pretty short. The TSA security lineups were also pretty fast. There were lots of shopping opportunities before going through security and still some decent shopping and eating after going through security. The waiting areas were quite pleasant and offered a good view of the airport ramps for an airplane nut.

The idea of separate lounges (one for business one for leisure) is smart. I got a lot of work done on a 5 hrs delay and the £17 for 3 hours fare was well paid for. The small airport after the revamp has managed to squeeze in a lot of shops and cafes but still managed to preserve a small gathering area for each gate. The airport is obviously always busy and I can't imagine how it can be during peak holiday times. After security (pretty friendly and fast indeed) the hall is stretched to an almost single passageway. Getting a seat in the various cafes and fast-food places is a lottery.

By the time we got inside the terminal over 200 passengers waited in line ahead of us with a recorded message playing ""Sorry for the delay due to large number of inbound flights"".

The new layout still relies heavily on shopping food and bars but if you don't want to use these facilities places to just sit quietly are severely limited. We now try and arrive at the airport as late as possible to avoid the inconvenience in the departure lounge. Sadly we can't cut it too fine as security is still surly and slow! Arriving back into LBA doesn't improve the impression. The escalator up to passport control is still not working after 10 years (no quick fix here then! - shops more important). Elderly people left to struggle with their bags up the stairs and then a long walk to meet the rude and slow passport control staff. After all this you would at least expect your luggage to be on the carousel (after negotiating more stairs back down!). However this is rarely the case as with everything else at this airport at all goes very slow. If you need help with a trolley well that's another non-refundable £1 and then it's another £2 for someone to pick you up in the car park.

Flew Jet2 to Budapest and back and had a great experience at LBA check in there was no queues whatsoever and security was the same. The new departures area is quite a transformation much different to when I flew out of LBA last around 7 years ago it looks great but unfortunately is still ongoing. New restaurants and a couple of bars as well as a duty free area give it a great feel bar was rather pricey but it is an airport. Boarding was smooth despite the old way of walking out to the aircraft was well signposted (unlike Budapest airport) and everything is fine.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2012-05-16,This used to be a pleasant little airport. However in recent years it has been taken over by a company determined to squeeze every last penny out of customers. The drop-off area costs £2 simply to enter so many people simply take a chance and drop passengers off on the mini-roundabouts. There is no taxi rank so taxis bringing passengers to the airport cannot get a fare back to the city. The airport taxis are provided by Arrow cabs which are more expensive than local firms (for example £20 to my home instead of the local firm's fare of £10). If you live locally and are flying home take the number of a local cab firm with you and call them when you leave the plane. The taxi will be waiting for you when you exit the airport. Public transport is poor; there is no train service and the many flights arrive or leave outside the hours of the bus services. The terminal is cramped so it can be difficult for example to get through to the lavatories if you are carrying hand luggage. There are shops but the selection is not good and the cafes are crowded so you will not be served quickly. The only advantage of LBA is convenience if you live locally.

lilongwe-airport,/airport-reviews/lilongwe-airport,Lilongwe Airport customer review,D Moir,NA,2009-05-01,Lilongwe airport (Malawi) takes you back to some of the delights of 70's travel - no announcements so you have to listen carefully when the staff shout which plane is boarding. Fortunately it's a small and quiet international airport so you can't go too far wrong unless you're asleep! There's enough shops to keep you entertained for 10 minutes there's a cafe and you can watch the planes from the outdoor balcony - and there's not much else. But what it needed to do it did so efficiently and pleasantly - nice to be aware from the security paranoia of LHR or other big western airports. Note - the duty free doesn't come in sealed duty free bags so you do run the risk of losing it all if you transit to somewhere else as we did.

Queue for security check is bearable and the choice of shopping is reasonable - although the Port wines are much more expensive than what you pay in town. The Harrods cafe along with other dining options are good. They are also expanding the airport by adding more shops and space. Immigration (to non Schegen) was efficient. The gates for non Schegen area also have plenty of seats and are very airy and bright. Arrival is another story. The wait for luggage always takes more than a good 30 minutes if not more.

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,I can only reiterate what I said in October: though it is far from perfect I much prefer Liverpool over Manchester as my choice of airport. I also wonder whether some customers expect to find First Class service at an airport which is served almost exclusively by low-cost carriers. The fact that bus transfers from the car parks are neither necessary nor provided is an advantage as far as I am concerned. Also I have never encountered any unpleasantness from any of the security staff during any of our many departures over the years. Last week the lady who attended to my wife and myself was both very friendly and helpful. Transit through the airport on both legs of our trip was as speedy as usual which was particularly helpful on the outward journey as we had been held up for at least 30 minutes in heavy traffic en route from North Shropshire.

I read the criticisms of both and find that while I agree with some of the things that are said about them both when it comes to choice I would always prefer Liverpool over Manchester because Liverpool is smaller and less crowded. I agree that it is looking tatty around the edges and that the management seems to be doing all it can to encourage spending even removing most of the seats near gates 12 and 3 where we used to wait happily away from all the commercial outlets for our flight to be called. However it has a big airy security area where we have never encountered any long queues whereas we have found security at Manchester both congested and claustrophobic. It has rarely taken us more than 30 minutes from one of the on site car parks to the departure lounge on our outward journey while on our most recent return journey we landed at 23.30 and exited from the car park at 23.50. At Manchester one is lucky to complete the same process in an hour unless you pay over the odds for the closest car parks.

For me an airport's principal purpose is to facilitate my departure / arrival as painlessly as possible and LPL has largely done so each time I have used it this year. I have no problems with walking from the car park (instead of having to wait for a transfer bus as at some airports) and travelling hand luggage only have rarely spent more than half an hour getting from car park through to departure lounge. Passage through security has always been swift - but my wife and I are usually flying out first thing in the morning - and we have never encountered any lack of politeness perhaps because a smile and a ""Good morning"" from us creates a favourable ambience. Even when we had an item confiscated last week (a jar of jam - don't ask!) it was done in a perfectly pleasant way and demonstrated that the security staff were vigilant. I would agree that the carpeting throughout the terminal looks dowdy but I think that is due to an unfortunate choice of pattern / colour rather than actual dirtiness. Returning through LPL isn't the most exciting experience in the world especially if two flights arrive almost simultaneously but I have queued far longer at passport control in Spanish airports and had longer walks from plane to exit.

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Ed Smith,United Kingdom,2012-07-01,"I used Liverpool airport for the first time in a few years recently - I have to say the Departure experience has vastly improved - gone now is the terrible old slow security area that forced you to queue on the stairs or tried to blackmail you with a ""Priority Security Charge"" - the security area is now well staffed and you get through it quickly - plus the new route through departures takes you on a nice walk with good views across the airfield and the river. The departure area is well equipped with shops and cafes etc but still with plenty of waiting space and you don't have to walk far to the gates. I like the fact that they have a couple of bits of John Lennon memorabilia scattered about the place - I'd suggest that they acquire some more and turn it into a bit of a mini-museum - little things like that make a difference to an airport experience. Flying into the airport is still a bit rubbish though - you now have to walk along a long semi-exposed walkway through to the arrivals area which is fun when it's cold and wet - fine if you are travelling on your own but this must be an ordeal if you have young kids in tow. To be fair when I arrived baggage reclaim was quick as was passport control and I was in the arrivals area within about 10 mins of touchdown which really isn't bad. Parking fees are pretty steep at the airport - I'd suggest if you are getting collected the best thing would be for whoever is collecting you to wait in a side road and for you to phone them when you are about to go through customs then meet them in the ""drop off"" zone - you still only get 5 mins so you need to be quick (again probably not practical if you have kids in tow or have mobility problems).

The car park is always extremely busy and you're generally forced to park in or near the overflow area ending up around 3/4 mile from the terminal. The walk (there are no buses) from the car park to the terminal requires dodging cars avoiding tripping on the awful footpath and if you use a luggage trolley playing the ""when the will the trolley turn over and dump all my luggage on the road"" game. It's an absolute joke of a car park. Now the airport - it used to be good. It was a small well run and organised business.

Following recent surgery my wife temporarily needed wheelchair assistance and we could not fault the service provided. It was even thanks to LPL's e-mail passenger service system that I finally discovered how to contact easyJet to add a request for special assistance. We were directed to the PRM (Passengers of Reduced Mobility) desk when we arrived checked in there and were issued with a wheelchair and then allowed to make our own way through security to the gate. Security was very quiet but in any case we were directed straight to the nearest desk where everyone was very attentive and helpful. There were even apologies for the need to ""frisk"" my wife. We had to have a convoy system for boarding as there were 7 wheelchair passengers for the flight the other 6 of whom required the ""ambulift"" while my wife was able to climb the aircraft steps alone and at her own speed. The whole procedure went so smoothly that the flight actually was able to leave early. Our return was equally well handled: since an ambulift appeared at the side of the plane and there were only 2 PRM passengers this time it seemed churlish to turn it down so we were transported directly to passport control and bypassed the queues in the chicane. At no point in either direction did we get the impression that PRM passengers were a nuisance or inconvenience.",NA,NA,NA,5,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Most people seemed to be flying to European destinations and were bemused by the chaos.

Check-in was straightforward and the North terminal wasn't crowded at all. There was ample space and it was very clean! Its also well sign-posted - I had to use the shuttle to get from the South to the North terminal and I haven't used Gatwick in a long time so was a little anxious about where everything was but turns out everything was dead simple to find! Security was security and staff weren't that friendly but I wasn't there for more than 5 minutes so no worries there. Departure lounge is a little disappointing as it didn't have as many shops and restaurants as I had anticipated but as an airport that offers mainly European routes you can't really expect it to be like Heathrow. Though saying that I think they are planning on adding more shops and restaurants. Departure gate took forever to appear on screen but once it was there it was a fairly short walk to it from the departure lounge and then after 10 mins at gate we were told to board the plane which was brilliant as I wanted to just sit back and relax. On the way back to Gatwick - passport queues were horrendous but they were moving steadily rather than being a complete stand still so was through in about half an hour.

Similarly on the way back no long delays at passport control at 23.30 if you have a chipped passport. Still a few things that could be done to improve things. Firstly a few more toilets after you get off the plane before getting to passport control. Secondly I like the fact they now give an estimate of when the earliest bags will arrive and last bag arrival based on average past experience. Just over 50% of time bags first appear 20 mins after the plane arrives on stand but you are still waiting in a crowded area with no chairs. Thirdly late at night most of the shops are closed and I needed a bite to eat and a drink. But the major problem is with the short term car parks they look identical and although the ticket says write the floor number and row it does not say which car part (5 or 6?).

As others have commented there has been a vast improvement and there are still some changes to be fully implemented. Parked in the short term car park which is still relatively expensive. BAA use to offer a reduced price at weekends from Friday to Sunday and I would like to see that re-introduced. The signs when entering the airport area particularly the filter to the right leading to the car park could be improved as well as signs to the number of entrances to the car park building itself. Easy walk to the terminal buildings which makes a good first impression from the outside. A short walk inside still looks a bit scruffy and then one needs to re-orientate oneself for check-ins or security etc. Security excellent both in time and friendliness and professionalism of the staff except they may need someone or a machine to stack the trays after they have gone through the x-ray machine as passengers are not doing it. The waiting area is still a bit crowded good choice of shops and places to eat on two levels not all of them high end but more high street just needs a Tesco Express or Sainsbury's. Television monitors well placed for information about flights. Long and strange walk to use the toilets. I am not sure if that is temporary while other building work is being carried out or going to be a permanent placement. Longish walk to the aircraft but not untypical of large airports nice views out over the airport and some electric walkways good lighting and flooring. On the way back minimal wait for passport control and staff at the border also friendly and professional.

South Terminal security area is now much larger and brighter and I have never waited more than 5 minutes recently to pass through security. Selection of shops and restaurants is good and the departure lounges have always been clean and reasonably presented (notwithstanding a rather outdated feel and appearance overall). On my return from Italy on Sunday 27 May to the NT I was pleasantly surprised to find a very short EU immigration queue and clean bathroom facilities. Only criticisms would be a relatively long wait for baggage (which may actually be BA's fault) and the lack of a rail connection directly from the North Terminal.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

During the 1980's I would regularly leave a Scottish airport on time only to spend an hour or so circling over Gatwick due to congestion on the one runway. Departing from the airport today it is obvious that enormous sums of money have been invested into the shopping mall that you are faced with following the security bottle-neck. On arrival however it is a very different matter an assault course is the first welcome to the incoming passenger who is then faced with passport controls that operate in a building site that seems to have remained in the same state for about 10-years floors walls and ceilings all in a state of mess as is the baggage collection area that is designed to create a bottle-neck of passengers blocking the flow from many flights who are trying to find where their baggage will be dumped.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,O Omar,United Arab Emirates,2015-08-01,"Arrived on BA from Dubai at Terminal 5 at around 6 am, along with a bunch of long-haul 747/777/A380 arrivals from all over the world. There were bottlenecks on the walk from the gate down to the shuttle trains which take people from the remote satellite terminals to the 'main' part of T5 which houses passport control/baggage reclaim as well as check-in/security on departure. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get on a train, because in many cases the shuttles would arrive from the previous stop (the C gates) already full. Was a bit stressful. At passport control, it was a 30-minute wait for non-EU nationals, expected as this was the morning rush. Immigration officer was courteous and polite (am a frequent visitor to the UK, so minimal questions asked). She endorsed (i.e. stamped) the wrong visa, and when I pointed out her error, she rectified her mistake with minimal fuss. Bags didn't take much time. Very convenient vending machines if you need to pick up a SIM card in the baggage claim hall-if not, there are several shops in the arrivals area selling UK SIM cards, plus WHSmith and a few other outlets. Signage to Heathrow Express clear, and in 20 minutes was in central London. Departure: Arrived on the HEX, and wanted to do VAT refund, but the office was on the other side of the terminal, and quite busy at that, so I ended up ditching-they should have a VAT refund office on either end of the large T5 check-in area. My flight left at 1pm, and there were quite a number of flights leaving, a mixture of European and intercontinental flights. Used self-service kiosks to print BPs, then waited for a good 30 minutes in the bag drop queue. Would be much more efficient to have a proper self check-in service, where passengers can print and stick their bag tags themselves. Although the queue to get into security was short, getting in line to go through the scanner, then waiting again for the bags to come out through the machine all ended up taking a good 15 minutes. By then, only had 70 minutes or so until departure. Bearing in mind that my flight left from Gate B35, which required another ride on the shuttle, only had 20-25 minutes to grab a bit and run. Despite arriving 3 hours in advance, with the all the walking and waiting, felt like I was cutting it close. Overall a mixed bag. I highly recommend anyone planning on doing a VAT refund to get there a good 4 hours before their flight (and of course, you need to be prepared to show them your purchases, so unless it's in your carry-on, you need to do this before checking in your bags).",Arrival and Departure,01-07-2015,Solo Leisure,7,2,5,5,4,4,4,NA,3,1

And the terminal was very overcrowded. Then when I went to get my flight directions were poor realised very late that my gate was on lower level. Other passengers were also late finding the gate. Then had to take bus a ridiculously long way to the plane. It took forever. So flight was late departing which meant being stuck in a long queue to take off.

Once through security (no problems there with the staff) there are enough seats for everyone. My main gripe is the place lacks that certain atmosphere the old T2 had. It all seemed a bit too new and sterile. Walking under the aircraft parking area to get to the departure gate was a little annoying but moving walkways help. On return the corridor from the gate to the security/passport area is so narrow its a joke. That said everything is on one level and walking distances are short. Spoilt by the queue at the e-passport booths but made up somewhat by fast baggage delivery and a short walk to get outside for the buses to the car parks.

I travelled economy so no fast track or lounge for me so had the basic encounter with the airport and have no complaints whatsoever.

Lots of signs pretty clear instructions no problem. I had to take the train to T5C again nothing to worry about. On the way back coming from SFO and connecting to BRU early afternoon of another Tuesday I deplaned the A380 and timed myself again from getting off the plane (T5C) to clearing security: about 40 minutes although security was a little bit more crowded and my bag was put on the side and double checked. Overall I had a quite good experience but I can easily understand that it can quickly become a bad one when there are lots of people or when having tight and stressful connection.

Terminal Five is a magnificent terminal ultramodern with excellent cleanliness and facilities with very professional and helpful staff. The airport has an excellent selection of shops and restaurants. What I like most about Heathrow were the staff especially the purple coated helpers whose job is to assist and guide passengers. They should have more quiet sleeping areas at the airport. Right now the only sleeping areas in the airport offer hard benches suitable for resting not sleeping.

At our arrival there was a huge queue for visa and passport examination and that should be organised better. Five or six desks didn't work and that number that is present at terminal four just isn't enough for all those people there. Something else that I didn't like was some kind of form that you have to fill in while waiting there are no tables or desks when you can put a pen and form while filling it so you have to fill it in while standing and/or walking in the line. There is no sign that you need to fill that in there are just a few spots to take those forms (and to take them you have to step out of line).

There was a very polite and friendly gentleman from the airport at the entrance to give you direction and guidance. I assume because it's not occupied solely by one airlines like T5 does the check in desks seem to be more ""traditional"" and less inviting. Most of the airlines are using self check in and bag tag printing service which might save time for some but not for all. Perhaps the airport was still new and not used by many airlines and we also arrived very early the check in was very smooth and fast. Security was also fast but it will be interesting to see what happens when all airlines move in. The check in agent warned us its a long walk to get to the gate.

My main gripe is that on both occasions having landed we were kept on the taxiway for 20-30 minutes as 'we are waiting for the gate to be vacated'. It also happened to my daughter (T5). It is frustrating that on a short flight you can spend as much time getting off the aircraft as you have in the air and on a long flight the last thing you want having arrived is to sit in your seat for another half hour. I know Heathrow is a large and very busy airport but this problem has to be addressed.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,M Riley,United States,2014-04-22,Make sure to look at your boarding passes to determine whether or not you have luggage to claim (I think if you are flying the same airline both flights your luggage goes to your destination). When I landed at Heathrow we were not given any directions or instructions about what we were to do next. Being an inexperienced traveler I assumed that I needed to pick up luggage so I followed the signs toward baggage claim. After standing in line for at least 10 minutes I realized that my baggage had already been sent to the next flight. The annoying thing was that nobody mentioned this to me. After baggage claim I must have made a wrong turn and got completely lost. The layout of the airport can be very confusing and there seems to be a lack of signage in some areas. I asked several employees for help and no one could put me in the right direction. Trying to find my way through this airport was like running through an endless maze. By the time I reached the boarding gate I had just missed my flight by about 5 mins. I went to the counter to have them put me on the next flight. Told it was my fault and had to charge me $275. The return trip was much easier because I knew that I didn't have to pick up luggage and I was with a group of people so that made it easier. As soon as we got off the plane there was an information display listing terminals according to the airlines so it was simply a matter of following signs to the terminal and departure gate. How did I miss this on my first trip? Where was the information display or clear signs in the baggage area? I guess I simply took the longer confusing route. I suppose some terminals may be smaller or easier to navigate then others. There are some nice restaurants and shops and the flights were pleasant but I will still try to avoid this airport in the future after this awful experience.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,Simon Darnbrough,United Kingdom,2014-04-16,I really feel sorry for British Airways at T5 as they have an otherwise excellent terminal ruined by Security and Immigration which are out of their control. Having flown in on a BA flight from Geneva and departing to Manchester had to queue through the transit immigration desks rather than the electronic gates which took 20 minutes as only manned by 1 official despite there being 4 other channels! Then the joys of Heathrow security queuing for 15 minutes and then being told the equipment had broken and join the back of another queue for another 15 minute wait. I know security and immigration aren't the most interesting jobs around but some pretence at being human wouldn't go amiss as this is the first impression of the UK that most visitors get.

This terminal is awful. The food is all terribly expensive. The shops are so expensive that no one actually purchases anything from them. The two stores that passengers were buying anything at all are Boots and WH Smith because they have the least expensive items in all of the airport. Security is completely out of hand. Security is overwhelmed due to the number of passengers that travel through this airport. It is my thought that Security has a policy of confiscating items for twofold reasons you're tired and don't want to even bother questioning and that they want you to go purchase the item from one of the stores in the airport.

Terminal 3 is huge - if you have a flight from one of the ends of the long concourses take comfortable shoes! I think most North American and Asian carriers are based in terminal three so mornings are busy read maps to not get lost which is easy to do in this terminal.

They have attracted premium airlines to the airport such as SAS. However increased passanger numbers have caused severe limitations in seating availability and ease of access throughout the departure lounge. You will often be ""forced"" to find a space to stand and wait until your gate number has been called. They need to focus on improving the gate areas, especially those which Ryanair uses, as many are lacking in sufficient seating areas and/or are confined in small, dark areas.

conveyor. They insisted on checking my sleep apnoea unit separately, probably because the security man had never heard of the condition or the equipment. A first for me. They also insisted on separately scanning a solid deodorant, marketed as not needling to be separately screened. Again, a first. The security guy said they classed
the product as a liquid, even though it is solid, on the grounds that it could be melted to a liquid. I pointed out that this was true of metal as well.

This airport is in a clear sorry state I generally enjoy flying and don't mind Airports for the most part but the experience here was utterly joyless. Firstly the Terminal as you walk in it is dark dingy and cramped with poor signage - not very clear where particular check-in desks are located. Then there is the zoo that is security I've been to third-world countries where security has been managed better - it was chaotic with enormous snaking queues which barely any staff controlling the masses of people going through security or to give any assistance. If you were running late you would have been stuck and most likely miss your flight. Once through security airside is no better again dark dingy and cramped with barely any natural light entering the building. Surprisingly there were some nice food outlets like a Leon but the environment is so poor and devoid of any joy you wouldn't want to linger here for long. At the Gate it is even worse decrepit waiting area with gates cramped next to each other and only a common seating area to wait for multiple gates which was obviously not enough room for the 3 flights taking off at the same time. This Airport clearly needs some serious investment - it hasn't got any hope of competing with the likes of Gatwick and Heathrow and is already at a disadvantage because of its location I would have thought some effort would have been made to actually encourage more passengers. I'm sorry to say but this is the first time an Airport has actually put me off from flying - it is unacceptable in this country to have third-world like airport especially when it is supposed to be serving what is the capital of the world.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,M Horsfield,United Kingdom,2015-03-24,Once again had the misfortune of the Stansted experience last week. I do not use this airport anymore but my schedule required I had to do so but nothing has improved. It really is the pits. As you enter the airport you have to weave through passengers now making their way to the new location of the security area. To be fair this was reasonably quick once we had walked about 50 metres back and forward through the ever wonderful queuing pens. You are then forced to wander through a shopping mall and into an unmade bottleneck to emerge into a building site. There are not enough seats and Stansted's owners then believe that by not telling you of your gate number you will utilise the retail opportunities. Really? Once you get your gate number and catch the silly little train you find a quiet gate lounge with plenty of seats and an air of calm compared to the dump at the main terminal. Returning into the border control is farcical. The automated gates take longer than the ordinary gates so don't bother to use them. And guess what? Despite the queues 5 of the automated gates were locked out of use. If you managed to get through with a single swipe of the passport you were lucky and many people were not. There was one helpless officer on the other side dashing back and forth telling people to simply try again. It really is pitiful. There is plenty of room to extend this area and add more machines (in return for the APD paid) but they have not done so as it would mean moving a large area reserved for unused luggage trolleys. Most flights are low cost meaning that people do not need luggage trolleys - they just want to get through the airport quickly and stress free. Stansted is unable to do this and this is because MAG believe that it is a third rate shopping mall that some planes fly from.

The cost of parking has rocketed (£19 a day for long stay) the car park buses are now shared with JetParks and are absolutely jammed. They've built a ridiculously shiny new Duty Free shop which requires you to walk about a mile from security to the departure lounge all with the money they've made from parking. They even charge you Â £2.50 to drop off so they must be making money faster than they can count it. But when it comes to landing after your holiday you are stuck on the plane after landing because they have no staff to unlock the arrivals doors. This has happened to me twice now. After 10 to 15 minutes you might be able to get off. Staffing at passport control is laughable well almost non-existent so this now takes 30-40 minutes. At the 'do it yourself' passports 3 out of 15 booths are in use and the single staff member is occupied with moving the barriers to accommodate the growing queue. By the time I got to the carousels the luggage was almost falling off it had been there so long. All in all it took an hour from landing just to get out of the airport.

When will Uk airports learn that what passengers want and need is to get through them easily and efficiently. We do not go to airports to shop we go to them to travel and I take great offence at being forced through retail areas directly after security. I also take huge offence at being asked to present my boarding card if I wish to buy a newspaper or a packet of mints.

Until recently if you arrived by taxi or were dropped off by a friend it was outside the doors to the booking in desks. Now you have to pay to be dropped off at a ridiculously crowded area and push your cases up a steep ramp which is very unpleasant when you get to your 70s. And if the traffic queues are long you have to pay more for the pleasure of sitting in the queue to be dropped off. Coming back is just as bad controlling a trolley going down a steep ramp is very unpleasant and then you have the problem of locating your lift back home - a mobile phone is essential to find out where to go. After getting to the check in area for some reason or other the time to check in or drop your bags off takes a lot longer despite arriving 3 or more hours before take off. Then as has been mentioned by others there is the very long delays (almost an hour on our last trip) getting through security with rude staff constantly trying to push you through. Again a horrible experience when you are travelling with a family from 4 years old to the over 70s - alternatively of course you could pay (a rip off £35 in our case) to use the priority security gates. As has been mentioned in other posts coming back the queues for passport control are very long and the last thing you want to encounter after a long flight with very tired children. We won't be using Stansted again until they have made substantial improvements - despite being 40 miles further to Gatwick the time to get from home to the plane will be a lot less and much less stressful.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

We did meet and greet parking and was very simple and swift. The airport itself is very well run. We decided to get there earlier than needed as mentioned on other reviews but was not really necessary as there was no queue at check-in or security.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,V Brown,United Kingdom,2013-07-07,I have long been of the opinion that Stansted has no concept of customer care. The whole place seems vaguely grubby staff are frequently rude and security is a nightmare. However dropping off or picking up passengers was always fairly simple. To drop off you drove up to the terminal your passengers got out (under cover) you drove out. To pick up you drove to the pick-up zone your passengers got in you drove out. Not any more. The whole thing has become shambolic. This morning I drove my husband to Stansted with the objective of dropping him off at 5 am for a 6.30 am flight where he had already checked in online but we were allowing at least an hour for him to get through security (see earlier comment about security). Arrived at 5 am discovered you could no longer drive up to the terminal and then took another 10 minutes to get to the so-called drop-off area where we were confronted by vehicles in the parking areas on both sides and also in the central lane which explained why there was a traffic queue trying to get into the drop-off area in the first place. As there was absolutely no chance of parking properly my husband got out and then wended his way through the melee. Fortunately he had no luggage to impede him. If the drop-off zone was properly sign-posted perhaps the log jam in the first lane would not occur but at the same time you cannot blame people for wanting to be as close as possible to what is anyway the far end of the terminal building. This morning was dry and warm so not a problem but in inclement weather with luggage? I wonder whether the designers of this chaos have ever tried it out as paying customers. In my book Stansted has gone from mediocre to completely shambolic.,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

The experience itself is alright but there's no 'wow factor'. What Stansted really does need is a greater mix of airlines especially to long haul destinations such as New York or Dubai as there are currently no long haul flights from Stansted. Once services like these are introduced this will save many passengers having to use the busier congested airports like Heathrow and Gatwick. Furthermore we tend to travel to Romania frequently and it would be good to see carriers like Wizz Air introduce a Stansted-Bucharest service which would save us the hassle of using Luton airport. Clearly Stansted has a lot of potential to attract future long haul growth and new airlines besides Ryanair. Once MAG improves the terminal and its facilities I am confident that Stansted will improve and become more appealing.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

The new passport entry facility for those with the new type of passports only let two out of each ten people through the automated gates the others having to queue like the rest of the hordes of arrivals. The people in security are surly and unhelpful using gestures to move people around the poorly marked areas where you are meant to wait for your fellow travellers who have failed to negotiate the automated gates. Compare this to the English speaking security guard who stopped me in Billund to check my case who apologised for keeping me waiting and could not have been more courteous.

It can get crowded first thing in the morning between 5-8am) and on Sunday evenings but otherwise I find I just have to wait a few minutes to drop off my luggage and 5-10 minutes to get through security. I have found the staff polite and helpful. On the return flights the main problem is at passport control where there can be a lot of people particularly if several flights arrive at about the same time. The automatic passport machines seem to be temperamental - sometimes they recognize me and sometimes not. Luggage is usually on the belt in 15-20 minutes. Car parking as at just about all airports is expensive. It sometimes has cost me more to park the car for a few days then I've paid for the flight.

Then a train takes you to one of the remote terminals. We did this process twice since we missed our first flight. The strange thing is once you take the train out to the terminal there is no way back. We had to call our airline and have a representative come out and escort us back to the main terminal. I'm sure that the design is good for security and crowd control but someone hasn't thought through all possible scenarios. The second time we went through the process the remote terminal was freezing cold and dingy.

Departure is where the well thought out Stansted plan fails badly. Too many people for the terminal to cope with. The departure area is cluttered with too many shops and check in is too close to the doors leading to jostling crowds. Very bad. Then security is almost always under-manned leading to long queues.

Sad to say LAX struck out badly. Entered Passport Control area around noontime, there were people in red uniforms directing USA travelers to the automated passport kiosks. Another person in a red uniform said many of the kiosks in this row were down. So why didn't the person directing me to use them know this? An utter fiasco. As I left to the real person passport check line, people in red were arguing among themselves as to which machines were working, which were not.  Went downstairs to baggage claim and another fiasco. Baggage carousels had signage showing all the arriving international flights, but no information as to which carousel to go for your flight's baggage. Master baggage carousel sign on the wall listed all the flights. Again no information as to which carousel to use. Over the PA system, a hard to hear voice gave out the information on where to go for your baggage. No information saying area was being upgraded, work in progress or under repair. Or is this just the daily standard for LAX? Went to my terminal gate for connecting flight. Saw a snack area offering small, thin sandwiches and drinks.  I guessed an overpriced $5-6 for one.  I about choked when I was told they sell for over $11 each. Funny how retail stores must have a price shown for every item while LAX hasn't got a clue. I have to give LAX credit for the connecting flight baggage handling drop-off as you leave the International area. Finally an efficient area with someone in charge who knows how to do their job.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,A Veccio,Belgium,2015-05-13,I connected in LAX on my trip from LHR to SAN from TBIT to T4. I don't have much experience about connecting through US airports except international connections in MIA and had no particular expectations having heard how messy it could seem. Immigration was somewhat disturbing as agents came in front of the line you are waiting in and ask if there are any US citizens in that line. If so they are kindly authorised to cut the line and clear immigration before anyone else. I guess they know better and usually open different desks for US and non US citizen apart otherwise I don't understand this way of handling things. After that I collected my bag and cleared customs really quickly (no line) and re-dropped my bag so it could continue to my connection. After that I got out and felt like I was literally out of the airport with cars driving by and shuttle waiting for passengers. This is the moment one should be aware of: know before your flight which terminal you are supposed to go to as there is not that much of an explanation. My outbound flight was a domestic hop with American Eagle which departs from a remote satellite of T4. So if happening be aware that once in T4 you will have to wait for another shuttle that takes you to a mini terminal with a couple of gates from where your plane will departs (and adds 15-20 minutes before you reach your actual gate). It's not that I would particularly recommend LAX but it manages to handle a lot of passengers which may have its downside. If connecting there know where you are going print a map avoid tight connection relax and you'll be out of there as quick as you can.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,N Raven,Canada,2013-10-22,An atrocious place to transfer between international flights. Also dingy understaffed and too small for the volume of passengers moving through. City and/or state and/or national authorities should be embarrassed by this place which is the first glimpse of many visitors. I understand that American airports have no concept of passengers in transit but LAX makes transferring especially tedious. On my last trip my 747 from Australia dumped its load into a Border Security hall that had only 6 agents working and which looked like the basement of a community centre. It took me 45 minutes to get through. Half the people in the line were panicking due to tight connections. After getting through the border (after which I was just going to be getting on a flight to another country anyway) I had to retrieve my bag go through another passport and bag check and then recheck the bag with United personnel who were behaving as if this was the first time they had done this. Next I had to find out where my next flight departed from. This was very difficult because the departure board in each terminal only shows the flights that depart from that terminal. So I had to ask an off-duty employee to point me in the general direction - which turned out to be the terminal farthest from my current location of course. Next I had to find my way with bags in tow from Terminal 7 to Terminal 2 (even though both airlines were Star Alliance partners). To make this journey one has three options: take a shuttle bus that circulates between the terminals walk the long long way around the horseshoe-shaped road or cut across the horseshoe on foot. Mindful of my short connection time I chose the latter. But the airport does not make it easy. Traffic is heavy there are no guiding signs and crosswalks are few. But I made it. Then I went through security all over again. Having started out with a 3-hour layover I made it to the gate 30 minutes before boarding. Well done LAX.

Maybe DFW offers a more comfortable mode of making your connection with its Skylink tram system. However I made a similar connection at LAX by taking a 5 minute walk outside between Terminal 4 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Sure I had to re-enter the secure area but 9 out of 10 times you have time built into your itinerary to spend elsewhere (area hotel restaurant etc) when connecting domestic with international and vice versa at LAX. As for TSA lines Los Angeles' moved faster and had more lane options. The clincher in this day and age of flying with the latest and greatest of technology I prefer the quiet comfort of the Airbus A380 over the older Boeing 747. The Airbus flies into LAX but not into DFW until they fork out the money for a serious terminal upgrade.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2010-07-13,I've used LAX so often I'm quite accustomed to it and have no big problems with it other than the traffic jams in front of each terminal making it difficult for example to see when your hotel's courtesy van is approaching. A variety of vans for private parking lots hotels and others use the same area and other people who aren't supposed to use the area also pull in. Chaotic. While in some ways it would be nice to have all terminals together so you didn't have to go outside to go from terminal to terminal the chaos that results in some airports where everyone is under one roof (eg. Atlanta) could means this would be a mixed blessing. Lots of hotels near LAX with good rates.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It's one of the worst airports in the world! Having arrived in afternoon peak-hour our flight was sent to one of the many remote gates at LAX requiring us to be bussed to the arrivals hall. Waiting for immigration clearance at LAX is a frustrating experience with several lines of about 100 people each being serviced by one or two immigration officials. After a 100-minute wait (seriously!) the lad who processed my arrival didn't know how to use the software properly and had to ask for assistance from a colleague which delayed the process even further. Once the passenger has actually had their passport stamped they enter the Soviet-era baggage-claim and commence their epic voyage to their connecting flight. The entire airport is grimy noisy and not at all pretty. The moral of the story is to arrive on the west coast of the USA via San Francisco or Seattle and avoid Los Angeles all together.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,N Werner,Switzerland,2010-03-29,Arrived on Southwest at Terminal 1 and found it quite ok to get to baggage claim and the bags where out after around 5 minutes. Was out after around 20 minutes after deplaning. Terminal is old but seems to work still fine however a face lift would be appreciated. Left through T5 on Delta. There was a line for the baggage drop but it moved quickly. Security was fast and efficient. Officers on duty where not rude as you expect them to be at LAX which was a nice surprise. Facilities at T5 are not very exciting with a McDonald California Pizza Kitchen take away and one or two small shops. Since it was breakfast time I opted for McDonald as you don't get anything on Delta domestic. The terminal had some natural light and did not feel dark or dingy. Arrived back at T5 at night and the terminal did not have many flights arriving. However it took around 40 minutes to get the bags which was extremely annoying. Also there was no ground staff available when a big suit case blocked the other bags to come out. Luckily a passenger took care of this which earned him a round of applause. The signage once you are outside is pretty clear where you have to wait for which shuttle. Next day left through TBIT to Heathrow and found the facilities have improved since my last visit to TBIT. They have done a face lift and are still working on it. Security took a while though and there is nothing actually after security. So eat and do your duty free shopping before security. All in all for the size of this airport it is not that bad actually if you know the tricks around it. However there is a lot of room for improvement.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,N Werner,Switzerland,2010-01-01,Arrived and departed on AA from / to LHR and was using T4 (AA own terminal) at LAX. Since AA only has two international flights a day from LAX (to NRT and LHR) the facilities were pretty straightforward and easy to use. However when we arrived there were only three people at immigration (2 for foreigners and 1 for US citizens) so I was glad that I ran from the plane to immigration as people who came out last had to queue quite a while to get through. I waited for approx 15 minutes but the immigration officer was pretty friendly and efficient. After immigration my luggage was waiting and I could go through customs where again only two officers were handling almost 300 pax. All in all I was at my car rental in 45minutes after touch-down which was not bad. When I departed the check-in hall was quite busy and AA has implemented the self service check-in everywhere so you could see many pax who were confused and needed help by the grumpy ground staff. TSA was quite quick and so was security. There is no immigration if you leave from T4 on an international flight and you just hand your departure card to the ground staff at the gate. Facilities are so so at T4 and consists of a few shops selling magazines etc and two mexican restaurants. Since it was before Christmas the terminal was quite full and it seemed every flight that day was overbooked. Restrooms were ok but I have seen better and cleaner ones at other airports. I think T4 is not a bad terminal to use and I found it to be quite efficient and rather modern in comparison to other terminals at LAX.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
luanda-airport,/airport-reviews/luanda-airport,Luanda Airport customer review,J Ross,NA,2007-08-02,Luanda Airport would be hilarious if it wasn't so bad. Everything that has been said below is true and having gone in and out 10+ times in 18 months I would know. Check in is becoming an increasingly unfunny joke. For the 1405 SAA departure to JNB (TuThSa) you now need to be there at 9am. On the last two occasion we were held outside the check in area for 45 minutes whilst waiting for the TAP check in to close. Well that's what they told us. The fact they can't check in more than one flight at a time should tell you something. In reality there did seem to be people getting through to check in though so I suspect some greenbacks were going to security guards or these were 'friends'. Once through to check in things went smoothly enough thanks to being in the business class queue. Well worth paying the extra money for a business seat just to avoid the economy queue. The check in attendent managed to check my bags through on my Air France connection from JNB without any trouble. Immigration and security is fine as long as you are near the front of the check in queue. Now you will inevitably get pulled over by the fiscal police who are just making sure you don't take the local currency out of the country (not security as was mentioned below). They will however take any bribe you offer them should you not know any Portuguese and / or don't understand that just saying no usually work! Go upstairs to the bar - mosquito's cheap beer and little aircon. You can of course go to TAAG's business lounge which is barely acceptable though now has wireless. Or pay 20 bucks to go to another lounge which has less to offer but has aircon! And there you sit ipod on reading for around 3 hours before being called to baord the plane - before it has even come in from JNB!!! So you go down past another security check and are penned in there for an hour before being allowed on the bus to take you to the plane. Overall the place is a farce and is not befitting of a country that is attracting more and more traffic every year. Apparently plans for the new airport went on hold as they found a seam of diamonds in the ground they were going to build on so it could be a while before the situation improves!,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On arrival immigration is like some Orwellian post-communist throwback nightmare almost designed for psychological torture. Make sure you have the immigration form filled in on the plane and you get it stamped (show the guy yellow fever cert.). The immigration officials are painfully slow and exeptionally bossy and rude there is no A/C (by the way there are different queues but no one cares which one you're in choose the shortest) it is mosquito infested and dirty... shabby. the toilets will make you want to vomit.... after you've been to the immigration desk they will take your passport from you and you will have to wait an age to get it back with your visa... there are no seats. This is a good time to try and get your luggage sometimes the officials will let you through to get it sometimes not it's completely random just like everything else... expect anything as they change the procedures regularly and without informing anyone. Once you have your bags you're almost there just have to negotiate corrupt officials searching your bag and being accosted by local con men/pick- pockets once you're outside. I can't even begin to describe departure.... long queues to get through.. be careful when you go past duty free as there is a security check (a guy in a glass room looking for a bribe) once you are upstairs it's a bit easier.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Regular shuttle service to and from Lugano city centre is timed to match arrivals and departures from and to Zurich. There are a few shops and restaurants outside the airport. Check-in on departure is very swift too. The staff are highly motivated and efficient. They managed to have our luggage checked through to final destination although our onward flight from Zurich was not booked under the same reservation code. (Yet again no priority labels.) You then go through security control and are in the waiting area about five minutes after entering the terminal building.

Staff don't seem to care. It takes two hours to do what is done in around 20 minutes at Edinburgh or Heathrow T5. Absolute shame on the management team at Luton airport - please visit any other UK airport and see how it should be done. It all seems to be about fleecing the traveller from Â£ £2.50 for drop off to charging to 'fast track' though security and it's anything but 'fast' but the alternative is missing your flight.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2013-07-10,Having recently used this airport it is clearly evident that it is mainly geared towards low cost flights. The check in area is in desperate need of re-organisation (lots of confused passengers too few check in desks open and under staffed) results in huge crowds all confined in one small space with the other half of the check in hall being empty and unused. On a plus side going through security was quick and well organised. The departure lounge itself was alright with a good variety of (over priced) shops and restaurants. However the boarding system and gate area at Luton seriously needs to be improved; you are forced to shove for a place in the line and then be prepared to wait for a plane that hasn't even landed yet. Furthermore there is absolutely nowhere to sit down in the gate area which could be a problem for families with young children. Furthermore none of Luton's gates are fitted with jet bridges like Stansted so bring a coat with you in case it rains! On return we had to wait for over an hour for our suit case which is unacceptable. They kept stopping and restarting the conveyor (You'd think it would've just been easier to move the luggage onto a conveyor that actually worked properly!).

In the past year there has been a distinct improvement in the politeness and care of the security search staff but you can still be bawled at or humiliated in front of other passengers. The amount of seating in the airport 'lounge' has been reduced (area taken over by Pret a Manger and other cafés). After boarding clearance has begun the holding areas are cramped and are often simply stark staircases. On return I have found the automatic passport gates (installed at enormous cost to the tax-payer) open just 7 times out of the hundreds (see above) of times I have travelled whilst staff actually manually checking passports are always too few while colleagues stand idly by.

In fact the airport carpark shuttle bus regularly just opens the doors and let's its passengers make the dash - I dread the wetter months coming. Once in the terminal it is quite quick - provided you take the £3 priority security option which although very quick compared to the alternative is just a wrong concept when taking into account you are only late because of the traffic congestion arriving at the terminal. Arrivals - the immigration is quite often stacked up and the last thing you need.

luxor-airport,/airport-reviews/luxor-airport,Luxor Airport customer review,John Treacy,United Kingdom,2014-08-18,We flew into and out of Luxor as international passengers. Landing at the airport all flights are transferred to the terminal building by bus. Once stepping inside the terminal it is possible by get a visa at any of the banks before going to passport control where the visa is check and landing card (as previously issued and filled in on the plane) is taken. Immediately after this there is a staff member who checks your visa has been stamped. Never ceases to amaze the level of irrelevant check. From here to baggage collection/ customs and then out to face the scrum of touts. They seem to be keener as there are far few flights. The return trips was much the same but in reverse. Touts scanning checking/ bag drop exit card (given at checking and need filling) in before getting to passport control. The lounge is quite large with four duty free shops one on each corner and in the centre a gloriously named 'food court' with quite a poor offering of food but expensive. To the gate. No announcements but numerous displays on screens but very slow security checks. As to why with 10 staff they didn't open a second channel to deal with hit is beyond me. Not many people there only three international fights listed for departure that day. Previously used the same airport many years ago and it is a vast improvement on what it was. One really good thing is the authorities seem to have got rid of the toilet touts so more selling loo roll and trying to extort baksheesh.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Very clean and modern. One thing I miss about the old terminal is that it was right on the end of the electric tram line. So you could walk out of the airport to a tram and pay about 2 dollars for a ride into the city. You can still get to the tram but it's an awkward walk. You have to walk about 15 minutes to reach it. Also the kantor/currency exchange was outside of security so after we had gone through passport control I couldn't exchange money. So hopefully they'll fix that. There was free internet near a cafe but couldn't easily find power. So most people had to run off of battery. There was a nice hotel we had used in the past (affordable and clean) but it was closed for renovation. Hope they don't raise the prices upon reopening.

The cleaning machines were strangely comforting and while the airport doesn't have too many overnight dwellers it could do with a snack/coffee bar that is open all night. Everything else was fine it could just use either a lounge (I had heard of one but I think this was just airside) or some double layer entry points (to limit heat loss) or some heating just for the few months that Macau may need it. Perhaps the airport could work with some of the nearby hotels/casinos to accommodate transit passengers - that would make for a more memorable night than just freezing on an airport seat!

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Federico Muscogiuri,Spain,2014-10-28,Madrid Barajas is a complicated airport. For a start it would be more adequate to describe it as a tale of two airports. Terminals 1-2-3 are within walking distance to one another. Terminal 1 is mostly used by low cost airlines and has the ambience and charm of a bus station. It is also used by non-Schengen flights except those operated by Iberia and other Oneworld airlines. The non-Schengen section of the Terminal 1 is a bit quieter and modern. There is only one overpriced eaterie queues for check in and security are long but overall it does its job. Terminal 2 is pretty similar but is used by Lufthansa Swiss and Star Alliance airlines. Occasionally however I have caught the odd Easyjet/Ryanair flight from there. Terminal 3 is more modern and airy definitely the best of the bunch with Skyteam airlines mostly using it. Terminal 4 is located about 4 kms from the main three terminals and it is connected by a frequent and free shuttle bus (I don't understand some passengers' complaints about connection from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4). It is used by Iberia and Oneworld airlines as well as those airlines that have a code-share agreement with Iberia. It is architecturally impressive and compared to the other terminals feels relatively uncrowded however there are three things that really bother me about it 1) long walks from one gate to another 2) the fact that now you find it impossible to transit from one area to another without having to pass through some Duty Free and 3) any eating place is almost twice as expensive than in the city. Despite its shortcomings one thing that sets Barajas apart from other airports in Europe and the US is the public transport which is excellent from all Terminals. I live in Madrid and moan about Barajas but when I travel via CDG or FRA (not to mention US airports) then I realise that it's not bad after all.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,L Stephen,United Kingdom,2013-11-05,The others reviews are spot on but the key highlights include: 1) If you arrive at terminal 4 it takes about 45 mins to get to the baggage reclaim area. This includes trips up and down about 20 escalators for no good reason. It also includes a trip on an underground railway between immigration and baggage claim this is very disconcerting as the signage is not clear enough to explain that you will still get to your bags. After the train ride you still have to wait another 20 mins for your bags. 2) The signage is comedy - a down arrow actually means carry on rather than go down. This includes signs in front of the lifts - a down arrow means you actually need to go up! The gates are also lettered S R J and H. 3) The gate numbers are in the opposite order to what you expect with the lowest number gates often being the furthest away from you. 4) The airport is huge and you need to set off about 4 hours before boarding to allow for getting lost and working out what the signs mean! 5) All staff work at about the same speed as tectonic plate movements. Fast food is not fast food in Spain. 6) Check in was a joke. You can't use your online boarding pass without getting a ticket for your luggage from one of the automated tills but of course that wont read your passport so you have to go to a totally different set of desks instead! 7) The lady checking boarding passes was having a competition with herself to see how long she could take to check each document.

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,W Gilbert,United States,2012-07-13,I had an unpleasant experience for the most part at Barajas. Signage is poor. It took me a good 45 minutes to get to my BA departure gate after arriving on Iberia (fortunately my connecting flight was delayed). I had to take two trains and go up several escalators before finding my gate only to learn the gate had been changed after I became concerned that there were no other passengers or ground staff at my gate 1/2 hour before the scheduled departure time. Nobody told me the gate had been changed and there were no messages showing the gate change. I had to ask a staff member at another gate. There was very little in the way of food available nearby and what was available was very expensive. Pay-as-you-go Wifi was very confusing if you were not fluent in Spanish and the information desk was largely unhelpful and unfriendly. To top it all off my check-in luggage was left outside in the rain and was sopping wet upon my arrival at Heathrow. This is by far the worst airport I've experienced in Europe. Of all the airports I've flown through Nairobi-Kenyatta is the only one that ranks below Barajas in my opinion and only because it's much older.,NA,NA,NA,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

But having just flown into and out of Madrid this past weekend the signs regarding the supplemental fare are all over the place. They're on the trains (in English and Spanish) on platforms vending machine screens on station walls even on large stickers on the floors. That supplemental fare of one euro is peanuts on top of the normal fare which is also one euro.

Less helpful was the signage from the hire car return area to the terminal which was actually confusing and we had to wander backwards and forwards until we recognised somewhere familiar.

We then unknowingly walked past the bus point because the signage was not displayed for passengers emerging from the terminal. We were glad that our car hire collection point was off-site as the area outside the airport was very congested. On our return we found Security somewhat disorganised. There was something of a melee to secure trays and at our security gate one harassed female agent seemed to be trying to do everything: call passengers through check the detector and frisk selected individuals whilst at the same time trying to call to a colleague to come and help. We found it very difficult to hear announcements made at the gates.

I'd agree about the distances to be walked for departures. We had less far to walk on arrival but that might have been because we were transferred from the plane by bus rather than airbridge so taken almost directly to Arrivals. Roadworks right outside the airport rather undermine the otherwise impressive appearance of the terminal building: access to Departures seemed to take us virtually through a petrol station forecourt! Security busy but reasonably free flowing but in the departure area (pier B) it was very difficult to hear flight announcements especially those from the desks themselves because the gates are on busy thoroughfares with food bars around them so there is a great deal of noise going on. The fact that we had a late change of gate when the queues for our easyJet flight had already formed did not help matters.

Security no better or worse than any other international airport these days at 15 minutes from start of queue. I am however astounded at just how many people still have liquids etc in hand luggage at security and have to have their bags searched causing hold ups for others! The big problem with Manchester is lack of seating due to the shopping areas. Good choice of food and drink outlets however and toilets clean! On arrival back on the 25 July usual queues at Border control but at least that meant the luggage was already on the carousel.,Arrival and Departure,27-07-2015,Solo Leisure,9,4,4,5,NA,4,4,NA,NA,1
manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,R Mortara,United Kingdom,2015-06-06,Arrived and departed from T3. Queues ok. Biggest gripe is the walk from the terminal to the rain Stn. Some of it is under cover whilst the rest is outdoors although part of the route is sort of protected from the elements. Worst still are the lifts in T3 which you need to use. Although big there are only 2 and they seem to stop randomly. Why is there not a clearly signed set of stairs people could use instead especially if they do not have large/heavy items of luggage. On leaving T3 was a noisy horrid shambles full of people with insufficient seating. Might be ok for holiday makers but for those on business as I was it was unacceptable.

Everything went reasonably smoothly on our outward trip. There were no delays in Security and staff were both cheerful and helpful. The whole terminal was busy but we managed to find seats till our gate was listed. As an infrequent user of T3 though I find the geography of the place confusing but to be fair there does appear to be more than adequate signage. The only slight hiccup before departure was having to thread our way through other queues to reach our gate. Minor irritations on our return: our Ryanair flight had to wait several minutes before it could access its designated stand and the e passport readers were being temperamental (my wife had no problems but I had to be re-directed to a manned desk). Overall however a better experience than expected though we still find Liverpool our preferred option simply because Manchester is so much bigger and busier and consequently everything takes much longer e.g. without any major holdups or any luggage to reclaim it still took us an hour from landing till exiting the car park.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

The front of the UK/EU passport queue had a very large number of Saudi's from a large Saudi Airlines flight and I admit that they could have been dual passport holders however the amount of time to process them I would say not as we were waiting over 1 hour with young children and elderly persons forced to be herded like cattle. Some members of the Large Virgin 747 flight verbally displayed their concerns and disbelief at the lack of efficiency within the immigration hall to be confronted with a large presence of police (more than actual immigration staff) standing there in a display of power and authority telling us to pipe down. 12 immigration desks with only 6 staff manning them?

Coming in to land the airport looks deserted. We were brought to the larger looking terminal by bus and instantly I recognised the Japanese design having lived in Japan for several years. Aside from the outstanding design nothing else was even close to Japan. Most of the lights were off immigration desks looked abandoned and one of the panels of glass separating the baggage and arrival halls was badly smashed. Still service is efficient if only because there is no one to serve facilities mostly work and taxis are plentiful. If the reforms continue to improve Myanmar this airport could be a real gem.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,R Cartry,United Kingdom,2014-03-28,I use Manchester airport regularly. Excellent motorway access. Easy to negotiate. Can be fast in and out. Immigration can be a problem with queues but security are the worst queues. The airport really falls down on how it's run. What a terrible advertisement for Manchester. This airport must costs Manchester a lot in bad image you just can't do the job. The place it just plain filthy. It's not cleaned. The car park dear me. The lifts look as though they have never been cleaned. Strange coloured dried up puddles. The whole place needs steam cleaning. Cigarette butts everywhere litter ingrained old dirt on the surfaces everywhere. Is this really the UK? Surely we are in some other country already? The second big problem is the overcrowding at the airport. There's hardly any room for passengers to me met at arrivals: the area has been taken from passengers and given to shops. It's also v congested in departures hard to get in and about little room to wait. The space has been given to shops so little left for passengers. And is this the last airport in the world which requires a coin to be inserted into the trolleys to obtain one? It's a laughable sight to see hordes of people arriving in the customs hall to collect their luggage and go to get a trolley. Of course they need to change money first. Its a pound coin!

However the current security debacle in T3 is abysmal - on a recent short haul flight to Europe I arrived as I usually do 90 minutes before departure time and after baggage drop off I immediately found myself in an incredibly long security line that snaked around the building as far as the eye could see - asking a security guard how long it would take to clear he shrugged and responded ""about an hour"". I asked why it was so bad and he replied that they were down to two scanners due to refurbishment and it was the busiest time of year. You really do have to question why they have chosen to do this refurbishment at the busiest time of year when it would clearly cause maximum disruption. All the way through the awfully long and hot wait a lady was calling through passengers who were departing in less than 30 minutes (so it pays to be late clearly!) and a sense of barely controlled chaos pervaded the whole thing. When finally getting through the lines there wasn't time for any refreshments etc just a brisk walk to the gate and immediate boarding was all that time allowed - am surprised the retailers in T3 are not up in arms at the current state of the place!

She even suggested that my wife and I share a tray for the items which had to be sent through separately. Would we choose Manchester in future over Liverpool? Only if it was much cheaper. Everything took much longer at Manchester because of the crowds. Security area seemed more claustrophobic and there was hardly any room on the other side of the channels to re- pack one's bags.

My hand luggage was ""queried"" because a swimming mask and snorkel showed up as potentially a ""blade and some piping"". Can't the scanners tell metal from plastic?

Meanwhile my jacket wallet passport etc. had gone down a different channel and was at risk of being taken while my bag was being ""examined"". By the time we were through this process the flight was on ""last call"" and had only 15 minutes before departure. So much for refreshments and shopping before boarding.

Compared to other airports I use its standard of cleanliness and trasnport connectivity is pretty good. Queues at security are often long but move quickly and announcements are made for any customers on soon-departing flights to be fast-tracked. When I've dealt with airport staff they've been courteous and efficient. Facilities at each terminal are pretty good if expensive but they aren't the worst I've come across! Note that proceeds from the £1 charge for a resealable bag for liquids go to a local childrens charity not to the airport. The main issue is that airport really needs to improve its layout - the ad hoc development over the past 5-10 years has left it a bit of a mess and inefficient which had a negative effect on your overall impression.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

With on-line check-in after a short walk from the railway station I'm in the departure lounge ten to fifteen minutes from arrival at the terminal. The staff seem to have made efforts to smooth the passage through security. A turnstile system gains entry operated by the barcode on your boarding pass. Staff are employed to help should you encounter a problem with this. There is a fast-moving queue for scanners. Shopping and food facilities are limited but adequate. Gates can be a bit cramped but I've yet to fail to find a seat. Signage is good. Arrival is no problem and there is a drop-off/pick-up area nearby so you can be away very fast.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,R Brook,United Kingdom,2009-06-09,I have been using Manchester frequently over the past 15 years. Overall it's getting worse although with the recent addition of many more screening points the security queues are much shorter and efficient than the previous horrendous experience. Check in (having used many different airlines) is usually OK. As with any airport if you want to avoid long lines arrive early. In Terminal 1 beyond security I hate the way one is led through a maze of perfume stalls before reaching the departure lounge. I don't mind airport shops but not so 'in your face'. It really creates the wrong impression. They've avoided this particular folly in Terminal 2. T2 business lounge (mostly use Sky Team - KLM/Air France) is very small but adequate if not busy. Arrival experience is variable. Long delays in getting off the plane are common due to no one to operate the air bridge/no one to drive the mobile steps/no buses waiting when parking remotely. Queues at immigration have lengthened over the years as on average has waiting for the baggage. If using the long stay car park and pre-paying on the internet to avoid the extortionate on-the-day charges the part where you are supposed to insert your credit card at the entry barrier doesn't work. Instead call them at the exit barrier when you leave and quote your reference number. My card was charged correctly after this. Overall the airport looks shabby doesn't operate particularly well and can't really be called a pleasant experience. The managers should pay a visit to some Asian airports to see how an airport can be run.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

I've been to this airport for plenty of times now and I was surprised to see few improvements in Terminal 1. But still, the airport staff are rude, the information desk officer was on his phone which was extremely unprofessional. There is Wi-Fi around the building but connection is only available in certain areas. I was on a Malaysia Airlines flight, plane being parked at gate 16, which has no Wi-Fi connection. There are smoking areas and cafeterias on the fourth floor but it was awful.

The Taxi wait for metered cabs was dreadful with plenty of touts eager to charge over the odds. Departures was quick and efficient mid afternoon as was Security and Immigration (no queues at all) and I was in the Departures area within 5-10mins of entering the terminal. Not many major airports can manage that. Airport Charge (PHP 550) is now included in the ticket price. With Philippine Airlines working very hard to improve their on-time reliability and price competitiveness (Cebu Pacific were putting them out of business) they are now a good choice for regional destinations and T2 is working hard to meet that challenge.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

T2 isn't too bad in Arrivals - reasonable queuing in Immigration bags on the belt in a timely manner and exit the terminal 45 mins after landing - not too bad. But then the problems start - nearly an hour wait for a meter taxi outside Arrivals in late afternoon. Not good. T1 Departures is a zoo. Construction work ongoing everywhere. 15 mins queue just to get into the terminal nightmare queues with little or no effort from the Airport staff to manage queue jumping so lots of irate customers. I feel sorry for the people who have to work there. Short queue for paying departure tax (PHP550 - I thought they were doing away with this and rolling it into the ticket price - but maybe that's too hard for the Airport management to arrange?). Well organised Immigration and Security screening. With the construction work in the terminal all the seating has been removed in the Departure area after Security with dozens of people sitting on the floor - total nonsense. Where exactly do they expect customers to go before their gate opens? I paid 650PHP? For an hour or two in the Manila Lounge upstairs - total waste of money - tiny little lounge noisy brutal air conditioning with mediocre food and drinks selection and about as much atmosphere as a carwash. I usually try and avoid T1 and the construction work which has been going on for several months now is obviously very disruptive but one would have thought they would be pushing it through at best speed? I saw plenty of construction but not a single worker working on anything. NAIA-1 is a national disgrace. It's more fun in the Philippines? Not in NAIA-1 it's not.

Either you wait for ever for a metered cab or get ripped off by the touts. T4 apart from being small and overcrowded is probably the better of NAIA terminals especially arrivals. Mostly new and clean. Taxis are less of a problem here and it WS easy to jump in a taxi emptying its passengers . T1 is possibly one of the worse I've been to. Even getting into the terminal took an age. Make sure you have a print out of your flight details or you won't get in. And there was only one officious security guard for a huge line of passengers. Don't forget to have 550 Pesos for departure tax. Once through the many bag checks carried out by seemingly disinterested guards you are into the departure area.

Once again arrived at this awful airport on the morning of the 11th to find it still in full blown renovation which is Lila maze to negotiate for the passengers as nothing was clearly sign posted but as I have been a regular it was not so bad for a first time arrival it would be a nightmare. Immigration was busy and the number of counters had halved! Made it twice as long to get through. Customs was a breeze as there were none on duty when I entered the baggage hall so straight to arrivals and out of the hot stuffy place as there was no air-conditioning working sufficiently to keep the area cool.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Andy Williams,United Kingdom,2014-11-12,Terminal 1. I have just returned to the UK from Manila via Terminal 1 NAIA. I visit the Philippines 2-3 times a year and have done for several years. The last time I used this terminal was May 2014 and I honestly didn't think it could get any worse. How wrong I was! It's almost like the authorities set about doing everything they can to make it bad. On a plus side arriving at this place is not too bad. I always try to time my arrival for a Sunday afternoon which normally means immigration queues for foreigners are not to bad. Baggage reclaim slow as normal. The noise and chaos of the meeting area can be off putting for foreigners who have never been there before and I would suggest if you haven't got transport organised or are being met then walk out to the main road and get a normal passing taxi. Departing is a nightmare. The renovations continue which now means there is virtually no drop off area which causes traffic chaos. There is no clear signs to direct people. Once you have got past the initial security check just to enter the terminal the check in queues stretch from one side of the terminal to another and despite arriving over 4 hours before my flight it still took me 2 hours to check in. Terminal fee still exists so another queue followed then by another queue for immigration and then yet another security check with another queue. All in it took me 3 hours just to get from my taxi to duty free and this was at midnight when the place was quiet! Seating is still an issue as is places to get food or drinks. You can pay 650php to use the lounge upstairs which has a a smoking room constructed from plywood here is sadly probably the best seating in the house where you can enjoy a lukewarm beer and a smoke while listening to the airport announcements telling you that you are in a non-smoking airport! The departure gates are still not big enough and involve yet more queues. I unfortunately cannot avoid this place but if you can then do avoid.

On Arrival I had a 30 minute wait for Immigration and a further 45 minute for baggage (many were longer) with no functioning aircon in either area. Customs is not a problem and taxi wait was OK late at night but I was 1 hour 20 minutes to exit the terminal. On Departure a 20 minute wait just to get into Departures but fortunately I'd checked in online for Emirates but for that the other poor souls would be waiting a couple of hours in queues stretching half way across the terminal. Most of the seating has been removed airside in departures and there were dozens of passengers sitting on the floor. Pretty quick to take your PHP 550 Terminal Fee. Immigration was another 20 minutes and I usually shell out PHP600 to get into one of the pay lounges upstairs - mainly to be able to sit in a comfortable seat relax and to get access to a clean toilet. NAIA-1 is just an awful place - mainly because for years it's been working at 3 times it's design capacity for passenger numbers. My Rating is based on T1 - T3 is much better. I also passed through NAIA-3 - way better experience. Quick into the terminal Cebu Pacific slick on check-in. Immigration and Security efficient with comfortable and spacious Departure Areas.

Arrived early afternoon at the extreme southern end of the terminal. Carpets in the piers are disgusting and haven't been cleaned in years. Not a single travelator was working the entire length of the terminal (and no aircon either). T3 has over 20 Arrival Immigration Desks. How many were manned? 5. With 3 flights arriving within a few minutes of each other it took nearly an hour to get my passport stamped. In the baggage hall there were no information screens working which wasn't much of a problem since all 3 flights bags were on the single operating carousel again no air conditioning. Lots of Customs Officials though doing what I do not know. I decided to get a metered taxi but at mid afternoon there was a queue of about 50 or 60 people waiting with no taxis arriving. (They actually have seats in the Taxi queue). After a few minutes I decided to go upstairs to see if I could get a taxi which had just dropped off but the only way to get there is to walk the whole length of the terminal (again) entering without a ticket on the pretext of going to the Cebu Pacific Ticket Office going up to the Departures level and again walking the entire length of the terminal since all of the doors except 1 are entry only - total nonsense. I was able to get a taxi within a few minutes. I can't imagine how long those people had to wait outside arrivals for a cab. T3 Departures works fine most of the time but the Arrivals experience is getting worse as the terminal fills up. I cannot imagine what T3 would be like if it was working to capacity - parts of it are dirty it's not maintained it's not properly staffed the organisation is chaotic at best and it appears they don't want to waste money on running air conditioning or other mechanical equipment - but it's still the best MNL Terminal.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

A few minutes to pay airport tax (550PHP) and get through Immigration and Security. Airside at that time in the morning only a few places were open.

Hadn't been through T1 for a while - I usually try and avoid it. Arrivals is a zoo with very little you can do to avoid the queues at Immigration other than sitting close to the front of the aircraft and hoping that 2 other flights don't arrive at the same time. 20 mins there would be good 45 mins not unusual. The Baggage Hall is dreadful with poor to non-existent air conditioning and the vast majority of passengers seemingly unable to identify their bag from a distance of greater than 6 inches. 30 mins would be good there 1 hour not unusual. Customs is usually pretty quick and waiting times for taxis are OK. If you exit the terminal 1 hour after arriving at the gate you've done well. Departures - I always get there early (Check In will open 3-4 hours before scheduled Departure Time) so arrive 3 hours before Departure and Check In Online before you go to the airport. Most Airlines have a dedicated Online queue - use it - nobody else does. Fill in your Departure Form and have PHP 550 available for Departure Tax. Immigration is slow but there is a reasonable queue system and avoid getting stuck behind somebody with a folder of paperwork. 20 mins typically in Immigration and if it's much more it shouldn't be a problem provided you've arrived early and have checked in online. Through Security in 10 mins and the Departures area is nothing special. I never buy Duty Free in MNL - I can get a better deal elsewhere - like in town. The Bar and Cafe facilities landside are non existent and airside very poor so bring a snack and a book. There are Pay Lounges but at 750 PHP you need to eat and drink a lot to make it worthwhile.

I waited about 1.5 hours to get through. Then when I cleared customs and went to the information desk the attendant was fast asleep and I couldn't wake him.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2011-03-27,NAIA-3 is beginning to get there. Many more eating places Landside than before. Cebu Pac have an open desk check-in now where you can check-in to any flight (international) at any desk and in advance of 3 hours before the scheduled departure time if that's convenient for you. Departure Immigration is much slicker than Arrivals and Baggage is way faster than T1. Security is quick and slick both ways and Taxi queuing times are minimal. NAIA-3 is by far the best of the MNL terminals and affects my choice of airline. T1 is just too much hassle with chronic overcrowding and pathetic passenger facilities and T2 (PAL) is just a very poor airline.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Gunnar Emausson,Sweden,2011-03-15,Before this journey our most recent experience departing from NAIA was in DEC2008. Overall it appears as though some improvements have been made although still more needs to be done to raise the standard of Terminal 1 to anywhere near that of most other airports in the region. This being a late Wednesday morning departure it was not overly crowded. On arrival into the building there was a standard security check quite normal. Although there were monitors indicating the departure gates we found no information on the specific location of airline counters within the check-in area. Eventually after some searching we found ours. Although we arrived at the terminal relatively late (two hours before departure) the line wasn't long and with four desks open the check-in procedure took no more than 15 minutes including waiting time. Immigration cards were completed after which we proceeded to pay the user charge 750 pesos per person (USD 17.50 would also have been accepted) with a five minute wait in line. Passport control was next; this entailed the longest queue roughly 20 minutes. Immediately thereafter was the aviation security check only a minute and we were through. A brief stop at the washroom which was acceptable although slightly crowded. Finally a 6-7 minute walk to Gate 3; considering other reviews regarding Terminal 1 waiting areas we were pleasantly surprised as it seemed relatively recently refurbished. The only complaint we might have would be the acoustics which left somewhat to be desired. It was difficult to hear the many announcements with all the chatting among our fellow passengers. The entire terminal was overall clean and in reasonably good shape considering its age. On our return ten days later we arrived in Terminal 1 late on a Sunday morning just after several wide-body long- haul flights from Europe and the Middle East. Understandably the immigration lines were long but the supervisor was very flexible and opened the diplomatic line also for ordinary travellers. After twenty minutes we came to the baggage belts which were overloaded; in fact there were so many other flights listed on the baggage board that there was no room for ours. Nevertheless after asking the staff nearby we found our baggage belt and within ten minutes our party had received all four checked bags. The customs line was rather long since not all workstations were manned; the wait was around fifteen minutes. Eventually we came out of the terminal building to the usual crowd of well-wishers.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Mid afternoon bunch of Middle East flights departing early evening. 30 minutes queuing just to get into the terminal. Once inside I've NEVER seen that many people simultaneously in the terminal. The queues were horrendous and snaking most of the length of the building. Many of the Long Haul Carriers are now opening Check In 4 hours before Departure Time simply to get the passengers through. Turn up at the Airport 2 hours before Departure and there's a very good chance you'd miss your flight. Fortunately I'd checked in Online and my wait wasn't too bad but I can easily believe many people would be queuing for nearly 2 hours.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2010-12-11,Been through NAIA-3 most months this year. Arrivals is fine with rarely more than a 10 minute wait provided you're close to the front of the plane. (Always preferable when flying into MNL). Bags on the belt quickly and minimal queuing for Taxis. They used to check Bag Tags on exiting Arrivals but that seems to have stopped. Off the plane and into the taxi within 30 minutes. (Couldn't do that in NAIA-1). Departures is pretty well organised with a quick security check prior to entering the terminal. Cebu Pacific usually open 3 hrs before the Flight Departure Time but you can check in at one of the desks earlier provided you don't have bags. With only a few airlines using Terminal 3 Airport Tax Immigration and Security are quick and efficient 15 mins maximum. Food and Drinks places both Lanside and Airside are disappointing and quite expensive. Both the eating places and Duty Free seem to have a temporary feel to them - like they're going somewhere else once the terminal opens up to other airlines. Smoking Room Airside plenty Toilets and comfortable seating at the gate makes NAIA- 3 by far the best MNL Terminal.

Departures however are dreadful. For sure do not arrive more than 2-3 hours before your flight because there is simply no place to sit in the check-in area and no place to eat or relax. Check In will typically open 3 hours before your departure time. Immigration and Security are reasonably efficient but the Departures Area is cold and noisy with uncomfortable seating very poor eating and drinking places poor Duty Free in selection and price and not a single Flight Info Screen in the Departures Hall.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Geoffrey Wyndham-Jones,NA,2010-01-03,Since I last visited Manila 2 years ago things have changed dramatically: there are now 4 terminals: Terminal 1 is for all International flights (except Philippine Airways although PAL code-share flights use Terminal 1); Terminal 2 is for Philippine Airlines only (South Wing for Domestic and North Wing for International); Terminal 3 is for all Cebu Pacific flights and Terminal 4 is the Domestic Terminal used by local domestic carriers. Because of this there is far less crowding and entry through Terminal 1 is now devoid of the heaving snaking lines of passengers standing in a non-airconditioned space which was the previous norm and is now a 5-minute wait (don't forget to find and fill in an Immigration form before you present yourself at the desk - the forms they give out on the aircraft before arrival are only for Customs and are not for Immigration) in an adequately airconditioned area. Baggage claim is still chaotic but this is true in most airports. In all airports in the Philippines your baggage stubs are matched against the baggage tags so don't throw them away. Transfer between terminals is now more organised: the shuttle mini-bus has more seats the locations of the shuttle stops are signed and the driver is helpful: the bus visits all 4 terminals although it still has to use the public roads to do so (these can be a little crowded at times). The great advantage at Terminal 1 now is that the airlines open their check-in desks very early so even if you turn up 3-4 hours before your scheduled departure you will have a working check-in crew. Facilities in Terminals 1 and 2 for eating shopping etc are now reasonable (once you are in the departure lounge) and the toilets are adequate in number and clean. What more could you ask? Security is still tight (shoes belts and watches off) but there are sufficient scanners so no snaking lines of irritable passengers worried about missing their flight.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Arrival is confusing no indication of what you have to do. Massive queues at immigration control. Queue jumping. Every detail has to be punched in by hand. Lack of safety - vehicles rushing along roads where passengers are walking. Bad attitude by officials. Having to fill in a card to leave the country is ludicrous.

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,M Gother,United Kingdom,2014-04-19,A reasonably modern airport no air bridges you walk to and from the aircraft.

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-02-18,There are good points: the building is quite airy and there was adequate seating when we were there (though it could not have coped with many more passengers) there was a good choice of eating places mostly not the usual boring international fast food outlets. Getting to and from the centre took about 20 minutes by taxi at a reasonable price (we had pre-booked on arrival which I recommend if you can). However there is one huge downside which has coloured my experience - the absurd process of immigration and emigration. You fill in an immigration card on the flight and then queue to have it and your passport checked and stamped. In our case it took about 30 minutes just about acceptable. On leaving though you fill in another (identical) and form take it to your airline desk to be stamped if you only have hand luggage (as we did) you thus queue (15 minutes in our case) for a process that takes about 30 seconds. You then go to the embarkation area and queue again (5 minutes) to check that you have been to the airline desk. This allows you into the hallowed ground of the emigration area where you queue (about 40 minutes) to have the paperwork checked and a stamp in your passport. All over? Oh no there was another officer standing about 1 metre behind the desk you have just passed who randomly stopped people to check again (admittedly we were not stopped). So over an hour queuing to get a stamp to leave the country. Marrakech clearly needs and attracts many tourists and has much to offer if it wishes to continue increasing the number of visitors it has to find a more efficient way of processing them into and out of the country.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

I found the staff particularly the border police indifferent to passengers and talked amongst themselves.

If you fly with easyjet even as a low cost passenger you get modern well equipped clean and comfortable jet.

mauritius-airport,/airport-reviews/mauritius-airport,Mauritius Airport customer review,Martin Brown,NA,2005-08-18,Interesting airport. The runway is big enough to take a 747-400 or an A340 but the terminal only has 4 gates. I arrived on 6th August on business and my baggage arrived very quickly and for those who really need a smoke there is a dedicated smoking area in baggage reclaim. The arrivals exit is looks inviting with palm trees etc. The queues at immigration are long but then how many people have just come off of that 747? They try to deal with you as quickly as they can. I was at the back of the queues as was last of off aircraft and was through in 20 minutes. Leaving is a different matter. You go through security before checkin. Security stick a security label on to say they have checked and you can go out and come back if you need that smoke as once inside there is NO SMOKING at all what-so-ever. I was told if we opened the bag we would need to go through security again. My bags have many pockets and the label was only across one? You need to go through security again before going into the main terminal which really doesn't make sense. There are not many shops inside. You can get coffee and food but it isn't cheap. Duty free had the usual array of jewellery alcohol tabacco etc at some good prices and in Euro's as well as Rupee's. I did find on a trip to the toilet that most people went in there for a smoke. The attendant standing outside knows this but ignores it so if you really need a ciggy before the 12 hour or so flight there is an 'opportunity'. That said the terminal was clean and most staff are friendly. Immigration can be stroppy. I had to fill out all of the details on the immigration form again as the carbon copy came out faint.

Departure is entirely different as the passport control and security is truly awful and staff as has been said are rude, aggressive and need some serious customer training.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,C Fairfax,Australia,2014-10-13,Arrived mid morning from the US to be confronted by chaos. An announcement was made advising that passport processing had been stopped due to overcrowding in the baggage area. At least one self serve machine was not working but eventually found one that was and processed self only to discover that the exit points were seething with people all pushing. There was no organisation and no one to advise people where to go. Many people had got into the self service queue without the required pass and were then fighting against the crowd to get out. Why can't the airport provide cordoned off runs for this like they do at other airports? After getting to the baggage hall it was a struggle to view the inconveniently located board to see which carousel to go to. After a long wait for luggage we proceeded past a customs employee towards the exits only to be then told to return to the back of the hall and get in the line which now snaked around the whole area. I am at a loss to understand why Mr Useless did not have the customer service skills to start directing the traffic at the appropriate time. Doing so would go a long way to calming people instead of making them angrier at the disgrace that is the arrivals hall. An explanation of end of school holidays is no explanation. School holiday dates are listed 5 years in advance- surely enough time to roster staff appropriately. On eventual exit we entered a taxi line where an occasional cab arrived until we realised none were being directed to the rank by the taxi manager. We had to walk down to request a maxi taxi (of which there are not enough) for groups arriving with luggage. There was no sign or person advising that the centre cab rank was not working.

Arrived flying J class on Air China on Fri 2nd Aug. An absolute disgrace that it took 2 hours to be processed. Got through the Smart Gate in a couple of minutes. But the queue for aliens was huge and the delay on processing those pax was a major source of my ultimate slow progress. Got to carousel 4 to find it full of Malaysian Airlines bags. But the pax were still back in the immigration queue not present to pull their bags. So the conveyor belt bringing new bags just stopped. I asked baggage services for a handler to come and either put the unclaimed bags on the floor or rearrange them on the belt to fit more on. Refused to do either citing work practice rules. There are employees pulling the bags down in the basement why not up on the carousel too? Finally the MY bags were cleared and about 10 J class bags from my flight. But then no more. Eventually Y class bags and finally most of the J bags. A 90 minute wait. I contacted baggage services 3 times during this period. Walkie-talkie calls to the baggage room below described chaos down there. Then got into customs queue. It was approx 400 meters long snaking along 3 walls of the baggage hall. Two yes two customs officers were at the exit causing the backlog. Why not 10 officers? All in all an absolute disgrace. On leaving the airport it crossed my mind that in fact Melbourne Airport is a private monopoly and earns its highest income from the car park. It is reasonable to think that the company will be delighted by the slow service it raises their revenue. Food for thought.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,T Collier,United Kingdom,2013-08-07,Arrived in from NZ early Sunday evening. Reasonably short walk to passport control where there were no queues. Luggage arrived very promptly. Minor queue at customs. Could be done with more bench seating outside where hire car buses pick up. It was hard to see our bus arrive due to others waiting a considerable about of time before moving off usually without picking anyone up too! Flew out domestically to Sydney. Security queue fairly short. Didn't spend too much time in the terminal as such because we had access to the Qantas business lounge. Not a lot of seats at gate area though. Finally transited through Melbourne airport on route from Auckland to Dubai. International transit a short walk from gate with easy enough signs to follow.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,R Woodward,Australia,2013-01-02,I have travelled through the airport a few times for international trips over the past years. Depart from here has always been quite a smooth affair especially on Jetstar who seem to have extra short waiting times for check-in. Departures section is well-lit comfortable and easy to navigate. Deletion of the upstairs observation decks and windows to the food court on Level 1 are a sad move but place no impact on overall operations. Departures staff seem to be kind. International arrivals however are a completely different story. While they have added extra parking spaces for A380 aircraft's the immigration and customs facilities have become smaller and slower. MEL has the worst arrivals experience I have experienced more so than airports like Manila and Dhaka. On my most recent return to Australia it took 2 hours to clear immigration with the queues stretching through to the duty free section. Arrivals staff are rude and impatient hardly a welcoming face for first time foreign visitors. This is before we even get to the building itself which has almost no windows on the lower levels along with low ceiling heights cold lighting and an industrial-feel ambience. There is a real need for extra customs and immigration space (not just extra aircraft gates). The existing building has served us well over the past 40 years but is now outdated and unable to cope with the capacity demands of modern high-capacity aircraft. Other side notes are the over-priced parking and lack of meaningful (and affordable) public transport to and from the city 25kms away.

After the incredibly lengthy arrival delay the last time we used MEL for an international flight my wife and I were expecting the worst on our evening return. To our amazement it took less than 20 minutes from touching-down until we walked out of the terminal. We travelled Business Class and having priority baggage handling helped to obtain our cases quicker than was the case on our previous Economy flight. While we used the Smartgate service the few passengers using the traditional Immigration lines at the same time meant we didn't progress any quicker than they did at that point.

We disembarked at about 2220 & collected our luggage at the carousel at 2245. Ominously there were approximately 150 people queued for Customs when we first arrived at the carousel. By the time passengers from our flight had collected their luggage there was a single queue that snaked twice around carousel 1 before feeding into the existing three lines of people who had been waiting when we arrived. As we waited patiently passenger from another flight collected their bags & joined the queues. It took until 2345 to reach a Customs Officer & be waved though after a quick check of our luggage. I don't blame Customs staff who were obviously doing their best with patience & good humour but seeing almost everyone being asked to open their cases I could understand the delays. I doubt whether too many people waiting to clear Customs that night would have any positive thoughts about Melbourne Airport or maybe Melbourne & Australia in general.

mexico-city-airport,/airport-reviews/mexico-city-airport,Mexico City Airport customer review,N Taylor,Mexico,2011-05-04,I wouldn't normally write a review like this but after waiting almost two hours (standing up) for my in-laws a few days ago I wanted to share my renewed unhappiness with this airport. We would have been able to escape to the American Express lounge but unfortunately my hubby had forgotten his card. I am British but I live in Mexico City thus I have no choice but to grit my teeth and face this horrendous airport several times per year. I therefore also mainly travel through Terminal One. Terminal Two is a bit more pleasant in that it is newer but my review refers to T1. Departing from Mexico City is much better than arriving however it still leaves much to be desired. Taxis are good and inexpensive (make sure you pre-book to get a secure white/red taxi and never hail the green/white taxis or the red/gold taxis. The special sirport taxis are white and yellow and are also safe) and the airport is located in fairly close proximity to the city centre so in theory it should be fairly quck to arrive there. However with traffic in Mexico City it can take much much longer than expected so be aware of this to avoid missing flights. If you make your own way there by car strangely for a major airport it is not signposted until you are practically there so you need to be fairly sure of where you are going before you attempt this. It is also located in a fairly off putting and run down part of town so it is not the kind of place you want to get lost in. This also goes for leaving the airport. Parking can be difficult at peak times. Inside the airport - during the summer months the heat can be awful I am not sure if there is air conditioning or if it just doesn't function when needed. It can be tricky to get to where you want to go as Departures and Arrivals are very poorly signposted and the lay out is confusing. So far when I have checked in here I haven't had to wait too long as I always make a point of checking in online and getting there early and using the bag drop when I fly British Airways however we did face a bit of a queue flying with Iberia. I have not experienced too many going through security either so they have obviously organised outgoing flights a bit better than the incoming flights. Passing security facilities are fairly average. As other reviewers have said the terminal is fairly shabby and could do with a renovation but at the end of the day that would probably cause utter chaos. Some of the gates have absolutely no seating areas whatsoever so you basically just have to stand until you are able to board which can take a long time. Arriving in Mexico City - a completely different story and the main reason for the very low scores. Do not expect anything to happen quickly as several large European flights all arrive at almost exactly the same time every day (approx 7pm). Strangely after disembarking the plane arriving passengers are ushered through the arrivals lounge and all is a bit confusing. The queues at passport control are generally frightful and can take over an hour both in the line for nationals and non-nationals (after receiving conflicting information about which I should use as a holder of a Mexican Resident's Visa I have used both). Baggage claim is equally horrendous with several flights worth of baggage arriving on one carrousel whilst many others remain empty. Again there is limited airconditioning so it can be especially unpleasant in the warm summer months. After finally picking up your bags you then have to queue again to have all your luggage scanned (don't expect any help with this - I was travelling alone literally moving my life from London to Mexico City and had a significant amount of luggage as a result three members of staff simply watched while I struggled to load the cases onto the belt - same story when I took them out and put them back on the trolley) and they never open up all the scanners so again this can take a long time. After scanning your bags you then have to hit a button - green means go but if it comes up red you have to have your luggage inspected by an officer. This is also worth remembering when picking someone up do not rush to get there when the flight lands as it is a waste of time as they can take another two hours on top of that. Queues for taxis can be long especially if you need a larger vehicle and once in your car/taxi there is still Mexican rush hour traffic to contend with through a not-so-nice part of town.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

We arrived on a Virgin flight from Heathrow and found ourselves wandering down endless corridors to immigration. Here we queued for nearly an hour. Immigration staff were surly and in one case downright rude. What made this worse is that we were transiting through to Grand Cayman but Miami airport has no facilities for transit passengers. Luckily we had 3 hours before our flight out goodness knows how anyone would manage with any less time between flights. The building itself has obviously been designed by someone who builds mazes for a living. Security staff who checked us through to the gate for the flight to Cayman were equally abrupt and unhelpful.

Like on the way out at Stansted no security questions were asked. Once through immigration and the security check all their is is a small duty free shop and a coffee shop. The amount of seating was reasonable but not sufficient for the Ryanair flights scheduled to leave within 45 mins of each of each other. The airport also seems to suffer from a lack of airside buses to transfer passengers to aircraft  but thankfully no delay to departure occured.

Upon arrival from France we headed off for a long walk to the customs and immigration area of the airport. However once we arrived we were held at the bottom of a staircase while they got their staff ready for us. Once inside things moved quite quickly though I've never been asked so many random questions by immigration. (Nor have I ever run into such unfriendly immigration agents.) Instructions for where to go and what to do with your bags for continuing flights was totally lacking. Fortunately a TSA agent walked by as we were being given instructions and he told us to just follow him. (Following the blue line in the floor was fine expect that you had to drop your bags off to be x-rayed about mid-way on the blue line.)

Terminal J still in the process of being finished so fewer choices for dining and shopping than in some other areas (you can get to Terminal H without exiting security).

It is a fairly basic airport and the architecture is pretty unimpressive. However it is one of the most efficient airports I know. Luggage is normally delivered within 15 minutes from arrival and one can be in the centre of Milan in 15/20 minutes provided there is no traffic. I also like the fact that the parking area is next to the terminal and one can be in the check-in counter minutes after parking. Its downside is the lack of amenities the cramped spaces and the fact that on international flights you are whisked to the plane in a bus which is too small and always packed.

Transfer into Milan city centre is operated by two competing bus companies with rather the same prices. Allow at least 55min between Malpensa and the city easily more in rush-hour periods. Upon departure there are very few and small flight information screens making it difficult to locate the right check-in desks. It is even more difficult to find the gates as security checks take place at an intermediate floor between Arrivals and Departures floors! Security employees were efficient and friendly. The Schengen file (for Gates A) was quick enough but the Non-Schengen queue (for Gates B) seemed to be chronically congested.

MKE gains some points in my book by also including a small museum that deals with the history of the airport and aviation in Milwaukee a nice touch that other airports should consider.

The new international concourse is very impressive. However I do think it could be utilized a little bit more but it is a busy airport during the rush hours of 10am to 5pm. Some problems is that the AC does not work that well in Immigrations or Customs but that will soon be changed as they are building a whole new section to replace the current immigration and customs area. There are so many shops and a new shopping concourse is suppose to open really soon. I think there should be a first class lounge for all the airlines that don’t have their own and I feel the check in lobby in the departure concourse needs to be extended. During the busy periods its way to crowded and it seems like it takes forever for you to check in. Also I think they need to raise the roof in the western concourse it’s a little bit to low and it feels claustrophobic. If you’re an aviation fan this is a nice airport to for some spotting from the East concourse because it’s very airy and allot of glass windows. Overall I give the airport 4 out of 5. It will be nice to see the airport again once it has completed its expansion project. Maybe then Ill give it a 5 out of 5.

montevideo-airport,/airport-reviews/montevideo-airport,Montevideo Airport customer review,Chris Beck,NA,2010-03-17,I was in the new terminal in Montevideo going to Buenos Aires. The new airport is brilliant with three levels. The lower level is the arrivals level the main level is the departure level and the upper level is a observation deck with airside views. All three levels are connected by escalators. The building has a soaring roof which enhances the spaciousness of the facility. Check in (PLUNA) was handled quickly. After check in you pay the airport tax and then proceed through security which was done by Air force personnel who were quite thorough and also polite. After security you go through a large duty Free aerea and into the waiting section. There is a full service restaurant on this floor (no fast food court) and the entire area looks out over the aircraft apron.

It is a comfy little airport. It has 2 main runways capable of a full loaded 747's take off. It is a 20 minute ride into town. There are only 9 gates in all 8 of them remote. There are very little eating facilities. Only one newsagent a chemist shop a post office a tourist info office an official bank branch some money exchange bureaus  a few shops and the usual car rentals. Immigration and customs are slow but smily. Can be chaotic confusing and messy during the holiday period. The duty free shop is brilliant I think the cheapest in SA. Although not a great selection.

I arrived from Frankfurt on AC875 on Jan. 1 at 15.56 and connected to a domestic flight that departed to Winnipeg at 17.20 - officially well above the minimum required time. Clearing Immigration and Customs via the Connections line was as quick as I've experienced anywhere and I was slowed down only slightly by baggage re-check. Then came security where connecting and local passengers must all go through the same line. That was where things went pear-shaped with a long line snaking across the terminal followed by a few extra minutes going through a random more detailed (but professionally done) inspection. Literally ran for the gate without even putting my belt back on or refilling my pockets and was the final passenger to board just after the final call.

moscow-domodedovo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-domodedovo-airport,Moscow Domodedovo Airport customer review,A West,United Kingdom,2013-10-16,Is there an airport in the world that needs a new terminal more urgently. Domodedovo is over crowded which I think is where all its problems begin. After we passed through the understaffed and poorly organised passport control we found the baggage carousel empty not because they were slow unloading the plane but because they needed it for another flight so they'd dumped the London bags in a corner at the other end of the reclamation hall. Departing was an exercise in queuing even though I had mastered the Russian art of queue barging by the end of my trip. After the security and passport checks which felt very much like a legacy of the Soviet era we needed refreshments and while the extortionate prices couldn't put us off the lack of anywhere to sit nearly did. More waiting areas are needed to get people out of the cafe areas. Toilets were dirty and crowded furtive smokers lurked in the cubicles. Somebody had set a paper towel bin alight presumably with a discard cigarette and a cleaning lady was left to put it out by scooping handfuls of water from the taps. Our queue for the gate was in the middle of a narrow and busy corridor right next to the smouldering toilets. Staff were as friendly and helpful as I've found anywhere but don't expect much English spoken. Hopefully the airport's continued success will prompt a new terminal soon.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Baggage appeared almost instantly after walking into reclaim. You still have to fight your way past importuning taxi drivers - go to the official taxi desk at the wall facing you as you emerge into arrivals and book a taxi into town. You will then be escorted outside to your assigned driver. On return leg check-in very smooth. Security a tad silly at times - two people stationed just 3 metres apart both checking passports and boarding cards - but otherwise fairly standard.

moscow-domodedovo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-domodedovo-airport,Moscow Domodedovo Airport customer review,Rich Jenkins,NA,2010-01-08,"Used DME during the Christmas/New years season. Arrival was quick and I was through immigration customs et al. within half an hour. Limited exchange facilities--one bank with several locations and exchange rates that are slightly less favorable than intown. Getting to the Pavaletsky-bound train means going into the domestic terminal a lengthy walk with many signs although a couple are a little confusing as to direction. The train leaves every 30 or 60 minutes depending on time of day. On New Years (a big holiday in Russia) it was running to Pavaletsky but not to the airports. For departure I arrived early (3+ hours) because it was a holiday (New Years) and new procedures were rumored to be in place for US flights (turned out not to be the case). The train from Pavaletsky was not running in the am - taxi was R1500 (after an initial ""offer"" of R2000) - a hair-raising but uneventful ride. Note that the limited food/shopping options and non-existent seating on the ground floor of the departure terminal are just part of the story--seating and food/shopping are on the second floor. Passport control and security screening were uneventful and reasonably efficient. The departure areas are filled with upscale stores and the usual duty free stuff. Expect to pay 50-100% more for food and drink than you would in the city. Most airports seem to have stopped this kind of nonsense.

The airport seemed relatively modern but still lags far behind other hubs I've flown through like Frankfurt and Heathrow (which isn't saying much). Transit times seem to vary depending on time of day and which terminal you land in. Terminals D, E, and F all form an interconnected transit area. On our first stop over in Moscow we arrived at Terminal F and found ourselves funneled through a tiny transfer area that had one attendant serving multiple arriving flights. While we we arrived near the front of the line, I could see some people easily waiting 40+ minutes to pass through transit passport control and security. On the way back, we landed in Terminal D and things seemed to be better staffed and far less busy. My main complaint with the airport is the absolute lack of space. All three terminals are packed with very expensive duty free stores, squeezing out room for seating, food options, and bathrooms. The toilets at the airport were probably the dirtiest I have seen in any airport, and are stained with cigarette ash marks. In terminal D the duty free shops leave so little room in the corridors that it is a struggle to pass between crowds of people queuing for their flight. Terminal D also gets very hot during the daytime. The airport staff didn't seem very friendly or interested in customer service. They mostly bark commands at passengers.

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,Andy Williams,Spain,2011-07-29,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport is essentially split into 3 main terminals - D E and F. Each one is completely different in terms of age facilities and experience. Getting between the terminals was once a chore but all three are now linked making transfers between terminals fairly painless. On my recent visit I arrived in terminal E and had to transfer through to terminal F and found the process to have been made far more complicated than it should have been by the inadequate transfer desk which requires you to pass through a single internal passport control and security desk - given the number of flights bottlenecks can be a real issue. I found the staff at the transfer desk were helpful but very abrupt. Matters were confused by the fact that there were additional staff approaching and assisting those in the queue making the desk and it's staff redundant - but without informing anyone waiting that there was no need to queue if you already held a boarding card and that irrespective of this the desk cannot issue boarding cards to those without them(???). Terminal F is the older of the terminals and has the look and feel of an authentic soviet era airport - complete with coffee stained formica partitions 1970's furniture and a very odd arrangement of kiosks that give it the feeling of an indoor market with narrow winding passages between them. Food and refreshments are VERY expensive (around $10 for a not very good coffee). The terminal is a smoking terminal with 'smoking zones' consisting of ashtrays placed around the terminal but not segregated from non smokers in any way. There is no air conditioning in this terminal and while it was a fairly chilly morning when I arrived inside it felt stuffy. There is good free wifi access in this terminal. Terminal E is much newer though equally puzzling. It is a much more spacious terminal perhaps too spacious as there appeared to be a LOT of empty space with no seating which I found strange. Generally these areas were filled with passengers sleeping. The eating options here appear much more modern but equally as expensive. The terminal is much more open with glass walls segregated smoking zones and air conditioning. There was no working wifi in this terminal when I visited. Terminal D is newer still and much more like the modern terminals you may be used to (think heathrow T5 Singapore HK etc) and is a much nicer experience. I found it a breeze to walk through to terminal D from E to use the free wifi.

Upon entering the duty free area it is like any of the top airports in the world with an impressive variety of shops restaurants bars boutiques and bars - all neatly laid out. The signage and announcements are very clear and precise - it sounds like they hired the same lady who announces in Heathrow T5.

Departure was a similar story: some queues were there but moved relatively quickly friendly check-in (TK) very friendly officers that even joked with us at security with the usual stamps here and there and finally a quick cup of coffee close to the gate before boarding. True: there are mosquitoes in T2 and not all shops are operational yet but all we needed for departure was relatively prompt & pleasant and we enjoyed the huge improvement that has taken place in Mumbai. When they shift all domestic flights to T2 towards the end of 2014 we won't hesitate to use BOM again for our travels to India. Delhi IGI is better at present from international to domestic if you continue domestic with Air India.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Vineet Bapat,Canada,2014-02-19,My wife and I had the pleasure of boarding our flight at the new Terminal 2 at 1 am on Feb 13. Having arrived at and departed from Mumbai's international and domestic terminals several times over the past two decades I can honestly say that the new Terminal 2 represents a quantum leap in (for the most part) vastly improving the passenger experience. This includes the new elevated access ramp to the terminal from the Western Express Highway. The terminal building itself is an architectural wonder. There is lots of glass all owing expansive views of the airport. Spacious seating / waiting areas with clear flight boarding announcement. Slightly secluded seating areas with relaxing arm chairs and modular sofa type seating configurations. Numerous bistros and coffee shops in a shopping mall type of a layout. Interesting and original retail outlets. As this was the first day of operations several stores were not yet open or had goods displayed but were not available for shopping. Nevertheless the store managers invited us to have a look around. Likewise the duty free shops were still stocking up with only a few items for sale. Washrooms were very clean and well distributed throughout the terminal. One aspect that could be improved is the still cumbersome process of passport and visa checks for outbound passengers which seems to be largely bureaucratic and unnecessary. There was a long snaking line for this checkpoint before proceeding to the airside retail food and gate area which was tiresome and resulted in us feeling a bit too exhausted to fully explore the various stores and eateries. I hope the airport authorities eliminate or at least streamline this procedure.,NA,NA,NA,9,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,A Swamy,India,2013-10-13,Transited through BOM while travelling between BLR and South East Asia. Departure from BOM was fine. Good shuttle coach provided for transfer between domestic and international terminals. Immigration and security lines were manageable though the immigration lines can be handled more efficiently by providing proper directions to passengers! Good dining (though overpriced) options available at international gates and sufficient seating arrangements at the gates. Return was a different story altogether. The carpets in the arrival gate were worn out and smelly. After immigration we wanted to use the restrooms before transferring to domestic terminal. What a shabby experience it was! Half the toilets were in maintenance the rest were leaking and there was a bad smell. Similar scenario in the domestic terminal restrooms. The seats in the domestic departure area were inadequate and quite a few were torn. An airport that can be avoided if you have the choice.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,1,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Onward to DXB was quite ok since it was an afternoon flight. Efficient transfer from domestic to international terminal in an AC coach. Immigration and security each took less than 10 minutes and lots of empty chairs at the gates. Some limited (but nice) food options at the gate. Returning from DXB was a totally different experience. We landed at 0220 and the onward domestic flight to BLR was at 0635. Immigration was quick (less than 5 minutes). Baggage took almost 25 minutes to arrive. We had to get our baggage screened for Customs and this required us to heave our bags onto the luggage screening belt. There was one more screening of baggage before we dropped them off and a security check before boarding the inter-terminal transfer coach. Security staff were rude and unconcerned. Once at the domestic terminal there was one more security check.

I was aware of Mumbai's fearful reputation and was apprehensive about have to transit through it. However I was pleasantly surprised. No queue at immigration bags turned up fairly quickly and customs wasn't a problem though bags are screened incredibly often. Our transfer to the domestic terminal was quite smooth as well though the bus does go on a tour of the airport facility. The domestic terminal was remarkably clean and facilities were fine given that it was early hours of the morning. We had to change some sterling to INRs but that too went okay and we had no trouble with the exchange desk. Our only problem came at security in the domestic terminal where my husband's bag was retained. He was carrying our personal camera equipment and his diabetic medication. Our cameras were removed and the bag re-scanned. The security officer came over with the bag asked if he used insulin and immediately stamped the bag as cleared. We had to wait around 2 hours for our connection to Bangalore but again this wasn't a major issue.

The chaos and disorganisation was only surpassed by the security staff's inefficiency and general lack of effort.

The flight was scheduled for 4am which reflects the lack of queues but airport was clean retail areas were spacious and there were fantastic recliner seating areas at each boarding gate and coffee shops nearby. The duty free area seemed similar to that at Dubai Terminal 3 and it seems the airport are trying to improve their image. I also liked that there were highly visible emergency defibrillators located at regular intervals throughout the airport. Other airports would do well to follow suit. Staff were lively polite and helpful. Have to mention one of the police/security guys at the front of the airport who went out in the monsoon rain to fetch our dimwit of a cab driver who had got lost (don't ask me how a taxi driver gets lost at an airport complex...). Really did appreciate that personal touch and not something that I would expect in Europe/US regions.

Once you have made it through all the people to get inside you have to get your luggage scanned and security taped before check-in will take it. They tell most people this after queuing at the check-in desk (not useful). The international departure concourse for the most part looked like it is falling apart despite renovation (though the internal departure concourse in another terminal was newly designed and looked good). Immigration is painfully slow and immigration staff seem to think everyone is a suspect. Security is a joke as their methods are inconsistent. One guy will pat one passenger while the guy next to him doesn't bother with his passenger. Queues are the longest I've ever seen at security and this was at 11.00 at night.

Only a mere 29 minutes elapsed from engine shutdown on my inbound flight from Canada to my arrival at the gate for my onward flight to Sweden. This included waiting and processing time at both Immigration and security screening, and I walked at a normal pace at all points in between.

After making it through passport control I believe there was a bus ride. Then when we got to the departure gate the services were really substandard.

Especially if you're flying with Omanair, they have a specific area just for that airline with many counters open for it. The only thing is, I just absolutely am disgusted with some of the staff where they would constantly question whether I need a visa to UAE with my passport and then question me back on ""are you sure?"" and ""really?"". 2 weeks ago, the guy at the check in counter said ""how do you know you don't need visa? When was the last time you were at UAE?"" (if he had properly check my passport that he was holding, he would have noticed that I have at least 10 UAE stamps in my passport, one which was dated 2 weeks before that). 2) Not many shops to be honest. Not the sort of airport you want to be at for more than 3 hours. 3) Did not like the other gate for low costs airlines such as Rotana or flydubai. That place is packed and crowded and super unorganised. I have honestly paid more to fly with Omanair just to avoid boarding through that gate. 4) Arrival at the airport is ok at times. Sometimes its super crowded, sometimes it's excellent. The immigration counter could do with some more counters during the busy time cause I remember when it took over an hour just for the queue. 5) Taxi from the airport to your destination is absolutely expensive. Where I am staying at, is only 10 minutes drive, yet it costs OMR8 (and same price to where another place that is 30 minutes is). 6) When the airport is full, it really is full.

Check in was a breeze, but had to wait 45 minutes to get my checked bag screened at the X-ray as the security officer had not turned up for work yet! Similarly had to wait in a long line with the rest of the passengers until the officers manning the doors to the departure lounge decided to show up, at around 6:10 or so. Watching the airport cats play with the dangling straps on a passenger's bag in the departure lounge was a nice way to pass the time while waiting to board.

nadi-airport,/airport-reviews/nadi-airport,Nadi Airport customer review,T Maddern,Australia,2015-07-27,"Our experience at this airport yesterday was a complete shambles. They are building the new airport around the existing one. The departures area is extremely small and very claustrophobic. Once through security, there is no view of the outside world until you go up the escalator and out to your aircraft. There are 2 areas for passengers to sit. Option 1: A white square room with seats that resembles a prison cell. Option 2: An old section near the airline lounges which has no airconditioning and resembles a coffin. There are 2 duty free shops and 2 food outlets in the airport, which when we were there was filled with passengers for 4 flights. When our (and other) flight was called for boarding, we were made to queue at the bottom of an escalator for about 15 minutes until we were allowed to rise up to the next level on the escalator and walk through to open air on the way to the airport. At security, we had already had our bags x-rayed and any bottles of water taken off us, but just before getting to the aircraft, we all had to open our bags again so they could be searched again and any bottles of water that had been purchased inside the airport were taken off us. Finally, after going up the escalator, we came to some steps that we had to walk back down to the ground to get to our Virgin 737 aircraft. It's sad that our last memories of Fiji had to be at this shambles of an airport, but we will hold on to our wonderful memories of Fiji and look forward to our next trip to Fiji in about 5 years when I assume the rebuilding work will be complete and Nadi will have a bright new airport with windows and open spaces to welcome people to and from their wonderful country.",Departure Only,27-07-2015,FamilyLeisure,2,3,3,1,NA,1,1,1,NA,0

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,M Kemp,United Kingdom,2013-05-05,I'm recently back from a business trip to Kenya. This airport is poor. Arrival required trekking across the tarmac before entering a noisy hot and crowded 70s style concrete corridor where departing/arriving passengers are in the same place. Long immigration lines and grumpy staff. Make sure you know what you're doing when you exit baggage claim as the public area can be rather threatening. For departure expect queuing just to get inside immigration again very slow and miserable. This airport has few decent shops or facilities; the Java house coffee bar is OK otherwise it's mostly curios T-shirts and duty free alcohol. Toilets were clean but old and no TP!

Basically its straight out of the 1960s so not that well laid out. The two main problems are having to queue outside to get past the first security check and having to queue twice more for a long check-in and two more security scans at the gate. It really needs a layout change - so you can be scanned just once on entering the secure passenger only area. Duty free shops well they sell the same as elsewhere in the world just without hi power arc lighting and glossy shelves. I agree the main problem is the lack of seating and the fact it feels a bit cramped. I've always managed to get a seat and try to arrive not too early but with enough time to get through all the checks.

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,D Shah,NA,2008-09-08,Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is in dire need of a face-lift. As I approached the airport staff upon disembarking from the plane the lights along the corridor were glum and a sombre mood existed in terms of passenger variety especially with the lack of proper seating signs and most importantly modesty and flare with which airports are supposed to define a country. Security is quite good but the luggage conveyors need to be quickly fed and this suggests to me that there is a boardroom feud amongst luggage handlers or something similar as to which a huge air of discontent lies with this airport's workers. To my knowledge this airport generates more than 2.5million passengers annually and it has a vital geographic location which serves African routes very well.

Just a couple of steps and you're outside the building and basically in the middle of the town. There's a selection of car rentals in the arrival hall but it takes ages to actually get the keys and papers if there are more than two people in the queue. Getting to the car eventually is another interesting experience as the AVIS/SIxt/Hertz etc parking area is located far away from the airport and there are no directions whatsoever where to go. It turned out there's a small shuttle van (also without any discernable signs or labels) commuting between arrival hall and the various parking lots. The drivers don't speak English (or any other language but Italian for that matter) and cannot tell you where you're supposed to find your car. On departure you may find the checkin quite crowded but once through it leads to a light and open lounge area with a number of shops and some fast food restaurants (Burgerking Autogrill).

nassau-airport,/airport-reviews/nassau-airport,Nassau Airport customer review,J Hagen,NA,2008-03-10,"The vast majority of problems with this airport pertain to the delays of having to travel back to the US. If you are travelling to any other country (international) security is a breeze. For example travelling to Toronto Montreal or London: simply check-in with the agent walk down 40 feet to the right to the security area and walk through the detector. After this quick security screening you have reached the ""international lounge area"" where you just sit and wait to board. It takes about 20 minutes in total if there isn't a big line up at check in. Just be there an hour early to make sure your bags get on the plane but they should since NAS is a small airport. The BIG problem is travel to the US. If this is your case you should be at the airport at least 2.5 hours in advance due to all the TSA regulations. The Bahamians are just following protocol but they sometimes exagerrate when they confiscate possessions (eg golfballs were taken from me) and they are rude and brush you off when you ask why. Expect at least 3 security checkpoints a carry-on search (1 on 2 chance of having that done) and for the unlucky a random spot check (1 on 6 chance of having that done). These are all measures the TSA has enforced in the Bahamas and have to be followed by Bahamian security personnel. The US Customs line can be really long and slow especially during lunch hour when the bulk of the flights are leaving. You would think they could have more agents out at that hour and save the lunch for 2 PM when things calm down. During Christmas break and spring break the Bahamian Customs area for arriving passengers can be packed and lines can take over an hour if 4-5 flights arrive at once. Otherwise it is extremely smooth. The biggest problem with the airport is the fact that it is just SO old and in dire need of renovation. The restaurant in the US departures lounge is way overpriced and the food is horrible. Ultimately the image the airport conveys is that of a tiny island airport you'd see at a Bahamian island like Long Island-- this is not an airport suited for the capital Nassau. Also the baggage area has no security and lost bags are thrown everywhere. It is a mess to see for tourists. But the baggage people who can be paid to place your bags on a chariot and wheeled out are helpful and informative. They are worth the $5 tip since they'll also get you a taxi/limo. Overall this airport is a 5/10 but people should not base coming to the Bahamas because of the airport. It is a great country with much to offer simply a little slow as the expressions go.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Terminal 1 (Lufthansa Turkish Austrian Air France etc) is a disgrace: third-world airports put it to shame. Half of the drinking fountains do not work. Electrical outlets for computers are scarce. Signage is largely absent or unhelpful. There appears to be no effective control of temperature or air circulation. TSA screening for passengers boarding international flights was excessively prolonged and confusing. Terminal 1 punishes arriving international passengers with non-operative escalators and moving walkways as they drag their luggage towards TSA and Customs. Terminal 1 at JFK is a fraud: charging exorbitant airline fees for services that if does not provide. On the other hand Terminals 2 and 4 - operated by Delta - are clearly customer-oriented. While making flight connections there on April 24 and May 2 2015 Delta personnel and clear signage made navigating those terminals pleasant and even happy. The temperature inside was comfortable and there were ample seats and electrical outlets for computer users. I will do my best to avoid any airline operating out of the pit that is Terminal 1 at JFK. I would welcome flights through Terminals 2 and 4 at JFK because Delta Airlines obviously cares about passengers' comfort in its terminals at JFK.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

The most recent example was a few days ago arriving into Terminal 8 Saturday evening at 11pm. Baggage was total chaos and took 1.5 hours after landing to finally get our bags. It will never change. The best preparation if you must fly through JFK (or EWR or LGA) is to learn in advance everything about what must be done - where you need to go and whatever procedures you need to go through so then you need to rely on the poor customer service to a far lessor degree and then it will be less painful.,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Firstly the wait at the BA check in was about an hour with only 3 desks open higher classes of travel had their own check in desks and the staff there were largely unemployed. Heathrow took five minutes. The wait to go through security was about 40 minutes there was only one desk with one officer and three belts Heathrow has approximately twenty belts and a myriad of security officers and again took five minutes. Another officer did come to help the one on her own but all too late and it looked very inefficient indeed it was also unsafe and I saw a large bottle of water go through on someone's hand baggage that went unchallenged. Signage was also inaccurate telling you to remove your shoes and belt but nothing about wallets pockets etc therefore time was wasted in operatives repeatedly having to get customers to rectify their mistakes they were also rude and overbearing in their manner.

Departing from Terminal C was a little bit of a hassle going through the Premier Access line for security. I waited over 20 minutes. The two United Clubs were a little worn and I feel they should invest money to renovate them. I also made some observations while I was walking around the terminal before my 16 hour flight. Terminal C especially C1 and C2 are starting to show its age a little bit and almost looks like a dirty bus terminal. Luckily I didn't need it but the United Customer service lines were massive with about 200 people on it and only one customer service agent on duty. The dining options are Not bad. My worst experience was coming through Terminal C International Arrivals. My flight came in on time and everything was going well until I saw the massive immigration line that took over an hour. There were three major flight that arrived and there were only 4 immigration officers on duty while there were at least 20 empty booths. I got my bags and the customs line took 10 minutes. As I was leaving I made another observation The United Transfer desk line for connecting flights was just as long as the immigration line. People in line were actually sitting on their bags. There were literally only 2 agents helping over 300 people. Luckily Newark was my final destination. Based on what I saw any connection less than three hours is a really tight connection. Maybe even three hours isn't enough. I always used Newark because there were hardly any lines and it was easier to use than JFK.

I will avoid this airport whenever possible indeed avoiding the US altogether as a transit country is a high priority for me given the requirement to clear immigration even if you aren't staying in the country. Canada surely there is an opportunity here for you. I also agree with others that in most respects it is user unfriendly. It is poorly signed and even simple things like finding the hotel shuttles can be a real trial and certainly something one can do without after a long international flight. I think other countries should have special lines for US passport holders and reciprocate that same degree of inconvenience and rudeness.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,M Rogers,Ireland,2010-08-26,Travelling through Newark on my way to Chicago was a nightmare. I have to agree with several of the previous reviews that point out how unprofessional and rude immigration control can be. I (and I'm sure many of the other reviewers) have entered more than one other country as a foreigner (as well as the US through other airports) and so will have a fair idea of what to expect from immigration control officials. I witnessed an incident of an officer being unduly rude to a fellow traveller in a similar way to an incident in a previous review so this must not be all that isolated or unusual. Waiting times for baggage and to go through other security areas could also be improved. I was not there at a particularly busy period and yet waiting times were significantly longer than one would expect from an airport of this size. Further signage and direction finding must be improved. There were several information points around the airport that would have probably been helpful if there had been anyone at them. I passed 3 or 4 on my way to my connection and not one had a staff member present. I would avoid this airport if possible in the future.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I believe segregating passengers without explaining why is a dangerous thing for them to do (which is what happened to me despite being the only Indian in an all-Caucasian group). This was made worse by making me wait for an hour and being interrogated like a criminal about intimate details of my life. My advice if you end up in Newark airport is to co-operate fully and never go back there.

While the newer larger terminals Continental uses are rather nice with a decent array of eateries and shops our onward flight departed from Terminal A which looks like a small crowded terminal built decades ago and never updated. Woefully over-crowded. While the main terminals had bars/restaurants run by Heineken and by Samuel Adams beers Terminal A had just a Budwesier brew pub/eatery (being the only sit-down restaurant in the terminal it was filled with a long line of people waiting to get in). The main terminals could use a desk giving ground transportation information (the only one is outside security) since at one point we were given the option of trudging out to Laguardia to get a flight to Ottawa but the reps at the customer service counters could give us NO information at all about time and cost of getting out to Laguardia.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

There is not much in the way of signage both inside and outside the airport grounds and it can be confusing. The whole airport needs a rethink in terms of staff attitude towards passengers together with more signage. The TSA agent on arrival was quite pleasant and we were on our way into Manhattan within 40 minutes of arrival. Our luggage was already on the carousel. For departures BA's check in area is located in the basement area of Terminal B; the signage by the roadside indicating where this is indicated is very small and needs to be made a lot bigger. In Terminal B there is small food court with a McDs. There is also a Chilis Too which is located nearer to the security checkpoint. Again there are no signs to indicate the existance of Chilis Too. TSA people on departure were slow and officious to the nth degree. There did not seem to be much effective communication between the TSA and the other security group who work in that airport; what we did see were these two groups arguing with each other about a wheelchair going through a security checkpoint (the wheelchair did not fit through the TSA checkpoint).,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

It is shameful that an airport that is connected to New York is such a mess. After dropping the rental car I waited for tram to get to the airport. You have to guess on your own whether the one to the left or one to the right will depart. And on top of that for no apparent reason you had to change the tram at terminal A to go to terminal B. Nothing tell you do so. You just have to guess seeing most of the people getting off the train. It was very confusing. The gate number for my flight was not listed even though flight was about to depart in less than an hour. Security had to be the slowest of any airport I have seen. Its not that there were lot people ahead of me - the TSA folks just looked lazy and clumsy thats all. They didn't have any incentive to expedite people faster.

There wasn't one, so people unclipped the tapes and we all clambered over - total chaos. When it was pointed out by a number of passengers that all other lanes had appeared to be taped off she was very rude and dismissive.

There's a Hungry Jack's burger outlet which provides standard fast food fare - probably the best food value in the airport because their prices are the same as any other Hungry Jack's outlet and not inflated by the airport location. The ""Insomnia"" coffee bar was charging between $3.50 and $5 for a long black coffee - not cheap in my opinion. There's a water fountain right next to the entrance to the toilets so most people would probably pay $3 to a vendor for a bottle but to be fair - there is a water fountain. The check in desks only specify the airline and don't have details of flights. So it's possible to wait 20 minutes in line only to be told ""We're not checking in that flight yet come back at 4.40 pm"" (but that's after no effort has previously been made to communicate this information to people in the line). The airline makes a lot of fuss about its free wireless hotspots but I haven't tried it so can't attest to its speed or quality.

We had purchased a small (12 cm across) very fragile ceramic plate on our trip. We carefully packed this plate in our carry-on luggage. During a hand inspection at security the inspector demanded that this plate be placed in our checked luggage since it could be used as a weapon (she motioned how you could hit someone over the head with it). Believe me it seemed an incredible concept that you could injure someone with this small thin incredibly fragile plate. Yet the inspector persisted and we anxiously placed the plate in our checked luggage.

When you have children with you you feel under pressure to try and sit with them. We bought some food for the journey in the airport which was expensive only to be given the same when on the coach would have been helpful to relay this earlier this would have saved us spending more money.

norwich-airport,/airport-reviews/norwich-airport,Norwich Airport customer review,R Brook,United Kingdom,2013-01-17,Norwich Airport is the most half hearted operation imaginable. Commercial passengers are given the impression that they are a bit of a nuisance and attempts to keep their numbers to a minimum with the £10 service charge high car parking charges minimal choice of destinations and a generally apathetic air have been remarkably successful. The lack of arrivals or departures does not result in a speedy check in and the airport is liable to close if weather conditions are anything less than ideal.

After I told him where I was going he warned me that it would be expensive to take a taxi. The trick is that you need to call in advance. The taxicab mafia wants $50 and they stick together. If you call directly you can get a ride for $10 or so and they'll arrange for a pickup. Always arrange for pricing in advance. There's also a very inexpensive autobus that takes you into the city but can be crowded. I was in and out of the airport in 20 minutes. Don't exchange a lot of money there.

Baggage claim wait time was practically zero although this airport is not equipped with a baggage belt. Instead the tourists have to pick up their luggage from the back of a small truck. Probably the airport taxes for this airport are very small and for this reason some very good flight deals can be found on flights from this airport. The toilets were decent.

Access to the international departure counters in a tiny hall is only granted less than 2 hours before flight departure often resulting in long lines and crowded conditions. Access to the departure gates is also controlled by strict staff and only allowed a set period before the scheduled departure; if you are 1 minute early you will be turned away!

Once outside the terminal confusing signage as to which of the islands in the airport road one need to go to for the consolidated rental car facility's shuttle van and if you pick the wrong one it's almost impossible to get from one island to the other with a cart so I had to go back to the terminal first (I'd imagine it'd be the same for a wheelchair).

ontario-airport,/airport-reviews/ontario-airport,Ontario Airport customer review,S Koenig,United States,2012-05-27,A relatively quiet airport - there's even been talk of consolidating operations in its two main terminals into just one - and easy to access. Rental car facilities are consolidated in one location which is good (eg easy to shop among companies) but it does require use of a shuttle bus that can get crowded.

The return departure was less satisfactory. Because Delta's website would not let me check-in online I followed the instructions for airport check-in and arrived two hours in advance of the scheduled departure time (0410 for an 0610 departure). It was over an hour before any agents showed up to check me in by which time a long and irate queue had formed. All the other airlines were up running and checking pax in by 0430 but Delta was not and we were given no explanation for the delay. Of course by the time I was through security there was no time for any breakfast before the flight. And even if there had been there seemed to be only one airside place open serving breakfast and that had a queue to be seated. I would probably use ONT again as it is only 15 miles or so from where I stay regularly in California and the queues usually aren't anything like as bad as at LAX (especially to go through security) but this airport does seriously need to improve its customer service.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
ontario-airport,/airport-reviews/ontario-airport,Ontario Airport customer review,Derek Greenaway,United Kingdom,2010-10-03,Situated some 60 minutes from LAX direct with access to the 10 freeway quite a good option for travel into California. The airport was taken over by LAX a few years ago but they are starting to limit the flights there and promoting their main airport. The airport was built to provide up to 20 million passengers a year but in fact only about 5 million will probably use the site this year. The airport is pretty laid back with not bad facilities check in is easy and collection of baggage quite straight forward. Word is that the local municipal will take over the running in the next couple of years this would see an injection to make the facilities more appealing. The first improvement needs to be to eating facilities. Car hire is a couple of minutes shuttle away. On site long term packing at $9 a day seems a bit expensive.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I spoke to one woman who had already been standing in line for an hour. It was a weekend arrival but again only 6 desks were open out of the 30 or so in total they have there. Our flight was the second of the three to arrive that day from the UK and by the time this flight had started to line up a couple more desks had opened. The blame for that lies with the CBP so this is out of the hands of the airport management. Baggage was again placed on the floor of the carousels for people to find once immigration formalities were completed.

Aer Lingus flights depart from gate 28 and this departure area is not particularly pleasant. The range of shops cafes and bars is limited and in stark contrast to landside is quite expensive. Two glasses of average wine came to just under $20 for example. Very annoyingly only one set of restrooms in this area were working leading to queues! This is wholly unacceptable.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,Steve Koenig,NA,2009-01-13,"A modern relatively comfortable airport. Also extremely busy with many families starting or ending holidays there which adds to the chaos in the check-out lines (lots of overweight baggage on the way out and far too few attendants at least at Delta). After checking in getting your bags weighed etc. you need to take all of your bags to a security area to leave them off for scanning (agents said to just leave our bags and leave which seemed to defeat the purpose of security; also not clear what would prevent one from adding items to their luggage to get around weight restrictions). Security line was relativey quick for us but have heard it can be very busy. Plenty of options for shopping and dining but far fewer once you go through security and take at train to your individual terminal. Returning a rental car can be a bit confusing since some companies have their return facilities next to the terminals (need to walk) and some are off-airport. Worse when we stopped to top-off the tank of our rental car several blocks from the airport entrance and with no price signs outside the station we found only at the tank that gas cost TWICE as much as we had paid several miles away. The attendant explained that the higher price was due to it being ""on airport property."" Sounded like a rip-off (fortunately we were buying just a gallon).

The railway station is also within the terminal building easy to find and an excellent idea in winter. At departure safety queue is quite long the terminal certainly boasts the highest ratio of bars and snacks (with lots of customers even in the afternoon) compared to its size. Bad thing is that the number of available seats at the gates is ridiculously small and as our flight was delayed with very little information had to wait standing at the gate.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,D Rose,United Kingdom,2013-09-25,Terrible experience. On arrival at Majorca's airport (around 1am) from Gatwick the entire plane's luggage was nowhere to be seen for an hour and a half. When the bags did start coming round it still was very slow. During this time another flight arrived (from outside the UK) and miraculously they all had their luggage within 20 minutes. On our return we were checking in with a member of staff who was clearly incompetent. We were waiting for over an hour to do this and we were halfway down the queue who knows how long the people at the back took. At one point this member of staff threatened to walk off picking up her handbag and gesturing. Why this happened no one could understand. Upon getting onto the plane (straight from check-in due to the massive delays) there was no air- conditioning for half an hour. It became very hot and everyone had sweat dripping down their foreheads we complained to the cabin crew who promptly informed us this was due to Palma airport's engineering department since the ground power unit (or something like that) was out of action. Genuinely my continued disappointment with this airport in several key areas may well keep me from going to what is otherwise a fantastic holiday destination.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

We were quickly off the plane and into busses to get to the terminal. The queue for passports to be checked took around half an hour in sweltering heat. The time was not all the fault of the narrow corridor and small number of desks but wa snot helped by passengers from several arriving flights being disorganised not having passports ready etc. Baggage waiting in the hall. Returned on 25th for an evening flight home. Long queue again not helped by disorganised passengers soon sorted by staff opening more desks.

Vast areas are deserted and many of the outlets are closed. That all made for comparatively painless transits on a long weekend break. We still had long walks as easyJet flights were assigned to the far most end of area C but there were no queues at all for security. The only hold-up was at passport control on arrival: the control booth was beside our arrival gate and although there were two officers on duty they had to share one passport reader between them so it took 20 minutes or so for the passengers on our flight to be processed.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2010-10-10,"It's ironic that my last posting on PMI should have referred to wheelchair passengers because on this latest transit my wife had temporarily joined their ranks. The PMI pages on the AENA website were a useful guide to what type of assistance we could expect but when we actually landed at Palma my wife needed to stretch her legs after 2 hours of sitting and so we walked slowly from the gate instead of waiting for one of the 7 wheelchairs which would have been needed for our particular flight. For our return journey we did use the PRM facilities which didn't work quite as smoothly as those at LPL. None of the special call points around the airport seemed to be operative so we had to report to the information desk in the centre of the check-in area for assistance to be summoned. We then had a wait of perhaps 15 minutes before assistance arrived a form was filled in (with copy attached to the wheelchair) and we were then taken to the special security area for PRM passengers. There appeared to be a relay system after security but we were allowed to make our own way to the gate rather than wait for the next available ""pusher"". And yes we did have the gate number long before it appeared on the screens for everyone else. A delay to our flight resulted in a Belfast flight being allocated to our gate and more wheelchair handlers arrived ready to assist PRM passengers onto that flight so we quickly had to explain that we weren't going to Belfast! One of the handlers was good enough to ring through to ask for the new gate for the LPL flight and even to wheel my wife to it. When eventually our flight was called PRM passengers were the first to board with more handlers to wheel them along the airbridge to the door of the plane. Unfortunately my wife's ""pusher"" talked loudly on his mobile phone most of the time leaving only one hand free to steer the chair and failing to avoid the bumps! The only time when he came off his mobile phone was when he saw an associate some 20 yards away down the airbridge and had a shouted conversation with him. My wife was glad to board the plane! So though PMI has a clearly defined system for PRM passengers its operation was not as smooth or efficient as we had hoped though no one was actually unhelpful. We didn't see any of the motorised buggies which used to transport PRM passengers so efficiently in the past but perhaps they are reserved for passengers being taken to the more distant gates as on this occasion we flew into and out of area A. As for PMI itself it was less busy than we've seen it on some occasions and there were few queues....but then we bypassed the main security area.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2010-01-26,I know my name already appears several times for comments on PMI but a January transit provided a completely different experience from any of our previous visits. It was pretty quiet when we arrived on a Saturday morning after a long taxi round to area D though there was a queue at passport control as 2 flights ex-UK arrived almost simultaneously. Departing on a Tuesday morning though was positively eerie: the place was almost deserted and at security there were just 4 staff and 2 of us! I've never seen an airport so quiet. Yet even with only 3 flights departing during our 2 hours there we still had to wait a while before our gate number appeared on the screens. I can't understand the reluctance of airports to announce the designated gate well in advance because the staff who take wheelchair passengers to their departure points always seem to know which gate long before the number is displayed on the screens. Despite checking in online I even had to go to an easyJet desk (also deserted apart from the staff) simply to find out which area (D again) to head for after security.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-11-05,Surprised to find how busy Palma was midweek halfway through October (not even UK half term week). Both inward and outward flights involved bus transfers from/to remotish stands and through area A which was fairly crowded. We were told on our return flight that one runway was closed so perhaps all flights were concentrated to just part of the airport. The result was shorter walks but busier concourses. Perfunctory passport control on arrival long queues at security on departure though the queues did move reasonably quickly. Even so some people had to queue-jump presumably to avoid missing their flights. Also there were lots of flight calls for named passengers who had failed to board on time. PMI is a very big and busy airport and you need to allow for this if you want to reach your gate on schedule.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-04-08,Back at PMI again but as this was early April it was noticeably quieter than on our previous transits. Easyjet flights seem to be using area C again after being in area A for a while so it meant we were back to the extra long cross-airport hikes. No delays at passports in either direction and quite swiftly through security on the return journey. We didn't have to take our watches off this time but there were notices advising that certain types of footwear would have to be removed e.g. ladies full length boots. The only minor hiccup was that our return flight to Liverpool seemed to be omitted from some of the screens which could have been difficult for passengers who had checked in online. Quite a few of the food outlets were not yet open but otherwise the airport seemed to be functioning efficiently.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,NA,2008-09-11,"Much of what I said last year still applies to Palma in some cases even more so. My wife and I were on our own this time and travelling with hand luggage only yet both transits took approximately an hour. The chief problem on arrival was the passage through passport control: we joined a queue that stretched halfway along a main bridge/concourse and shuffled forwards slowly only to discover that the other equally large queue to our left had to filter into our queue at the end as there was only one man checking passports! Had he actually been doing any more than merely glancing at them it would have taken even longer still. Given the cursory nature of the check I did wonder what was the point of any check at all. (There was none at all on our departure in contrast to our experience last year.) The hold-up on the return journey was through security where the queues stretched back from a double and very long set of ""chicanes"" into the main concourse. Again it proved the case that the twin queues filtered into one (because of building alterations going on?) so transit through security took over half an hour. Security is still fairly strict with watches having to be removed but there are plenty of staff who seemed both efficient and pleasant. Even so transit at the height of the season (this was September) must be a nightmare. The metal detectors through which one has to pass also seem to go off fairly frequently: I set it off and the only possible reason was my spectacles which have never been a problem before. These delays apart Palma still seems to function fairly well: plenty of seats in the gate areas loads of shops etc (if you want them) though they don't seem particularly cheap and loos at regular intervals. You do have to walk long distances though and watch out for the electric ""buggies"" used to transport the less mobile. It was noticeable that there were frequent ""last calls"" for missing passengers so anyone departing from Palma needs to be aware of how long it can take from check-in to departure gate. Also if you do need to check in and have luggage the desks are on one floor and departures are on the floor above but the indoor route from the car park accesses the upper floor with limited lift availability to the floor below.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Everything seems to work well but there could be more lifts because access from car parking/car hire collection or return to check-in usually involves going up or down one floor with a laden trolley. Transfer of less mobile passengers is usually efficient but on our return journey from Palma to Liverpool yesterday the two elderly and less mobile members of our party were deposited at the wrong location and I had to start searching for them! Luckily I found them fairly quickly but it could have been a real problem. Security is thorough and slow moving: even wrist watches have to be removed. Passport control en route to departure gates was also slow yesterday: two queues 50 yards or more in length gradually combining into one with just one man to inspect the passports. All in all you need to allow plenty of time to make your way from check-in to departure gate: 30 -45 minutes at least.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Some of the older comments are indeed true. Some need explanation. It is true that the immigration for non-FP and non-EU-nationals takes a while but it is nothing compared to the ordeals you sometimes have to go through when arriving in the USA. (I know what I am talking about. I had to cahnge in LAX before going to PPT.) The staff at PPT is overall very friendly – even at night – there is a little band to welcome you with traditional Tahitian music. The airport employees do not usually grunt the problem simply is the following: If you arrive at Tahiti and you do not understand French you are as lost as a person coming to the UK or the USA with little or no knowledge of English would be. However when you leave PPT to return back home  you have to pass ONE security control (screening of all your luggage and your body) before you can check in your luggage then you have to leave the security area for some reason no one was able to explain. You pass through a door and are once again in the airport’s main hall. You then have to go through passport control and have to go through ANOTHER security control where they screen your carry-on luggage and your body again. After that you arrive in the departure lounge. The latter can be crowded if two planes depart at the same time but there is one more public waiting room on the second floor and that was surprisingly empty. Very few passengers seemed to go there because the signs only read Airport Lounge. When it comes to boarding before you leave the terminal to walk out to your plane there is a THIRD security check.

This is important as performance varies a lot in this huge and very heterogeneous airport (although never outstanding). 2G is dedicated to ""Schengen"" flights (to and from countries under the Schengen agreement no passport control) for the AF group. For commuting passengers it is important to know that the usual commuting nightmare at CDG is a the worst if one of your flights is from this terminal as it is far away from the other ones and the only access is a bus shuttle. When you fly from this terminal the positive point is that queues both at luggage drop off and at safety control are usually very short. Also positive is the fact that you walk to the (small max is 100 seaters) planes to board like in a small provincial airport. Now the negative points: I don't know who selected the food ""services"" in CDG. Except for 2 decent places in the whole 9 terminals it is always bad but the only one in 2G is just terrible and much too expensive for what it is eat a sandwich at the small stand before safety control if you can. The terminal itself is bland and as everywhere in CDG the seating is insufficient. They call the doors in theory 20 minutes before boarding but manage to be a little late making boarding more mess that it should be. The AF lounge is ridiculously small not very comfortable and with minimum amenities.

Those comments are absolutely true. This time I was vacationing in France so I figured that just arriving and departing from CDG could not be that bad right? Wrong. Arriving at Terminal 1 proved to be an absolute disaster. The facilities are operating at a multiple of their capacities with too few restrooms for example. The baggage area was clearly too small for even one or two arriving planes; people crowding around while waiting for their luggage created a jam where no one could get in or out or around. There was just not enough square footage for everyone and it is probably a dangerous situation. Even getting through the final customs check to embrace your loved ones was a crowded bottleneck involving a pushing/shoving battle just to somehow get through the maddening crowd. The parking and layout of the rest of the airport is confusing and illogical but we figured it out. Departing from Terminal 1 is even worse. Check in is okay but once you go through the first boarding pass check (ticketed passengers only) you take the escalator upstairs to see the real problem. You will stand in line for a minimum of one hour to get through the passport control. There were only two windows open for all departing passengers and those two officials took their time! I was up there two hours before my departure time and I nearly missed the plane. I have never just walked on a plane and had them shut the door but this is what happened. Everyone was in the same boat. The boarding announcements started while we were still in this non-moving line and everyone got very nervous. To run to the gate while they make the final boarding announcement and then realize you still need to go through security. It is all very unsettling. I would advise anyone who is using Terminal 1 to be upstairs three hours before your departure time.

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,Marc Guillemard,France,2013-04-21,"I have already written a number of reviews about CDG but never about terminal G and in CDG every terminal has its own peculiarities. It is dedicated to the ""Schengen"" flights in other words flights between European countries that have signed an agreement suppressing customs between them. If you are on foot or rental car you must take the internal railway in one of the other terminals. This looks very much like a small city airport where (if you are lucky) you walk to the plane (otherwise it's a bus sometimes for ridiculously small distances). The good thing is that the baggage check and safety control are most of the time very quick then you arrive in the single hall. Although there is a lot of seating and the rotation is quick (bigger planes here are A320s) it may be difficult to find a seat at certain times. Flights gates are normally given 20 minutes before boarding but quite often less so it can be a rush. Main concerns are the food : only one ""snack"" with insufficient seating where you can have some kind of fancy sandwiches and salads and I've never have one that was good even the very limited choice of cakes is bad.

paris-orly-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-orly-airport,Paris Orly Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,NA,2010-01-30,"I often use ""Orly-Ouest"" terminal for French domestic flights and my experience is quite mixed depending on which boarding halls I use. Hall 1 is mainly used for medium-sized destinations (with turboprop and Fokker aircraft) and is my preferred one - security checks are usually quick boarding area is bright with sufficient seating areas. Hall 2 is dedicated to LaNavette shuttle flights to Bordeaux Toulouse Marseille and Nice - at peak hours waiting time at security can be very long and the boarding area is cramped. Furthermore as LaNavette flights run every hour or even every 30 minutes it can become confusing and difficult to locate the right boarding gate! Hall 3 uses only departure gate 30 for domestic flights - no need to rush through security as tha gate has only toilets and no other facilities. Hall 4 is used rather for tourist destinations with larger aircraft (A320/A321 to Biarritz Toulon and Corsica) - the boarding area gets crowded rather rapidly and the small bar has rip-off prices. ORY is much closer to downtown Paris than CDG but is unfortunately missing a fast and reliable train connection. Avoid the Air France coaches and the OrlyVal train which charge rip-off prices - around €10 one-way. The OrlyBus shuttle is cheaper but is always overcrowded. My preferred alternative is to use the RER C suburb train: first catch a shuttle bus from the airport to the train station ""Pont de Rungis - Aeroport Orly""; from there a RER train run every 15-30 minutes to downtown Paris.

This time we landed at CDG coming from Hamburg. Everything seemed to work well and we went to a gateway (CDG is famous for having a high percentage of planes that load and unload by bus especially short and medium haul). The surprise came from the fact that we did a few meters on the gateway then were directed to use the stairs (very convenient with luggage not to speak of older people) down to where a bus was waiting for us.

There's even a viewing terrace for spectators. On transport links though it's often suggested people should take RER B to Antony and then the ORLYVAL shuttle train this is a rip-off option. RER B to Antony takes a while from Central Paris and is often is packed out taking commuters into the southern suburbs whilst the ORLYVAL is a rip off.

This is not the worst one but the architecture is all show and nothing practical therefore efficiency is difficult to obtain. The new thing when you fly Air France in economy is that you do everything yourself : print your boarding card but also your luggage label that you have to fix yourself to your suitcase (do not forget to take off and keep the receipt). When you have queued to leave your suitcase you go through passport and luggage control which is not the worst but not the best either. Try to get a sandwich and you find that the famous architect has completely underestimated the necessary seating space in the 2 small underground snack bars as well as the restrooms which could be cleaner. Then go to boarding gate and go through the most incredible experience CDG has created so far : we went down the stairs to a bus that drove 5 to 10 minutes in the airport to leave us not at the plane but at another gate!

Almost all reviews are very negative and I confirm these comments. The 2E terminal is overcrowded and to go to the gates one needs to take a train. The new building is OK but the check-in should take place in that new building. Arrival is a nightmare. It takes a long walk plus train to arrive at the customs. There is not a separation between ECG passport holders and other travellers. It takes a long time to pass customs. The airport found the solution; the delivery of the luggage is extremely slow.

Luckily I have an e-passport so I answered the 2 questions got the card and proceeded to the machine which takes your photo. I have done this before and it rejected me this time. I asked a man in a yellow coat what to do and he pointed to the massive queue and said abruptly ""join the queue"". I joined the Australian and New Zealand queue but was furious that with so many planes landing at the same time that Customs don't have the common sense to put more than 2 staff on the counters. When I finally got to the top of the queue (25 minutes later) the officer just laughed it off when I asked why the photo scanner rejected me when I had done it countless times before. Then it got worse. Now this is Perth a small city but the luggage carousel area was almost packed from wall to wall. A loudspeaker message kept saying ""Due to the high number of planes arriving at the same time there may be delays"". It took from the moment I got off my flight to get out to the taxi rank just on 60 minutes. Perth Airport get your act more professional.

Much of the problem relates to the fact that airport facilities are federally governed.

If US Airways and the airport authorities want to make the place more appealing then they need to get customs and TSA sorted. Customs - 3rd time to the US and the longest wait by far. We all complete ESTA but then stand in a long queue with people who seem to have a library of documents that need to be checked. When we eventually get to a desk we breeze through. TSA - are they providing a service or do they think they run the show. They are amongst the rudest people I have encountered and need to be told so and told to sharpen up their act and their ""customer"" skills. It would also help if they didn't randomly bark out orders and could speak in a language that at least approximates to English. I couldn't wait to leave the place - felt and treated like a criminal from the moment we landed. What a welcome to the US. As for the airport - no real complaints - enjoyed the food court and some decent shops to occupy the layover time. Although the kids tell me the toilets there (M&F) are a disgrace - I took their word for it and went elsewhere (have to say the toilets I used were very clean). I've read other posts complaining about the size of the airport - well it is a US hub and it is big  but no different to London Schiphol etc. My only gripe is the poor signage (what are you supposed to do with your bags for the onward flight where do you go). This needs improvement. Was a bit taken aback to find the baggage dumped on the floor (after a long wait for customs) so had to wander about looking for cases - and there was a lot to get around.

portland-airport,/airport-reviews/portland-airport,Portland Airport customer review,M Atkinson,United States,2014-09-28,"There's a lot of bad and good to say about Portland International Airport. First the good: PDX has a lot of restaurants and shops to visit. Prices aren't too outrageous and it feels organized and easy to navigate. I've read a lot of complaints about the TSA in Portland but I've experienced very few problems especially compared to other airports. The lines usually move fast and they don't make me remove all my liquids from my luggage which some airports do. Now the bad: the pick up for PDX is a mess. It doesn't need to be but it really is. First of all is the smoking problem. Everywhere along the pick up line are signs that say ""No Smoking."" There is a designated smoking area at the very start of the line where cars come in. However whenever I'm at PDX there are smokers standing all over the place in any location along pick up. I have yet to see PDX enforce them. The second issue with pick up is that there are signs posted everywhere asking people to not wait. That's why there is a very useful easy to find cellphone waiting area nearby. However often the pick up lane will be entirely blocked with parked cars who are still waiting for people to get out of baggage claim or off their flights. I've watched multiple cars sit in the same spot for over fifteen minutes while the drivers played on their cell phones. On many occasions I've picked up and been picked up at this airport and if anything I've always seen cars blocking the entire pick up line with no one in sight to pick up. There was no one to enforce the many signs stating this was illegal. It's been a problem several times which is why I'm finally writing about it. Weekends are the worst and I usually try to avoid that but sometimes that's impossible. Let's use common sense PDX! I can understand giving people a few minutes so the person being picked up can run to the car from wherever they were waiting outside and drop their luggage in the trunk but anything over five minutes to fifteen plus minutes is ridiculous.",NA,NA,NA,5,3,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

While it was nice to have the consolidated rental car facility near the terminal with no shuttle bus required finding the correct entrance was a bit confusing. As noted having a light rail station adjacent to the station is a definite plus (about 45 min to the area of downtown where we were staying) though we had so many bags we did not use it. Although I had read that taxis to downtown cost about $30 we were told at the airport they would cost about $45 and so used one of the shuttle vans costing about $14 per person (usable for downtown only). There are several hotels and shopping malls near the airport. I agree that the road immediately in front of the terminal is crowded and chaotic.

I recently saw a TSA agent grab the lapel of a jacket worn by a Mexican woman who did not speak English and yell at her to take it off. I saw another TSA agent insist on taking away a walker from an elderly woman who obviously needed it to pass it through the X-ray machine. One TSA agent grabbed the laptop in my hands as I was putting it into a plastic bin for screening. I held onto it and he was incensed.

It took less than 10 minutes from plane seat to arrivals hall. Return (only flight again) was a little bit worse. Quick check in and security control pleasant enough cafe and two shops with local produce and the best of all- the outdoors observation area at the top of the waiting hall. What spoiled the perfect arrival/departure? As per usual ""Europe's largest low cost airline"" started announcing boarding despite the arriving flight was not even near the Croatian airspace. Me and my partner decided against standing in the queue until at least arriving plane was in our sight but this was prevented by member of staff shouting at us (at the observation deck) that we should proceed through the boarding gate (reminder - inbound flight did not arrive for another 20 minutes).

Bit of a shock on arrival but should be fabulous when finished. Befitting a gorgeous island such as Rarotonga. Previously RAR didn't separate Arrivals and departures - bit of a problem for the once weekly flight to/from LA. No airbridges in the new terminal planned from the renderings I could see. So still a bit of a problem to/ from aircraft when a tropical downpour arrives as it want to do. Reason being this is such a tiny aerodrome with short runway of approx 2300m ( just enough for a 777). Accordingly turnaround and parking area for aircraft precludes a fixed airbridge. New departure area will still have the outside garden area so you can have one last look over the airfield to the beautiful mountain peaks before boarding. On another note duty free no longer the stupendous bargain it once was. Still pretty good compared to many big airports around the world.

In the departure hall they have approximately ten check-in counters which seemed quite enough for a Sunday afternoon. The ""Schengen"" departure lounge after passing the security check however is hardly adequate. There were only two departures at that time an ATR 72 (70 seats) to Munich and a Boeing 737-500 (120 seats) to Luxemburg.

Getting the bus into the city was a bit chaotic (ticket offices just seemed to close at random) but once on the bus it was OK and cheap. Departing was another matter. I caught the train from Termini, it is a bit faster but not really worth the extra expense and it's a long walk from the station to T1. The self-service check-in did not work and the queue for desks was very long indeed, a nice member of staff suggested that with hand baggage I should go through security and act as a transfer passenger which worked except they could not allocate me a seat. The gate was being used for another flight and as soon as that finished boarding staff disappeared. The replacement appeared with about 30 minutes to departure and several of us waiting to be allocated seats. He was very distracted, dealing with one person and then walking away, the same with boarding, he would check half a dozen on and then do something else (to be fair he was alone but it was very inefficient and frustrating). We were boarded on a bus, there appeared to be only one so we had to wait while it went and came back. Once on board we waited for 10 minutes while nothing happened, on a very hot day.

The staff are rude, impolite and arrogant. They seem to go out of their way to avoid eye contact and therefore having to respond to any questions. We arrived with what we thought was ample time to make a connection. Once we had our bags we proceeded to the connecting airline bag drop. We had already checked in on line. This turned out to be of no value time wise. The woman at the bag drop sat and chatted with a colleague while the queue grew. She did nothing. When she finally opened up her desk we had lost half an hour. She told us we were over weight on one bag. It had been underweight on the flight we had just come in on. We took out one jacked which made the difference. Then she told us we had to hurry, our departure gate was about to close. We rushed to our departure gate only to find our flight was actually delayed for an hour. When that gate opened, there were two people at two check in desks. These two chatted and laughed with a third who subsequently left. They carried on with their conversation while the crowd grew and fumed. There was no order, no lines. The guy, officious at best, started to take the 'fast track' passengers first. This took about 20 minutes before they began to accept the rest of the passengers. At the moment I am at Heathrow.

No queuing for check-in and security was managed efficiently with a minimal wait. Passed straight through one of the automated gates for EU passports again with no delay. After T3 passport control there are many more shops to pass the time and good eating facilities (although avoid Venchi with it's exceptionally rude staff) not many seats though although you will find some near the 'H' gates at the far end and again in the 'G' area once you have transitioned via people mover. If your flight leaves from the 'G' gates it is a good idea to take the people mover about an hour before departure as there is more seating there and additional shops to explore.

After that easy experience what follows it is hysterically bad. Check-in in Terminal C at least is a horrendous experience due to the abysmal layout of the check in areas - I can only assume they were designed by someone who never uses airports or who has severe masochistic tendencies. For some reason the check in desks are split into ""zones"" - each zone occupies a square with an area of approximately 50 metres square with approximately 12 check in desks in the square 6 either side of the square - as a result of this the queues for each desk meet in the middle in a horrendous muddle of confusion. To add to this the passport/security line also runs through the middle of all of this! The result therefore is that you have something like 13 different queues in a very small area working in 3 different directions - most passengers with heavy luggage often with children running around and screaming. If like me you are trying to get to a check-in desk near the back of this area you will find that you literally have to elbow your way through a seething mass of grumpy humanity and baggage to get to it - and then trying to find the end of your own queue is another matter -in the end I had to shout out loudly for people going to my destination to identify themselves so that I could join the correct queue. Once through all this the passport/security line is reasonably fast when compared to many airports (10 mins) although I would say that the actual inspections are a little on the cursory side. Airside the airport is at least a little more spacious although the airport authorities have not deemed it necessary to fill this space with useful furniture such as adequate seating. Proceeding to the gate to board in plenty of time I was amazed to see that the gate was being used to board 3 other flights before mine - although my plane was sitting waiting on the tarmac we simply could not get to it as the gate was being used for these other flights - this tells me that this airport simply does not have adequate capacity to deal with the volume of flights going through it - and this was on a Wednesday early afternoon not exactly peak time.

The Mormon shuttle will take anyone of any religion to downtown and collect them later in the day and take them back to the airport free of charge. The only catch is you have to do a tour of the Temple Square complex which takes about 40 minutes and involves being guided by two young female missionaries. This tour is excellent but will involve your own religious beliefs being inquired about which I didn't mind but others may want to consider this. Airport itself is only 15 minutes from downtown unlike in most cities where it is some distance away. Airport had good stores albeit rather small. TSA staff were genuinely charming and helpful.

salt-lake-city-airport,/airport-reviews/salt-lake-city-airport,Salt Lake City Airport customer review,J Jensen,NA,2010-07-13,The airport itself is a kick back to the 1960s or 70s but recently is has been announced that SLC is going to bulldoze everything and start over. The airport has gotten more restaurants inside of security. Weather delays can be bad during or after a major storm but general not as bad as say Denver International. My only real complaint is that the airport is a major hub for Delta Air Lines not one of my favorites. Delta crams a lot of gates together and at times not enough seats for people waiting. The airport was designed to handle around 12 million passengers a year and it handles around 23-25 million a year. Lets hope for a modern well lit terminal.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

First the ""smoking rooms"" is SLC the last airport to still have these? Every place else I regularly fly through relegates it to outside. The ventilation is horrible and the gate next to the smoking room stunk. Second is the cramped seating at the end of the concourses. At the end of the C concourse there are 8 gates with insufficient seating. At the time I was waiting to depart on a 737 there were 2 767s waiting to board an MD-80 a 757 arriving and two other 737s. What a mess! One last peeve but not unique to SLC is the omnipresence of the CNN Airport Network. I'll give a gold star to the first airport that opens a CNN-free zone.

The terminals (especially the new one that houses Virgin America and the International one) are very nice though the restaurants are fairly pricey. The staff are helpful but a little no- nonsense which can be irritating. Commuting is a breeze thanks to being located right off the highway and the metro. Customs is done without hassle. On the downside the process of checking in and getting through security can be abysmal at the wrong time the majority of flights are United and flights are often slightly delayed because of fog.

While arrival was easy departure was a bit of a pain for us due to the complete absence of baggage carts on the arrivals level either at the curb or inside. No skycaps except in the baggage claim area. And no apparent curbside check-in facility. This was a big factor since you have to first take your bags to a Department of Agriculture inspection area to be scanned then take them to your airline's check-in counter then take them to the x-ray security station. Line for TSA security was relatively short. Selection of eateries inside security was fine. Note to airport authorities: put some darn carts at the curb on the arrivals area!

Airside services are ok for the Caribbean but there is little available space for seating in the waiting lounges. Clearing US customs here is easy as it is mostly small planes feeding in passengers.

Overall I would it fair to good. Arriving international is usually ok as other travellers noted: if you hold a Canadian American Australian or Mexican passport you will have to pay the entry fee in a different line before proceeding to immigration. Lines are generally fast in the morning but can be slow in the afternoon. Immigration and customs officials are usually relaxed with the exception of plant/animal goods. If you are unfamiliar with Santiago I would recommend getting a taxi just before you exit the baggage claim area. Departing can be a little different. Depending on when you depart you can expect to wait. Check-in will be long in the early weekday morning and sometimes in the afternoon. If you are departing internationally you will again have to go through immigration. Again they are quick but it can take 20 min. If you are departing domestic security is lax but can be very long on weekday mornings due to high volume. International gate side has a decent selection of restaurants and shopping although expensive. Domestic side has a few stores and not as many places to eat. Overall the airport is clean and bright.

Airport at least apart from T3 is older - not the best facilities. Poor selection of eateries especially once you pass security. Connecting from an international to domestic flight you really need to find your own way to the transit counter (not easy to find). As with all Brazilian airports when connecting from domestic to international even if your bags are transferred you need to leave the security area and check-in with your international airline. Contrary to what one earlier review states there are lots of ATMs in the airport. Signs in English and attendants speaking English are not as common as they should be but they are definitely present. There is Wi-Fi it appears you need to register and pay for it. I didn't try. No problems in Immigration baggage pick-up or customs. The fact that the airline I used in T2 (Delta) is apparently not among those international airlines moving to T3 saddens me. I used T1 for Gol domestic flights.

GRU is the worst IMHO. The baggage claim area has go to be one of the worst-configured I've seen: little space between baggage carousels and that made worse by the fact that baggage carts (at least they're free) are stacked between the carousels. When crowds jam around a carousel after a large plane arrives chaos can ensue. If it's a hot day the lack of effective air conditioning makes things worse (what this will be like during the World Cup I don't know). After Customs we stood in a long line to check our bags for a connecting domestic flight. Then went upstairs through security (that was quick) and downstairs to a crowded departure gate serving two flights. Passengers were told to get on one of two buses depending on their destination.

GRU is not dirty just dingy and dark. It does have elevators! But I agree food prices are very high especially for snacks (the Viena churrascaria is expensive but not as overpriced as a pao de queijo and a beer) queues are long (get here 3h before your flight) and unannounced gate changes make it hard to relax (check screens at boarding time and regularly afterwards if your flight is delayed). I think the comments here are by and large fair. GRU is not somewhere you would choose to spend time but its not a bad place just struggling to cope with more people than it was built for and showing its age. GRU is a difficult airport to use if you speak no Portuguese. But whatever you do keep smiling stay positive and calm and staff will warm to you and try to help you.

seattle-airport,/airport-reviews/seattle-airport,Seattle Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2014-07-20,It may reduce congestion but I still don't like the fact that shuttle buses and taxis leave you out in the parking structure across from the terminals and you must go up one floor by elevator then cross a skybridge then descend again. Easy enough if you are without luggage or have just hand luggage but if you are using a cart ($5 of course) it can take a while. Other than that the airport will large is relatively easy to navigate and clean. In most cases it's as quick to walk as to take the airport trains unless you're going to Terminal S (satellite terminal) used by some but not all Delta flights. Decent array of eateries in the airport. To get to the consolidated rental car terminal you must take a shuttle bus (definitely too far to walk).

seattle-airport,/airport-reviews/seattle-airport,Seattle Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2013-11-18,In general a modern clean comfortable airport. My biggest complaint is the fact that to get from the baggage claim area to the courtesy buses for hotels etc. (except for the shuttle bus to the consolidated rental car facility) or from the courtesy buses to the check-in area you have to go up an elevator or escalators cross a sky bridge then descend another elevator. The shuttles stop on the third level of the parking structure. No big deal unless you have lots of bags. If you're departing and are staying at an airport hotel you can ask the hotel to call the Port Authority for permission to drop you off at the curb at the arrivals level (note: permission must be asked maybe half an hour in advance and the permission applies only to those on the request so if others are on the bus they first go to the regular drop-off area and then the bus circles again to drop you off). The area for the courtesy buses is for a variety of such shuttles: those for both parking lots (public and commercial) and hotels. While there are signs showing where each type of bus stops (in 2-3 locations) they tend to group together (with those for commercial parking lots seemingly especially numerous) and you have to be alert and while standing on the curb may have to flag down the shuttle you want especially if it's for a hotel.

This meant I used the airport about 6 times in a week using different terminals so feel well placed to rate it. Immigration lines on arrival were pretty long and immigration officials were characteristically prickly. Airport transfer to downtown via shuttle buses was cheap ($12.50 one way) and efficient. Wi-fi in the airport is completely free and a good connection. Tram connects all the terminals and airport is well sign posted. Trams connecting terminals leave every two minutes and often have announcements in mutiple languages. Restaurants and gift shops either side of security with excellent choice and high quality offered. The only let down is the S terminal.

The proximity of the light rail station allowing quick and inexpensive access to downtown Seattle is a definite plus (it is located at the far end of the northern parking garage - best to ask for directions). Getting to the airport terminal to check-in can be confusing. Hotel and other courtesy vans let out passengers not next to the terminal but across the access road next to the parking garage. I saw no crosswalks across that road. To get to the main terminal you need to get to one of the elevators in the parking garages to take you to a skywalk (bridge) over the access road to the terminal then find a second elevator to go up to the departures level. We almost rented one of the baggage carts in the parking garage but were glad we used a skycap due to the confusing route to our check-in counter. There seemed to be a dearth of rest rooms in the check-in areas. As noted a bit of a walk to the security line (with special entrance for First Class passengers) then down 2 (more?) escalators to get to the train to the ""S"" terminal for our flight.

For $2.50 I can get from the airport to less than a block away from my corporate office. And for an additional $6.90 I can ride the ferry over to Bainbridge to meet up with my parents. (The ferry is free heading back into Seattle.) I generally fly Virgin America which seems to be assigned gates in Siberia. Rumor has it there are more dining choices at the food court which is good since pick’ins are pretty slim down by the low number gates.

The airport also has many areas for relaxing too with many sleeping chairs and complimentary showers along with saunas. Aviation enthusiasts can spot departing and arriving planes from both runways located at either end of the terminal.

Rebuilt for the 1992 Expo (along with much of Seville) the airport is spacious and well- functioning with a huge and airy departures hall. Arrivals is pretty spartan but baggage was delivered swiftly (even though several suitcases fell off the conveyor belt at the first ‘bend’). Taxis are plentiful and cost a fixed rate to the city centre (currently €24). Airport buses also run regularly to/from the city centre picking up in Nervion and Santa Justa station and cost a mere €2 – allow plenty of time on the return journey as traffic can be a nightmare. Beware also that the bus drops off at ground level and you will need to carry your luggage up two flights of stairs or wait ages for one of two lifts. Swift check-in with Ryanair more through luck than organisation. Security ng goods at usual inflated prices and plenty of (very hard!) seating to wait for your flight. Once through into the departure lounges there is soft seating but the only facilities here are toilets and vending machines. There is a quiet café seating area behind the non-functioning departures board (don’t worry there are also monitors that do work) which has good views of the runways to while away the hours.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It is big well connected to the city (Maglev train 10min metro 45min tax 50min bus 1hr) and in my opinion it has the potential to reach the level of other Asian hubs like Hong Kong or Singapore. Queuing time for passport controls (especially for departures as arrivals seem to be much better) could be reduced and more facilities (restaurants bars shops) could be added to the departure hall (of both T1 and T2). Even smaller domestic airports like Chengdu or Hangzhou are better equipped from this point of view. The main problem however is the duty free area: bars/restaurants are expensive and of average quality shops are few and look all the same. An international airport should a better variety (see Shanghai Hongqiao Airport for example). Last but not least if the airport really aims to become a regional hub procedures for national/international transfers should be streamlined and all dedicated staff should be fluent in English.

The check in agent was friendly and the airport police stationed at the entrance of the departure hall was friendly too, it made me feel really welcomed. Being an aviation enthusiast, I decided to do some plane spotting airside. I headed down to Terminal 3, hoping to photograph a Qatar Airways A350. I set up my tripod, and start taking a few shots of it. A tourist was intrigued by my camera and tripod, hence we both started chatting. As the tourist left for his flight, a fellow police officer, I saw who was watching me the whole time, walked up to me and told me off that I could not spot there. He warned me rudely that my camera could be confiscated and I could be jailed. I asked him the reason why, and he told me he was not sure but still insisted I leave that place immediately. That ruined my mood in the departure hall. I headed back to Terminal 1 as there was not much at Terminal 3. Since Changi does not offer plane spotters like me to openly go into gates and spot planes, I decided to take photos of the screens at each gate. In the process, several gate officers rudely shouted at me not to take the contents inside the gate and I felt terrified each time they do. I gave up on plane spotting in the airside, sitting near my departure gate waiting for my gate to open. Being a passenger and a Singaporean departing out of my home airport, I was extremely disappointed with the service of the Airport police. Instead, I felt they could have done better by not being so harsh. Despite all that, I still believe that Changi Airport is a brilliant airport, with excellent wifi service and signs helping passengers to get to their gate smoothly.",Departure Only,12-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,6,4,5,4,NA,5,4,5,NA,1

Small queue at immigration, bags waiting on the belt. No waiting for a taxi. For the first time in many years however there was a customs inspection via xray. But thru in less than a minute. Some pax were being searched. T3 early morning departure involved a short wait in a SQ check in queue but straight thru emigration. Excellent but quite expensive food choices, free and fast wifi, very clean rest rooms, plenty of flight info boards, travelators to the more distant gates, no hassles at gate security, comfortable seating in gate lounges. boarding well organized. T2 late afternoon departure fine as well with no hold up checking in or at emigration. Less food choices than T3 and terminal is showing its age a little. But it is still clean and spacious. gate security and gate lounges fine. free wifi. T2 mid afternoon arrival involved a full on security check in the concourse. It was a little chaotic. Instructions prior to putting hand luggage on the belt and pax walking thru the scanner were contradicted by the personnel on the 'other side' which involved many pax having to go back and repeat the process. If they are going to do this they need to get their act together. Ipads are not lap tops! Again no queue at immigration and a short wait for bags.

singapore-changi-airport,/airport-reviews/singapore-changi-airport,Singapore Changi Airport customer review,P Metcalf,Australia,2014-10-13,This airport was confusing as it displayed the best and worst of what an airport can be all in one! Arrived Terminal 2 toilets clean but mostly squat toilets! There was 1 western toilet in each block which was always full as no-one wanted to use the squat toilets I found this problem throughout the airport which was very surprising as I've traveled extensively in Asia and never seen this at an airport before. Passport control took over an hour by which time the baggage was left on carousel but no airline sign was on there so we had to ask. Airport looks great very impressive until we noticed the lack of basic seating. Most restaurants closed about 10pm so it was too late for us. They had 24 hour food courts which were great only problem is they didn't accept card. The cash machines nearby would only let us draw out 100SGD so didn't want to be left with all that money for a cheap meal. The airport lacked signposts and was hard to navigate we walked around to different terminals and others were having the same problem. They had wifi but it was different in each area so you had to request a code and find the information desk each time! Very inconvenient as sms codes didn't work. Had lots of problems speaking to staff in English which was surprising for a country where its the official language. I was very disappointed in this airport its like they are in a race to build more gimmicky things and are too concerned by the look of the airport to overlook basic things like restaurants accepting credit cards lack of seating and toilets fast passport control! It is a very impressive airport on the surface but basic airport things are just lacking!,NA,NA,NA,4,1,5,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

It's a huge terminal with many shops and restaurants and I can't imagine passengers getting too bored inside. However its problem is that it's really too big and sprawls to nowhere. Walking to Gate A21 completely tired me out. The most ridiculous thing is water. They sell bottled water after passing immigration but they don't let you bring the water bought into the gate. Why allow those shops to sell them if they aren't eventually allowed in? In the end I was forced to drink the whole bottle before entering the gate.

Terminal 3 was very clean and modern with lots of duty free shops and we also visited Terminal 2 (looking a bit dated) to see the M&Ms Concept Store.

The spaces have ample natural light gardens along with affordable shops and activities while waiting. Changi is not a world-beating architectural masterpiece but it is a nice place to spend time. It provides a warm and inviting ambience that many more elaborate terminal designs (like Kansai and Hong Kong) fail to offer with their expansive hard surfaces and artificial materials. Now that the shabby budget terminal has been closed even LCC users can enjoy the fine facilities.

The bad thing is they don't tell you this in the cafes / shops therefore you have to abandon your bottles at the gate. I purchased two 500ml bottles of water $4 in total both still sealed yet they tried to take them off me. I therefore opened them both drank them in front of them and gave them the empties.

split-airport,/airport-reviews/split-airport,Split Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,NA,2006-07-23,Split Airport on a Saturday in mid-summer is obviously a different experience than reported by your previous correspondent. It is simply overstretched by the sheer volume of flights. Arriving wasn't too bad though we did have to queue for several minutes to get out of the baggage reclaim into the arrivals hall. Departing was awful. We had to queue to get into the terminal building itself and then join any check- in queue once we were inside as the only airline which seems to have a separate designated check-in desk is Easyjet. For all the others it is a free-for-all. It took us about 45 minutes to reach the head of our particular queue then we had to fight our way back through the queue behind us and across the hall to access Security and Departures. Security itself was fairly swift and efficient but upstairs in the Departures lounge itself there was more congestion with queues for everything including the loos (it took our daughter 20 minutes at least to pay a visit!). We were lucky: we managed to find two seats for the three of us to share while we waited for our flight to be called. From what we could see the airport itself could be as congenial as your other correspondent suggested but it is not really equipped for Saturday summer schedules. (There seem to be far fewer flights in the week - we stayed on an island across from the airport - so I'd advise prospective visitors to try to avoid flying into or out of Split at the weekend).,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Bags arrive within 5-10 minutes after arrival and for domestic flights you are out in 15min with bags and perhaps 5-10 minutes without. There is a taxi stand where you can buy your coupon and there is a fixed price depending on where you go. Since KL taxi drivers are notorious for not switching on the meter this solution is the best. They renovated Subang airport and it is very modern and nice to use. Subang is very close to downtown and unless you arrive during rush hour you can be anywhere in KL within 15-40 minutes.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,N Ramsay,Australia,2015-06-28,We are regular users of T1 and can sympathize with a lot of the previous comments here. But on this last trip all was well. An 8am departure saw us check in and thru emigration and security without any delays. The border patrol guy even had time for a chat. Have never seen the airport so deserted. Toilets airside were clean and most of the food places were open. Arrival back in the early evening was the same story. Of course my passport wouldn't scan (it seldom does) but went straight thru the manual check without delay. My partner (American passport) went thru the automated system without problems. Luggage was soon available and customs/quarantine was also quick. Landing to airport hotel room in 40 mins.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,S White,Australia,2015-04-08,Passengers off just one A380 queued up nearly back to the embarkation point trying to navigate through to the arrivals hall - poor signage and few instructions. No staff were coming through the queue and directing tired and frustrated passengers down to the numerous kiosks positioned by the smartgates - so no-one knew they could form different lines. Half of the kiosks seemed to reject passports which shouldn't have been rejected so it took a number of attempts again leaving painful queues. If you could successfully get the kiosk to work the smartgate then rejected some of the tickets. After that to be faced with seemingly surly and rude customs officers and being pushed into ever decreasing space which took forever to exit through the 'nothing to declare' channel made for a truly wonderful experience!

Just returned from an overseas visit to Tokyo Hong Kong and Bangkok. Arriving back in Sydney on March 3 was by far the most excruciatingly painful difficult third world airport experience of the trip. There was nothing positive about the experience. The arrivals hall infrastructure is completely inadequate with thousands of arriving passengers queued up well back into the terminal. Half of the kiosks weren't working with the ones that were working with long painful queues. If you could successfully get the kiosk to work (I couldn't necessitating a 60 minute wait in a service queue) it was likely the smartgate wouldn't take the ticket. Overwhelmed customs agents were short tempered screaming at incoming visitors. The temperature level was high. Baggage delivery was just as bad. And of course I missed by domestic connection as a result of the two hours it took me to get through. What a waste of time money and energy. You call this a world class international airport?

Unimpressed though that there were no signs up saying that airport train was only going to central and that you then needed to take a bus to your final station if we'd know that we'd have taken a taxi straight to hotel. Different story though when flying out to NZ. Taxi dropped us off near Air NZ check in desks so that part was a breeze then headed through to the horror of passport control and security. I'll never moan about queuing in the UK/US again after what we faced here 12 lanes of snaking back and forth to get through passport control (4 lanes) and security (7 lanes).

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,P Jenkins,Australia,2013-05-12,I used SYD last month for flights to and from the U.S. As a departure airport Sydney International is an airport of contrasts. For example the nice leather lounges with the recharging stations and the high ceiling in the central space feels just great. However as you near your gate the ceiling becomes really low and you will find many people just standing around because the seating is far from adequate given the number of passengers. The free wifi has a fairly strong signal throughout the terminal. As an arrival airport the new SmartGate system definitely speeds up the immigration part of the process. After that it all becomes a bit more interesting. The problem seems to be that there is not enough floor space between the end of the baggage claim carousels and the customs area. When a couple of jumbos are on the ground there are long lines wrapped all along the backside of the baggage claim area. To combat the confusion I looked for the least busy carousel and then picked a customs line close to it. That strategy paid off though it took some creative weaving around other passengers and walking the long way around nearly all of the carousels to make it happen. It was all worth it in the end. I was on my Route 400 bus outside an hour and fifteen minutes after my plane's arrival. The bottom line: Sydney is one busy airport that services a large percentage of Australia's 20 million people. Be prepared to wait and go with the flow. What the airport may lack in affordable parking it more than makes up for in its CityRail train station downstairs and even handier bus stops upstairs.,NA,NA,NA,6,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,Ian Mackay,Australia,2013-03-05,I use Sydney on a regular basis and I like the airport but it does have its drawbacks. I have to mention the staff Check in and passport staff have always been friendly and helpful however that cant be said for the security staff who always are surly and unhelpful. International departures can get crowded and its not helped by a needless shopping area. There's far too many of them and they are all of the expensive variety including the food outlets. Once checked in you head for security and line up via a maze of lanes that are roped off. Fine when its busy but when its quiet why they don't provide a more direct route to the desks is beyond me. Once through security you head through yet more expensive shops to the gates. Your departure gate will dictate how much walking you have to do. If you need food or drinks be prepared because it is expensive. International arrivals is much the same but in reverse. You head through a shopping complex to reach passport control via another roped off maze and then onto the baggage hall. I've always been lucky and got my bags swiftly. Arrivals hall is always busy and its not helped by more shops! Depending on your destination will dictate what happens next. Buses / taxis etc are within easy reach and the hall is underneath International departures. If you have arrived off an International flight and want domestic its not so easy as the domestic terminals are the other side of the airport. These can be reached in a variety of ways and this is where Sydney lets itself down (other than the shops!). There is a train that you pay for that takes two minutes but you have to walk the length of the terminal and down a set of escalators because of where the arrival exit has been placed. You can also get a bus which are often crowded. The third option is a taxi. Whatever option you choose try and give yourself plenty of time it gets very busy at peak times. I should also mention that the approaches to the airport like the rest of Sydney can get very busy so also leave yourself plenty of time. In summary I like Sydney but there's far to many shops and arrivals especially if you need to transfer could definitely be improved. Walking the length of the terminal to get to the bus / train is not ideal - maybe they designed it that way to get you to walk past the shops!,NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,J Rose,United States,2011-05-17,Recently flew domestically into SYD and had to transfer to an overseas flight. It is inconceivable to me that going from one terminal to another could be so inefficient and costly. There is no tram that runs between domestic and international terminals. Option #1 is a shuttle bus (called T Bus) that runs every 30 minutes (and not on a schedule). Passengers were queued up for this service and it isn't even free - there is a A$5.50 charge for what amounts to an inferior unreliable service. Option #2 is a city train (called Airport link) which also charges A$5 for transport between terminals. Option #3 is a taxi which we chose because of a reasonably tight connection. Fare was A$15 and after generous tip cost me A$20. I cannot think of another major airport in the world that does not offer high quality reliable comfortable free transport between terminals.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,C Tudehope,Australia,2011-04-03,Never had issues in the domestic terminals (T2 and T3). Both are very easy to use and get around with plenty of facilities and lounges to keep one busy should there be a flight delay (given how busy it gets there is potential for this to occur). In particular the food court in T2 (Virgin Blue Jetstar and regional NSW flights) has a great range of outlets with good views of planes moving around. For aircraft aficionados there are plenty of spots throughout this terminal for viewing planes taking off and landing. T3 is pleasant and is open throughout. It's easy to travel through yet doesn't have the same range of shops as T2. Staff are friendly and there is an interesting Qantas Heritage Museum located near Gate 14. Transfers between these terminals is easy through a subway that also goes to the railway station. T1 the international terminal has just been refurbished and is rather pleasant with a large range of shops to rival other airports worldwide. Going through customs etc. to leave the country is often a speedy process with queues minimal. However re-entering the country is a lot more difficult with queues for customs taking a while baggage taking its time to arrive on the carousel and immigration taking a while to screen everyone and their respective goods. I understand that they're trying to be scrupulous with who and what to allow in the country but surely there must be some way to speed up the process. A word of advice is to not arrive on a flight between 5am and 9am when most large long-haul aircraft arrive meaning particularly long queues for all arriving passengers. In general however it's an easy airport to use with all facilities that one could need.

The place is dirty dusty and has no soul. Its just like a temporary bus station. The immigration process was perhaps the best in the world. There was no queue and the immigration officers were extremely friendly and approachable. The luggage as usual didn't come out quick enough considering how empty the airport was. Then its a hassle to get to the taxi rank – again it had the feeling of a temporary bus station rather than an international airport at a capital city. Leaving the airport was another experience. I assume that the check-in area has been refurbished and the lighting was great. It might have difficulty dealing with large quantity of passenger though as the luggage belt at the check in area wasn't properly designed. After checking in I proceed to the immigration on the second floor. Again the wall and ceiling was covered by plastic for the renovation. Immigration and security again was no hassle.

tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,R Buaron,Vietnam,2012-10-10,Worst Airport ever. Our plane arrived in TAS at around 0345am from BKK the shuttle took us to the wrong building with what looked like a Transit building full of people lying on the floor. The people did not know what to do with us and we asked to be taken to the arrivals - a bus came in and took us to the right building. Got in the building - the Visa on Arrival person charged us more than what we should have paid for our visas (no receipts) and instead of the double entry which was on my LOI he put in single entry. I made him correct it. But he forgot to sign it which spelt trouble when I got back to Tashkent from Almaty. Nightmare did not stop there. 6 immigration booths in a 30 square meter area and with loads of people jostling around. Uzbeks don't know how to queue! Got pass it. And even when you are in the Green Zone everything should be declared including your iphone camera etc. This involves two back to back pages of customs declaration and 1.5 hours queue at the customs.

They now have more passport control personnel and actually have luggage carts though you need to fight for one. Do not entertain any ideas of ground staff honouring priority luggage tags or any priority boarding from elite members. Departing passengers keep an eye out for last minute gate changes. Double check luggage to make sure staff have tagged the destination correctly. This past trip I caught that they had indicated my bags be sent to SOF instead of SFO.

tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,G Hu,United States,2010-06-10,Arrival was pretty problem-free arriving at 9pm on the flight from Seoul with Asiana. Make sure your are among the first off the plane and run do not walk to the passport control line. Make sure you have TWO copies of the customs form filled out completely. Then make sure you prevent people from cutting in front of you in the x-ray line after baggage claim. Still you may be delayed as the staff seem to wave locals on in front of you. Departure was crazy - gates are vaguely marked and flights are announced via a monitor. When the flight is announced you are herded into a cramped hallway with people from at least 3 other flights all waiting to board a bus. It was a pity since we could see our plane less than 300 yards away! We had to wait in the cramped hallway as airport staff screamed flight numbers and destinations and people squeezed past others to the bus.

tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,K Fridlington,United Kingdom,2009-11-05,It does take time to get into the country especially if a large tour group gets to the immigration check first. Local people get a kind of priority however the officials seem to be looking at reasons to stop as many as they can. Anyway remember to complete your arrival card fully and complete every section. The first control point examines your passport and visa you collect luggage and then go through a second check where they examine and stamp your arrival card. Leaving the country is similar again you need to complete another card to present to the security at passport control who ask about money. Again I was expecting the worse however we had no issues or problems it helps to smile and be polite. After the passport check there are very limited facilities the duty free shops only take euros dollars or UK pounds the prices are very expensive and the choices are limited.

Whether it is the inexplicable wait for luggage when you are on the only flight arriving or the crazy check- in/customs bureaucracy or the only bar in the departure area that does not accept local currency there is always something to cause problems. jumping queues seems to be a birth right for some of the locals. If an Uzbek lady runs past you in the queue for customs clearance shouting 'Istanbul Istanbul' don't be fooled. She wants you to think she is late for a flight.

tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,Mark Bickerton,NA,2006-02-11,Tashkent airport is quite modern in design but tries hard to retain a flavour of Soviet bureaucracy in its overall service. I have been asked for bribes by check-in staff at least three times and one time had to spend 10 mins trying to find a member of staff so I could check in (the desk said 'Check in Open'). When I located someone I was eventually told there was no seat for me (which means 'give me money and there will be') so I had to argue with him to get my confirmed seat. There is not much to do at this airport; the gate cafe is rubbish and only accepts US Dollars. If you are stuck there because of a delay try to get out of the airport and go to a nearby choykhana or shashlik place.

tbilisi-airport,/airport-reviews/tbilisi-airport,Tbilisi Airport customer review,A Jansen,NA,2006-05-23,"I found this one of the most revolting airports I have ever been. The facilities have changed little since soviet times and are just too small. In arrivals there was only one luggage-belt. Some thugs monopolized the trollies and demanded money from foreigners who wanted to use them. Unruly taxi drivers even pushed their way into the arrivals hall looking for prey (foreigners). Departure was even worse. The departure hall is much bigger and supposedly better organized but still we had a very unpleasant time there. First of all most flights seem to leave very early in the morning (around 5 AM) which is already inconvenient. Secondly the check-in of several flights at the same time causes a lot of confusion. Staff works extremely slow and broad shouldered types simply push their way up the lines while people behind you gladly try to push you aside. The guards in the hall are uninterested in this and do not take any action at all. After receiving our boarding pass we had to go upstairs. In spite of the sign ""passengers only"" the stairs were blocked by people saying goodbye to their loved ones. There were only 2 desks for foreign passports. Even here some unpleasant types tried to push themselves in front. People from western countries were treated politely but my wife who has a Moldovan passport and a valid residence permit for the Netherlands experienced real trouble. An extremely unfriendly female official grabbed her passport and without any explanation went into some office rudely ordering my wife to follow her. I went after her and found some officer holding my wife's passport. I demanded an explanation as well as their names and registration numbers. One good thing about Georgia's rose revolution is the fact that officials are in fact required to identify themselves when asked and that it is also possible to make a complaint against them. Luckily this helped without even looking into the passport he gave it back saying that there was "" no problem"" . I am sure that without this intervention they might have detained my wife for hours. I am deeply disappointed that officials at this airport show a smiling face to westerners while at the same time they apparently take pleasure in harrassing people from poor countries. After this intermezzo we had to go to the metal detector. There was only one working so again a huge queue had formed. This detector did not work at all - it went off for almost everybody but not for me even though I was carrying a pocket knife with me! Finally we had reached the "" departure lounge""  an extremely small area with a bar and one sad "" tax free shop"". I am a smoker myself but the fumes exhausted by visitors of the bar were even too much for me. There seemed to be no toilet at all however when looking really well (a small corridor behind the bar) you could find it. Even though Georgia produces wonderful souvenirs there was nothing except cigarettes and some alcoholic drinks in the taxfree sold by some unfriendly women spending their time chatting to each other and taking cigarette-breaks. There were 2 "" exit gates"" (not indicated by numbers). Departures were announced in unclear english (no monitors). Travellers had to walk down to ground level were busses were waiting to take them to the planes. Since these busses stand next to each other and several take-offs take place almost simultaneously this leads to confusion when people get into the wrong bus. We were really glad to have the ordeal behind us. A terrible place unworthy of this beautiful country!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Departure was a bit of a different story. We arrived 2.5h before departure and there was a long line for our LX flight to ZRH. However somehow we were asked to come to the front and the interrogation started. It took almost 2h as they searched my bag asked me questions and passed me to three other officers who asked similar questions and then I had to go to some back room to get searched again. The staff was very friendly though and it is just part of the trip if you visit Israel.

The young lady who inspected my bags was pretty friendly and it took me about 10 seconds to re-pack them so no big deal. Then going through the personal security took about 5 minutes max - everyone was firm but polite so no problems. One of the security girls apologised for the delay.

With the Metro being built its potential will increase. But the airport - which is being expanded is really not geared to tourists and though above the standard of other Greek airports is inferior to what it needs to be particularly when compared to Athens. Public transport information is non-existant - the tourist office is shut most of the time and has no bus maps (Thessloniki only has buses for transport at the moment): the bus stop has most information in Greek (fine for me but for German and British travellers?). The runway is being expanded to take long haul aircraft and a new terminal is being constructed but the airport has to think it terms of being a hub with clear information if it is to compete for tourists + business travellers with Athens or Istanbul.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There is a major expansion of another terminal building next door so maybe proper facilities may exist later. As it is the check in area is separated totally from the rest of the airport requiring everyone to show ID to walk through a door to go through a customs area before actually checking in for the back end of the row of counter. Then you retrace your steps to access the immigration area before the typically cramped security screening which only had two of the four points on duty leading to a long wait in line. Once through the main terminal area is obviously a temporary scenario by the way the duty free shop acts to block access to the other gates.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,A Rochard,Canada,2015-03-17,We had to return from Trinidad to Toronto by Caribbean Airlines sooner than expected as my husband was not well so I asked the Purser to arrange for us to de-plane first on wheelchairs. We did get off first but then was left in a crowd of 6 people all in wheelchairs with 2 people to push all of us. This has happened time after time whenever we travel with wheelchair access at Pearson and it is just ridiculous that they cannot hire the sufficient amount of porters to wheel all the passengers in a reasonable amount of time. When we were leaving for Trinidad they came so late with the wheelchairs to take us to the departure lounge that we had to board immediately and did not have time to eat anything. My husband is a diabetic so as soon as we boarded I had to ask the Purser again for something sweet so his blood sugar wouldn't go low.

We missed our connecting flight to Tokyo (thanks to the inept staff of Air Canada) and had to spend the night in a hotel. The Air Canada customer service rep told us to go to ground level S-5 and a shuttle would pick us up. She also said it was a long walk to get there (true very true). We asked her how to get there and she said to follow the signs. What signs? We had to move against the flow of people to leave the secure area. We had to ask security how to go through screening in the opposite direction to leave they were not sympathetic to our dilemma at all. We asked no less than 3 airport staff for directions to ground floor S-5 and never got a coherent answer. The airport is the most confusing unorganized airport we have ever been in. Directional signage is woefully inadequate and confusing. The staff are poorly trained and not customer friendly. The food choices are scant at best. On our return trip through Toronto to Boston we found the airport dirty mush trash on the floors and in the restrooms. We waited at gate F55 which was drab with very little seating. The air quality was so bad that my wife and I went for a long walk in search of some air that didn't reek of jet exhaust. We really have nothing positive to say about our visit there.

This terminal badly needs two changes. The first is to find a better way of sorting arriving travelers into the appropriate Immigration lines. As a Canadian it was embarrassing to watch international visitors being ""welcomed"" to Canada by two frustrated-looking greeters literally yelling at everyone to go left if they're making a connection or go right if not; and then to see American transit passengers being abruptly told to leave the Connections line and join another line after merely following the greeters' instructions. The second change is to install screens showing passengers which gates they need to go to for their connecting flights as soon as they exit Customs or at least a sign informing passengers that they will need to go back airside to find this information.

I understand that there aren't many flights departing at night but still. Also they had problems with bridge retracting that caused a 90 minute delay in departure (Chine Airlines to TPE). Upon arrival around 6 pm two or three big jets landed and the immigration lines were horrendous. That whole area seems to be a bit too small already.

The CATSA agents for flights to the USA on the other hand were both incompetent and refused to communicate with passengers. We were near the front of the line and still waited well >30min while only one scanner was put to use and the staff and supervisor refused to respond to any questions regarding the situation or to any requests to inform the airline of the situation so that passengers would not miss their connecting flights.

vancouver-airport,/airport-reviews/vancouver-airport,Vancouver Airport customer review,M Doyle,Canada,2010-08-26,At first I was impressed to find the new Immigration kiosk system for Canadian residents. Just a few minutes and I was off to pick up my baggage. However after getting the bags as a passenger with a connecting flight to another Canadian city I experienced the most bizarre line-up to clear customs. In all my years of landing in Vancouver and connecting to another Canadian city I have never experienced such a horribly long line. In the past we walked out and deposited our checked bags fairly quickly. After which I assume they were security screened in the same manner that any baggage is. So why are we suddenly required to line up and wait while each passenger's bag is slowly screened? The more bizarre twist is that those people who are exiting the airport are expeditiously moved through customs and sent out into the country. Why are connecting passengers treated so differently? If for example a passenger brought an illegal item in their baggage they are able to exit and be let loose in Canada but if connecting to another city all their bags are searched and must be scanned in their presence? Why must a connecting passenger be present for screening when someone who checks in upstairs can simply drop off their bags? Simply because of this bottleneck due to an extremely illogical and inefficient system I will be trying to avoid this otherwise fine airport in the future. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I need is a pointless 2 hour wait in line to have my baggage screened!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
venice-marco-polo-airport,/airport-reviews/venice-marco-polo-airport,Venice Marco Polo Airport customer review,Leonardo Pavan,Italy,2014-01-29,This is a small but busy airport. The covered parking lot is very expensive so you might want to consider the uncovered ones. Check-in is all done by the SAVE personnel (it's the managing company of the airport) not the airlines so they tend to be rather strict with the weight allowances. In many cases I have experienced long lines at check-in and I believe that the check-in area is rather small and can get congested very quickly. Security has improved a lot recently (they have re-designed the check points) and it has become a lot faster. The shopping area is well presented and with a fairly wide choice of boutiques considering the size of the airport. Perhaps it is lacking of chairs. The upper floor also features a smoking room which perhaps is not kept super tidy. The Marco Polo Lounge is OK but not the best of the lounges: access is the same as every other lounge (scanning of the boarding pass) the food offerings are not particularly thrilling (most of the time some cold pizzas some stale sandwiches and some broken up cookies) beverages selection is rather wide instead and it is self service; there is complimentary wifi in the lounge even though the signage indicates that you have to pay; the upkeep of the lounge is OK. Generally the airport needs to be kept a little bit better perhaps.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The airport is a nightmare with a shocking lack of personnel and some of the rudest people I have ever met. The security queue was very long indeed and actually went out of the building. It took me almost 3 hours in lines to get to the gate only to be rudely treated. A few people were denied boarding and I was bussed to the flight alone in a coach.

Cheapest parking is nr. 3 which is still very close to the terminal no need to go for more expensive lots. The problem with this airport is always the same: it is under dimensioned for peak periods traffic. As some check-ins have already been moved downstairs the whole departures up-arrivals down scheme should be rethought. Downstairs space look under-utilised while upper floor busts with passengers. Security is always quick and efficient no matter the flow of passengers. They are using new trays that are much better than the old baskets. My flight was delayed 4 hours and there are no lounges for paying travellers. The two lounges on the second floor look very exclusive. There is a business centre with basic facilities. There are four Internet kiosks before security but only one after and none in the no-schengen area. Facilities after securities are very good though shops and cafes are expensive. You may face long queues at passport control accessing no schengen area as there are direct flights to USA and the Middle East. In the schengen area there are only a small cafe and a small duty free upstairs and only a couple of vending machines downstairs but they seem to cope with the flow of passengers.

A KLM flight to Amsterdam meant standing in a long line which intersected with another line for Air France nobody knowing if they were even in the right place.

Though lines at the security are discouraging I always went through at good speed and the personnel is usually kind and efficient. The baskets they use at security are not very practical.

Thus the airport is not friendly for weekend commuters and budget travellers while trying to suit the needs of business travellers and charter flights. The check-in area is spacious and rationally planned. The choice of shops before security is sufficient. I'm travelling on a Sunday morning and the flow of passengers is scarce. Security looks very professionals and friendly enough though procedures are strict. After security there is virtually nothing in the non Schengen area.

In consequence we lost the departure slot and were delayed for a further hour and a quarter all cooped up on the plane before the flight was re- routed and able to get away. The return trip check-in contributed to this because only two desks were initially available for the passengers on our A300 and the queues extended outside the terminal building.

We were flying with Pacific Coastal airlines to Vancouver YVR airport, and the security lines took forever. My father and I waited a tedious 30 minutes in the queue for a 5 minute flight to Vancouver. We had several trays of stuff and a man thought I dropped a SD card and when he took it up from one of my trays and asked me all the security people turned to me, glaring for no reason. The four trays blocked the traffic of baggages coming through the X-ray machine so out of respect I put them all onto one tray and moved away, and a security personnel said kindly to place it on a table. However as I was worried that we'd miss our flight as the security was taking forever to screen my father I was talking in a loud voice as he was across the room and all the security were busy looking at me and it just took forever. If you are flying from YVR to Victoria I highly recommend not using YYJ, as the security is appalling.

Most of the things stated in previous comments are true. But at least one has changed radically after the latest terror threats. In contrast to YVR there is only one security control for all flights (domestic flights to Canada and international flights to Seattle and Salt Lake City). The first oddity was that a security officer awaited me in front of the controls just to find out whether I wanted to go to the USA or to remain in Canada. As I was merely going to return to YVR I was told that I could keep my shoes on whereas all passengers travelling to Seattle had to take them off to have them x-rayed. (What if I smuggled in something for someone I was to meet in the departure lounge who was heading for the USA?) The second oddity was that the security officers checked my hand luggage by hand after screening and found two sealed one-portion packages of marmalade which I had taken from my hotel's breakfast room earlier that morning. The officer took them out and threw them away. If they had really been so dangerous I wonder why the staff in Vancouver had not already thrown them away on my way out.

Lots and lots of duty free shops. Several discount airlines have check-in counters in a separate building across the street from the main terminal but boarding is in the main building. Having separate security check-in for each gate has its plusses and minuses but we found it strange that we were made to stand in the terminal's corridor until 40 minutes before our flight at which time we were allowed to go through security and sit down in the boarding area until actual boarding was announced. There is a train from Vienna's town center but we opted for a cab in order to avoid changing Metro trains twice and then getting on the 9 Euro train (prices ended up being close).,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport has a new rail link to the city center, and public transit options from the airport are well marked. The departure hall has been expanded considerably. The additional check in and security facilities seem to have reduced overcrowding. We got from the train station to airside in less than 15 minutes. There are a wider selection of shops and a new small food court. The airport even had a kids play area and a rest lounge for transit passengers.

Be warned that unlicensed cab drivers will approach you in arrivals. Ignore them at all costs even if they are pushy. The best way into Warsaw is to take the Modlin Bus a purple coach that costs 33 zloty (just €8) an air conditioned warm coach will take to central Warsaw in a journey lasting about 1 hour.

The TSA officials are very efficient and courteous and the Aerotrain is also very convenient as well. Coming back is another story even though Dulles has improved. First of all are the ancient plane mates which take you to the international arrivals building but which will be used for the foreseeable future. Second even though the electronic kiosks for U.S. citizens in theory are a good idea they are complicated to use at first and you still have to hand the print out to a border security agent. Third the border security agents are extremely rude even to U.S. citizens. The agent who looked at my passport asked me where I visited which I told him and then he began grill me about why I didn't mention the other country I visited (Turkey where I only changed flights) even though I never left the airport to get my connecting flight! Fourth your luggage is routinely removed from the baggage carousel and placed in a pile without you even knowing. I made a complaint to Dulles Airport's Twitter handle and was told that the airlines are doing this and not the airport but that they would look into it. Even with all these complications on my return it only took me about an hour to be out of the airport.

Considering that the competition for that ""honor"" includes JFK and Miami that's how bad Dulles is. The fundamental problem with Dulles is that it looked really ""cool"" on the drawing board in the late 1950's when it was designed with no airplanes at gates and everyone being shuttled to and from the aircraft in people movers. It worked just fine when there were two flights to London and one to Paris every day. Then they built the ""mid-field terminals"". Now there are so many international flights that immigration and customs on arrival can take hours and here's a real kicker-there are two separate immigration and customs areas. If you are ending your journey at Washington you go to the main terminal if you are making a connection you stay in the mid-field arrival terminal. If the guy sorting luggage at your origin put your bags in the wrong container you could wait for hours for your bag to show up at the correct customs terminal.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,Rich Jenkins,NA,2010-01-08,IAD tends to be a miserable experience but it provides almost all the international options in the DC area and it should get better. Immigration/customs formalities are relatively efficient although it's still necessary to use the people mover (often crowded) to reach the immigration area. The ambiance and dining/shopping options vary by concourse. The United commuter concourse is the worst. The main C/D concourse (used by United for mailine flights) has gotten better over time. Departure security has gotten more efficient and there is now a second security area on the lower level near baggage claim along with the new security mezzanine. I recommend the lower level location as it is still lightly used. The new train system will connect to the smaller infield terminals before opening to the C/D. The opening of the train has been delayed but should occur early this year. Getting to the airport remains a hassle - the 5A bus to Rosslyn and L'Enfant Metro stations remains the cheapest option but is poorly promoted although information can be found on the DC Metro website. The buses to West Falls Church are the next best option; there used to be service to DC but it was not used enough to be profitable. Staying near Dulles means being carbound and having limited dining options. Service within the airport tends toward the indifferent.

Second National is very pricey for certain flights considering it's a little domestic airport. The airport has a heavy US Airways presence but because it brings in a lot of business and political traffic that can evidently afford it both US and other airlines jack up prices on non- competitive routes - the ones I've dealt with included DCA-BNA (Nashville) and DCA-SDF (Louisville). And it's not like the shuttles to Boston and NYC are dirt cheap either. Comparing costs between DCA and BWI says it all often 350$ out of National when only 190-225$ out of BWI (but you have to deal with going out of BWI). But it is incredibly convenient right on the Metro (one of the best subway systems in the country) and an easy cab ride to downtown and easy to get to from all of the Virginia and many Maryland suburbs. DCA is a smaller airport that happens to be the airport in a major city. It's very good except expensive.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

waterford-airport,/airport-reviews/waterford-airport,Waterford Airport customer review,Patrick Jordan,NA,2007-07-30,First time to use this Airport and I have mixed feelings.The poor signage makes this a difficult airport to find on a first trip. However it is a rare pleasure to be able to park mere yards from the terminal! Mind you at 8Euro a day it is far from cheap. Yet the automated pay machines do not accept 50Euro notes or Laser debit cards. Staff are very friendly and the small size of the building is makes a pleasant change from most other airports. At present catering is limited to drinks and snacks. Beware of one outrageous thing: each passenger is required to pay a fee of 5Euro at check-in to fund the future development of the airport. Nowhere during the booking process is this mentioned. Furthermore when other busineses plan expansions there is no requirement for current customers to pay upfront.

The current electricity supply problem also means that the airport is totally reliant on generators. When we arrived early evening we discovered that the generator had packed up so the airport was operating by candlelight or battery-powered torches. Thankfully our plane was an 15-seater and the non-functioning baggage carousel wasn't required.

If you dont get stuck with that then there are people standing around who pretend they are going to help you to your rental car or to the transportation to your hotel but it always ends up turning into a timeshare commercial. Also there is no place to sit so if you have to wait for any amount of time you have to sit on the floor. I would suggest when arriving leave straight away from the airport and dont make eye contact with anyone! Just plow through to the exit. The departure area is much nicer. Pretty clean lots of shops and stuff. I was amazed at how decent it was. No problems with the departure process. Planes are slow to board. Security goes through every carry on bag as you board the plane. The beauty of Cancun far outweighs the bad stuff at the airport. Just get out of there as soon as you can and enjoy the paradise that awaits,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

pisa-airport,/airport-reviews/pisa-airport,Pisa Airport customer review,Steve Dar by,NA,2008-08-13,Mixed views of the airport - the queue for the hire car bus in 33 degrees and followed by an even longer 1.5 hour queue at the Budget car hire desk was not a pleasant experience (Avis and Hertz seemed better at clearing customers through the process) but is that the airport's fault or the lack of customer care from the hire car companies. The airport itself was east to get in and out off- the facilities land side were good for a regional airport (have you ever flown from the shed at Coventry!!) but a little disappointing air side - so called 'duty free' was rip off!

In the last month I've flown through Pearson from LHR MUC and IST and without fail I'm amazed at our archaic customs process and the ridiculously long wait for baggage. I'm a Canadian citizen. I'm pleased they have a separate queue for Canadian Residents now however Canada is the only country I've been to (out of 47) that is the most onerous and frustrating to enter. The Canadian Residents line is always the longest the three flights I took also required us to use the automated machines that promote ""faster entry home"" - the kiosks were slow couldn't read my passport and the organisation was a mess. You then still have to join another queue and give your printout (a waste of more paper and tax dollars as it's a scanned copy of the form you just filled out) to an officer who may or may not ask you questions. You then join another queue to show more officers your printout - and then once you get your luggage (which even for Priority can take ages - I waited 50 minutes for my bag from IST - easily wait an average of 40 minutes) you have to queue yet again to give your printed form to another customs agent. If the airport isn't busy it's not so much of an issue but these times are rare particularly when you arrive from European flight - most arrive in the early evening and you then have thousands of people trying to get through. It's terrible and makes no sense - can't we at least get rid of one of those checkpoints? And Pearson/GTAA whomever please fix the ridiculously long wait times for luggage.

pisa-airport,/airport-reviews/pisa-airport,Pisa Airport customer review,A Chinnery,United Kingdom,2014-07-13,Pisa airport is OK Medium Sized. Our flight landed in a 10mins early (Easyjet from LGW) and had to wait on the taxiway for 5 mins as a plane was leaving from our allocated stand a little bit late. We had to disembark by air stairs and walk a long distance to the terminal building. Immigration took 10 mins and as we were only there for a long weekend we had no baggage. There was a large taxi rank which was a delight from our 30min wait at Edinburgh for a taxi last year. Flying out we got at the airport 3 hours before our 10.10 departure (easyjet to LGW). We were expecting long queues at security and customs. However there wasn't and we were left in the departures lounge with around 10 duty free shops and cafes. Annoyingly they said go through customs (for UK and intercontinental flights separate departure area upstairs) 90 mins before departure and around 50 of us did. However a hazard was the escalator was kept running and we had to cram in to a small area for 25 mins before they opened up customs. We boarded 35 mins before (inbound was 40mins early) but there was a long walk down ramps (quite odd) our plane was at a stand the other side. It took a while to get down to the planes and a Ryanair was disembarking and pax had to walk across the ramp which caused a 10min hold up. (We where last to board before hold up) We push backed 10mins late and departed in just 2 mins. We arrived 5 mins early.

tokyo-haneda-airport,/airport-reviews/tokyo-haneda-airport,Tokyo Haneda Airport customer review,Anand Diwakar,India,2011-06-12,Have used the new international terminal recently for departure. The airport operates international flights between 2300 to around 0600 (when Narita is closed). There are some flights to/from Taiwan Korea and China throughout the day as well. The terminal is modern clean and beautiful. Monorail and limousine buses offer good connectivity to the airport. However these transport modes are not available after late night. Last bus to airport is around 2200 and from airport is around 2230. So if you have a flight early morning you must reach airport by 2200 and wait or should use a taxi. One weird design flaw which is not expected in a place like Japan is the way you arrive by taxi or bus. You arrive at the terminal at ground level. However departure areas are on 3F. When a bus load of people arrive at a time you end up in a queue at the elevators. Escalators are useless as most of the international passengers will have luggage and will use trolleys. To add to this when I arrived one elevator out of 2 was closed to save electricity. Not sure how things work for arrivals. Check-in is speedy. 4F has very beautifully decorated shop and rest area. The area is designed like old Japanese town street with wooden facades and lanterns. Has a good variety of shops and eateries. Beware most will be closed after 2300 though. I guess as the passenger traffic will increase these facilities will start staying open in the night. 5F has a very good and big open viewing area. Enough benches to rest and vending machines if you need drinks. Good place if you want to do some airport/aircraft photography. Spend as much free time in these areas at 4F/5F as there are not many shops once you clear immigration. Got down to 3F again to clear immigration and security. Both were breeze. Staff was friendly and smiling (as anywhere in Japan). Not many shops at this side of the building but enough area to sit and wait for boarding.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2012-08-05,I had a decent transit experience at T3 the first time through here 7 weeks ago. My flight from HYD had the misfortune of being parked at a remote stand which meant wasting 20 minutes on a bus back to the terminal. Once in the transit area no signage regarding what to do if transferring to an airline other than Emirates. Security check was fast. Then came the bizarre process of going down a set of escalators walking 50 feet then up another escalators to the floor we were just on this time a little further down the hall. Then came the hike from the far end of Concourse 2 to the transfer desk for BA at the other end of Concourse 1. What's maddening is that the transfer desks are outside security by just a few feet (amazingly to reach them you are told to go the wrong way through the metal detectors) so after getting my boarding pass I had to go through security again even though I'd just been in a secured area! Finally boarding pass in hand I could head for my gate - only to find yet another useless security check! The whole thing took exactly one hour while speed walking through the terminal enduring 3 security checks during that time 2 of which were unnecessary. At least with the exception of one officer at the third and final security check the personnel I encountered were helpful and efficient. The bottom line after two transits through Dubai - if your arriving flight parks at an aerobridge the process isn't bad taking perhaps 30 minutes though you may have to walk a bit. But all bets are off if you get stuck at a remote stand. That risk alone will put me off from choosing to transit through Dubai again.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

However there's still a lot of space for improvement. While Terminal 2 (which houses all international and Garuda flights) looks better and brighter Terminal 1 certainly needs a facelift especially Terminal 1A. One area needs immediate attention: the baggage claim area it's dark bleak boring and sadly it is the place where you would most likely stay for quite a while to pick up your bags and at peak hours where many domestic flights arrive at the same time it can be quite crowded. Outside things can be chaotic once you proceed to check out you will be greeted by many taxi drivers who endlessly tout at you attempting to persuade you to take theirs. One more word of advice: the biggest problem in CGK is not within the airport it is outside the airport area. CGK is located some 20 kms west of Jakarta leave your hotel as early as you can particularly in peak hours.

Inside the cattle theme continues as you are herded around like farm animals particularly at the gate where you have to wait in a sort of holding pen rather than being allowed to sit down. The queues were awful. The bag drop was awful. There was not enough space in the departure lounge. Sandwiches cost 6 Euros a coke 7 Euros. Worst of all were photographs of groups of people around the place wearing T shirts spelling out BILLI - as if they had something to be proud of! They couldn't even bring themselves to give it a proper name like 'terminal 2'. The only good thing I can say about it was that it made the easyjet flight seem luxurious.

Returning the Hertz rental car was joke also. Poor signage a random parking spot if you can find one and then deal with people that can't speak English well enough to assist with billing questions. Inside the terminal the signage directing you to check in is inefficient. If you don't know where your going good luck figuring out where the US flights check in. They love numbering the check-ins but don't tell you which airline is at what number. Be prepared to hike your bags a long way to check in then hike your carry-ons the full length of the terminal to a poorly mark Stairwell with the single broken escalator.

Very good experiences with both terminals. I was especially pleased with the service I received after I had accidentally left my Blackberry at T2 only realising after I had boarded my flight. I called the airport lost and found upon arrival at my destination and they had located it. It was available for pickup when I got back to Changi T2 a few days later. I was especially impressed when I was called at my hotel afterwards by one of the staff members at lost and found (who I had initially been dealing with) who was checking to see whether I had been able to retrieve my phone and whether I was happy with the service.

The person collecting me on arrival most recently got confused and ended up in the wrong area due to poor signage. Efficient airport though but still feels a little cramped especially at the old gates (the ones where you turn left after Security) and at the check in.

birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,James Jones,United Kingdom,2015-05-02,I travel frequently - about ten times per annum - to Jersey and back via BHX. I have noticed a gradual deterioration in the standard of ground handling for these flights at BHX. This dates from the change of terminals which now requires Jersey passengers having walked through the hideous perfume shops in the first terminal to walk a long way to the Jersey terminal where there is now only one inadequate junk food outlet apart from a small Boots and Smiths and a souvenir shop. BHX authorities have also removed most of the flight arrivals and departures boards including the most vital information board which is the one where you initially arrive in the terminal. One could be forgiven for thinking that the BHX authority has a prejudice against flights to Jersey and the other flights to UK destinations which leave from the same terminal and is determined to take it out on the passengers. However the main substance for my complaint is the truly awful level of ground handling for incoming Flybe Jersey/BHX flights which I have experienced in the last five flights I have made into BHX on this route. Invariably the aircraft is made to wait for its stand. Invariably there is a delay in getting the passengers off the aircraft. Invariably they are made to wait in the bus which takes them to the airside stairs to baggage reclaim. Yesterday for example there was a delay of 45 minutes from the time the aircraft on BE 502 stopped its engines before the passengers were able to retrieve their baggage and exit the customs area. 15 minutes in the aircraft before the doors were opened and the passengers loaded into a bus. A full 25 minutes waiting with locked doors in the bus before the passengers were allowed onto the airside stairs and another 5 minutes waiting in the covered walkway before we were allowed access to our luggage which had clearly been on the carousel for a long time. This is as I am sure everyone would agree totally unacceptable from a passenger point of view. It is also clear where the blame lies. Namely with the BHX ground handling organisation. Unless this is considerably improved I shall simply stop using BHX and I imagine so will many other potential UK destination customers. Yesterday was merely the worst of a long series if such delays in handling incoming flights from Jersey at BHX.,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Once I left the processing area I was looking for the shuttle service I had booked however I was unable to find it so took a regular taxi instead.

While the terminal building was originally inaugrated around 1993 and constructed by a french company its a basic airport. There is a duty free a shopping arcade for Pakistani handicrafts and a McDonalds Kiosk for those who just have to have a Big Mac. However while the airport may be maintained to some extent its not neccesary that everythng will be spank. Lightning can be an ""occasional"" issue and the local authorities have put in these hideous looking black glass enclosures everywhere which are not coherent with the original airport design. A welcome addition is the Citigroup ATM kiosk right there at International Arrivals which adds a colourful touch to a rather mundane airport. The best part is that the terminal has lots of space for developing passenger facilities including new restaurants bookshops and coffee shops etc. Heck on the street level Pakistan has every conceivable food franchise including McDonalds Pizza Hut KFC Costa Coffee and Papa Johns. The airport has none other than a McDonalds kiosk which is not open 24 hours. The duty free also needs a brush up as the current operator is not allowed to sell alcohol. All in all the airport is modern and the size of the terminal manageable unlike other asian and western airports which overwhelm passengers with their long walks and distant parking lots. Also the huge underground parking which has not ever been opened since the airport came into existence in 1993 needs to be opened up.... whats the use of having it in the first place!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I was surprised - in a positive way. Yes the airport is old no facilities but - it took me 15 minutes to get the visa another 15 to go through passport control and once I finished with that my suitcase was already waiting for me. No custom forms to fill out only a short immigration form. Thinking that this may have been an exception I arrived to the airport 2 hours before my departure. 5 minutes for check in no queue in passport control and literally a minute in security check (no one cares about things like liquids taking out laptops etc.). Which left me with more than an hour and half in the terminal where there is nothing to do. A small duty free (expensive) and a small bar are the only things for entertaining no wireless of course.

I have entered the US via several big airports but never had to wait so long to clear immigration. The lines were massive and only half the booths staffed. When our party cleared that hurdle we then had to then clear TSA security to get to our gate and what a nightmare. Massive line again and very few staff on duty. Then came our turn. We were told to place our Passports and boarding passes into the property trays with shoes etc. Immediately we noticed that one of the staff had removed my daughters bag from the tray it had been in straight onto the conveyor belt and threw the tray which still contained her Passport onto a pile of empty trays. We alerted the staff who handed it back with no apology. I then passed through security and when my tray appeared after screening and my passport and boarding pass was missing. I immediately informed a staff member who alerted the control desk who told him they had a passport but not mine. It took an age to locate it under a machine which led to us missing our flight and having to wait on standby for 3 hours until the next flight. If you are using this airport to transit make sure you leave a good two hours between flights or pick another route as it was not just our party that missed our connection but at least 8 other people from our flight missed their connections.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

First give yourself lots of time to get from your starting point to the airport by car as the roads in and around Austin are terrible - badly designed and poorly maintained with tremendous volumes of traffic. Second give yourself more time if you are on the first flights of the day as the check-in and TSA security cannot handle the large volumes first thing in the day. Third prepare to have some sort of strange interaction with the TSA as they exercise their improbable variant of ""logic"". Fourth eat before you go to the airport as the options inside the ""secure"" area are plentiful but of poor quality. Otherwise once you are inside the ""sterile"" area the airport is well-designed and I see others have mentioned the good massage spot near gate 13. The bathrooms are excellent.

beauvais-airport,/airport-reviews/beauvais-airport,Beauvais Airport customer review,Mark Wadham,NA,2008-11-18,This once great little airport has outgrown itself. When there were just 2 or 3 flights a day this airport was a pleasure to use. The problem is that there are now many flights and further expansion is planned. This would be fine if the facilities were developed in parallel. I arrived one hour before my flight having checked-in online to find the car parks at near saturation point. A helpful attendant invited me to leave my car at the end of a row but outside a normal parking space. In the terminal there was a very long queue to go through passport control & security. This was because insufficient staff were on duty for the number of passengers. This is inexcusable as surely the authorities must know the number of passengers expected beforehand. it also represents a loss for the airport as many passengers - myself included no longer had time to visit the shops. Although at the airport one hour before the flight I only boarded 10 minutes before departure due to these inadequacies. The other major problem at this airport is access. If your destination/departure point is Paris there's no problem. If it's anywhere else there is virtually no other choice than to use a car and be subjected to the monopolistic practices of using the airport car parks. There is a bus to Beauvais but its infrequency is as good as to render it useless. This airport needs to invest fast in additional parking quicker security and larger departure lounges. The bus service to Beauvais needs to be increased to at least one bus per hour to allow the surrounding communities to benefit from what is after all Beauvais airport rather than Paris airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,M Miles,United Kingdom,2011-12-07,I have used all three terminals at Manila over the last few years. Most international travellers arrive in Terminal 1. An imposing concrete manifestation that might be right in the 1950s or 1960s but not today. The terminal is simply too small for its needs and has a very depressing feel about it. There is often congestion in the bag screening area and the departure lounge is very basic however the optional and fairly priced lounges makes the stay more pleasurable. For arrivals the immigration queues can be very slow sometimes especially when several international flights arrive together and the meet and greet area is always just chaotic. The other terminals (2 and 3) are much more built for purpose and are more cheery. The satisfying Terminal 3 is clearly designed as an international terminal but why isn't it being used as such after several years of operation?

We have just come back from a brilliant trip to Krakow but it did take us 2 hours to get through airport security. Our plane eventually took off one hour late. First there was a mad 'crush' to get to the boarding area followed by long queues to the baggage x-ray machines. This took about an hour and twenty minutes. We then had to queue through passport control. Because all flights were being delayed because of security priority started to be given to certain flights meaning we were being queue jumped making us even later. We didn't clear passport control until 5 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave which caused us a lot of concern especially as there were no announcements telling us the flights were being delayed. Once through passport control we then had to queue to go through another security check during which they checked our hand luggage all over again. I've no problem with all the security but the time to get to the departure lounge took us by suprise. Yes there is nothing in the departure lounges make sure you take something with you to eat/drink and keep occupied with but go through boarding just as soon as you possibly can after checking in.

From check-in go upstairs to immigration; you need to complete a disembarkation card which is just before the immigration queue. After queuing there you queue again to go through security. This can take some time. Once through if travelling business etc. there are two executive lounges the first one seems to get really crowded last time I went people were standing in there.

This airport lacks proper seating for passengers unless you like sitting on the floor. The tiny washrooms are located up a flight of stairs - very helpful for disabled passengers - during my visit only one of the two toilets was functioning. They do have several good bookstores where you can pick up books - unfortunately because they have frequent power outages here you may not be able to read them. There are several good cafes serving coffee which will at least allow you to sit down. Public WiFi is available.

QANTAS check in although automated still lacks enough staff at peak times with the queue winding out the doors. Security checks are very quick and thorough with polite staff. A travelator on the Qantas pier like on the Virgin one is a must. Baggage collection is fairly quick (unlike Melbourne). The International terminal is again stretched at peak times both departing and arriving. Again QANTAS check in is inadequate where even Club check in takes far to long. Security is again fast and efficient but Customs both inbound and outbound seem to be stretched to the limit of their capabilities even with all counters and personel working. Transport to and from BNE is it's biggest downfall. Very farsighted in developing a rail link but let down by poor frequency the Airtrain even though very heavily marketed is not an attractive option for frequent travellers. I have used the service many times and it is fast reliable comfortable and not too expensive when compared to comparable services in other countries. The only problem is that it ceases operation far to early in the evening for when I'm returning. If you don't make it easy for people to use it they won't! The consequence is the traffic snarls which occur every evening with people waiting for passengers to arrive. Again the airport should consider a ""stay in your car"" parking area short of the terminals for such use.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,J Fang,Canada,2015-01-05,22 December 2014 - boarding flight from YYZ to YVR: very very slow processing times that the CATSA Security Screening checkpoints. There were 10-15 people ahead of me in the queue and it took 20-25 minutes to go through security. Allow yourself at least 2-3 hours in order to make your flights and at least 4 hours of you are connecting flights at YYZ. Nothing particular impressively at YYZ other than exorbitantly high food and drink prices and expensive restaurants. On the plus side they had some airport workers singing Christmas carols which spread a bit of cheer in an otherwise lacklustre airport.

For those trying to make their connecting flights there was only one with hundreds of travelers in the line. When additional customs officials arrived they also went to service those who had no connecting flights. No doubt many travelers missed their flights as a result. We missed ours even though we had over 2 hours to make the connection. Speaking to other travelers upon our return we found that many had identical experiences.

Toilets are full and are also dirty. People lie on the floor blocking the passageway while restaurants are all occupied there are no place to sit either. Even if I could sit somewhere power plugs can be hardly found in the gates. Trying to appeal as a luxurious airport while providing such poor facilities is not a good combination believe me.

All inbound transit passengers must queue again in order go though security/Xray once more before going back down to the gate again. As everybody is on a short connect everyone seems to be irritated and close to panic in case they will miss their flights. The only ones not in stress are the security guards. So my question that nobody at MRS can ever answer is; if I have cleared security at a French airport (MRS) why do to I have to clear security again 10 mins after landing ? Either they don´t trust the other French airports (in my case Marseille or CDG) or this is just a way of creating another few unnecessary civil service jobs.

My incoming flight was a little late admittedly but the extremely long queue for EU immigration was being handled by one person. No-one in authority to organise the priority of any passengers. The people in front of me had a 4 hour period - I had half an hour. The queue for international immigration was almost non-existent but the haughty woman said she was unable to assist. A staff member with a walkie talkie appeared and then proceeded to tell us he had no responsibility for this area. Here's a suggestion - use your initiative and find someone who is. Eventually two people came along and proceeded to prioritise flights which were later than ones almost ready to depart the story goes on and on but the woman then proceeded to yell at me that I had 2 minutes or I would miss my flight. Have travelled extensively around the world and I have never seen such a mismanaged situation. I was embarrassed to be British!,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

We only had one Customs representative for the first half an hour for both EU and International arrivals! To make matters worse she gave priority to the EU line! When a second customs representative arrived she too gave priority to the EU line making several international arrivals late for their planes. I myself was stopped from going through when an EU customer just happened to arrive. When I chipped them they were very rude and unapologetic. Full marks however to a lovely lady who as a Customs representative tried her level best to ensure people were attended to in order despite their being several queues.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,F Odds,United Kingdom,2014-04-29,What a dreadful airport! At terminal 3 today around 50% of the x-rayed bags in security were passed for hand screening and swabbing causing huge build-ups of frustrated passengers. Many airports recognize that people who've paid money to fly are not criminals per se but Manchester (terminal 3) likes to make everyone passing through get the feeling they are an unreasonable nuisance to mankind. At security the tray containing my jacket and laptop and the tray containing my cabin bag were both sent for manual screening. Incredibly the security chap solemnly looked me in the eye for the second time when it came to tray number two and asked exactly the same questions: did you pack this yourself? Could anyone have interfered? etc. Is it really impossible to add intelligence to security? Airside at Manchester terminal 3 every WHSmith and Boots outlet insists on production of a boarding card for all purchases. Many British airports ask if you object to showing your boarding pass and don't mind if you say 'yes' but Manchester won't sell you even a newspaper without your producing a boarding pass. This farce has gone on long enough. The food outlets don't ask you to show your boarding pass to make a purchase: why should Smiths and Boots?

The transit process can be very painful early in the morning and even when slow around 5pm the security proved to be tedious compared with Asian airports of a similar size - the system and space allowed for it is not adequate for the volume.

dublin-airport,/airport-reviews/dublin-airport,Dublin Airport customer review,D Poulet,Ireland,2014-09-01,I fly in and out of Dublin about twice a month. In general it's a good airport. Sometimes there can be monumental queues at the check in desks during holiday periods so I find it best to check in online (or using the numerous electronic kiosks) and then use the bag drop. T2 is the Aer Lingus terminal even though a number of its short haul flights leave from T1 so you go through T2 security and then walk for about 5-10 minutes. They will tell you it's a 20 minute walk but it certainly isn't. I know some people find this walk a pain but I occasionally will go through T2 security for a T1 flight (requires a smile and polite request to be let through) because at peak times T2 security can be faster than T1. There are some nice touches for instance the clear plastic bags for liquids are provided free of charge. Once into the scanning area you have to pick a random queue but in a year of flying in and out at different times I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes in T2. Even in T1 it's never that long. Paying for a fast track pass is rarely worth the expense in T2 as it only bypasses the boarding pass check - you still have to queue for the scanners with everyone else. Inside the terminal the facilities are not that great for the size of the airport. There's a real lack of seating in the main departure lounge and space is limited so it always feels cramped. Most of the seating is by the gates themselves. The shops and restaurants are only so-so. Overall I like it and I prefer T2 much more than the slightly shabby and dark T1.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

My bag took forever to arrive which was annoying as I had been in Business Class. Departure was horrible again hijacked by a porter but this time it helped to speed me through what passed for security. Was identified by a Qatar Airways employee who escorted me to business lounge. Porter at this stage demanded £50 if I wanted to see my bag again. I gave him my last 200PK and told him he was welcome to my dirty laundry. Qatar Airways staff was very annoyed but said he could do nothing about it. When departure came was escorted past queues of people and was deposited at my seat. Great service.

The only route is the Scot Airways service to London City Airport which operates several times daily. The only negative aspect is the lack of public transport links but a taxi ride to the city centre takes only five minutes. The main Aberdeen-Glasgow railway passes the airport - the lack of a station is annoying.

However, after this there appeared to be no signs pointing you to border control, and in fact it was tucked away in a corner on a lower level. we walked around in a confused state with no staff actively trying to mange this.

On arrival from abroad I find the immigration staff reasonably efficient. It is downhill from there. The luggage belts do not have the capacity to handle all the luggage from a full international flight. I have seen baggage falling off and the belt jamming. And of course every passenger just has to push anybody in the way. Having retrieved your baggage Pakistani passengers find that the Green channel is purely for ""foreigners"" i.e. those who appearance does not indicate Pakistani roots. I have never been able to go through without being stopped and asked to take the other route - where everything is scanned just in case you decided to bring a television or airconditioner in your suitcase. No one has ever checked my luggage tags to see if they match the luggage. You exist to be hustled by people eager to help you take your luggage to your car. I don't actualy mind this too much as they are poor. When leaving the city there are the inevitable customs checks whose primary aim appears to be cash generation. The check in queues are staff by the genetically slow (I have taken 2.5 hours to check in). One reason for this is that several international flights are scheduled within a few hours. This saves on the time that ground staff have to be paid but results in utter chaos for passengers. Even worse than the waiting is the tendancy for check in staff to let friends relatives and payers jump the queues. Complaining about this to a more senior person results in a piece of set drama where the counter staff is told off. Nothing actually changes though. Immigration and security are usually quite professional and the lounge is fine. In summary it is not so much the airport facilities that are the problem; it is the unnacountable staff.

There is only one runway which means deays in departure if there are several arrivals. The terminal facilities are sufficient in the low season but when the charters are at full peak it is woefully inadequate. The limited number of check-in desks means that when several flights are being loaded often only one or perhaps two desks are available for each. There is a real bottleneck at the one and only security entrance. Information is poor even when it is obvious that flights are late the original time is left showing on the monitors. The departure lounge is small and with only one cafe which offers a very limited selection of food and drink. There is however a large open roof seating area with lift and stair access with excellent views of the apron and runway with a cafe which opens when the airport is busy. The only bus link is crowded with non-airport passengers as already described by an earlier contributor and doesn't end at the combined bus/rail station but some 400 metres away in town.

Inside International Departures you have the usual surly guard who glares but doesn't speak while checking your passport. Then you're through the terminal where all the gates are close together there is not enough seating and the only refreshments available are from a coffee guy who sells soft drinks/coffee & crisps. Coming back to Saudi via Riyadh is even worse as you have to collect your baggage clear customs and then then drag it from International Arrivals to Domestic Departures to check it onto the plane.

Got off the plane at 9pm on a rainy Monday night: 2-minute walk to reach the shuttle train station 1-minute wait to get on the train 2-minute ride to reach the main terminal 2-minute walk to arrive at immigration 15 seconds to pass immigration (eligible to use the kiosk being a Korean citizen) 5-minute wait to claim all checked bags 10 seconds to pass customs and I was walking for the Airport Express station. Altogether only about 13 minutes despite arriving at the midfield concourse passing through immigration claiming 2 bags and passing through customs. Even the worst luck with gate assignment would have taken only 3 additional minutes for me and even for foreigners who cannot use the automated immigration kiosks would have completed all the steps within 30 minutes.

My comments relate to the older national terminal. The tone is set when passengers see the huge portrait of former President Fidel Castro on the airport terminal plus the slogan on the perimeter wall ""Socialism or Death"". This sets the tone for what is usually a pleasant visit to the city of Holguin. Incoming passengers walk to the terminal where an excellently designed baggage conveyor promptly brings the luggage to be reclaimed. The design of this conveyor requiring passengers simply to reach their suitcases off the belt is in contrast to those at much newer larger UK airports.

One should really work hard with travel planning to avoid going through Oslo airport - Gardermoen. Right now, my wife and I are stuck here for most of a Saturday after a 20 hour flawless travel from Indonesia. The trouble is largely related to very slow baggage handling, the fact that you must clear customs here despite going elsewhere and that there is NO service for a rapid re-check of the baggage after customs. (Like in the USA). I know how this works, but I am certain that many tourists are very confused. You should haul your luggage upstairs and essentially go through the same procedure as if your travel originated in Oslo. You have to suffer through a completely new security check etc. Everyone knows that this is a bad system, the airport officials have traveled the world ""to see how it can be done"", but nothing ever happens.

Only very few areas have stone flooring. Proper signage to for the various airlines and to check-in areas is basically non existent. Security check points are a mess. Passengers are being pushed by TSA staff to hurry up to put their belongings through the x-ray while there is hardly enough space that you can sort your belongings into the plastic containers. That is not what I would consider as a decent passenger service. How about one single jetway for a 747? Especially on disembarking this takes forever.

However long queues at check ins were tiring due to too few check in positions /inefficient staff. There were almost no shops in the waiting areas. When I inquired about the lack of shops I was told that there were very few takers as the rents etc were too high. I have heard that the landing charges etc at Pakistan airports are one of the highest in the world. If true I wonder why. Perhaps the decision makers in Pakistan cannot see beyond their noses.

During my last visit (26 Oct 2012) I was subject to a new rip off they have devised. They advertise parking deals which have to be purchased in advance so I asked to buy the 6 month deal for the advertised tariff of 340 euros. The guy took my money wrote out my receipt and prepared a little plastic 'credit card' for me to use for entry and exit. When I asked why my expiry date was shown as '31st March 2013' he explained that all parking contracts have to start on the first day of the month so despite the date of purchase being 26th Oct my pass had to start on 1st October. Furthermore there was an additional 20 euro fee to issue the card! My other memory of Nimes is the airport restaurant. Service there was so sloppy and slow that despite having nearly two hours available it was never possible to eat all of your rather poor quality overpriced 3 course meal without missing your flight.

I travel between Washington and Montreal at least once a year. However I do not understand why passengers waiting to board are only allowed to enter the gate area minutes before flight time. At a small door an agent checks passports/IDs and boarding pass and passengers enter a smallish lounge. There is only one other door leading to the aircraft.

We waited over 45 minutes being fifth in the line for a one minute process! Just before us a person cut into the line and then the immigration officer spent five minutes arguing with them before sending them away. Ridiculous! At least there were taxis waiting as we walked out. On the return we waited 30 minutes for the counter (Air France) to open only to find yet another problem with our tickets that took 45 minutes to resolve-and then we were lied to by a supervisor about it when he acted like he was doing us a favor just by giving us the seats we had ticketed a year prior. The flight was delayed and there was no place to sit other than a hot humid non-air-conditioned open air space right by the smoking area a few feet away. There was only one snack bar with limited offerings and too many children who were not being properly supervised by their parents. It was like a 3rd world country.

I normally head to LHR but I was tempted to give LTN another try because it's 15 mins from my house by car. Big mistake. I didn't actually think the airport experience could get worse but it has. The short stay car park is a disgrace. It's outrageously expensive, full of potholes, signage that's confusing and faded and there's an obstacle to exit where mopeds are parked next to signs warning not to park there. The security is a joke. Today I had to queue 15 minutes at 4.45am. How can that be justified? Staff are completely disillusioned, rude and generally unhelpful. There is barely any seating in the departure 'lounge' and limited food outlets selling dreadful food but don't worry, there's plenty of space for a huge duty free shop and a shellac nail bar. The toilets are dirty and in a poor state of repair. The newly renovated arrivals area which seems nearly complete has clearly been designed by someone who is blind. The final slap to all customers is the utilitarian railings that force you to walk the length of the 40 metre arrivals room and then back again to exit. This airport doesn't give two hoots about delivering a reasonable customer experience. I won't be coming back.

With the recent opening of the western wing of the airport it now has a total of 24 gates which means it can accommodate 24 planes at a time. The opening of this wing has increased to 40 the number of passport security counters. Obstacles in the air transport sector had been lifted in an effort to boost tourism and as of this year private charter airlines are allowed to operate from Beirut. The Lebanese government has licensed 11 Lebanese-based companies as passenger charter carriers. These new charters will work with Lebanese tour operators but will fly routes on which MEA does not operate. I am sure the industry can carry the weight of competition. A total of 45 airlines now operate out of the BIA the newest one from the Gulf including Oman Air. The fact that most visitors can buy a tourist visa on arrival at the airport is added incentive to travel to Lebanon.

dublin-airport,/airport-reviews/dublin-airport,Dublin Airport customer review,K McCarthy,France,2013-12-16,Literally the best airport I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. The service at the food hall was incredibly Huge inconsistency in services. Aer Lingus check in terminals in particular. 1 machine could not read a passport next could. Bag drop off consists of huge queues at peak times. Half the desks are empty and they prefer to have staff herding passengers around instead of checking them in. No other airport in the world finds it a normal process to have people working full time to pull people from the main queue for the closing flight queue as they know they will miss the flights. In T1 I used to just wait at the closing flight queue instead of waiting for nothing at the normal check in. Then generally if you are on a short haul you may have to walk to gates in T1 anyway. Once had our aircraft brought back to the ramp as they had departed minus 10 passengers due to delays in T2. Security has improved in timings in T2 and found that more organised now but watch out for Aer Lingus sharks monitoring the queue for oversized cabin baggage to send you downstairs again. Airside services are nice and if departing T2 terminal its a pleasant experience just painful to get there. Of course pre clearance for US flights is a great plus. For arrivals prepare to walk and if you arrive in business hours car hire consists of a mini bus to main yards 15 min away. So factor this in unless you go gold with the hire company. Also with car hire Dublin has extra charges for pick up (no clue why as pick up is away from airport) and excess is generally 3000eur.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Indeed design a fab new building but not for the purpose of architectural vanity. You forgot the passenger experience here. I have travelled widely internationally but the distance travelled from check in to my outgoing SQ flight and baggage reclaim from my incoming SQ flight takes some beating quite bonkers. What should be a relatively smooth and stress free transition to and from flights has become a heck of a long walk but at least it got my leg muscles working after a 13 hr flight! As for arriving by the Heathrow Express or Tube - add another 30 mins after you have your bags once you have negotiated the barriers and stranded trolleys. Why are we unable to access these services from within the building rather than having to exit and then descend via slow elevators or escalators? Give me T4 any day. So the important point here is make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to the departure gate indeed the 2-3 hr check-in timeline from ticketing to the gate has never been more relevant with the new T2.,NA,NA,NA,3,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

I think he is well and truly jaded about his job there. After the long shuffle through passport control our bags were collected fast and thank goodness they have now barriers for people to walk through for customs rather than having people cut in line as was the case previously. So they have made an improvement. Having more friendly staff with E passports needs to be addressed, especially with those oldies like me that have never used this technology before. The last thing you want after a long haul overnight flight is to be yelled out for not doing it ""right"", without being told the right way to do it. Funny the biggest problems with Melbourne airport would and could be fixed for free yet they seem reluctant to address them. Odd. Would I recommend?

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,A Meyer,United States,2013-12-03,We were told to arrive 3 hours prior to departure and believe me it was needed. The airport wasn't designed for long lines (pre 9/11) in mind meaning that you go from security screening to the ticket machines (good luck with those) to the passport control hall. This deserves special mention. The hall is too small with too few agents. You enter from above and are usually held at the top of the stairs to prevent people being fed into the breach like cattle. The guards move slowly and there is too little focus on the non-euro zone folks so there will be open positions but they are in the euro zone area so to speak. Once past there (call it 45 min) on to the security check point. Here you will find everyone being shunted through two or three checkpoints despite there are six available (unmanned of course). The only bright moment here was we were traveling with our children and were led to a separate family position where it was shorter. This probably saved us 20 min. Then on to the dash for the airplane. My wife decided to stop for some shopping I gave her the boarding pass. At the gate I was told that I needed my passport and that we all had to board together. My wife shows up and we all pass the check-in gate not 10 feet away we are asked again for our boarding passes. When we finally get on the bus to the plane I was speaking to another passenger he said it was the most baroque system he's ever encountered. I would have to agree. So when they tell you 3 hours plan on 3 hours. With regards to the workers themselves they seemed to be polite etc no issues there. The restrooms were as clean as any I've seen in an airport. It's a shame that they haven't figured out a more efficient way to process people through one of Europe's largest/busiest airports.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

The LAN Chile flight from Santiago to the Falklands was direct and we were a group of tourists scheduled to meet a ship going to Antarctica. Out of our group one passenger's hand luggage and another's suitcase - mine went to Ushiuia Argentina instead the Falklands and we faced a six week polar trip without our important gear. Counting in the check-in and check-out times we went fourteen hours without any significant meal. I was glad I still had a chocolate bar. My advice is to wear everthing you've got even if it means two bras and four underpants.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,Eric McPherson,United Kingdom,2014-03-26,Often depend on a transit airport for my onward flights from the UK to elsewhere in the world) which means we really only have 4 choices from my home airport Manchester which are Heathrow Paris Frankfurt or Amsterdam. Lately we started using Amsterdam simply as it is the best of all the 4 main hubs in Europe and we really enjoy spending some time there. Frankfurt doesn't inspire Paris CDG is a rubbish place to spend some time just a soulless place (unless you have lounge access I guess which we don't have) and we tend to no longer fly BA as it's just to expensive to the destinations we regularly fly to. That leaves Amsterdam and we tried it a few times now and really like it. There's just so much to see and do the range of shops eateries and places to relax are awesome and every pier has something else to offer there's even a museum and if you have the chance to go through customs to go to the railway station you're greeted by a rather large shopping mall as well. Some airport staff recommended we went through customs to go to the roof terrace where we found to our surprise that an airport was parked on the roof for the public to see really cool. I do agree to some comments that security staff at the gate need to learn some manners as some of them are just awful. I guess that's down to translation issues but the Dutch clearly have to learn to add the word 'please' to their vocabulary it just makes all the difference. Airport staff needs to give security staff some proper training as some have very limited English and as a result sound very rude. Overall KLM airline staff are always pleasant to deal with they really stand out from other airlines it is really noticeable. But back to the airport by far the best airport to kill some time in Europe if you depend on a transit airport.

Upon arrival I was greeted with very friendly immigration officials. I left my information documents that I was given to fill out en-route on the plane I didn't realise until I got the counter and went to hand them over. The friendly official was extremely helpful and gave me replacements and helped me fill it in as I looked tired. My bags arrived very quickly through the small carrousel and I was able to pick them up and move to a customs check point. At this point you are randomly picked for checks. I was picked however I was dealt with by another very friendly and helpful official who made me feel very welcome to Mexico. Finally I took a taxi to my hotel. Once out of the control area there is an area with information and helpers on hand to get you a well priced taxi or bus into town.

Comparing to Frankfurt this airport does not cut it for me. Coming in by train with heavy luggage many times the moving staircase at the station did not work which in course caused 50 or more people waiting to use the only elevator available to get to the sky train station finally bringing you to the actual airport. No baggage carts available at the station nor other than in Frankfurt check in facilities right at the station. 5 or 6 times the sky train did not work and substitute transport by bus was arranged. Again a real hassle if you travel with heavy luggage. First spot to find a luggage cart is only to be found after the moving staircase down at the actual airport and that only if you walk out of the airport and pay 2 euros. Hence while also in FRA you have to pay for luggage carts it does not reflect any international standard. One repeating deficiency is the security personnel (not Federal Police but private contractors) after immigration. While immigration is very professional fast and friendly the security staff are while obviously effective very unfriendly in their with no doubts not easy job. I do not expect any entertainment or similar while passing security but the words please and thank you are considered basic respect and education.

We queued for 40 mins only to be told when we got to the desk that we had to check in at another desk as we had '4 S's' on our check-in card. We then queued for another 1.5 and endeavoured to get help from a staff member (who were extremely rude and uncaring). Basically we had half an hour to get through a vigorous security check (due to having 4S's on our boarding cards). No matter how many times we told them at our flight was due they just made us hang around. We had to run to the departure gate after hearing our names being called numerous times.

A long walk with no assistance from the railway station to the passport control followed by another very long walk - about 15 minutes - to the airport lounge which included climbing a flight of stairs and a 5 minute walk along a rough shelter on the rooftop. Then the same in reverse as part of another 15 minute walk (with one travelator for a short section) to get to the gate.

Immigration staff seemed to have little concern in processing people speedily they were slow to get set up and there were frequent personnel changes at the desks. The management of the queues is amateur at best with passengers being moved between lines on an apparently random basis. I would have been very concerned if I had been try to catch a connecting flight. The line to clear customs was the worst I have experienced with several passengers being selected for further checks. What should have been a prompt start to a drive to Palm Spring turned into a very slow drive through the LA traffic.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,Johnny Tung,United Kingdom,2011-05-30,Arrived at Gatwick very late at night after a bank holiday break and flight delay. My flight was parked in the far end of North terminal and then we were shuttled to the south terminal. Normally I quite like the shuttle transport since it saves time walking and passengers are sent right outside the immigration section. It was a totally different story this time. Actually since they carried out renovation the immigration service has been poor. Last time when I came back the immigration officer cared more about the comfort of her chair and was chatting to her colleague rather than doing her job checking my passport. The immigration hall was packed with passenger at 11pm at night. I have never seen such a long queue and chaos in a civilised country. Because of the renovation work they removed Iris check so one option of faster track was removed. No special line for business class passengers either. There were empty desks that weren't being used and the queue even extended outside the door. Luckily for passengers with EU passports the wait is only 10-15 minutes. I did feel sympathetic for passengers not holding EU passports since the process was very slow the queue was just too long. It is a shame for the airport owners who acquired this airport not long time ago and have since then given themselves good dividend.

When the bus finally arrived we took a 10 minute ride and then experienced another 10 minute wait this time on the bus. When I finally reached the airport I was greeted by an extremely un-appealing old building with a construction filled hallway that went on for at least 2 or 3 km's. No air conditioning and it was an almost 30 degree day but I have noticed that this is a pattern in European airports. Reached what I thought was customs but turned out to be more security only 3 different security doors which caused a gigantic line the scanner must have been very sensitive because I saw no one make it through without a pat down including me even though I was cleared in Vancouver. When I got through I realized what was first over an hour was now only 30 minutes and I saw yet another queue this one for a train. When I got off the train and through another gigantic line for customs I had only 15 minutes. After another long walk through the depths of FRA the hallway split revealing another line when passed through I was running I just made my flight by seconds where surprise surprise I was loaded onto a bus And all this after a 9 hour flight.

I appreciate there may not be full availability of staff as it was Sunday afternoon but overall I feel this is poor planning on the part of the authorities. There was a group of officers standing in one booth chatting and seemingly indifferent to the melee forming in this hall. They are undoubtedly aware of the number of overseas flights and should plan for pax arrivals accordingly. After a long wait two more desks were finally opened to process more people thus causing a mini stampede. No security search on arrival this time around (I have commented on this previously and wondered why this was). Pax are now permitted and actively encouraged by staff to put their suitcases on the train rather than use their slow belt system after clearing Customs. Orlando has a nice departures area which a wide range of shops and restaurants (particularly landside but airside is good too especially when compared with some other US airports).

Arrival was ok luggage belts a mess but finally we got our things. Departure was the horror! Besides the temperature the airport was packed with people with literally not a centimeter space between each other and their luggage to walk trough. To get from one counter to the other we had to leave the airport building at one exit to enter it at another! There were no proper signs nobody to ask! Finally other passengers told us where the x-ray for the luggage is. That's a scandal I am sorry! A passenger has really to queue 4 times minimum until reaching the plane. First you queue at the check in (if you are lucky: in the building) then you queue at the x-ray (so you finally have found it and could get rid of your bags) then you queue at the passport control and then you queue at the security check. Then you reach a completely overcrowded waiting area with one duty free (where we bought some wine and oil and the cashier graciously handed us a plastic bag - not even thinking about making any extra effort to put the goods into the bag - I had to do it on my own - that's real service congratulations). We found two really friendly people helping us the rest was either arrogant bored annoyed or overstrained. This airport is a service desert! Crete was nice but our holiday mood was gone that moment entering this airport. Improving this fully underdimensioned airport would cost a fortune - true but I don't see any will for change at all reading the comments dating back to 2004.

As an experienced traveler this airport has to be the most disorganized one I have ever seen. In order to check in you have to put your bag on the counter afterwards you have to take it again (as this is only done to check the weight) and leave it on another drop- off counter; there were only three of those drop-off areas for 20 counters in total so I let you imagine what it looked like with nearly all of them being used. Airport facilities are dire no exchange desk poor restaurant services very rude security agents illegible FIDS screens everything badly indicated including the flight gate. All this was pretty reminiscent of the old Athens Hellinikon airport (definitely not a compliment for those who remember it).

It's been built on stupid and inhuman principles and thus nothing works properly and the staff give the impression they hate their jobs. Even if they make an effort they're always depressed about it. Terminal 1 resembles a torture chamber' Terminals 2A and B are hard to access and a sorry mess. There's a rapid transport system that goes round the airport but carefully misses these 2 out. Terminals 2C and D are ugly badly served and depressing. Terminal 2E is an over the top opulent show off of a terminal where everything looks pretty and nothing (and no one) works. I believe Terminal 2F is being refurbished and about time too. Worst of the lot is Terminal 2G. Firstly it's not in Terminal 2 at all nowhere near any of the other terminals in a different part of the region there's one bus that leaves from one place only from all the others isn't properly sign-posted and when you get there you find all the planes are due to leave in bunches at the same time which of course means they all leave late. The staff seem to be even more depressed than in the other terminals and outside you'll find stranded passengers trying to work out where to go to next.

If you can avoid evening departures as this is when the live musicians play in the center area causing an already noisy airport ambience to become even worse. If you can avoid early morning flights as the TSA security theater is made worse by inadequate entrances resulting in lines that stretch the length of the terminal. For those with checked in luggage the lengthy wait times upon arrival can be problematic; however the airport restrooms are some of the best in the US. AUS has both a good heel bar and an excellent massage kiosk.

Memories of past experiences with post-soviet airports are all too clear. They've made the effort its evident but its still no where near the standards of 'world hubs'. If there's one thing that's hit me over the years at this airport its the sheer over-crowding probably because everyone's moved from Sheremtyevo. Anyway they still have the annoying scheme of scanning the baggage before you even enter the building. Im all up for security but surely this is crossing the line. Its a job weaving your way through the terminal with heavy baggage endless numbers of people explainable by the fact we were travelling in the winter season back to London. No electronic check-in scheme so there was a long queue. Surprisingly clean airport still with the aroma of cigarettes but the interior looks modern enough. Immigration very swift security was average. Busy busy busy is all I can say afterwards. There's the lack of those wide open walking areas or rest areas with huge ceilings that you get in 5-star airports in Asia. We found it hard to find anywhere to eat although when we did it was ridiculously expensive! Lack of seats duty-free shops also very expensive. There's no doubt that Moscow has made great strides since the Soviet and Post-soviet era but its still miles off the 5-star spectrum.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,S Frith,United Kingdom,2015-05-10,I flew from this airport on Sunday 5th April 2015 to Reykjavik along with my mother on EasyJet flight EZY6001 our first time of flying with this firm and from this airport. After going to the baggage drop-off and having my suitcase weighed and labelled I mentioned that it was hand luggage and the member of staff said he did not know what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but it would be more than helpful if there were signs saying where passengers with just hand luggage have to go to check in rather than have them queue in the wrong place. It would also be helpful if there could be signs (or staff) telling people well in advance when they will need to show their passport / boarding cards and what needs to be placed in the trays for scanning rather than wait until passengers are at the scanners and therefore causing unnecessary delays. On the return journey (EZY6002 on 9 April 2015) we were rudely told to show the glossy photo to the scanner and stand on the footprints on the floor. My mother and I had no idea what the two female members of staff meant and eventually one of them took my passport and showed the photo to the scanner but once we stood on the footprints the two members of staff wandered off leaving us unsure what to do next - the picture on the machine was confusing. After several minutes the two staff members were altered to the fact that we were still standing on the footprints and returned to tell us we could go through the gate all of which could have been prevented if the staff had taken the time to explain the procedure and waited to check that we had understood rather than wander off for a gossip! Finally could all airport staff remember that they do their job every day and know the routine but a lot of the travellers going through this airport may be a nervous first time flyers in a different country or tired from a long haul or early flight and would appreciate being treated with courtesy and having any problems dealt with politely. Travellers can be stopped from flying if they are aggressive or rude to staff so could airport workers return the courtesy as good manners cost nothing but go a long way!,NA,NA,NA,5,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Unfortunately the passenger flow design for return connections from USA to other Canadian airports (even if you're flying with the same airline) is stupid - passengers have to deplane collect their luggage (several large carousels) and then wait in line with many other passengers regardless of connection flight or not then re-check your luggage and sprint to the other end of the airport and redo security with all the other pax getting on for the first time.

When I connected through Paris I had to leave the secure area with the complete family just to start the security mess all over again. The passenger walk areas are packed with lines so it is very hard to get from one side to another. We got separated multiple times. To get from one flight to another requires a lot of walking and mind reading. I do not know what the airport planners had on their mind when they planned this mess. Signs are a joke. You have to know what gate belongs to what terminal. Before the customs some firm is checking that your carry- on is not overweight. If so they send you back to the lines to check in the personal items you do not want to check-in. It does not matter if you are just connecting. The staff that tries to help are untrained and can't even read boarding passes. Air conditioning seems to be not existent. Food in the new Terminal is awful. They offer microwave food to self microwave it. Is that French cuisine? Microwaves are without English instruction sets. We watched several people messing up their food because they only have instructions on the box and appliances. Besides the usual laptop the security wanted every cable iPod iPad usb stick phone camera lenses plugs outside in the plastic bin. The very rude security people did not care if the belt pushed the bins on top of each other making items falling to the ground.

Equally there are competing parking firms one of which appears to be the official on-line firm for the main car park it is not. It appears that many people pay this other firm online arrive at the airport and then have to pay the top rate at the official car park.

I had liquids in a sealable plastic sandwich bag which I have used to go through airports on several continents including Belfast but on the last occasion the woman at security decided after it had been through the scanner that it was too big and would have to buy two smaller ones from their machine. She wouldn't allow me to put my goods in the new bags and tried to do it herself. When I objected to her handling it her boss snarled at me and insisted on doing it himself with bare hands. I then put it back in my original bag while he watched and said nothing. In other airports security staff are not only reasonably pleasant but wear gloves to handle personal possessions.

We saw several passengers at security who asked staff to let them through as they were going to miss their flights.

Let's be honest - queues at Security and Passport Control are standard just about everywhere nowadays. Once through and out of the retail mall that most airports now are we found plenty of seats tucked away in quiet corners. Coming back in on 8 December bit of a queue at Passport control and for once a 30 minute wait for baggage. Apart from that a breeze.,NA,NA,NA,8,3,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,Chris Trafford,Australia,2013-06-06,Having taken more than 50 flights in and out of Melbourne over the past 2 years I feel qualified to offer an opinion. Most of my flights have been to Asia where most of the airports are way better. Almost unbelievably I would rather fly in and out of Mumbai than Melbourne! The international arrivals area is an absolute disgrace where the queues are long the baggage carousels are way too small the whole area crowded and poorly organised and the staff officious and unhelpful. Most airports have free wifi to provide a helpful service to their customers Melbourne no. Melbourne as the world's most liveable city is being very poorly served by a shocking sub standard airport. Sadly I have no confidence that this will improve in the foreseeable future. If there was an alternative I would use it no question.

In all it took me 40 minutes to be at the airport station whereby I joined the bus link to the terminal building. The terminal was large and the shops plentiful. There was no adverse problems with security or check in formalities that I would not expect at any other airport.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,Jack O'Brien,NA,2007-05-07,I am a frequent traveller to Geneva Airport. I was dissapointed with the lack of organisation that went into baggage collection. Those of you who have been there will know that there are 7 or 8 baggage collection carousels and most of them are in use at the one time. If you take skis or snowboards away with you there is a total lack of organisation when you try to reclaim these items at the airport. There is always a rugby scrum/free for all when you try an collect your items. Most of the items after being taken off the aircraft are just left on the floor in the middle of the room with the carousels in (which is not very big as it is) and with the floor space being taken up by skis and snowboards there is never any room to move. There is also a significant absence of baggage trolleys available and usually these are not available for quite some time after you leave the plane which causes a lot of frustration and inconvenience especially for those who take small children away with them. When flying out fromt he airport on the return journey I found the experience slightly more pleasant than when I was arriving. Although i would say that a little more thought could have gone in to naming and numbering of the gates. There is a very complicated system of numbers and letters which results in a very large hike round the airport just to find the correct gate. Apart fromt this lack of organisation the airport has lots of duty free shops selling a range of items and plenty of bars and restaurants. I would describe the overall service provided as fair.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
hannover-airport,/airport-reviews/hannover-airport,Hannover Airport customer review,Simon Albury,United Kingdom,2014-11-20,A great and unexpected experience. I paid a UK travel agent CubaDirect £70 for VIP arrival and transfer to Inglaterra Hotel (all my other arrangements were independent). The VIP went faster than I thought possible. Had to wait with the agent for some other passengers to emerge from the plane and then was taken to the VIP lounge and offered a drink. After a few minutes and before I could start the drink another English speaking agent who had collected my luggage escorted me through the Diplomatic immigration desk through customs x ray to landside where I was met by a third agent who looked after my luggage while the second agent took me at my request to change money. With money changed a car was immediately ready for the transfer. By any measure this was an expensive service and there are ways of getting it cheaper but I felt it was worth it. For the return I arrived at the airport I arrived at 4.45 pm. No queue for Virgin Upper class and negligible queues for other classes. Only two ahead of me to pay departure tax and when I wanted to change CUCs into Euros I was given priority at another window and a good rate of exchange. The emigration and x ray lines were short and in little time I was in the VIP lounge. This lounge is simple by international standards with a limited range of drinks and little more than ham and cheese rolls and slices of cheese to eat - but the seating was comfortable enough and the air-conditioning was rather fierce which seems to be the norm for Cuba. There is no Wifi.

amman-queen-alia-airport,/airport-reviews/amman-queen-alia-airport,Amman Queen Alia Airport customer review,Charles Roberts,NA,2007-01-21,A fairly horrible airport although sometimes with helpful staff. There are hardly any places to sit and the security is very tight - which means that you might or might not be able to visit an airline office since you have to enter the area where only departing passengers are allowed. I was lucky and the guard decided to let me through to change a ticket - but gave my traveling companion a hard time. There are few places to sit the bathrooms are quite gross and it's very smoky. The only thing going for it is that the exchange counter by the visa desk offers a rate of exchange often much better than the hotels in Amman. If you are getting a taxi from the airport there are slips with pre-set rates (pretty good) which you should be given when you hire a cab - but that doesn't always happen.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The boarding process at Terminal 3 is to say the least chaotic. Especially if your flight involves being bussed from the terminal to where your plane is parked and because of this (notwithstanding the tight connection times between a lot of Etihad flights) they never seem to leave on time. Facilities do leave a lot to be desired. With planned construction of a new terminal building you hope that issues such as being bussed to and from terminals (abnormal in today's era of international airports) and chaotic boarding are ironed out.

It's also a lot cheaper to fly from Shenzhen to Bangkok and you don't have the hassle of double immigration you have to pass when you fly from Hong Kong. Finding the terminal and a place to park is not easy if you can't read Chinese. The Chinese directions are large and the ones in English very small. First time I picked up my wife it took 3 laps around the airport before I finally found the place where I could park my car. Finding the check in counter for international flights is also not easy when you have to do this the first time - now we know where to go but the first time it was very confusing and time consuming. Information monitors are everywhere and for all domestic (Chinese) flights it's clear where to check in. International flights however use a counter that you can't see when you stand in the departure hall - just look around you can't find it. I asked for help at the general information desk but there was nobody available who could speak English (so much for an international airport) We found it ourselves; you have to go all the way to the left when you walk in and then there is still no sign; you have to go thru a healthy checkpoint where you still can't see the check in counters - non-passengers are not allowed in so my wife called me that she found the check in - crazy!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Why are we complaining about the flight times /train bus links etc. They are no better from/to Glasgow Airport - in fact Glasgow does not have a train link that you can WALK to in less than 5 mins - it's a bus to Paisley. The restrictions to parking commented on by one reviewer are due to security - nothing to do with wanting more cash for parking - its the same at Glasgow now. Prestwick has all you could want from an airport - somewhere to eat - the food in the restaurant before you go to departures is fine and not too expensive for an airport. You then walk all of 30 steps to the departures which have never at any time I have been there been queued. Small duty free but there isn't many places in Europe you can actually benefit from duty free now. Plenty to eat and drink in departures and even an outside smoking area for those who indulge.

One would think that it would be enough especially on a Tuesday afternoon. Not so. Canadian Customs clearance was relatively quick but upon arriving in the baggage pick up area and once finding the carousel for my flight as passengers congregated around it and waited and waited and waited. On board the West Jet flight it was announced bags should begin to arrive 20 mins after arrival. In fact it was about 45 mins before the bags started to trickle down and an hour before most bags seemed to arrive. Now depart this baggage area and looking for place to drop connecting bags off and again an area of mass confession. People everywhere one huge lineup that everyone got into then 10 mins later a worker said if only need to drop bags go around this corner. Fine 100 plus folks do this only to find another lineup waiting to drop bags on a belt that seemingly did not work. Slow slow slow! With 45 mins to spare I go out of this area to find that I must go upstairs and clear security again. Next big lineup about 300 people lined up to clear security in a queue that did not move. When I queried a worker about my flight leaving soon was put in a shorter line but this queue did not move either. Long and short of it made it to my flight literally as the door shut behind me. 2 hours of stress!

Queues for Passport/Immigration have become ridiculous. Earlier this year the queues zig-zagged out of the arrivals hall and down the ramp. Thought this was a one off issue having used the airport many times previously and never experienced any real problems. Not so. It is now the norm. Took in excess of 1 hour 30 mins in queues on both occasions just to get to the Immigration/Passport desk. Once at the desk all formalities completed in a couple of minutes. The reason for the huge queues is that very few Immigration desks are manned. Officers are employed to look at the queues and then disappear only to emerge minutes later to do the same again. eparting was so much faster. A real breeze.

Told by rep that airport very busy on a Saturday in high summer with up to 100 flights! Told that this is only a problem during high summer- hence why Split Airport is still relatively small. Had a stroke of luck though when our tour rep rang ahead and informed us that the outside check-ins had been opened just for us! Walked straight off the coach and to the three/four little desks that are positioned outside under canopies. Baggage checked in and x-rayed here and put straight onto a luggage cart you cannot get better than that! I admit we were lucky as inside the terminal there were large queues for checking in- but surely in high summer queues are to be expected. Security relatively swift much quicker than the 30-45 minutes of queues in Manchester which Was a nightmare. Departure lounge small and only two small cafes and a couple of duty frees which were extremely busy. Staff in airport were friendly enough toilets were kept clean and tidy certainly alot cleaner than the ones at Manchester. Had to be bused out to the plane which was only a short distance away (had walked to terminal from aircraft on arrival) but the airport was a lot busier than when we had arrived.

Departure was just a nightmare. Queuing all over the airport in lines you could not identify counters used by staff that was unable to speak a single word English or German (flight went to CGN) and had to use a travel assistant to translate everything we said. Airport was horribly overcrowded. There was no space not a centimeter left. After we thought our baggage was checked in we were told to take it back go to another counter and have it x-rayed there. This never happened to me before and I have been flying quite frequently in my life. What a stupid organization. People around you were quite rushy. The security check is just a joke. I left all my jewelry and belt on had liquids in my bag but they just did not care. No one was interested we could have easily taken anything into security area. The ""gates"" are funny too. It is unbelievable how easily people manage to get out (for a walk?!) on the runway they probably search for their airplanes themselves. Flight was delayed we were not informed. There were two monitors in the whole hall one suddenly went out of order. The hall was overcrowded no place to sit very uncomfortable light no facilities to go to except for a duty free shop and a sandwich store and there was just not a single person feeling responsible for telling us something about our flight. It was not even orally announced delayed when it would have been time for boarding already. The staff controlling the tickets and letting the people walk outside the terminal to the planes seemed extremely swamped several planes were delayed by many hours there was one flight that had a delay of far more than ten hours. They were just unable (or unwillling?) to control who went outside the building. Most of the time staff was busy giving final calls for noshow passengers calling them again and again... and again.

Came out of the channel and the Arrivals Hall was very crowded and small made worse by a convenience store taking up so much space. On my return check-in was very quick and proceeded through the Arrivals Hall up another level to security. Security was very quick too.

johannesburg-or-tambo-airport,/airport-reviews/johannesburg-or-tambo-airport,Johannesburg Airport customer review,Darren Tan,Singapore,2011-07-01,The airport was quite spacious. However airport staff need to improve on their attitude and service. There was a long queue for the immigrations counter. When I reached the immigrations counter they demanded to see my boarding pass for my return flight to Singapore which is totally unnecessary at any other airport I've travelled to so far. However the boarding pass for my return flight was with the local tour guide whom had already checked out earlier. A tussle had to go on for about 20 mins before I was allowed to check out of the local immigrations after the return flight boarding pass was shown. There was another staff to guide the queue and the immigrations counter but she seemed rather lost once the queue started to get messy. A rather unpleasant experience. 1 week later I returned to the airport for a flight back to Singapore - this time round I didn't get pass the security screening because of my metal belt. I was given a body check by a local security staff and he was pretty rude. He started touching my entire body very thoroughly (not the usual body check) and was laughing and started talking to his colleague in the local language. He seemed to be making a joke out of the whole process. Yet another unpleasant experience. Waiting time to board the plane was not too bad though people had to board the plane in batches as everyone had to take a bus that brought us to the middle of the runway where we climbed the steps up the plane.

Perhaps it's an attempt to make you spend time in the duty-free shops which are well- stocked but charge rip-off prices for everything (two or three times what a supermarket in the UK would charge). Smoking is permitted in the terminal building and it can be difficult to find a place to sit or eat that is not smoky.

There was no signs or members of staff advising people of this information. I then had to re-queue at a separate line for 30 mins to be greeted by a very unfriendly and stressed staff member.

Whilst going through security I was pushed aside by a member of the ""poliza"" security personnel.

An employee pushing two wheelchairs at once had to do the same turn-around and didn't use the walkways. The spur that included our new gate had only three food services (the other one had more) all run by the same company with no cooked food except one was making breakfast egg sandwiches. I asked for one without meat and was told it wasn't possible. They seemed to be making them from scratch! I settled for a very good yoghurt parfait but would have preferred something more substantial. Most staff were incredibly helpful but one needed additional training. None of the food services on our spur had a vegetarian sandwich of any kind. We've had easy food choices at many airports and while traveling throughout Arizona for two weeks so Phoenix's attitude seemed very obtuse. Many people have dietary needs or preferences for a variety of reasons. The airport itself is close to downtown Phoenix easy to reach. The free wifi worked fine.

We had 1 hour 15 minutes to boarding and 2 hours to flight departure and only just made the flight. Indeed our flight was delayed due to the need to wait for passengers still in security. The transfer bus drove out of the airport and in to the traffic jam of cars entering the airport (1 hour). Security was ridiculous and could easily have taken the two hours alone. Fortunately a group of us managed to persuade a very unhelpful guard to open a 'quicker queue' barrier (45 minutes) plus time to find boarding gate meaning we arrived at the plane at the departure time. Many of our companion transferees missed their flights. There were no members of staff able or accessible to assist.

It's become a personal challenge to see how friendly and polite I can be and still get a surly response! This last trip I flew on Delta through Terminal Three which is showing its age with filthy worn carpet broken seats at the gates and broken fixtures in the bathrooms. The ticket counter agents were surly the TSA personnel were yelling at passengers the bartender at the Taverna restaurant was carding everybody including a surprised white haired old man in his seventies who proceeded to drop all his stuff on the floor while trying to find his ID and all the time the bartender was loudly slagging her managers. Wendy's had a long line that didn't seem to be moving the Delta/Sky West gate agent was curt to the point of rudeness and the flight was almost an hour late with no announcements. I should mention that in both Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 most of the shops and eateries close very early sometimes as early as 4:30 PM well before the evening flights leave. I can't count the number of times I've been stuck behind security with literally more than a thousand passengers who have no place to eat or drink. Sorry while all of that may be typical of the pathetic state of air travel in the USA these days none of it says ""friendly"" to me. To top it off the drunken-sounding automated announcer mangles names to the point of unintelligibility. On the return it is common to wait forty-five minutes or more for a checked bag. On the good side the free Internet usually works the taxi stands are very convenient to the baggage claim and economy parking is cheap at $8 a day.

After all the stinging criticism of the Departures Immigration problems when I departed 2 weeks ago I discovered these have been partly solved with more staff and the introduction of a snake queue system. So having seen that this works why is it that the management of this airport still insist on no snake system at Arrivals? Worst of all last night was the almost complete absence of public taxis at 01.00 am. The queue for these snaked right back into the building. Trying then to get back up to Arrivals level to take one of the notoriously expensive Airport Limousine Taxis I discovered that despite an abundance of escalators and moving walkways you can not get back up! Either they are deliberately switched off or there is a guard on duty who will not permit you to access them! There are also lifts but even these will not permit access to the Arrivals level!

Its noticeable how the efforts are trying to be made by Heathrow as a whole to try and improve its status (terminal 5 being a prime example) but there is still room for improvement. Interior looks very dated. Transaero seem to have their check-in zone tucked away from the main area so its a bit of a task trying to locate it. When we arrived there was an ominous-looking queue and we had noticed that the delayed take-off kept on getting extended every 5 minutes! Turned out that our plane was still in Moscow because of the weather so there was a 6-hour delay at most. We were given £25 to spend each in the airport though which explained the queue. Security was surprisingly swift very friendly staff. Giraffe restaurant very good not too expensive. Waiting seats are very hard comparable to park benches. Free Wi-Fi and good range of plug sockets. Something striking is the very long distances to walk to gates. It was a good 10 minute walk even with travelators! On return taxi to gate was very swift and we left the plane quickly. Immigration is in desperate need of a review in terms of services. Very long queues insufficient tables for filling out details (for some reason we weren't given them on the plane). Very grateful to the assistant who led us to the front because of the children (we had already waited 40 minutes).

Bus to terminal then straight outside. Note that the ordinary bus terminates at Moskovsky Prospekt Metro station - you also have to pay double (38 roubles instead of 19) if you have a suitcase (same on the Metro - 44 roubles instead of 22 and you get a different coloured token to operate the luggage gate). From what I could find out (but I may be wrong) there are no longer any buses from the airport right through to Moskovsky Railway Station. Outbound also easy - quick check-in unless you're using Aeroflot whose queues snake around the building. No-fuss security was quick (English-speaking security officers). Landside flight announcements are all made in English as well as Russian but airside I could only hear Russian. Landside has all the usual shops - news-stand gift shop cafes etc. Food prices are extortionate - 135 roubles for a croissant that costs 20 in any local bakery. Airside only has a bar gift shop (closed - my flight was 7.30 am) and news-stand. WiFi apparently available as plenty of people were using laptops. Be careful if your flight is from Gates 1 to 6 - these are in the satellite terminal in the middle of the tarmac so you have to go downstairs from the departure lounge use a travelator out to the satellite then upstairs into the gate area.

To be fair the airline has its own terminal so this review relates to that one. The Air Asia terminal has no transit facilities - so you need to enter Malaysia and then exit via Immigration. So be sure you have a visa if you need one. You can only check in for your continuing flight about 2 hours before departure and there are few facilities available before you get to the departure gates (after immigration). There are very few chairs and the crowds are huge so don't expect to find a place to sit. The air conditioning hardly works and KL is a hot tropical city. Its less comfortable than most Greyhound bus stops in the US in fact its the worst air terminal I have ever had to go through. Availability of food or drink in the check-in area is very limited. Bathrooms are dirty and several facilities are broken. This is an awful terminal in almost every respect - so I won't go on and on.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Robin Marshall,France,2012-05-09,I wonder if Bristol airport management fully appreciate the contempt that I and many other passengers have felt after using them for the first (and definitely last) time. They charge £2 un-refundable for a trolley. The £2 becomes a tax on being elderly or disabled and that for me encapsulates everything about Bristol airport. I had to pay £1 to get my rental car out of the forecourt and another £1 to get back in.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,S Jellin,United States,2010-12-12,BOM is a disaster even in it's newer state. First problem is the lack of signs and communication for international transit passengers. You follow one sign that basically takes right outside the building where you stand and swelter in the Mumbai heat waiting to be allowed in. Secondly once you're in there are no seats in which to rest while waiting for your flight check-in desk to open. Then they have this great rule that even if you have a multiple entry visa and are travelling on the same itinerary you need to go to a special immigration office and wait while they take the longest photocopies in the world of your documentation. Then after they separate men and women in security; they put these bizzare tags on your hand luggage and stamp them. They are secured with but a string which makes they easily lost. And god help you if you are connecting to the domestic terminal in short order. The process has to be the most inefficient and uncoordinated thing I have ever seen in an international airport. Also be prepared. You will go through no less than 4-5 security screenings; no matter what you're doing in the airport. And they don't move at any other speed than slow in BOM. In terms of cleanliness I was surprised by how clean the restrooms were in the international terminal however the domestic terminal is revolting. There was even a well- fed rat that ran across the terminal floor as we sat and languished for hours with nothing to do waiting for our flight.

The gift shop was closed and another coffee stand was also closed .When the coach arrived to take us to the plane people gathered round in a 'rugby scrum' pushing and shoving to get their boarding pass processed. Some old man ran from the back and just barged everybody out of the way the get on the coach first .There was no order and no queuing system .I have never seen anything like this in my life.

I think that this hidden gem of an US airports would deserve more international traffic to Europe and could become an alternative for those wanting to avoid the other airports on the US East Coast.

It is very large so I imagine it can cope when busy although I have seen it only in two Januarys. Spain's new smoking laws are relatively effective thus quite properly limiting the impact of the filthy habit in the terminal although the restrictions are not well observed by arriving passengers. The toilets were many and very clean. Food outlets seem limited.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Russell Edwards,United Kingdom,2012-05-31,As a frequent flyer all I can say is how embarrassing this airport is as gateway to our country. When you do finally get there after queuing on the roads to get near the airport you then find everything is set up to fleece the traveller out of their hard earned cash right from the drop off area through to the boarding gate. Staff are aggressive and moody gum chewing security personnel seem to be in abundance but its still painfully slow also usually chaotic and overcrowded. Now the new overflow security channels are open which issue forth to the old terminal area - so if you want to use the facilities in the main terminal its a 10 minute walk and don't even think about buying the fast track ticket for security (which went up 25% from £3 to £4 last week) as you will be turned away if they are sending you to the overflow security channels.

brussels-zaventem-airport,/airport-reviews/brussels-zaventem-airport,Brussels Zaventem Airport customer review,M Mayer,Austria,2013-01-10,The airport does what it needs to do but no more. Access - by bus in/out: long waiting outside overloaded no space for baggage connecting with public transport requires carrying luggage down on crowded narrow stairs - very uncomfortable! By train: in house sometimes very dirty trains no space for baggage - more comfortable better access to the public transport system. Taxis are comfortable but hard to find at first time. Inside walking distances - Prepare yourself for long walks changing levels 3 times up and down on escalators and a huge queue in front of the security screening area in the evenings. Plan 60 mins to arrive at the boarding gate as net fast walk time exceeds 20 mins and wait time at the screening can take 30 mins. Toilets - There are many toilets they are easy to find. There are no toilets in the lounges. Flight information - There is usually no gate information on the screens until -30 of departure but it will be printed on the boarding pass at check-in. WIFI is available but expensive. Restaurants are good but expensive. Lounges are overloaded with people in the evening. The food is far below average. Boarding goes smoothly and usually directly from the terminal over a gangway. Baggage claim - Expect your luggage to be late.

This is all going to change I'm afraid when the ubiquitous airbridges are installed making arriving in Adelaide the same as arriving anywhere else. It isn't so long ago that they had a cattle grid at the entrance to the car park! The international terminal is simply vile at present (April 2005). A huge queue at the check-in section even though all counters were operating - a total of about 10 altogether. Could they be just terribly inefficient in Adelaide? Or super-security conscious? Arrival back at the international terminal is similarly dreadful: exhausted pax who have hung around at Darwin or Sydney for a few hours in the middle of the night have to wait in another very slow queue with those hard to steer trolleys . Let's hope all this improves when the new terminal is completed at the end of 2005!

This is a fairly normal situation and one I am told the airport authorities have taken up with the Police (who provide the passport officials) and who refuse to do anything. could probably live with that if it were real security if they were checking passports if the process made us safer. Our passports are all in leather covers as I handed them towards him he waved me through without even looking inside - the covers could in fact have been empty. Is this security?

Again it was a Wednesday and the queues for some of the charters went out of the building. Security - a definite joke - seeing this was after some of the new regulations had come into force and Cyprus being part of the European Community. The two guys checking hand baggage were busy chatting to each other and didn't look once at the security screen which had screened luggage. My daughter returned from Paphos before Christmas and again Security was a joke. Bearing in mind that liquids etc. should be in ziplock type bags in quantities of less than 100ml. My daughter had completely forgotten about the rules and had her full make up bag in her carry on case together with her laptop. Security let her through without any questions about make up or making her take her laptop out.

Having planned to spend the day exploring Slovakia's beautiful capital I was rather intrigued to find out that the left luggage office 'had been closed for security reasons'. A friendly employee suggested that I could leave my luggage at the train station (a 20' taxi ride and at some distance from the city centre) which I first took to be a joke. When I then tried to check into my SkyEurope flight a mere seven hours before take-off the attendant said this was impossible because 'in the meantime the luggage might get lost'. For me the outcome of this extremely customer-unfriendly and rather absurd policy was to hit the central bus station (which is only somewhat closer to the centre than the railway station but still a 15' taxi ride if there is no traffic congestion) whereby I lost over an hour of precious Bratislava-time.

incheon-airport,/airport-reviews/incheon-airport,Incheon Airport customer review,Trent Tan,Singapore,2013-07-17,Transit security checks is a nightmare which can take as much as 1 hour to complete. How can an international airport be so inefficient when it comes to security checks? Poor management of tax refund verification prior to entering the secured area. The requirement is for passengers who want to claim tax refunds to first obtain their boarding pass and check-in their luggage before proceeding to get the tax refund slips verified. While this information is stated at the tax refund counter who would have seen the signs when there is always queue blocking the tax refund area. I was not the only one to have queued up reached the counter after 10mins and told to get my boarding pass and luggage check first. Apparently common sense is lacking here in putting up clear signs and information to inform passengers about tax refund procedure. The GREEN movement in Korea is worth commending but the stuffiness and the stale air in most parts of the airport are not welcomed. They should reconsider giving passengers a more comfortable experience by easing their strict temperature control. Insufficient basic facilities such as seating area or power points in the transit area. Except for the gates I don't believe I find any seats or power points in the shopping area or restaurant area of the airport. It is not a big problem but I would think that wouldn't it be better to just provide such basic facilities for those who are on long transits so that they wouldn't have to be stuck at the gate area just to get a seat or just to plug in their laptops/handphones.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,S Dissanayeke,United Kingdom,2014-09-01,Never have I been to an airport where there is such a lack of common human decency. I was travelling with a group that included my mother who had a large leg ulcer my heavily pregnant sister and a 22 month old toddler. Security was like being led into a cattle pen with no divisions for crowd control until half way through. Reaching the scanners took around half an hour. Once we made it to the scanners my mother sister baby and brother in law were all 'randomly' picked for frisking delaying us even further. A 20 minute walk to the boarding gate was difficult for both my mother and sister and despite asking for help for my mother three times it was refused as we hadn't booked assistance 24 hours early and were helpfully told that we would miss the flight! Which we did! Then we were told to return to security so another long walk back except this was not where we had to go! My exhausted heavily pregnant sister then tried to buy some water before we continued wandering round the airport trying to find the right place to be but the cashier refused to sell it because she had accidentally brought the wrong boarding pass into the shop! A kind woman behind her in the queue took pity and bought it for her. A security officer about to go on his tea break then sees my mother and realising that she is in distress and helped us by leading us to the right place to reclaim our baggage. Here was the only decent person we met working at this airport. We picked up our baggage and then went to Ryanair customer services where my mother and sister found some seats to sit down and rest. We had been at the airport since 5.00 and it was now 8.00 so they had been on their feet for three hours. However they were then approached by a member of staff and told that they couldn't sit in those seats as they were for people needing special assistance! Several seats were empty so they hadn't been preventing others from having a seat. At this point no one wanted to fly from this dreadful airport and we booked Eurostar tickets and left. Just leaving the environment to Stansted improved everyone's mood. What a horrible nasty place to be.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

On arrival we had to wait at immigration control and after a long wait it turned out that we were sold the wrong tourist visas. The counter for visas was already closed when immigration officers noticed wrong visas so we had to wait for the counter to open again. Oon the positive side - bus connections to Istanbul are cheap and very efficient. On departure: only a small part of departure lounge was open and about 300 hundred people had to wait in a small hall with about 50 seats!!

Auckland airport greets you on arrival with beautiful Maori music as you walk through a huge carved entrance-way. The corridors are lined with lovely photos of NZ life. Sure you enter though duty-free but it's easy to ignore. The airport is spotless. The best bit though is the friendly staff even at immigration.

Last summer we travelled in July (kids school holidays) but previous to that it was always in June. Our experience last year was a complete nightmare. Like a previous post on this site the queues are everywhere and it creates panic with passengers afraid they will miss their flight. On arrival once we left our hired car we queued for the check-in desk - very long wait. Then once checked in we queued for the x-ray hand baggage check - very long wait. Then into the duty free lounge and we had to queue again for passport control. Terrified we would not make our flight. I can only assume the reason for this is peak time travel in July (as opposed to my previous years travelling in June) but now I see from other comments that this has happened on other months. I have to say it is the one thing that dampens my ideal holiday in Portugal - we are returning but I dread the thoughts of those long Queues.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,Wendy Hill,Australia,2014-05-17,I travel to Bali every year and have done so for the past 15 years. Last year I went through the old airport and as I left in a taxi I saw the lovely new one next door thinking 'gee that looks nice pity it wasn't finished for this year'. This year I got to experience the fancy new one - how could they have got it so wrong. To be honest it wasn't too bad arriving but with multiple planes arriving at the same time it is confusing which carousel to collect your luggage from. We were lucky our bags came out first so we were then able to move to the next point - having them x-rayed for clearance. This is confusing as you need to go need to double back to put your bags through the machine before moving forward to the declaration inspectors. There wasn't signs telling you to do this and many people who collected their bags moved forward through the gate to the inspectors as you would expect to do but were yelled at by a security guard to go back to the x- ray machines. If these machines were at least on the way to the declaration station this would cause less chaos. Everyone is told by the airlines to get to the airport at least 2 hours before departure which in all the years I have travelled overseas to a variety of countries has made good sense. When departing from the Bali Airport arrive at least 3 hours early with your fingers crossed and a good book. On arrival you will be asked if you want your bags wrapped in plastic if you do then allow more time again. Most people I noticed didn't take up this option me included. When you make your way to the check in counter ASK someone which one as they put the wrong signs up. We were leaving on a Virgin flight @ 22.10 to Melbourne on flight VA54. The 3 check in desks displayed Brisbane 21.20 pm VA 58. After some confusion and wasting time looking for our flight I eventually asked 3 people including other passengers and was told the signs are wrong it's the Brisbane desk where the Melbourne flight is. Getting into line @ 7.30 it took until 845 to be processed. Initially there was 3 desks open but shortly after standing in line one was closed leaving only 2 desks to process both the Brisbane and Melbourne passengers. Now having received our boarding passes it indicated plane boarding time is @ 9.25 Gate 10. Next is the need to pay the Rp200000 departure tax at another counter which was done efficiently and quickly IF you had the right money. Next was the immigration centre where about 600 or more people had lined up waiting to be processed. Having waited over an hour in the last queue my heart sank stressing I had less than an hour to board my plane. Amazingly this process was quite quick as fortunately they had about 8 desks all processing people quickly. After passing through Immigration you can not avoid the Duty Free and every other hugely overpriced shop as to get to the departure gates you must wander or run in my case through all of these. I wanted to do some Duty free shopping but unfortunately this was no longer an option as my plane was now boarding. If you want to go to the toilet before boarding good luck it if you are female. There is only one sign for toilets and the line up was enormous. As I wanted to change into warmer clothes for the flight back and unable to get into the toilets I managed to change behind a pot plant! We were then ushered down stairs and loaded and packed onto buses like sardines and driven out to the plane where you walk up stairs . Having taken our seats we had to wait for 2 more bus loads of passengers before finally leaving late. Like others are saying it does spoil an otherwise lovely holiday. Such a shame but I don't think I'll come to Bali again as there are other tropical places to visit that have happier endings!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

On departure however you are firstly required to go through a pre- security screening on arriving which includes putting you're belongings through for scanning. This was all over the place and the workers were very rude and unorganised. After this you queue again to show your passport and boarding pass before getting through this congested area to check in. Check in took over an hour with each queue having about 10-12 people/families in it. Staff did not have a clue. We went through the next passport check which was fine for us but if it was busy it could get very messy. Then onto security there was no trays left and when I got a tray from the next line someone tried to skip me. After this I think it was through to duty free where the shop staff are helpful enough on the floor but the till staff were rather rude. Finally it was boarding which seemed to take ages and when I got to the front my barcode wouldn't scan the machine had broken and the woman was very unwelcoming!

Our gate was a 20 minute hike to the central areas - given the lack of occupancy would have been nicer if we'd been closer in.. Almost no people around (4pm on a Monday) so no queues at Immigration and the eGates worked well and quickly - maybe 10 seconds to clear Passport control! Then an hour for our luggage. The belt started. Then stopped. Then started again and some bags appeared. But then it stopped again for about half an hour. An engineer came and moved some bags around on the feeders and eventually all was good. A frustrating end to a good week's holiday and a very poor first experience of the new LHR T2.

For travellers to the West Coast Cincinnati offers another advantage.

However, when I was at the Immigration, staff were talking amongst themselves and were not concentrating on their work.

At the immigration booth were two immigration officers and obviously they were talking, one scrutinized my passport and the other was playing with his phone. The departure experience was worst. The baggage check-in was poorly laid out and badly maintained, old scruffy and inefficient. Next, I received my passport and my checked in ticket and went off to the immigration, again the officers were talking amongst themselves, which took them 8 minutes to realise that the scanning system was out of order, so they had to take me to a special room where further checking was needed. The entire process to me 15 minutes to do so, bare in mind there were many passengers at the back. The staff at the exchange rate counter was particularly not amused of what they are doing.

All of the family's belongings get split up on the belt as they disappear off into no man's land then you have to escape from the mass of people to go through the metal detector - with a 3 year old trying to escape.

First it's quite small so there's not much to do there if you arrive early. On the other hand it does not seem have the benefits small airports normally have - fast and friendly service short distance from rental/parking over check-in/security to gate/flight. Rather the opposite. Rental car companies are situated miles away and you have to get on a slow bus to get there and back. Arriving at check-in a bit early there are no self-check-in counters and you just patiently have to wait until they decide to open the counter. Waiting there there's nothing to do no lounge or anything just a sorry bar. On the good side check-in and security was very fast much to my surprise. From the check-in counter opened and till I was in the departure hall no more than 10 minutes passed. Being in there was a bit sad.

Unfortunately it is still an unremitting hell hole and is unworthy of a nation who say they regard tourism as important. Airport staff are officious unfriendly and downright rude the toilet facilities are appalling and dirty and every shop and stall treats its customer with utter contempt. The only food and drink available is of very poor quality and is priced at a level which would be a joke anywhere else. As an example I paid 4 pounds sterling for a cheese sandwich that had been made the previous day according to the label and was packed in a non-airtight card box. Consequently the bread was dry stale and inedible. I drew the line at paying £3.70 for a Kit Kat and left this at the till. This airport takes a very cynical view of its customers and makes no attempt to provide any form of customer service. Instead it wastes no opportunity to rip off the captive market in a way that I have never seen at any other airport (and I have seen quite a few). I would urge passengers to boycott all facilities within the airport and take in your own food and drink.

cluj-napoca-airport,/airport-reviews/cluj-napoca-airport,Cluj-napoca Airport customer review,Alex Rap,NA,2008-02-15,Cluj-Napoca International Airport is a very small airport. First thing you need to know is that it has experienced a 550% increase since 1999. But it still uses the same old terminal building. They will open 2 new terminals soon an arrivals one in April 2008 and a departures one in July 2008 so things will probably improve in a few months. But until then it's best to know what to expect if you go there. Everything is small baggage reclaim area arrivals hall check-in area (the largest of all but still small) departures hall. This means that it's quite hard for them to handle flights with many passengers. A full A320 with 180 passengers pushes the airport to its very limits. However on departure if you are there with about 1:30 hours before the departure time you're probably going to be fine. You will be queuing almost all that time (there's no real place for shopping or relaxing anyway). On arrival expect long queues for passport control. There are only 2 immigration officers processing (between them) only about 5 passengers per minute. If you're last to leave the aircraft you can expect an approximately 30 mins wait. Baggage reclaim area will be overcrowded so you'll have to wait a bit in there as well. The airport is about 8km east of the city centre and a taxi drive should take about 15-20 mins and cost approximately 15 lei (4 Euros). There is a bus stop (100m walk from the terminal) but I never used it. An overall fair experience if you know what to expect.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Peter Edwards,United Kingdom,2013-08-18,I've been using Luton Airport for over 40 years and have experienced its general decline to what it is now in 2013 the worst airport in the whole of the UK. In the last 5 years I've been travelling in addition to other destinations to Majorca between 5 and 7 times a year and it's almost a relief during the winter months when Easyjet don't fly to Palma to have to make the trip from Stansted which is 3 times the time and distance. The complaints are endless surly unhelpful security staff who often talk joke and laugh with their fellow workers about what they did last night and what they are doing tonight. Untidy and overpriced eating facilities. The lack of telescopic walkways to the plane makes it look more third world. I find it particularly galling that on arrival you walk up one set of stairs along a corridor then down another set of stairs. No other airport I've visited in the last ten years makes you do this. I now make most of my trips with just hand luggage as the baggage handlers must be the slowest in the country for what must be the shortest distances. I picked my son up from Luton a few days ago who had flown in from Edinburgh a lovely clean efficient and helpful airport and was aghast that they had put up the pick up/ drop off charge to £2. This is typical of this money grabbing terribly organised airport. I don't know how the new owners are going to improve things but if I may offer just one recommendation it is that they should sack every employee and make them re apply for their jobs and use a top recruitment agency from London who would sort the wheat from the chaff. NB. I always leave Luton Airport with a bad taste in my mouth which is brought about by the clouds of cigarette smoke that you can't void as you make your exit.

minneapolis-st-paul-airport,/airport-reviews/minneapolis-st-paul-airport,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Emmet Ferwerda,NA,2008-07-06,This has been my home airport for several years. Downsides: size (I suggest at least 60 minutes between flights) price (Northwest's fault not the airport) lack of airside transportation between terminals and not enough shops/food landside. Also the baggage claims are old and can easily back up (I heard recently that they will be replaced in the near future). Now for the good parts. Plenty of diverse reasonably priced shopping and food airside and clear signage throughout. The Customs/Immigration staff while not overly friendly were very professional and reasonably quick. Also I have never seen security or (Northwest) bag check lines longer than 10-15 minutes). There is an easy fast light-rail connection to/from downtown Minneapolis. There is also a separate underground tram from the parking ramps to the terminal eliminating the need to carry your bags outside. The entire facility is clean and well-lit. For those with a 2-3 hour layover there is a little-known observation tower in Concourse D (go to the block in the center of the concourse and all the way up the stairs) which is usually uncrowded and a very nice place to relax.

islamabad-airport,/airport-reviews/islamabad-airport,Islamabad Airport customer review,M Baughman,NA,2009-01-26,I have been traveling through ISB for three years now and I continue to marvel at the pain travelers have to endure to get on an airplane. It is not uncommon to find three or four B777’s of varying carriers arriving and leaving at the same time meaning that every relative of each Pakistani passenger will be at the airport greeting or seeing off their loved ones. That is a big sea of humanity to wade through. There are several lines: first to get into terminal and that can take up to an hour depending on how many people cut in front; then there is a narcotics task-force check which is a guy who may or may not look at your passport and wave you to a bag check line; then there are 2 X-ray machines for all those people and all that luggage and no matter what there will be porters who push you out of the way just when you get to the X-ray machine belt to put tons of luggage that jams the screening machines; then you check in at your airline; then you get in one of the immigration lines which are clearly laid out for foreign native and women/family travelers but who reads signs? Then there is another passport check and handbag screening which gives arrogant travelers from around the world an opportunity to show how obnoxious they can be; then there is another check of the handbag to stamp it and the boarding pass and you’re in the departure lounge.

In just the queue we were in one woman had an asthma attack and another one fainted. Luckily the travel reps were on hand as no medical staff could have got through and they managed to get her into a wheel chair.

International arrivals at the Tom Bradley International Terminal (TBIT) and those at the Delta terminal (Terminal 5) get much better reviews than those at the United Terminal (Terminal 8). My recent experience at United's international arrivals was shocking. The wheelchair I requested never arrived. The escalators were out of order both going down and later going back up. There were no moving sidewalks and the distances to cover were among the longest in the world. The ceilings were low. The queues were the longest I've ever seen at any US arrival point and in general the experience was comparable to those I have had in the worst of Third World terminals.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,We've used this airport a few times. It's not perfect but certainly not bad. It's important to note though that my experience of the airport is based on departures and arrivals out of peak times. Therefore it is possible that although I can only report short or minor delays at baggage reclaim and immigration control perhaps these delays would be scaled up at busier times. I've found that on our most recent trip that the airport was well enough sign- posted and there were easily enough food and shopping outlets to keep us and our 20 month old toddler happy especially as the departure pier we were at had a dedicated children's play area. We like Majorca for family holidays and with it being a small island where Palma is the only airport you are not going to be picking any others to get there. All in all I think it's a decent airport but a re-design of departures that means that you don't have to go through a secondary security process would be good that way you could avail of more of the facilities on offer rather than just the albeit decent facilities post secondary security for non-Schengen flights.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Flight info boards not very prominent in such a crowded lounge and hard as it is to believe of the five international clocks the Abu Dhabi one was stopped. Gate 5 at T1 for Manila bound passengers is disgraceful.

Both times I flew in and out of the (older) Terminal 1. Having not done much foreign travel I found even the older Terminal 1 fairly easy to manoeuver around in. We had a long line for immigration but 3 operators for foreigners had us all through in 20 minutes. Customs had long line as well. Again we were through in 10 minutes. One through there were plenty of friendly Terminal Porters giving information and assistance in their dark blue uniforms one exchanged currency for me even on Sunday. I checked in Rio and the porters were giving the same rate as the banks in Rio. You do get constantly hassled by taxi drivers trying to take you to Rio. We followed other comments (above) and went upstairs to departures and hooked a taxi into Rio. It was only R$ 67.00. Getting out of the country was easy as well. I did have my luggage searched once. It only took 10 minutes and I was immediately placed to the front of check in and actually got through check in before my companions who were not searched. OK shopping upstairs. There is an old 70s-ish restaurant and buffet which was actually kinda fun if you want to see what interiors were in the 70s. Terminal 1 is kinda old and dingy - maybe could use a sprucing. I didn't mind though. It was cool stepping back into the 70s.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I know something was going on maybe an event but the airport was quite busy and it put an unfair pressure on the facilities left and your customers/passengers.

Usually large queues for visas and passport control. As usual only the British queuing and all other nationalities esp Russians pushing in. Baggage reclaim is not always from the belt that has your flight number above it and many bags are taken off the belt and left lying around in piles. Returning for departure is an experience that could be described as something like 'Its a Knockout' Everyone runs off the bus into one building then through into another where the nightmare begins. Its a race to get to the queue for baggage screening. Whichever queue you pick is bound to stop for no reason then everyone moves to the next belt which also stops. No real security screening seems to take place although your case is put through the scanner none of the staff are actually watching the screen. Everyone is jostling to get into the queue and get their bags on first and tempers get frayed. Then suddenly out of the blue everything stops while a Sheikh gets through (unsearched) with his entourage. Once you reach check in it is a fairly slow process and you are not always advised you need to fill out an exit card for immigration before proceeding. Final passport check and into the duty free area which is a shambles. The renovations don't seem to have reached this far and there were several unattended gaping holes in the floor which posed serious injury risks. We were actually glad to get through to the final departures area to wait in the relative quiet until our flight was called. Be warned the toilets are awful and you need your own toilet paper otherwise the attendant will give you two squares for £1. Also odd to see uniformed staff smoking on duty at the gates and the local stray cats roaming through the terminal. Be prepared for a total culture shock if you are not accustomed to it.

We rented a car at Newark and after proceeding through the immigration we took the convenient skytrain which brought us directly to the rental agencies. On return I arrived with UA from Montreal at terminal A and I have been warned that 1.5 hours connection time to my flight to Europe from terminal B could be tight! The immigration to US from Canada takes place in Canada therefore I arrived as a domestic passenger. Before leaving terminal A I saw signs regarding an inter-terminal-buss.

The whole transfer from arrival gate in terminal A to departure gate in terminal B took me 15 minutes at the most without any security check no queues.

However despite the fact that Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines there is nothing overly impressive about its airport. I arrived at CEB on a domestic flight and was quite surprised how desolate the terminal was. This was in stark contrast to what was waiting just outside. For a flight of 60 or so people it seemed like the whole city of Cebu was waiting to greet us in the ""welcoming area"". I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only Cacuasian around but never once felt threatened by the smiling faces of Filipinos. I was immediately greeted by a sonata of sales pitches as taxi reps competed for my business. I gently waved them off since I was waiting to meet my friend. They were persistent but not obnoxious. The availability of transportation is not a problem at CEB but you will need to learn the art of negotiation to avoid being charged unfairly. Thankfully my friend is quite skilled in these matters and we never had to pay an elevated fare. A few weeks later I left from the international terminal at CEB for a flight to HKG. I don't remember much about my actual impressions of this terminal since I was contemplating a heartbreaking goodbye to my friend.

Honestly, my 7-hour layover in the airport led me to think that Schiphol is not the airport as it may have been a decade ago. Holland Boulevard is under renovation (and doesn't look nice anymore), so are the museum and the library, extremely overcrowded at McDonald's and at a Starbucks, and there is no place other than at the gates where one can sit and recharge electronics (outlets are extremely limited and some don't even work), internet access is okay but slow and needs renewal every hour. Finally, the lounges are pretty much overcrowded. Schiphol looks like it had better days in the early 2000s and the early 90s. Probably my most memorable experience there was the voice ""mind your step"" at the end of every walkway. Unfortunately, this place is like falling apart for when Amsterdam had rain, parts of the airport ceiling were dripping water, this aging airport needs more than what the current renovation project is working on. And as always, too much traffic (travellers are from all parts of the world), since this airport is a major European hub, yet I doubt that the airport can tolerate this much.

No real queues for bag drop passport control or security. Airport not as clean as Schipol which was very noticeable. Real need for road improvements from the M6 to the airport as some stretches still single carriageway and get very congested. (I concede that this is not in the airport's direct control but they should be lobbying for change). Staff attitude was great. Only real concern was that we had to wait for what seemed like a long while for baggage to appear on the belt. We also watched on the plane as bags were loaded and it seemed that the handlers felt they were not doing their jobs unless each bag was either thrown or dropped onto the belt of left to fall some distance onto the tarmac.

In the past month I have been through the airport 4 times. The shortest wait at immigration was 20 minutes the longest 1.5 hours. Even at 1 am you can wait an hour. On all occasions less than half the immigration desks were occupied and several staff were standing around talking laughing and generally doing anything but their job. One night section two was completely closed and the line at section one stretched out of the waiting area and more than 50 m down the arrival corridor. That night I sat next to an American lady who had to buy new tickets because she missed her plane after waiting more than an hour in immigration. The line for Turkish passport holders is fast. But International passports wait up to 10 times longer. Again poor organisation. Turkish Airlines are good but I suggest they transfer a couple of Managers over to the Immigration Department and teach them how to run an efficient operation. Im sorry but I have a choice of airports to transfer out of Europe and Istanbul has gone to the bottom of my list. Turkish Airlines - if you want this customer back fix your home airport.

If you are fortunate enough to arrive from Kuala Lumpur at lunchtime you will have a much better experience than if you arrive in the afternoon when there is a rush of large planes. Same as when you depart. The midnight flights back to Australia are usually packed so expect long delays when you are departing. The queuing for visas and then the queuing for immigration make this one of the worst airports in South East Asia. There is the corrupt VIP service which allows you to skip the lines if you pay an extra $25 each and families often fork out this to avoid hour long delays in non air-conditioned space.

This setup means that if you have a few hours to kill you are saddled with your luggage and unable to make the most of the (overpriced) shops and facilities on offer. Internet cafe must be in the running for worlds most expensive at US$15 per hour. Its slightly more reasonable once through security (but see above - you will not have much time to use it). For reasons unknown the entire area beyond security control smelled of vomit. A taxi for the fast 7 mile/12km journey to town costs an extortionate US$30+. As a point of principle you can avoid this by turning right outside the terminal and walking 100m to the bus stop where services are quite regular and a much more reasonable US$1.50.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Yet again it was passport control where we felt let down. We were met by a young lady who tried to organise us into numerous queues allowing those in a hurry through first. However my gripe is directed at the 4 'officers' who were situated in the booth next to the one in use who were deep in discussion. If this was training It should have been done out of sight of travelling passengers or could a sign not be used to inform passengers that they are training and not just gossiping because that's what it looked like. Lots of staff around the full airport but I don't think they were all being used to their full potential and some not the most pleasant. As for the lines there it was bordering on the ridiculous as I fel we needed a map to get round them all.

This long-term user history gives me the ability to step back from the short-term issues which often side-track passengers in their critique. I am completely clear in my mind that for the last 5 years this airport has been and remains on a downward spiral in terms of virtually every key aspect which is important to all passengers and particularly to regular users. The overall cleanliness of Terminal 1 is on a par with a third world city bus terminus the appallingly slowly speed of baggage claim from the carousels even at the quietest times of the day beggars belief as to why everything takes so long the extremely frequent failure of the advanced car-park booking system at the critical moment of inserting the credit card in the barrier to leave the car-park is so well known and feared in my company that no one trusts it now to use it. But the worse aspect of the whole airport and its management is that no one appears to care. No one responds to complaints no one is interested. The only interest appears to be the promotion of as many retails outlets as possible within the complex.

Visa on Arrival process is very quick there are 12 agents serving and so it doesn't take long at all. However it does mean that anybody on the plane who doesn't need a VOA gets to join the immigration queue ahead. We arrived at the queue and were faced with around 400 people ahead of us. I estimated the waiting time to be around 60 mins minimum. There were 8 immigration agents working but a little slowly. I asked a separate agent who was directing passengers for 'Express Service' and bargained him down to USD 45 for the three of us. Took 5 mins to clear immigration (he took us to a separate queue counter) and pick up our bags. No hassle out of the airport in 15 minutes.

I travel out of and back into Pearson T1 around 25 times a year and I cannot recall a time in recent memory where clearing US customs took less then 45 mins. The security screening process isn't too bad however its not as much a credit to Pearson as simply a by-product of the inefficient customs process before security. Once you have cleared that nightmare its generally not too bad an experience assuming you are traveling US Airways Air Canada or United however if you are one of the poor souls traveling Continental out of the 200 number gates then get those running shoes ready. From the end of the escalator at security to the 200 series gates is upwards of a 10-15 mins walk. Coming back into the airport from an international flight is terrible - the walk from your gate to the customs office could be upwards of 20 mins and once you get there there is no separate line for Canadian Citizens if a Jumbo Jet landed 5 mins before you - expect an hour wait. Even with the wait in CDN customs its still highly unlikely that your bags will have reached the carousal by the time you are done. T3 is a little better however the amenities are lacking. The one positive I can take away from Pearson is that the Air Canada Lounge in T1 is great aside from that generally unimpressive.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
washington-reagan-national-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-reagan-national-airport,Washington National Airport customer review,Stephan Neuhaeuser,NA,2003-08-09,Nicest airport I have seen in the U.S. so far. Clean airy large windows restaurants not crowded things move fairly smoothly and staff is friendly. Taking off and landing offers spectacular views of Washington since the airport is located very near downtown d.c. There is even a metro station directly at the airport so there is no need for a taxi if you don't want to spend $20 for a ride. The one setback is that DCA is served only by regional U.S. carriers and Air Canada. If you travel long haul to D.C and have to switch planes try to switch to a flight into DCA - it is way better than flying to dull Dulles International Airport (IAD) about a one hour drive out of town.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

In our case we got checked in quite quickly as we were at the front of the queue but to relieve the pressure in the departure lounge they got us on the plane consequently we were sat on the plane for 4 hrs cramped up and in the heat.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,Jerome Vanderberg,United States,2011-05-17,"My wife and I flew KLM from Schiphol to JFK last week - the worst and most offensive security arrangement we have seen. The security check is done by a team at each of the gates prior to boarding. When the start of the security check was announced we stood in a long line and had no opportunity to prepare ourselves by emptying pockets removing jackets taking out computers etc. People standing in line finally came to the single checkpoint where a woman barked out orders like a drill sergeant to move on through quickly. The people operating the full body scanner were competent and professional. Once we had passed through security we assumed that boarding the airplane was to begin shortly. Instead we were kept for 2 hours. in an overcrowded holding pen that seemed to have been designed for cattle. The holding pen had no toilets and a single machine for selling water. I lost 3 euros in it without a bottle coming out and when I asked the KLM agent nearby she replied brusquely (without looking up) that the airline had nothing to do with the machine. A short time later I saw a Dutch gentleman go through the same procedure. I walked over to the counter where he spoke to the same KLM employee. He said that he had lost his money in the machine and asked if he could exchange a 5 euro bill for coins so that he could try again. The agent dismissed him saying ""I am not a bank!"". He was told a place in the airport where he could report the problem but came back later saying that they could not help him there. I elected not to go with him because I was informed that I would have to go through the entire security routine again and that we would be getting water on the airplane. Later on in the airplane the captain apologized for the long delay explaining that it was due to the fact that the airplane had arrived late from its previous flight. Obviously the security people knew this so it was puzzling why they rushed us through so quickly knowing that we would have to stand in the holding pen for hours before being able to board the airplane.",NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,Dave Silverstone,United States,2009-09-23,"A horrible layout with frequently unpleasant staff (especially security) to add icing on the cake. Heaven forbid you're making a connection and your arrival and departure are from different wings or different terminals. Even if they're both Schengen (or non-Schengen as my recent trip was) you'll wind up going through security at least once. And of course if you don't like the food and shopping options in the arm of the terminal you're in your only option is to yes wade through a security checkpoint all over again! The problem is compounded by poor signage often courtesy of Lufthansa (could someone please instruct them that white lettering on a yellow background is not a readable choice). At one point I didn't even notice I had exited one security zone to enter another until I was almost past it (no sign saying ""Leaving secure zone"" only a ""no entry"" sign facing the other way!). When I asked the security officer who saw me there trying to see what the other side of the sign said he forced me to go through the security line all over again if I wanted to turn back! Of course this wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem if each section of each terminal had adequate food and shopping options but all but one of them most emphatically do not. International travelers going through a major hub expect more choices (without a trip through security) than just one sit-down restaurant one coffee shop one news stand and a duty-free! I won't even get started on the small infrequent and hard-to-find restrooms. That said if your destination/departure is Frankfurt the range of ground transport options hotels and car hire makes it quite convenient. For everone else I'd much rather connect through a modern efficient hub like Amsterdam or Zurich!",NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Upon our arrival it took 40 minutes to receive our luggage on the baggage carousel with each piece arriving at a snails pace. Actually we were one of the luckier ones as probably half the 200+ passengers on our plane were still waiting when I left and this was in the middle of the day. The open air concept fits here and was a nice change although walking past ""smokers row"" on the way to your gate may bother some. The restaurants and stores were fine and adequate and since every place in Maui is expensive I thought the prices to be average. And they don't close any earlier here than most airports I've traveled through. The airport employees were friendly and helpful although they did not handle our delayed flight back well at all. There was massive check-in confusion amongst passengers and staff with no attempt by airport staff to inform us as to what was happening. Again we were lucky and because we were early only waited an hour to check-in our bags. I later heard some folks waited in line for 3 hours! Because of the 8 hour long delay had there been storage lockers for our carry on items we could have left the airport for a while.

dalian-airport,/airport-reviews/dalian-airport,Dalian Airport customer review,Chris Carroll,NA,2008-02-07,Dalian Airport is ok. It is a large “new” terminal now with both the old and new buildings not exactly seamlessly combined. Check in for both domestic and international flights is straight forward. Look at the departure board and go to the appropriate window. Security is also easy. Don’t put your ticket away as they need to see it along with your passport and boarding pass. Delays are common due to the bad weather in the area- seems to me they built the airport in the foggiest part of the city. High winds also cause problems and the fact the civil airport doubles as a military base means there is no prize for guessing who gets priority. Don’t go there hungry or you will have to pay high prices for average Chinese or Korean food. The usual snack shops are plentiful but expect to pay for it. Toilets are bearable but (as with all toilets in China) don’t forget to take some paper from the dispenser near the wash area as there is none provided in the individuals cubicles. I guess they think you will steal it if they leave you alone with it long enough. Despite the smoking rooms provided Chinese still insist on smoking in the toilets so you have to put up with that discomfort too.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

oslo-airport,/airport-reviews/oslo-airport,Oslo Airport customer review,Hans Nederpel,Netherlands,2014-08-18,My usual hub for travelling business or private. I like the departure hall it is spacious and the swing of the Airport has become very crowded during peak season resulting in lack of seats insufficient amount of restrooms and long queues everywhere. It is also very likely to get in serious trouble when you have a transfer from an incoming international to a domestic flight. Travelers are subject to redundant procedures like collecting your luggage from the carousel then going through customs and go through the check in procedure again in the departure hall in a long queue together with new and other transit passengers while you already have your boarding pass and your luggage is correctly labelled. Finally you have to go through security again. Like authorities usually act many years too late it seems there is now a decision to abandon these crazy procedures in 2015. In my case last year I had to wait a long time for my luggage then had to run to the departure hall and look for an understanding staff member to assist in bypassing the queue for check in. That way I was just in time to catch my connecting flight. This year I was not so lucky when the luggage handling system was down due to a thunderstorm for the rest of the day. I finally arrived in the departure hall with my luggage where thousands of people were waiting not knowing what to do. The announcements by the pubic address system were only an apology for the inconvenience which was of no use at all instead of giving a clear explanation about the workaround implemented. To give instructions for dropping the luggage for your departing flight the staff member who could yell most loudly was selected. Of course these messages were missed by many people. Finally I ended up for hours in a queue of hundreds of people in front of the service desk to get my missed flight rescheduled and was lucky to reach my destination the same day and got possession of my luggage 4 days later. Definitely an airport to avoid during peak season when you have a connection to make. Hopefully things get better in 2015.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

The return flight out of Atlanta was smooth few queues and comfortable sized gates with lots of amenities. Really very slick. By contrast the arrival is baffling despite the Delta flight trying to explain the inexplicable before landing. In short you clear immigration (I had no problems) and you reclaim your bag from security. This would normally be it. However you need to go through the usual outward bound security checks (shoes/belts etc) all over again. Before you can do that you need to pop your case on a carousel which the sign says will arrive at a similar carousel in the Terminal South/North building. So half an hour for the security check down to the shuttle train which loops round the 5 main buildings and the final Terminal/exit before picking up the bag. I have every sympathy with those who had to wait for their bags although I was just as concerned that anyone could have walked off with them.

It reminded me of BRS except that CGN used a jetway BRS didn't. Train connection is kind of weird. I wanted to use my free luggage trolley to the train door which means using the elevators which never are easy in any airport. The elevators in CGN are hard to find and the buttons are really confusing with the labels not clear and worn off: I ended up on the wrong floor several times in the terminal and in the train station I ended up on the wrong side of the tracks. The train ticket machine wouldn't read my VISA bank card so I had to go back through the terminal and crazy elevators to find an ATM machine which did work to give me cash to use in the train machines. When I arrived in the Cologne Main Train Station the same type of machine accepted my bank card with no problem and a train staffer was there to help also. Also flying out be aware that you can't get into Burger King on the other side of security. The only normal place to eat is Subway and the attendants there ignored me so then I went over by the Continental gate for a German place for Cappucinno and Crescent which was okay.

It is more spacious more room for counters shops and other facilities. Schengen screwed up the South terminal dividing the airside into segments with long walks out to the Schengen flights. Before it was all one big airside area which was great for connections. They also have a fantastic observation deck with big windows and anti-terrorism protected but the views are good. The French Gov't came out with a rule that Orly would only be used for short haul CDG for both short and long haul and hence many carriers including AA were kicked out of Orly and sent to CDG. I can't imagine what they were thinking. Orly is closer to Paris it is easier to use and is more practical. They need more hotels as the Hilton a good hotel is the only one on site (that I know of). I like the monorail between the South and West terminals. CDG would do well to have something similar. Also they need a direct rail link between Orly and CDG.

My only complaint is about the security. In terminal A the security checkpoints are so overcrowded (and they have two of them!) so it takes time to get through them. Terminal C seemed less so.

pune-airport,/airport-reviews/pune-airport,Pune Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,NA,2007-12-24,The one thing that strikes me about this airport is that it's becoming woefully undersized for the amount of traffic coming to the city these days. Getting in the terminal isn't bad but once inside the security line snakes almost all the way back to the door (though in fairness it only took about 15 minutes to clear). Sitting space in the terminal area is also inadequate. My flight was at midday which you would think is a slow time of day traffic wise yet the waiting area was overflowing with people many sitting on the floor in any free space they could find. On the plus side the trip to the plane from the building is very short as is the taxi time. One thing to note - unlike at HYD MAA or the DEL domestic terminal the security guard at the terminal door checks your photo ID before allowing you inside the building. Not knowing this I had to fumble through my bag to get mine and my wife's which got me a rather unpleasant stare and what I presume were some choice words in Hindi.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
shanghai-pudong-airport,/airport-reviews/shanghai-pudong-airport,Shanghai Pudong Airport customer review,Dave Rice,Japan,2013-01-15,My first time at this airport and the impression was not good. My family flew out of Japan for Singapore. The transfer process is a bit odd. We come out of the terminal and there is a line that says 'International Transfers'. Naturally I head for that. Turns out I first had to go to a counter where they checked our boarding passes/passports. Then I could follow the directions for transfer. The second stop was a counter where our boarding passes/passports were checked again. After that was a security check. From there we could head back into the terminal which we really never left. We did not have to pick up our luggage and recheck it. In both directions luggage was checked all the way through to our final destination. We also had boarding passes and seats all the way through. There was a delay on the return leg due to 'air traffic control'. This seemed a bit odd as I saw several flights leave/arrive during the time we were delayed. Fortunately we left in time to make it to Japan. The frustrating part was that our gate was changed without notification. When checking in for transfer we were told Gate 17. Getting back into the waiting area it turned out it was Gate 16. After the delay our flight actually left Gate 14. The airport is not dirty but by no means is it Changi. It is not even NRT. The first thing I noticed was how it smelt. There were smoking areas but no real attempt is made at keeping that smell from the rest of the terminal.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Mick Campbell,United Kingdom,2015-06-12,"This airport is just a disaster. I arrived this morning from Poland with Ryanair (an airline I'm always happy with, by the way) to find myself walking what seemed like miles down endless corridors until I ended up queuing in a stairwell just to get to passport control. When I finally got in there with what looked to me like 800 others, we were herded like sheep around pens in a suffocatingly-hot room, making slow shuffling progress towards the head of the queue. When I finally got there, I asked the woman jobsworth who was pointing everyone to the different desks why they didn't broadcast an apology for the ridiculously long wait, and why they didn't turn some ventilation on. She completely ignored me. This is what the unknowing foreign traveller is confronted with on arriving. A nasty impression. The staff at Bristol all need a good kick up the backside.",Arrival Only,12-06-2015,Solo Leisure,1,1,4,4,NA,4,4,0,NA,0
accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,Eric Simpson,NA,2006-07-23,I wasn’t sure what to expect on reaching Accra despite having read previous comments. It turned out to be a slightly surreal experience There are no airbridges. Passengers were bussed the short distance from the aircraft to the arrivals wing. A long poorly lit corridor led to the somewhat shabby immigration hall. Not perhaps the best first impression for arriving passengers. Clearing immigration and customs was a slow process however the officials seemed to go out of their way to give first time visitors a beaming “Welcome to Ghana”. Baggage reclaim proved to be a bit of a scrum. The public area of the arrivals level was much brighter and more modern in its décor but it felt somewhat empty and unfinished. The most intimidating aspect was being approached and asked for a tip to provide security by someone clearly eyeing up my luggage. Fortunately the driver meeting me arrived at that moment and whisked me off safely. Departing Accra provided a somewhat different experience. The outside of the Departures level was positively packed the reason quickly became apparent as only passengers were allowed inside the building. The appearance of the check in area was quite modern although it was not particularly well signposted and had a somewhat stark feel to it. Having joined a very long line at the KLM check in desks I was quickly directed to leave the queue to clear customs a requirement which departing passengers should undertake before checking in and which was not clearly indicated. Check-in was speedy thanks to a KLM official directing frequent flier card holders to the Business Class desks but passport control and security checks were slow. The large departure lounge has recently been refurbished it contains an attractive duty free shopping area and refreshment and seating areas. On a less positive note the seats were metal and lacking any form of cushioning were uncomfortable. Public address announcements were almost inaudible. Like the refurbished part of the arrivals level there were vast areas of unoccupied space perhaps awaiting future retail outlets or other passenger facilities. There are two departure gates one at either end of the lounge. With two flights boarding simultaneously through Gate 2 this is where things broke down. The corridor from the lounge to the departure gate was shabby and the toilets were in a disgusting condition. With 500 or so passengers crowded into the boarding lounge and no apparent PA system airline staff were pushing up and down shouting at the top of their voices trying to separate passengers into groups for boarding. Two busses were in use transferring passengers from the gate to the two aircraft. Although the process only took about an hour it was a chaotic hot and very uncomfortable experience. Sadly these last few yards took away the otherwise favourable impression of the Departures level of Kotoka International Airport. I hope that the refurbishment which is underway continues and quickly addresses the shortcomings particularly in the arrivals area.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Baggage service was remarkably quick - bags had started appearing on the belts less than two minutes after we walked into the terminal. Much better than the airport in HYD which was built by the same company. On departure there's not much to write home about outside of security. All I could find was a Cafe Coffee Day which served their products at double the price you can get elsewhere in the city. Also beware that you now have to pay a departure fee of Rs. 285 per person which isn't automatically included in the cost of most tickets. Security is efficient and there's a large number of shops up at gate level. The inline security system is also nice as you don't have to put your checked bags through an X-ray machine before going to the counter. Biggest problem with the new airport as is the case with most new ""greenfield"" airports in India is distance to the city center.

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,Hans Gross,NA,2008-05-10,The number of controls has decreased from former 8 to 6. After the entry I should have shown my ticket although flying ticketless. I explained them that now most flights are ticketless hence the control unnecessary. At check-in I got a boarding card indicating that I should go to the gate (an uncomfortable place) at 21h30 although the flight was to be at 23h30. At 22h30 I was able to hear an announcement telling to go to the gate 2 (the visual information system did not work). There was a long queu already waiting so I went back to the hall. The next message heard was that another flight announced for gate 2 was redirected to gate 1. So a flock of people walked away and I went to the gate once more without having to wait for the entry control. I was asked for the ticket and the same dialogue began as before. They said I could not fly unless I would show a ticket. In order to show what they meant they order another passenger to show 'a ticket'. It was a flight confirmation on a shabby piece of fax paper. I had left the confirmation in the checked-in baggage but due to a lucky incident I found a preliminary confirmation in my handbag which was accepted. At departure time passengers were still coming in with up to 3 handbags and gigantic suit cases and the flight took with 1 hour of delay. Apparently they had been accepted although too late.

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,Henry Stenzel,Germany,2015-02-18,Arrived at the Airport on Terminal D (from Berlin) and boarded again on Terminal F (to Bangkok) with Aeroflot. We had a stopover of 01.15 hrs and it was said to take 01.05hrs to get from Terminal D to F. All flights were on time but we knew we better hurry. After hurrying it turned out that we just needed less than 30 minutes of fast walking to arrive at our boarding gate. If people tell you here that they needed one hour to get there than they either can't read signs or don't know how to walk. I even lost my boarding pass and it was reprinted at the boarding gate in just one minute. Had a long queue at the boarding gate though. Did not had the chance to use any facilities as of the short stopover. On the return flight (Terminal F to Terminal D) we had a 4 hours stopover and spent the time in a small Asian restaurant as we didn't wanted to sit in the small boarding area. There is free Wifi though very slow. But to be honest I have not seen any airport yet with fast wifi. No matter if Dubai Hong Kong Bangkok London or Milan (for example). The Wifi is slow everywhere. At least the wifi here in 2015 in SVO seemed to be more responsive as in Dubai first class lounge back in 2007. There is another security check even for transit passengers (but I have seen this in Abu Dhabi as well). All in all it could have been much worse. I can confirm that the Terminals are non smoking without the availability of smoking rooms. If other passengers complain here that they had to wait 4 hours in terminal F and it was horrible I don't understand why they did not waited 3 of that 4 hours in terminal D.

Like all BAA airports the concept of providing a customer service is completely alien to the company owning the airport instead they treat it as a cash cow with the intention of extorting every penny from the passengers passing through. The seating area airside is woefully inadequate but this is because approximately 1/3 of the available area is taken up with a very expensive noisy and smelly World Shopping retail outlet which you have to walk through to reach the departure lounge. Mitchell's Bar upstairs (airside) is eye-wateringly expensive; £4+ for a watery pint of beer upwards of £5 for a glass of wine overpriced food and snacks etc - even a packet of crisps is around £1.

It has mini rooms with no windows that you can rent by the hour or even overnight. Caution - when you arrive if you are connecting internationally and already have your boarding pass or want to go rest in the hotel do not follow the crowd down the escalator after customs. This leads you out of the terminal and to baggage claim via a train. If you do accidentally get to the train just take it to the main terminal and then don't get off.

There were only four Border protection officers working causing huge delays. The most frustrating part was there were no clear lines so some people were standing in line for almost 2 hours (it is not an exaggeration) and some people realizing they were going to miss their flight were cutting the line. People would get into actual flights since everyone was getting frustrated. 4 or 5 Border protection guys had to come in (so there were more than four?) to interfere.

To my big surprise the system charged me for more than one hour (12 PLN) while I was less than 1 hour in the parking (6 PLN) The same happened to my brother in law's parking card. There is no time printed on the card so one can't check but I knew from my GPS and watch that I spent less than 1 hour when paying and si did also my brother in law who followed me. After some discussion with the responsibles they charged me only the hour pretending their system was working OK what obviously is NOT the case. I would not be surprised that the system is somewhat manipulated to round up to the hour as of 50 minutes. So please check exactly what time you take the card at the entry and when you pay.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
singapore-changi-airport,/airport-reviews/singapore-changi-airport,Singapore Changi Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2009-09-28,Overall SIN is a large and well laid-out airport. Immigration counters are well staffed and there was no line either on arrival or departure. The customs officials handling GST refunds were polite and helpful. Security is handled at the gate much like Bangkok or Frankfurt so queues again aren't an issue. Plenty of shopping and restaurants are also available and the MRT station underneath the main terminal is a big plus. On the downside ATMs are awfully hard to come by - I could only find one working ATM in the arrivals area near the entrance to the MRT station and there are no signs indicating where it is. Also while security provided at the gate helps eliminate security lines it also means the seating areas don't open until an hour before departure and seating space is inadequate if you get there early and don't have lounge access.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

To the downside is that food and beverage prices are very high. When travelling from and to the airport I would suggest everyone to just take a coach to your hotel instead of a taxi. Inside GZ the taxi service is reliable but from the airport taxi driver try to take advantage of people who don't know.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,Mike Ilex,Australia,2013-01-17,Melbourne is my home town so I have used this airport many times. In my opinion it is the worlds worst international airports. The biggest problem is the staff who are rude and impatient the parking attendants shop assistants customs check in and immigration all have the same terrible attitude and it leaves a very poor impression of our city. You can expect slow rude service from immigration and security that will use at least 1 hour of your time and act as though its you the passengers who are the reason that nothing runs right. Returning to Australia is a nightmare waiting in customs queues for 2 hours is common. Whoever runs customs must be thoroughly incompetent 300 people in line but only 4 customs agents doing any work.

All accept Visa or Mastercard even the local ones so there's no need for cash. Outbound arrived transfered and departed all within T3-E but warning: there is no smoking room in T3-E so on return I got the free 72 hr transit visa and headed to T3-C via the monorail. This was easy and probably didn't take any longer than just going through security in T3-E as the queues were much shorter. T3-C is the main check-in area with more choice of restaurants and retail and where you can go outside to smoke!

There is no warning whatsoever until you are within 20 metres of the only entrance into the Passenger Terminal which is at a traffic light controlled crossroad. The approach road from each direction is understandably designated as a no parking zone but once there one has no choice but to turn into the Airport Car Park unless you are prepared to do a 3-point turn in the road - which I will do next time. I took my complaint to the Customer Services Desk and was met with a good deal of weary autotalk about how 'all airports were doing the same every since the Glasgow bombings' - I don't think so.

Start with the condescending attitude of some of the staff 'helping' you navigate the automated passport machines. Then a reasonably quick trip through customs and immigration and baggage gives you hope. Then with a few hundred passengers trying to get their bags checked in for another flight YVR allows a very long queue to form. Next comes the security bottleneck with two checkpoints for all those people it took us close to an hour to clear our flight through that security point - I cannot imagine what happens when more than one comes in. With the exception of a very professional young woman steering you into one of the two lines the security staff were silent slow and unfriendly. Some people needed assistance but that was scarce and those with tight connections were not given any leeway.

I flew there last year on Easyjet to and from London Luton but they don't do the route anymore it seems. Squeezed out by the inferior product from Ireland I guess so the comment about other low- cost competition may be a pipe dream.

anchorage-airport,/airport-reviews/anchorage-airport,Anchorage Airport customer review,Daniel Re,United States,2014-09-06,The (south) domestic terminal in Anchorage is world class and beautiful. This new terminal is very modern spotlessly clean provides amenities expected at an international airport and offers a view of the surrounding mountains that is breathless. The displays of local wildlife native culture and art is unsurpassed by most airports in the world. However the old north terminal (which is now connected to the south terminal by a concourse) is sad. Anchorage is one of the five most busy airports in the world for international (cargo) airlines but not for international passenger service. The few international airlines that do provide passenger service (mostly during the summer months) are forced to use the north terminal as U.S. customs is located there. All the comments seen on this site are about the north terminal made by international travelers and are undoubtedly true.

Welcoming two was a male yelling for us to go to the other side of the room to get on line for immigration. At the other side of the room were people in large crowds coming our way. I then realized the entrance to the immigration line was actually in the middle of the room meanwhile the agent was still telling everyone to go to the other side of the room.

You are very close to the aircraft (including the runway) so it does not feel claustrophobic. My only gripe would be the totally constant announcements of both arriving and departing traffic needed because the information on the boards was unreliable. No airbidges so you walk to the planes but this did make for speedy boarding.

Then when the immigration officer closed the EU passport control which unfortunately had only 1 counter open they merge into the line sometimes even had the audacity to cut in front people who had queued right in front of the immigration officer.

What it does is cause a huge line to form from row C right through to row G. This happens from between 06.50hrs to about 08.30hrs every morning. Travellers become very agitated and very fearful of missing their flights because of the long queues. Most importantly there are no Malaysia Airlines staff to help explain or assist passengers who are confused by this new system. Thick skinned clients cut queues and no Malaysian Airlines staff are there to help pacify the crowds. This is a very bad experience for any first time passenger with Malaysian Airlines or KLIA. Whilst one can understand the cost saving that happens with consolidating to only one row for check in of all international passengers the disinformation or rather the non existence of Malaysia Airlines staff to help soothe the nerves of the passengers is most unprofessional and shows a complete lack of customer service by the airline. It also makes the airport experience start on a very tense note. I have flown this airline for over 26 years now and this is a low point in the airline's airport check in experience. I do hope that Malaysia Airlines will at least put staff to help manage the long queue at row C and soothe passengers' nerves.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,M Steger,Germany,2014-01-02,"The best airport in India I have been to there is no bus transfer from domestic to international like BOM still has. Security checks are plenty the cabin luggage screening is a huge mess with shoving and pushing from all sides it is not clear how efficient these checks are and what the purpose of funny paper tags with a stamp on every bag is. If they are so important why are only 2 of our 4 bags actually checked at the time of boarding. Immigration is equally confusing. You are supposed to fill a form nobody tells you that you have to fill it and the form is not available anywhere. Same thing happens when you try to leave the country - you have to plea to a number of staff to actually find out the secret of which other staff member is hiding the forms. The form to leave the country again needs the same information as you gave for the visa application. The Immigration officer then told me it was the duty of the airline to hand out these forms. International to domestic luggage is not checked through even though this was confirmed to me at the time of check-in in BKK by Air India staff. Leaving India it was checked through as well as for international to international transfer. To recheck you bags you have to pick them up and walk them all across the building to some dedicated transfer counters. While walking in the terminal make sure not to stumble over the large gaps in the floor. I was also surprised to find large amounts of staff in washrooms that are labelled ""not for staff"" they are mostly passing time and chatting away.

We eventually cleared US Border Control 5 minutes before boarding. I'm sure the airport and the systems run very smoothly if you're used to them or if there was someone to explain them but as we had never seen an airport operating like this or been to the US with the pre-clearance before it was incredibly stressful.

The amount of people who were in the small little terminal. Both the Barbados and San Juan flight was delayed. It was such a disaster.

There is no option but to deal with the security staff at this airport - they are often the people who check you in and onto the plane. And they are the rudest people you will come across as well as being incompetent. I was one of many who missed my flight today as a result of unnecessary delays from security staff. I was then threatened with being thrown out of the airport for complaining and told they 'don't really have a complaints process.' Please avoid.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,S D'angelo,United States,2012-10-01,I echo Mr Brigance's review. A very pretty airport but going through security is the worst layout ever. The worst design the longest delays. For some reason this was designed so that - rather than each airline having its own security lines or 3 or 4 or 5 airlines sharing one security area MCO is set up so that all airlines all flights share two security areas. Last week on a slow midday afternoon in September I waited 20 minutes just to get to the agent who checked my boarding pass. It was another half hour to get through actual security from there! Seventy gates of passengers were funnelled into 7 lines. Made the NYC subway at rush hour seem like a Disney ride. They desperately need to redesign the security arrangement. I hope smaller airports like Melbourne will grow and become affordable alternatives because I would do almost anything to avoid flying out of Orlando. Coming in no problem but passing through their awful security system - arguably the worst in the US and maybe the world - is just not worth it anymore.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

In short all passengers agreed that staff appeared to be on a deliberate work to rule and a ""go slow"". Having checked in we zipped through security - the two open scanners seemed able to cope with people managing to check in and immediately boarded the plane.

Both times I took Delta/Alitalia which were using the same satellite concourse connected by monorail. That satellite concourse is nice with good shops for last minute spending. If you forgot to get a present for someone lots to buy there. Customs is a pain so expect a long wait there unless EU citizen. Got off of the airplane there and had to use the restroom which was difficult to find and not pretty. One good thing was the ease of getting my bags and then getting on the express train to Termini. The escalator to the train is just steps from the funky baggage claim. I like this airport because of the ease of access to Rome. I went to Rome both times in May/June and it wasn't too busy always room on the train and good space for bags. The walk from the train arrival platform at Termini in downtown Rome is a long walk from the main part of the train station--grab a cart if you've got heavy bags. I had an early departure from Fiumicino to Newark on Alitalia my second trip. i thought I'd arrive early to be safe and also do some shopping at the concourse shops. It was a bad idea to arrive too early for my early flight because the security does not operate at that time. I ended up waiting in line for an hour until they arrived. When they did arrive they were laughing and just waived us through with minimal screening. Very disconcerting considering they went all out with the armed soldiers in the terminal. The Delta/Alitalia check-in is on the far left side of the terminal right next to the security point which is up against the wall.

There is limited option for shopping before going through security to the departure area but they have a few bureuax de change and various food outlets and bars. Security waiting time was about 10mins and seemed to be very efficient since it looked busy. There is a large duty free shopping zone which you have to pass through to get to the gates. Once you are airside there are various shopping eating and drinking facilities although on the international area these are limited and the shops look empty. The international area also became very warm and uncomfortable considering it wasn't a warm day. Boarding gates are well sign posted and there are quite a few information boards telling you where to go.

You are not allowed to go to the airside terminal before your flight is announced for check in. This means you have to wait outside in the departure hall. WiFi is available for free but do not expect great speed. Check in is in a rather small area. Passport control is reasonably swift as is customs control and safety control. There are no shops on the domestic airside. The business lounge is almost always closed. And the local airline Air Astana does not provide this service for domestic flights. There is a small restaurant in the old and new part. There are shops in the international airside. There is a small restaurant/bar. The business lounge is available and open 24 hours. Use of this service is based on the airline. Lufthansa gets a limited menu of drinks and food. KLM seems to be more generous (no apparent restrictions). But it is an old room with plastic leather seating and not much else. There are enough ATM´s available to get cash. There are no newspapers/magazines for foreigners. Only taxis ordered or outside at the official taxi stand have decent fares. But agree on a fixed price no meters installed. Ignore offers inside the building.

During that time it seemed to improve slightly before descending into the pit once more. However a lot of the things are less to do with the airport than ludicrous security and baggage rules enforced with a gusto that would make any jobs worth proud. They just don't seem to get the fact that at some point the customer just goes elsewhere. Car access is inconvenient and car parking is expensive to the point of robbery given land prices and badly laid out. Food and drink in all parts of the airport are substandard and expensive. The airport is grubby and the long walk with steps to the plane inconvenient and looks like it was knocked together from left over porta-cabins. The only good thing about it is the train link but of course that is not synchronised to accommodate late or early flights. Returning to it is just as bad with the needless UK border control getting in everyone's way. I wonder how many people they have actually caught in return for holding everyone up. We are on an internal European flight. A new ploy seems to be to x-ray baggage at customs clearly more about confiscating some duty free than a security measure. All in all a grubby little airport with the same one sales point of many complacent airports and that is a lack of competition.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

All I can say is avoid. The beautiful building Norman Foster designed and laid out is now nothing more than a Northern Supermarket look-a-likey with swinging signs hanging from the ceiling in check-in areas which may as well say ""beans half price"" as they actually relate to nothing in the building. There is also a passenger entry system to security which is just about as hidden as the secret garden whoever designed that needs to go back to design school who actually paces a key entry point in a corner hidden behind a wall. Once through check-in the departure lounge has very little seating and does not instil the wish to shop. I travelled with my young family and the experience we had trying to seat eat and enjoy was poor. Boarding the mono rail from the departure lounge is nothing more than a serious accident waiting to happen. With all flights being called at once the rush was mad.

On a recent trip, as on a previous one in the fall of 2014, this restroom had dirty toilet stalls and nonfunctional ""automated"" sink handles. The airport is, in general, user-unfriendly. Yesterday I had intended to wait for a friend on an arriving flight in the cell-phone lot, which I'd not been to before. The signage to the lot was so confusing that instead I ended up in the central parking garage. Signage from the garage to the US Air arrivals area in the terminal was similarly unedifying; I had to ask an employee for directions. Same thing to navigate the return to the garage. The signage for the terminals and parking is not only confusing but also dangerous: any attempt to change lanes runs the risk of involving oneself in a crash with one of the numerous fast-approaching vehicles on one's tail.

Worst experience ever here carrousel 4 had 3 flights arriving at it so over 500 people fighting for cases literally fighting scuffling for space children being crushed people having troll lies pushed at them. We were over 1 hour getting our cases people are so rude pushing jostling and no one from the airport to supervise.

hyderabad-airport,/airport-reviews/hyderabad-airport,Hyderabad Airport customer review,Praveen Babu,NA,2007-02-26,I've flown through Hyderabad dozens of times over my life the old Begumpet terminal. The airport itself is acceptable by Indian standards. There are plenty of baggage boys to take care of you though. The carts are free but may not be in the best quality. The domestic terminal is much better than the international its been renovated and has shiny marble all over. Mosquitos are an issue in both terminals. Air conditioning is bad and there is a humidty problem in both terminals. What's odd with this airport is that certain halls and sections are air conditioned while others are not. For example immigrations is not airconditioned domestic departures is. Some sections of the airport are clean while others are not. Overall an inconsistent airport. In general this airport is not up to international standards. Fortunately facilities are being upgraded in 2008 in the form of a brand new airport in the city outskirts unfortunately it appears the same staff will be managing that airport as well.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Connecting to domestic flight required going through passport control and customs in Santiago. As you come down the stairs to arrivals the desks for paying the reciprocity fee require something of a U-Turn. Don't go directly to passport control. There are two areas for passport control but both lead to the same baggage claim area. After you pick up bags they will be scanned before you leave the secure area into a fairly cramped meeting area. There are several ATM's. Signs for domestic connections not that clear. You have to go upstairs and find the airline - LAN is a bit of a hike. Check-in area bright and open. After security for domestic flights there's one boutique a Starbucks and a local cafe. That's it - it's pretty sleepy. We had to ride a bus from domestic departures (very few gates) to plane parked at an international gate. Connecting from an international flight to an international flight much easier. Bags checked through. You exit passport control (if boarding in Santiago) into large duty free area. Good variety of restaurants in international terminal including Ruby Tuesday's Starbucks and Dunkin Doughnuts as well as local options. Some construction is going on to expand the terminal.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-01-10,I live in Hong Kong so pass through this airport a lot! It gets top scores but other than in comparison to other Asian airports I don't really understand why. It's not convenient to get to the Airport Express is only really suited for business men rather than locals and is also expensive (100$!). The busses are slow the airport is a long way from anywhere on an island. This is gripe number one because I often go to collect visitors so I make the trip far too often. My other gripes are that immigration is painful. I am resident but still need to queue up (albeit in the residents queue) which is better than most visitors - but still far too long especially on departure. The food/shop choices are poor. There is always an enormous queue for the food outlets none of which are any good (a basic sandwich shop would be nice) maybe McDonald's is the most popular (and cheapest). There is no cheap coffee either (except at McDonald's) and the shops are almost without exception fashion clothes watches etc. (all super expensive) which are useless for most people. Security is on the whole (surprisingly) sensible (that is not too strict on the >100ml liquids) and fast. It's clean and has a viewing deck (which costs money another sad point). Overall it's a shame this is my local airport given how far away it is from anyone and how pricey all the shops are. It's only saving grace is that the time to the airport is basically unchanging from most places so you can minimise your time there by leaving as late as possible!,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The wait here was one hour and 10 minutes for U.S. citizens and more than two hours for foreigners. Out of 26 counters for U.S. citizens three or four were staffed (depending on breaks). The entire time we were subjected to ads on TV screens encouraging us to pay $100 to avoid these lines. This is beyond outrageous. The amount I pay in income tax should entitle me to decent service - I should not have to pay extra for it.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,R Cooper,Australia,2015-04-08,In the last few years this airport has gone from being reasonably acceptable to being a total joke particularly since the recent renovations. Making both arriving and departing passengers pass through the duty free stores thereby running the gauntlet of aggressive sales staff is totally unacceptable an insult to the travelling public and something of which Brisbane Airport Corporation should be ashamed. While I pass through the terminal at least twice a month and used to spend time perusing the shops while outbound I now refuse to spend a cent in the shops on principle. On top of that mornings at the airport (both arriving and departing) are an absolute debacle with long queues and insufficient customs staff and the most inefficient security staff (outbound) I have ever encountered. If the body scanners are in use it seems that the whole screening process for the rest of the passengers comes to a halt. To further inconvenience the travelling public the scanning machine operators change frequently and instead of adopting a system whereby there is a short overlap between operators they have to stop the whole system for about five minutes further backing up the queue. Finally when inbound and holding an express card one would think the process would be efficient right? No. Following the signs to the express queue at immigration results in the longest possible walk to the counters and then you simply merge with the normal queue! Who dreams up these systems? My recommendation is to avoid this airport wherever possible. Unfortunately for those who live in Brisbane there is little alternative but at least don't encourage their poor management lack of planning and foresight and the derision with which they treat passengers by spending money at the overpriced duty free stores or extortionate foreign exchange facilities.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

MNL-HKG return using NAIA Terminal 1. Word to the wise: if your airlines offer online check in - use it or be prepared to stand in line for at least an hour. Not enough counters for most airlines to accommodate full wide bodied jets. Immigration lines are a little better. Security was a joke! My daughter inadvertently packed 2 safety scissors in her pencil case and was not detected on the two layers of security (upon entering the terminal and at the final security after immigration - unacceptable). Airside nothing to do unless you pay for the upstairs lounges. Limited and expensive food choices. On our return flight we had to queue for more than an hour to clear immigration and customs as our flight happened to have landed the same time as flights from the US (JAL DL) and Middle East (EK) did. Officials tried to rearrange the booths but did not do much good as the arrangement apparently created more chaos. I think they should have just used the snaking retractable devices that they did on the outbound area.

As the previous report said the walk to flights leaving from the western apron is lengthy; they allow for this by calling flights well before they are due to leave. OK if you are reasonably mobile but are there more seats when you get to your gate? Guess. So that is another 15 minutes of standing around.

Arriving in the non-Schengen zone my connection was also in the same zone so I headed off to the desk for the connection on my ticket. A quick trip through fast track security and off to the gate. Seems that I missed that flight and the desk agent ran off to do something or other to get me moving. She returned and handed me a new ticket for KLM to AMS. Back though passport control again no queue at all same nice officers and off to the other terminal. The ticket barcode access scanner for fast track security tells me to go to the original terminal and refuses to open so I just jump the rail and tell a security person on duty about the plane change who lets me through with no question. Second time through security scanning another passport stamp (3 in 1 hour) and off to the gate. Agent says to me with a dirty look that she was looking for me hours ago. Explained the changes and delays she turned pleasant checked me in and hit my seat with moments to spare. All in all it was a bit of a crazy time but it worked out and I had no real issues with any staff clerks officers at all.

The drop off and pick up facilities are non existent unless you count 10 minute free parking a bus ride away in car park 4 which is absolutely ridiculous. I had to pick up an elderly relative today. I could not go through to the old 20/10 minute parking area being confronted by a barrier. It was very poorly signed that I now needed to turn right into the adjacent car park and pay a £1 min for the pleasure so did a three point turn stopped and ran the forty yards to where I could see them waiting and hurried straight back to the car less than half a minute to be confronted by a parking assistant handing me what looked like a parking ticket. Whilst I fully understand the parking implications if they want to implement the parking restrictions and bylaws which apparently cover the area ""perhaps they could provide decent drop off and pick up facilities as used to exist in what used to be a convenient friendly little airport"".

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Y Beames,United Kingdom,2012-01-10,I used to use Bristol for around 6-8 return trips every year. This airport used to be a joy to use. My last 3 trips within the last 6 months have been awful. All the in-bounds took forever walking for miles then ages at passport control and finally over an hour to get suitcases that you can only put on over-priced trolleys. The outbound experiences differ. The first one involved a lengthy queue for passport control in the early hours of the morning. This spread all the way down the stairs into the main check-in area. After security I had to run to my gate whilst other people missed flights. The second time I was taking my daughter to Majorca and did not have any change for the chargeable drop off point. I had to get my partner to drop me off in the road. A 'jobs-worth' came up behind us in his 4x4 beeping and shouting and told us not to stop. Unfortunately the only way was to grab our suitcases from the car. On the way back my partner made sure he had some change but made a mistake of waiting up the road and watching our plane come in before he came to pick us up. It cost him £4.00 to get us out of the airport. Bristol Airport cannot cope with more than 4 flights in a day.

Crowds are enormous and the process is slow. Distances are ridiculously vast - even within the same terminal I had to walk (make that 'run' to make my connection) for what felt like miles and then take a shuttle to get to the gate. The entire process is a nightmarish exercise in endurance and as a result I have vowed to myself to never put myself into this airport or through this ordeal again.

Queues for the automated bag drop machines were horrendous and would have been cut by maybe 75% if there had been more than one staff member allocated to help those who had not done this before. Weird system of going through security at the gate meant that people were having to abandon soft drinks they had purchased after clearing passport control and because the process of doing security at the gate is obviously time consuming people were at the gate with no access to drinks or toilets for up to an hour before they were boarded onto the aircraft and there were too few seats for the amount of passengers.,NA,NA,NA,6,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

split-airport,/airport-reviews/split-airport,Split Airport customer review,J Valantine,United Kingdom,2015-06-07,Flew out of Split airport on a Saturday evening. Queues everywhere and departure lounge in particular was bursting with people. There was vastly inadequate seating and not even enough floor space for tired passengers to sit on without causing an obstruction to others. I couldn't believe how many more passengers were allowed to pour in when there was clearly inadequate room for existing passengers due to flight delayed caused by weather. When passengers were finally called to gates they were left standing for a good 30 minutes before a member of staff began to process the enormous queue that had built up. Our gate number was changed at the last minute and it took ages to work our way through the crowds to join the long queue. Once through the gate we waited an equally long period of time queuing for the airport bus on the hot stairwell. My overall opinion is that this airport does not have the capacity to cope with the volume of people coming through at peak periods. Even taking into account the delays due to weather I struggle to see how this airport has enough seats public toilets (no toilet paper in any of ladies toilets) food and drink areas for the numbers passing through. Incidentally the first mention we had concerning the cause of delay was when the pilot announced this was due to bad weather in Europe just prior to take off.

This meant crowds of peope were often blocking the tops of the escalators potentially dangeorous I thought. Then followed another long wait to actually check-in then another to get through the security at the departure gate. All told we spent about 1 hour queuing from arrival at the airport to clearing security. Just as well we arrived with plenty of time but not too much because after security there is nothing to do.

Instead of getting better over the years t has got progressively worse. From unnecessarily long queues at security presumably from poor resource management to the claustrophobic atmosphere in the T3 departure area. The airport group have squeezed so many retail outlets into the place that you can hardly see any daylight and there is insufficient room to feel comfortable. At the gate 141 waiting area I counted a mere 20 seats which is pathetic when you consider the Airbus on which I was travelling has a capacity of about 160! Some of the 'seats' in the waiting area were nothing more than park benches. Uncomfortable and totally out of place in an airport. Not a customer friendly experience at all and heaven knows what it must be like if there are any delays. Anyone travelling through T3 will know how a sardine feels when they use it. The signage around the place is also poor. The font size is large and its like something you would see in a kids nursery.

Due to a late arrival our connection time was shortened to a little over an hour. We transferred easily from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3 although it takes about 15 minutes by bus to do so. However the security screening at Terminal 3 was completely unacceptable. First of all there were only 2 lines open. Secondly once it was our turn our bags were placed into a tub and then abandoned. Simply left on the belt and everyone walked away. I asked several times for someone to process us and was told someone was on their way. Several security personnel were simply standing around doing nothing. I then went to the supervisor's desk and demanded that someone process us. He told me to stop shouting at him and that he had dispatched someone. Again we waited. I explained again that we had a flight to catch. No one was interested in the least in this. Then an agent took our tub and moved it forward to a table. Then another agent came. All these agents moved at snail speed. It was like a bad movie. No one was friendly not to mention displayed any sense of urgency whatsoever. The agent then carried our tub very slowly to another desk and proceeded to review our bags. We had a pasta machine brand new unopened in the box. This then needed to be taken apart examined it might have been a weapon and only when yet another agent a supervisor and the only person with any sense in that whole bunch said that it was ok were we permitted to pack everything up and proceed.

calgary-airport,/airport-reviews/calgary-airport,Calgary Airport customer review,Richard Boblenz,United States,2010-02-18,Our journey to Calgary and passage through Canadian Customs was happily achieved with no delays with no waiting lines and up to ten Canadian Customs officers on duty. Our return trip from Calgary to Philadelphia via Chicago was very trying for many reasons. We arrived at YYC at 2 pm two hours before our flight to learn that our flight was delayed to 5-20 pm. Although a sign stated that we were barred from entering customs until two hours before our flight time no one advised us that it would take more than ninety minutes to pass through US Customs and YYC Airport Security. We entered US Customs at 4:00 pm at which point the waiting line was backed up outside the door from the terminal with only two US Customs officials on duty and a third serving flight crews and a supervisor doing nothing. There was a fourth official person circulating through the waiting crowd assuring all that no one would miss their flights. We asked him about our Chicago flight and he assured us that our flight would not leave without us. A full one hour later we finally got to the front of the line cleared US Customs and proceeded around the corner to arrive at YYC Airport Security and we realized that there were three lines open and only one of the lines was actually moving. It took 40 minutes to clear Airport Security who were opening every single bag and patting down nearly every passenger; including those who passed the metal detector. So we finally exited YYC Airport Security at 5:40 pm and went to Gate 31 but our flight had already departed at 5:20pm. The result of this is that we were then sent back through Canadian Customs to return to United ticketing with the knowledge that we were destined to suffer through US Customs and YYC Airport Security again before departing Calgary. We were then presented with another line of at least an hour at Canadian Customs. However after about ten minutes we were thankfully rescued by a Canadian Customs official who took us to the front of the crew line. We arrived again at YYC the next day three hours prior to our flight time cleared U.S. Customs in seven minutes with eight U.S. Customs agents working. We cleared YYC Airport Security in seven minutes operating four lines opening only selected bags or purses. We were at our gate a two hours prior to rollback. How can you expect American tourists to visit Calgary and Banff if they continue to be mistreated in this way? Assuming that all airlines provide expected passenger volume information to U.S. Customs and YYC Airport Security and that anyone is using this information to manage these services how does it take one hour and forty minutes to get from the terminal to the gate? If people are going to miss their flights why is a U.S. Customs official circulating through the hour-long line telling us that we are not going to miss our flights? Why is there no advice to passengers regarding the current expected time delay to arrive at their gate? (This could be easily achieved by having a time written on any (or every) boarding pass when entering from the terminal and then noted by the person receiving passengers at the metal detectors who could then provide this information back to the entrance of U.S. Customs who could write it on a white-board sign.) Canadian Customs already uses a similar method to measure wait time. I provide this information and these questions in the hope that I may one-day return to Calgary without fear of wasting another day of my life (and the cost of hotel and meals) as a prisoner of U.S. Customs and YYC Airport Security.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Some distances can be long but unlike many airports of this size there are moving walkways (and the A concourse tram) the entire distance to your gate. The architecture though not entirely cutting-edge is very light and welcoming and the center mall area contains a wealth of dining and shopping. The Smith terminal (which serves all non-SkyTeam domestic airlines) on the north side of the airport is uncrowded but astonishingly dilapidated and depressing as some reviewers mention below. The new north terminal that is now being built will be a welcome relief from this antiquated and obsolete relic.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,D Tan,Australia,2010-10-03,Having traveled through Melbourne Airport a lot in recent years I have come to notice that in particular the International Terminal has become fairly old and outdated. In the past I have also experience long queues departing internationally as well. However this trip pleasantly surprised me. Check in was very quick and new signs (bigger and clearer) makes it much easier to navigate. A new security and immigration section has been opened up which is much cleaner bigger and has facility to process more passengers. As a result immigration and security were cleared quickly and efficiently. After immigration there were even screens showing a map of the terminal and predicting walking times to all the different sections. I had to walk through some construction corridors as the new retail precinct isn't finished yet but this was not a problem and the construction corridors were clean and well signed. As per usual I had to walk through numerous duty free stores but I have come to expect this of most Australian airports. The new wing (from which I was boarding) was open spacious new clean and provided fantastic views of the airport for aviation enthusiasts such as myself. Boarding was quick and efficient with minimal fuss. While they don't have the free internet and passenger facilities of airports such as Changi Melbourne Airport is certainly getting much better and has come a very long way.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Check-in completed quickly and on to Security to find a huge queue of people. We learnt the queue ended quite a distance outside the building with no- one to advise what was happening eventually an employee asked passengers to follow her to the front of the queue. Surely the airport authorities should try to offset this by ensuring all security terminals were open to allow a much quicker flow of passengers. We eventually got through Security and saw our Departure gate was open we practically ran through Duty Free/Shopping area in order to find our Gate.

No wonder the Marriott which is connected directly to airport offers a shuttle bus to the various terminals! The AC does not work well the roof leaks in heavy rain many of the seats are torn and the bathrooms are filthy. The TSA agents are rude and surly.

santiago-de-chile-airport,/airport-reviews/santiago-de-chile-airport,Santiago De Chile Airport customer review,S Dale Hancock,NA,2006-01-20,Arrived at Santiago after an all-nighter on Delta. Arrivals was very simple – US citizens veered to the left (at least in the terminal we arrived in) just before immigration to pay the $100US reciprocity fee. The booths were clearly marked and the lines went very quickly. They will staple a receipt in your passport good for the life of the passport. Immigration followed also very efficient. We exchanged $100US for Chilean pesos before we left the secure area. A subsequent ATM withdrawl showed we had paid a premium of about 3 ½%. Certainly not a big deal. Next we picked up our bag & exited customs. All luggage including carry-on was x-rayed & you turn the customs declaration form in as you pick up your freshly x-rayed bags. We probably took 20 minutes from the time we left the plane until we were in the free world including making the reciprocity payment passport control money exchange luggage pick-up & customs. Once outside it was a hectic mess. Everybody & their little brother wants you to arrange a taxi through them. We picked an official-looking fellow with a portable radio and agreed upon $25 US to the Marriott. There was no need to have exchanged money at the airport – the cab driver was happy to get the $27US I gave him. The exchange rate at the Marriott appeared to be exactly the same as at the airport. Departing was a little different. My wife went ahead and the bellman put our bag in the “hotel taxi”. I asked how much & was told $40000 (about $80US). I said no way took the bag out of the trunk & said I just wanted a regular taxi & pointed to one on the street. The bellman said it would cost $50000 to the airport. I said no way I’d only paid $12000 when I arrived. A little Spanish between the parties and I was offered the hotel taxi (down-scale limo?) for $16000 (about $32US). Okay. Based on posts here and other places we elected to get to the airport about 3 hours ahead of flight time. Good choice though this will probably not apply to you. We booked our South America itinerary (SCL-ASU-MVD-EZE-GIG) through TAM for $1253 (two tickets) in Miami. We had called 4 times in the previous 3 months to make sure there would be no issues & every time we were told the tickets were electronic & all we had to do was give them the number at the ticket counter. Don’t know why we were suspicious but it was an issue. After 2:45 screwing around with every TAM rep in the building and calling Miami twice we finally got paper tickets issued. TAM doesn’t use e-tickets throughout most of S.A. I was perhaps most perturbed when the TAM manager came down & said it was our fault because the “agency” issued the tickets incorrectly. The “agency” was TAM. He finally understood & I was happy to tell him exactly what I thought of his professionalism. Other than TAM related issues the departure was fine: about 10 minutes to go through a courteous immigration control plenty of duty free shops (though we didn’t have time to even stop for a bathroom break) and it appeared there was plenty of seating. Couldn’t tell about eating places – again because of TAM. Overall a very good airport experience and a rather poor airline experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

We were traveling back from Liberia Costa Rica and while the United Airlines staff on the plane was clear with instructions as to where to go wen we reached our gate once we got to immigration the problems were apparent. We were in line first for passport scanners for around 40 minutes then another wait for what looked to be 4 agents checking passports for hundreds of travelers in just the US citizens line. Then we headed in to get luggage and were in another completely disorganized winding line that blocked access to baggage. We got to our baggage and realized that the line we saw was only about one tenth of the actual line that wound back and forth with only the honest of other travelers to keep order. We saw airport agents whom we called out to to maintain order and they ignored people while they texted on their phones. With people trying to cut into lines that people had stood in for 1.5 hrs already missing connections there were near riot situations. We called out for security and finally airport police came and somewhat restored order while airport agents opened another line behind those of us who had been in line for hours missing flights and expedited them through not even checking passports. We missed our connections and there were no more flights for the rest of the night for us to get out. We got a room at our expense and will get out now 24 hours later.

Therefore at Schiphol we threw away our water and left-over drinks before proceeding into the departure lounge thinking the next step would be the X-ray machines. However the main security checks in this airport are just as you are called to the gate before getting on the plane. Wish we had known. We didn't have a delay but if you do it's nice to know that you are able to keep your own drinks until just before getting on the plane. This does save paying extortionate prices in the departure lounge. Why don't more airports do this? We can recommend Schiphol airport.,NA,NA,NA,9,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Eventually I saw a small line with mixed nationalities and decided this mist be the Thai flight to Bangkok. I was right. But there was no signage to indicate this. just a blank screen. And on the departure floor there was only one money change. Despite several flights a day to Bangkok they dont change baht. They couldnt even tell me what the exchange rate was. But they would give me US$$. I decided to take a chance and change it in Bangkok. Smart move as it turned out as there is no commission fee. If looking for somewhere to eat go down to the floor between departures and arrivals. A quick example - a capuccino down there was 32 CNY and on the departures floor 65 CNY.

You can only spend local money in the cafe or burger place but duty free only accepts dollars and euros. Escalator up to departures and not big inside but okay and clean. Arrival is very slow - so be patient. There is no queuing at passport control so I just took a seat on the side and waited until only a few people left and was much easier. At customs you need to complete two forms and I couldn't see an English guide (whereas there was one in departures) so ask a local or fill it in best as you can and customs officers will help with rest. There is a separate queue for tourists and they speak a little English make sure you keep the second copy as you will need it when you come to leave the country. Taxi ride into centre around 15000 Som i.e. $5 but you'll need to haggle a lot.

There are very few seats near the gates and hundreds of people waiting, most sitting on the floor. There were so many that it was difficult to move around or over them. Buses take you to the plane. Strangely the first bus, which took those who had paid for Priority Boarding, was only half full, whilst there were a couple of hundred still waiting to board and it seemed that we had to wait for that same bus to return again.

As for RyanAir a better attempt at customer service to alert passengers that their Frankfurt departure will actually take place at a remote and completely different airport.

I flew Mexicana Airlines and upon landing you are taken from the plane to the airport via a shuttle bus. The shuttle bus drops you off on the first level where you are immediately routed to the customs area. There are the typical long lines and wait as you are processed through customs. I was a little intimidated at first because my Spanish is lacking but the customs officer was efficient and spoke English. After you are processed you go to the ""stoplight"". There is an area where you are literally presented with a small red/green stop light sort of device and are instructed by the security personnel to press a button on the device. If it lights up green you are free to go. If it lights up red you are required to undergo further baggage search. My friend who is from Guadalajara told me about this before I went down there but seeing it really gave me a good chuckle. He also gave me a tip; give the button a good firm and long press. Usually nervous individuals will press the button quickly and so it is more likely light up red. This entire customs and ""stop-light"" area is probably no bigger than the average high school gym. Outside in the terminal lobby area there are plenty of kiosks and shops. There is also a ""taxi booth"" where you pay for your cab ride and someone will come out to help you hail a cab. Departing GDL I was very surprised and pleased with the abundance of space comfort and amenities in the international departures area. You can get anything from souveniers to CD's to clothes to food.

Is it really impossible to go anywhere without consuming the stuff? BKK is only an hour away!! And that is an airline issue not the airports. Buy an overpriced beer upstairs! The restaurant upstairs is a rip-off but this is not a unique problem to CNX as it is true of just about every airport i can think of (and I travel around 70000 miles a year so i know a few). CNX has much going for it notably the close proximity to the centre of town and the recent addition of a meter taxi service which I always use and a bus service which passes the end of my street if I could just fathom out what their schedule is supposed to be!! and the ability of being able to clear immigration here off most (BUT NOT ALL) connecting flights is a real plus. Some carriers have no agreement so TG in BKK claim (and disputed by BKK customs) to transit BKK and thus benefit from this facility. I arrived in BKK on Gulf Air (GF) and found this out the hard way but no problems with Emirates. So you end up having to clear immigration in BKK travel to CNX as a domestic passenger then reunite yourself with your baggage in the customs hall by walking in 'the wrong way'. Fortunately there is no problem as the security people probably see this off every flight. And to those who dream of flights from the USA or Australia direct to CNX please stop dreaming. We have lost the non-stop narita flight into CNX so the thought of an LAX-CNX flight is sheer fantasy. So we will all be stuck with a night in BKK. A new HKG-CNX flight is about to start with Hong Kong Express. But having seen how they cancel flights from HKG to Guangzhou one wonders how long this will last. But Silk Air to SIN and Air Asia to KL is appreciated and reliable! Travel well travel safe. Then enjoy Chiang Mai. Value for money here is second to none.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I used terminal two which is huge arrived around 5.30 am and shops were open. My only complaint is that places for eating are not abundant whilst souvenir shops are.

When the airport gets too crowded it seems the personnel loose their overview on things and everything quickly falls apart with insane lines. Staff usually helpful. Lighting and colors are odd as everything feels grey and dimmed. Why? No decent view of the runways and aircraft coming in leaving. No place for spotters inside the terminal. Go over to the old terminal building for spotting if needed. Shops are overpriced and should be avoided at all times. Pizza Hut overpriced but yummy. First time I went to OSL in 2001 everything was a mess and their baggage system was wrecked. Thankfully much has been improved since then but the colors design and shops leaves much to be desired.

Transiting to Japan with a 7-hour stopover we were ushered to the transit desk which is not airline-specific. Due to the very common delays on Chinese flights the most pressing flights were dealt with first. Passengers were dealt with as if they were causing problems for the staff rather than trying to do something which is carried out with ease at most international airports. I was asked why I didn't have a boarding pass for the final leg of my journey which could not be issued in London because the airline could not issue it there. All very annoying. A 7-hour stopover was reduced to 5 hours just by standing in the queue at the transit desk.

The airport is OK but could be a whole lot better. The usual temptation for airports to prioritise income from rents over the smooth movement of passengers has prevailed. Many of the corridors in the satellite terminal have become narrow passageways because shops have been plonked in the middle of them. I'm sure the designers didn't intend it this way and it really grates on me that space and convenience for the users is sacrificed at the altar of the almighty ringgit. Add to this the propensity for people to shuffle three abreast in these narrow spaces and you have a number of unnecessary choke points. F&B outlets are plentiful but expensive and the airline lounges are generally pretty average. There are few places to sit in the terminal unless you're spending money (by design?) and the sanitation in the restrooms is not great although miles ahead of the disgraceful LCCT (thankfully now superseded by KLIA2) Taxi services like elsewhere in Malaysia are terrible and the access roads in the arrivals and departure areas are chaos with double parking in no standing zones the norm.

Complete chaos on entering the airport queues completely ignored people pushing to the front with officials ignoring the fact passport control inefficient beyond words total lack of customer care or basic respect for other human beings. Leaving queues of people standing for up to 6 hours waiting for a totally disinterested official to grunt and gesture at you before begrudgingly stamping your passport allowing entry or exit. This time I thought Dammam would be a viable alternative to the Riyadh experience there cannot possibly be 2 airports in the same country that are so appallingly below any reasonable standard can there? Yes there can Dammam was actually a slightly worse experience than Riyadh! The passport control people are clones of their Riyadh counterparts total disinterest in anything other than their tea breaks socialising with their colleagues staring at their mobile phones and generally sitting around doing nothing for long periods before waving the next unfortunate traveller up to the desk. Please fill out an exit card before queuing I was told there were no cards available when I started and told to join the queue anyway. By the time I got to the front cards had actually appeared some way back in the passport control area (no one was told this). So I was then turned away and sent to the back of the queue again told to fill out an exit card. There must have been 20-30 people straight after me who had this experience. Basic levels of customer care are totally devoid here. In contrast I landed at Heathrow disembarked passport control and picked up my case in 35mins - a shining example of what an airport can do when run by intelligent efficient caring people - these places are two polar opposites!,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

I also think they have increased the seating since my last visit there was plenty free. On arriving we were bussed to immigration but again no queue and I was driving out of the car park 20 minutes after landing. It was my best experience here for many years however there was still an absurdly early call to the gate - a 300 metre walk followed by 20 minutes standing staring at four grey walls. My flight left late morning when about 5 departures are scheduled in two hours and we arrived just ahead of the evening rush. It is clear that there are far fewer flights using Bristol this winter than in the summer or previous winters and at these traffic levels it copes well and is pleasant.

Flights are often delayed even at quiet times and the security experience is so variable that it's beyond a joke now. While I have always been well-treated by MAN's security it's the haphazard way the rules are applied which is so annoying.

While several major airports around the world have now given up on such over-zealous screening I'm beginning to wonder just what MAN knows about security risks which the rest don't?

If people were grateful for the fact they don't have to travel for hours before even reaching the airport then we wouldn't have a problem with the fee!

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,H Lee,United States,2012-12-19,Flown into Terminal 3 and then waited for others at Terminal 1/2. Although it is not a fault of anyone this airport is just unreliable especially in the winter anyone can lose connections due to delays that can be triggered not just by snowfalls but also by mere rains coupled with low visibility. I was affected by exactly that and ended up arriving at O'Hare an hour late. Airport's location itself is already a reason to avoid this airport especially for connections. The airport offers a cheap rail link into the downtown in addition to the expressway option and considering the frequent congestion's on the expressways around Chicago sometimes the metro option is a must for travelers. Except for T5 - the international terminal - the other terminals are also nicely grouped together in the central terminal area so walking over to a different terminal is not that difficult at all there is a free and efficient Airport Transit System that links all terminals and the remote parking lots. The terminal facilities however can have some upgrades to be more appealing. Airside had seating available for passengers around each gate but landside had a very limited number of benches. The wifi was not free and even when I wanted to pay for it the signal was not even strong. The power ports were virtually non-existent. Flight information displays were lacking both in terms of its quality and its size. Information was incorrect for some delayed flights. Some flight information was not even clear as to which terminal they were expected to depart/arrive many first-timers would be in trouble finding their ways to the correct terminal/gates. Other aspects of evaluation seem to be on par with or slightly worse than most other major airports in my opinion.

You couldn't buy much at their one shop apart from overpriced perfumes and alcohol you can't even smell the perfumes in their shop as no testers on display. Nothing to do there to pass the time when you have a delay which I have to add this airport has lots of delays as its a military airport and closes at 9pm and doesnt have flights between 12 and 3pm.

Arrival procedures are quick and painless. Immigration is fast and friendly. The only snag is baggage pickup which can be slow sometimes but that may be more the fault of the airline. Departure procedures are surprisingly quick. Domestic terminal is a bit dated and there's hardly any F&B past security. However it's so compact it takes less than two minutes to walk from the security checkpoint to the gate.

I only rate San Francisco's Terminal 2 (Virgin America hub) higher. Reagan is clean and modern. Despite being 15 years old or so it is kept immaculately clean. The architecture and layout are thoughtful. Well-designed for a pre-Sept 11th airport. The airport clubs are good but not great. The only real drawback are the TSA lines at peak times - Monday through Friday in the morning and in the evening (6am - 9am) (4.30pm to 7pm). I have probably flown out of this airport 400 times. One travelers' tip for departing travelers: Always check your airport. I recently had a mixed itinerary - out on IAD (Dulles) return to DCA. I showed up bleary eyed early at Reagan. I showed my itinerary to a United Airlines agent - she didn't catch my error either.

Hardly any queue and through immigration and security in minutes. Yes the airport is showing its age with not too much in the way of facilities after immigration.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,Ali Jacques,Australia,2014-04-21,"Generally speaking my views are identical to Mr Powell's review below. There were no ""aero bridges"" available for both my arrival flight or my Departure flight. The arrivals hall wad enormous spacious. I had arranged the VIP service through Garuda Orient Holidays so it took around 5 minutes to have my visa in my Passport. When my flight arrived from Brisbane there were already 2-3 International flights that had arrived before mine so was a rather long queue ahead but all Immigration counters were open and fully manned so the queue moved at a steady pace. All luggage came out at the one carousel what a mess. I waited around 10 minutes for my suitcase I was then whisked away to yet another long queue to have all luggage X-rayed. This process over you exit the arrivals hall into the mass of people from Hotels/Tour companies and the like waiting for arriving passengers. The traffic is non stop out of the Airport. Now the Departure information: You are dropped off at a ramp where you can get a trolley for your bags it's a short walk up to the first Security check where your bags are X-rayed takes a couple of minutes. Then if you decide to have your luggage plastic wrapped there are around 4-5 stations where this can be done. The ""check in areas"" are spacious plenty of signage areas A-E and the entire area is spotlessly clean. There are no restaurants/Cafes in the Check in areas a huge mistake as there were many passengers in need of a cup of coffee. After check in there was ample seating in the Departure/Check in areas whilst waiting. After check in you walk the short distance where you pay the IDR 200000 Departure tax (A$20.00). The waiting tine at this point was only a couple of minutes. Then more Security screening separate lines for both men and women moved quickly. Then we have the shopping Duty Free and a lot of high end makes Designer and beautifully displayed very impressive. They are set out whereby all passengers must pass by every single shop. There are a few restaurants as you pass by the endless shopping a little expensive but convenient. The Gate areas are well laid out but the carpet is somewhat worn. The Boarding gates they cannot get it ""right"" too many passengers running all over the place with the constant changes. The worst gate being Gate 10 where the majority of Aussie bound flights depart from and as in my case my Garuda Indonesia flight to Brisbane was scheduled to also depart from this gate along with 4 other flights on Virgin Australia Jetstar bound for Perth Adelaide and Melbourne. It was total chaos. Headed down the escalator to yet another holding area where all passengers on the four flights were jammed in like sardines with airport staff screaming out the flights to a lot of confused people never seen anything like it in my 40 years of traveling. The airport may be lovely when first observed but the organization of the Departure/Gate areas require urgent attention. My holiday in Bali was just wonderful but with the airport debacle at the end put a sour taste to my Bali experience. Just for your information I arrived in Bali on Friday 7th March 2014 and departed on Friday 28th March 2014.",NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
cebu-airport,/airport-reviews/cebu-airport,Cebu Airport customer review,P Tripcony,United Kingdom,2015-01-30,I have been using cebu airport over many years as I travel from Cebu to Dumaguete City by way of land/ferry. It used to be chaotic in the old days but steadily and surely its getting better I went through the airport Dec 2014 Jan 2015 coming in is good no big crowds and it does not take long to get to the baggage pick up and main entrance (for those of you that get ripped off by taxis the fare to Cebu city center is P200). But the outward flight I was surprised at the check in area a few new shops a coffee shop which is welcomed and a few new souvenir type shops but still very limited for food. Have a meal before you get there! Staff are very good the porters for a small tip will do everything for you push your luggage and get you in the check out line - they are a great help and always cheerful. In short if you can avoid Manila do so as Manila airport is the worst. While Cebu is so quiet after a long haul flight and outside the taxi service and approach is managed well. If you are used to the Philippines you know how to be patient if you are new to it just show up and do not get agitated and keep smiling.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

In the past it has suffered from proximity to major airports in Nashville and Atlanta but today 7 airlines service Chattanooga with a rather rapidly growing number of destinations.

On arrival there is virtually no information on transport to the city and on leaving there is absolutely no signage as to where the various airlines fly from. I eventually found Air France in Terminal D. I then volunteered to go on standby and was allowed into the Air France lounge. Going through security took an absolute age and then the boarding gate area was chaos. Too many flights for the space. And virtually no toilets. I did not get on my original flight and was then sent back to the Air France desk who where severely understaffed and completely unable to operate their computer system. I have now back at the lounge with no ticket while they try and figure out how to do something that should be obvious. In summary the airport as a whole is chaotic and understaffed. The facilities are outdated and too few for the number of flights catered.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

There is a tiny check in area (we flew domestic today) with 4-6 check in desks but there are no lines or barriers and in typical Russian style there is no coherent queue. People are lining up all over to get in the correct queue. Upstairs there is a nice cafe called Lime which does decent coffee although double the usual cost. Still it is the only decent place to sit and wait. Then you go through another security check into a waiting room (full no seats left) then downstairs again to board the actual flight. This downstairs waiting room was also packed so we stood for about 30 mins in total with our squirmy 3 year old.

barbados-grantley-adams-airport,/airport-reviews/barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Barbados Grantley Adams Airport customer review,Robert Dabney,NA,2004-12-10,"I have been traveling in and out of Barbados since 1960. In the intervening forty plus years I have arrived and departed from the old Sewell International Airport and since 1979 Grantley Adams International Airport. Since the opening of GAIA I have transited the facility more than 30 times. Have I had any unpleasant experiences? Of course. I cannot name ANY international airport or cruise terminal where I have not encountered problems on at least one visit. However I am compelled to say that the Barbados facility is one of the best most modern facilities in the Caribbean. There are few airports in the region with the capability both in terms of terminal and runway to handle all components of major airline fleets from the B747 to until recently Concorde. The current expansion programme brings to mind renovations at many international facilities worldwide. Yes there are inconveniences that must be endured. But these must be seen in the light of ""temporary setbacks for permanent improvement."" My personal pet peeve with GAIA has been the lengthy walk from planeside upon arrival to the immigration and customs areas. But when put up against the walk to immigration when arriving in San Juan Puerto Rico on American Eagle Airline I'll take Barbados any day. I applaud the comment from Mr. St. John of the airport authority that one of the conditions to be attached to the letting of new vending contracts at the completed airport will be the requirement that restaurants be open as long as there are passengers in the terminal. This has long been a problem as pointed out by other posters to this forum. I would urge passengers arriving at GAIA to remember that you are not in New York or London or Frankfurt. You are arriving in the Caribbean! The lifestyle is slower (not a BAD thing!!) and the people friendly. Enjoy your visit to the airport. Take in the lush vegetation that is all around you. Enjoy the sounds sights and smells. And let your arrival be the harbinger of a wonderful visit to follow.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The planners should have visited a couple other airports before ever daring to think they could make any improvements. Boarding areas are way too small. Would have been fine in the 50s when the average plane was the size of a Douglas DC-3 but the aircraft today are a tad bigger. First class lounge is a joke. One never knows from one week to the next where the taxi stand is going to be. Taking public transit would be fine but one needs to be in the know so as not to be duped into taking the way overpriced CAT. (City Airport Train) Taking the CAT would almost be acceptable except that when you arrive at Wien/Mitte (train station) you then still have to buy a ticket on the subway to get anywhere else. (or take a cab) With the S-Bahn you can simply buy a ticket for EUR320 that will then take you to anywhere within the zone 100.

We had almost 5 hrs transit time so was very relaxed. Luckily both the incoming and outgoing flights were on time. I guess it will be tight if you have a transit time of anything around 1hr since there might be long queue at security controls and the long walk between Terminal D to F. We had to first go to the transit desk and then they guide you to passport control (transit without visa) and then proceed for security. The signs at the terminal are easy to follow and you don't have to ask anyone. Terminals D and E seems to be new and very well maintained. There are lines of duty free shops through the transit. The bad part is that the air conditioner only works in terminal D and E. You go down the stairs to terminal F and the whole terminal has no ac and it was very hot. Terminal F looks like a shopping mall and extremely crowded. So we spent our time in terminal E. Many shops there don't accept Euro / $$ or the exchange rate is extremely unfavourable. We spotted automated teller machines that converted Euro or $$ to Roubles & it had a more favourable exchange rate. The food and drinks here is actually overpriced. Luckily we did get vegetarian options at a food joint close to Gate 50 in Terminal F. Overall was a good experience.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

At about 3pm when most of the flights to Europe are checking in the departure hall was so full it was almost impossible to move. When I checked in with Iberia they explained that I had already paid the airport tax on my ticket but I'd have to get an exemption stamp from the airport tax office. This meant another queue for at least 30 minutes; but if I was willing to pay the tax for a second time I could have done so immediately. This just seemed to be a way of extracting extra cash from people willing to pay not to stand in another long queue!

The facility has gone through a major renovation some time ago and it is still well maintained. Most parts including the restrooms are very clean. The main terminal is not so big but not too small to be overcrowded either. The parking garage is attached to the main terminal so travelers can avoid being exposed to the wind/rain/sunlight to reach their cars. A McDonald's is located within the airport complex. The landside and the 3 concourses are also fairly well laid out and dotted with decent number of eateries. In most cases the check-in and security check procedures altogether took only about 10 minutes for me and as the terminal is not too big even walking to the farthest gate takes only about 5 minutes. Of course TSA agents sometimes can be less than courteous. Baggage handling was fairly quick I did not really have to wait for more than 5 minutes until my bags were placed on the carousel for pickup. This airport offers free wi-fi and plenty of power outlets in between seats including USB power ports. My only concern about this facility is the lack of public transportation options. This airport is connected to the city by only two bus lines (52 and 92). Of course as this airport is only about 15 minutes' drive from downtown even a taxi ride costs only about $25 which implies a low demand of public transportation options in this region.

The stores are strange - I bought a bottle of water at the same store during each layover. That same bottle of water cost me a different amount each time.

On arrival we were disembarked pretty quickly and efficiently and from there allowed through immigration controls just as happily. The only gripe on arrival was that (it might have been due to the work) the car rental offices were scattered to the 4 winds with no real signage to point you in the right direction so the relevant one was hard to find. The return journey was the same really. Descent queue times and friendly and efficient staff. There were 2 little niggles though. First the staff in some of the eating places could have been nicer. Their card machine wasn't working but they made no effort to tell people instead letting everyone queue and put in hot food orders only telling them after that they couldn't pay. That was just one cafe potentially having a bad day though. The other problem was that the gate we were directed to required going through a further security check point. Although it didn't make clear that you were going in the right direction. A large bunch of people then gathered at this point as no one wanted to go through in case it was the wrong gate (no signs at this point) and there would be difficulty getting back.

However the baggage claim and rental car location was poorly designed. If you are flying Delta the baggage claim is one direction and the rental car pickup location is the extreme opposite direction. It is approximately a mile walk (with luggage!) from the gate to the rental car pickup location. In addition there are an inadequate number of busses that pickup up passengers resulting in delays upward of 10 to 20 minutes. Then the rental car centre has the rental car counters spread out against the wall of the facility while the cars are on the floors above. The only access to the cars are elevators on the opposite side of the terminal. If you are a senior citizen or someone having difficulty walking long distances avoid this terminal at all cost.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,5,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

The terminal seems too small to accommodate the 3 flights that were boarding simultaneously. There were not enough chairs and most people were either standing or sitting on the floor. The lines for flights to JFK and Dulles taking off from adjacent gates were indistinguishable. A third flight to the U.S. was scheduled to take off at the same time as the flight to JFK further pressing the capacity of the terminal.

amman-queen-alia-airport,/airport-reviews/amman-queen-alia-airport,Amman Queen Alia Airport customer review,Hugo Duran,NA,2003-09-24,On our flight change from Amsterdam to Bangkok with Royal Jordanian Airlines we were forced to spend some hours on this airport. I must say this was not a pleasant stay because there is very little to do apart from the brightly illuminated small tax-free shopping area which looks OK. There is enough to see to spend some time. Outside the shopping area there is hardly any thing to do save for some coffee selling points a pizza counter and a France Delight counter where you should think twice to order something to eat or you must be starved in this case anything will help to fill your stomach. The only comfortable seating facilities are situated in front of the France Delight counter but with only about 30 chairs available you find yourself lucky to get a seat. The other places where you can seat are situated close to the gates but these are very uncomfortable and dirty. The local’s are disregarding the non-smoking signs and when you comment to their behaviour they just ignore you and keep on smoking. The male and ladies restrooms are incredible dirty and not well kept. Almost all locks on the doors are not functioning; at the washstand the soap dispensers are out of order you may dip your fingers in the soap containers which are open standing for this purpose on the sink. The faucets are not fixed and rotate in all directions allowed by their flexible connection to the water pipes and in one of the restrooms the electrical cable of the hand- drying unit was inadequately repaired. They just twisted the live wires together and did not insulate the connection thus very dangerous in this wet environment. Although we did spend our waiting time at night in the airport the coolest part of the day it was sticky hot. Our conclusion: Try to avoid this place if possible.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It was slow slow slow. Then there is getting your bag and going through security again which was very slow and chaotic. Extremely lucky to make it to our connecting flight with only 5 minutes to spare. The customs both arriving and leaving Costa Rica was much much more efficient and the agents were friendly.

So people are pushing in left right and centre.

Back in the mid-2000s (when Spain was a booming economy) Barajas was obviously growing at a staggering rate yet it's three well laid-out terminals were very convenient the staff was friendly it was clean security was a breeze and the airport in general had this unmistakable Spanish charm somehow present throughout it. Then one fateful day T4 opened and for me this marked the beginning of the downfall of Barajas. Since the opening of the nonetheless good-looking terminal Madrid's airport has become nothing more than your typical big airport with astonishingly rude staff members (except those at the check-in desks) dirty facilities (T2 is the only terminal that is somehow clean) laughable shopping experience strict security lines increasingly confusing signalling. But one thing in particular makes Barajas actually a desperate case: the fact that it is increasingly resembling London-Heathrow in every single way possible.

Customs is a breeze and the 10 euro 'admission fee' was scrapped in spring 2009 so there are no more fees at all. Usually by the time you're stamped through the bags are already on the belt. There's a new tourism information centre in arrivals now with advice free city guidebooks and maps. The bus to the main square departs every hour otherwise take the official fixed-price taxis. The bookshop in the main hall is pretty well-stocked (with only sister shop Adrion in the centre offering a similar range) so take advantage of it while you're at TIA.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Arrival was at 3am from LHR very long walk to old terminal for immigration although both immigration and baggage were quick and cheerful. Outside the terminal is a complete zoo. No easy public transport. Luckily we had a driver. Transit involved a 4.5 hour change from international to international flight. We were met off the flight by airline staff who did not identify themselves as such until asked then placed in quarantine in a locked area with two other transit passengers. The only facilities were a water fountain and a dirty toilet with no paper. The staff took our passports boarding passes and luggage receipts. To my relief they did come back an hour later with new boarding passes and luggage tags and let us out of the locked area. It did all work in the end - we made our connection and our bags arrived at LHR - it just wasn't very pleasant Facilities at this airport - food shopping wifi toilets and lounges - are all minimal or poor and anywhere from unclean to filthy dirty.,NA,NA,NA,3,4,1,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

The worst aspect of it for me was the 50 metres my elderly mother had to walk in the icy wind from the only drop-off point to reach the terminal (200 metres to International Arrivals). There is neither roof nor windbreak. Wheel chairs are available only once you reach the terminal. Have a look at Auckland: out of the car/taxi/bus - into the terminal; Singapore Wellington and thousands of others including the old Christchurch airport the same. What genius designed this in Christchurch? The regional terminal is a zoo with grossly inadequate facilities - especially seating - to service the volume of passengers. The old airport used to be pretty good - perhaps a bit of a mess in terms of design but it had a lot of character and history behind it. The new(ish) International Lounge area is also good with lots of glass and natural light and good passenger facilities.

The queues at immigration seem to grow and the immigration officials are getting more indifferent every time I land at the airport. They take their time and spend more time chatting with colleagues and in mobile telephone conversations than in stamping passports. Most of the time a simple good morning or even a friendly nod is to much to ask for. Incoming flights are getting delayed by the endless circles planes have to make over the Persian Gulf before finally being able to land and outgoing flights are regularly delayed by 30 to 60 minutes even if everyone is onboard and the doors are shut. The message from the captain is always the same: ""Due to the fact that it is an extremely busy time air traffic control has asked us to wait because there is no space on the runway."" This doesn't change no matter what time of day you are flying. Emirates must be the most delayed airliner in the world. There is clearly a capacity problem at Dubai International leading to massive delays every time.

damascus-airport,/airport-reviews/damascus-airport,Damascus Airport customer review,D Fay,NA,2008-11-19,Damascus Airport gives an unfairly poor impression of Syria. The arrivals area was basic but immigration was conducted quite quickly if without charm. Departure was simply chaotic. As another reviewer pointed out the check in desks have no signage. We found our desk by a process of elimination by wandering up to each desk in turn checking the small paper sign and concluding that ours must be another one. The queue moved painfully slowly with each check in taking 5 minutes. When we reached the top of the queue we realised why - it appeared that every piece of information on out e-ticket had to be keyed in to the computer. The duty free seemed to house the only departure monitor in the whole airport. Worryingly our flight did not appear. We then noticed that the flight number and time on the boarding passes were different to those on our tickets - I guess due to typing errors. Our flight departed at the time on the ticket if we had believed he boarding pass we would have missed it ! While we passed though several security checks no-one seemed to be checking the magnetic gates and at the departure gate I noticed that a door onto the apron was unlocked and unguarded. I guess the authorities figure they have other ways of preventing terrorist attacks. The departure tax is a swingeing SYP1500 though what happens to this money is not evident - certainly not on the airport facilities. Just treat the airport as an experience and don't let it put you off visiting Syria.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,Jason Martin,United States,2015-07-01,"Recently arrived and departed through Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3, and it was not a good experience. To point out the only positive, I am sure everyone agrees the architecture and terminal structure is very modern and nice. Other than that there are no positives. I arrived from Hong Kong and waited over an hour in the immigration line. There were only three passport control agents for hundreds of passengers. While waiting in line there were Chinese Security guards yelling at passengers in Chinese, leaving Non-Chinese speaking passengers very confused. After you clear immigration you take a train to the main terminal. Going through baggage claim was a hassle and customs checks everyone's bags. I waited over 45 minutes in a taxi line. Then the fun started. On departures, do not use a mobile boarding pass. You have to scan your boarding pass in order to go on the the train. Then you arrive at the satellite terminal and wait in a long line to go through passport control. After they check your boarding pass and passport, you have to wait in another long line for another official to check your boarding pass and passport and to go through security. The space is really small and people were pushing. I was flying Business Class and had to beg the Security Official to let me use the fast track lane, while people were cutting it with no explanation. Once they check your boarding pass and passport again, they make you take out iPads. I went to the Air China Business Class Lounge, and needed to use Wifi (which you would expect they would have at the lounge) - they have a machine where you have to scan your passport and it gives you a number. The WiFi didn't even work, so it was a waste of time. IF you are going to the US they search for liquids right by the boarding gate and will take away your water (will make you depend on the rations by the flight attendants), even through they had several checkpoints before hand. All in all, this is a very disorganized and a passenger unfriendly airport.

The airport has only two departure lounges where passengers seat like they are in school bus all facing in front. On Fridays and Saturdays when there are several flights departing almost at the same time the departure lounges are full to capacity. The situation is worse when flights are delayed and it is normal to find more 500+ passengers in a lounge meant for not more than 200 people. Air-conditioning in the lounges does not work well and the TVs make so much noise that it is impossible to hear the announcements. The Duty Free shops are extortion points selling items for prices that are way above the normal price. Indeed there are renovations going on at the airport but the benefits are yet to be seen. A couple of years back customs officers used to connive with “helpers” (trolley pushers) and armed robbers and several passengers arriving in Accra had their items stolen. The Government moved in and cleared the airport of “helpers”. These people are back again.

Restaurant & bar upstairs are reasonable and deliver good quality food & drink (helpful staff!). Friendly ground-personnel and no need to run a marathon to reach the gate makes it a relaxing experience. Once you go though the security and passport check you seem to arrive in quite a different country all-together: 'tax-free' is a complete rip-off prices of salmon are triple(!) of that in Cork (same trademark and quantity) so duly you bleed for your families request. A cup of coffee at the bar suffers the same added-value while seemingly being made out a mixture of tarmac and dishwater here the personnel seems to be trained not to understand any language (I tried 3) and so ignoring my protest (he was probably rightfully to ashamed to respond).

Check-in was fast but the check-in staff tried to convince many passengers that their baggage (which was within weight limits of the way out) was now over weight and surcharges would have to be paid. Perhaps the fact that some of the scales read 3 kg when unloaded and others read 12 kg might have had something to do with it! Immigration and further security was efficient.

Woe betide you if you face a spate of cancelled flights in the winter! The place is pleasant enough with a variety of middle of the road food choices but the new smoking lounge in the centre of Concourse B and the DEN Boingo implementation are two real black marks. No smoking lounge can never be made not to smell and when patrons come out the door they carry a powerful cigarette/cigar odour down the corridor with them. As for Boingo when you open a browser on a smartphone Boingo comes up as your only option and though it isn't free it's not obvious how to get past it to search through your cellular device alone. The only way I could find to deal with it was to turn off wireless services. DEN has a much better physical plant than PHX for instance but is nowhere near as traveller- friendly.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,/airport-reviews/houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport customer review,N Ward,Canada,2012-07-31,Your experience at Houston seems dependent on what part of the airport you need to pass through. On International arrivals immigration lines are always long but if it is an option for you get signed up for Global Entry. There is never a line at the dozen or so kiosks and you will be on your way through immigration in minutes rather than hours. Once into the airport Terminal B is by far the worst. Crowded and more than showing its age. Be prepared to stand in the gate area unless you are willing to camp out in the windowless hallways. Use the washroom and eat elsewhere in the airport if you can otherwise be prepared to stand in line for both. Terminal E being the newest has plenty of space with decent places to eat. Apart from staying away from Terminal B Houston is simply typical.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

humberside-airport,/airport-reviews/humberside-airport,Humberside Airport customer review,Alan Jones,United Kingdom,2012-02-08,Excellent airport I agree completely with the last two reviews. I would say to Alastair Finch that he should not worry the airport seems to be holding its own. Having flown from Doncaster recently I was expecting a far better level of service from the UKs newest airport but all I found were closed shops and poor customer service. Access from the A15 and M180 is excellent meaning it can be reached within 30 minutes from all of the nearby population centres. Customer service is second to none and one can be off the plane and through to the car in minutes. The only thing lacking is the range of direct destinations but it seems that is more to do with the economy than the competition. Certainly the KLM service is a godsend and far better than travelling to Heathrow or Manchester for direct flights. I would highly recommend people from the Humber region and Lincolnshire to give this place a try if they haven't already. Given the choice I would sooner travel from Humberside over Leeds Doncaster and East Midlands any day despite living closer to Doncaster.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Tom Watts,United Kingdom,2014-11-25,"It really is staggering how bad Bristol Airport is for a regional British airport. The problems start with actually getting to the place the bus is hugely expensive (£7 from the station compared to say £3.20 for the metro from the station to the Airport in Newcastle (which is a further distance but much faster) hugely impacted by traffic - there are no bus lanes on the route into the city and without alternative apart from taxis or private hire. If you drive to the airport then you better not follow the signs because you won't really get there well not in anything remotely resembling a reasonable time as the signing routes you out of the city then back into the centre again before directing you back out this is to avoid a residential area but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. Check-in/bag drop is usual for a regional airport not good but it works in the height of summer its a nightmare but otherwise its reasonably organised and as its quite a small area it works ok. Security is usually quite well organised but the staff are the worst I have ever experienced in the entire world. Its really tragic I usually make some kind of error even though I try really hard not to its like they're trying to catch you out the liquids rules are followed with an iron fist! I was once taken into a private room for having a ""hidden compartment"" in my bag this was actually just an interior pocket that the security person was unable to open I offered to help but was told to not interfere and then taken to a private room.... brilliant. I also walked through with a chap stick in my pocket which was found during a routine pat down apparently I was trying to ""smuggle liquids on board"" and the offending chap stick was placed through the x-ray. The departure area is hilarious firstly this is the only airport I've ever been to where the largest shop is a Claires Accessories. Not that it isn't an important thing to have in the airport but its not going to help get around the fact that there is no-where decent to buy a sandwich except starbucks which is tiny and often sold of most things by the evening. The seating isn't bad once you work out there's an upstairs but overall the whole place is poorly laid out and several of the gates queue straight into the main shopping area which while nicely avoiding a long walk does make the whole place disorganised. To compare Bristol to larger airports would be unfair but even compared to other similar regional airports is a disaster I've been to most airports in the UK and every time I'm in Bristol I'm always surprised that it is just as bad as I remember it being.",NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Then after you do finally recover your luggage the customs personnel try to make you go through the ""declare"" line (especially for the Dubai - Baku flight) which requires putting luggage through the x- ray machines again. Another complaint is in regards to the toilets. There must be some way to train the staff what ""clean"" means. The cleaning ladies are always in the WC (some times sleeping on the counter) but it is never clean - even when they are mopping the floor it is a matter of moving the grime from one spot to another.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

However the air con was inadequate and the bathroom shower when we got back home was really needed. I wonder if this would be a major problem during the very busy Summer months.

In the past  if you had a re-entry permit you could line up with the Japanese people at the immigration counter. That system was very good. However they changed the system recently. On my last trip from Vietnam there was 7 lines for Japanese 4 for tourists and 1 for immigrants (re-entry permit holders). As I was not aware of the new system my first reaction was to queue with the Japanese people but big mistake... I was sent to this huge line that was for the immigrants only. I have always loved Japan and unlike many foreigners I have never had any problems in Japan. But after queuing for a good hour and seeing that the only remaining line was ours I felt quite insulted. It was clear that Japanese were to be first second tourist and finally immigrants. A few people shouted while they were queuing as the situation was outrageous. All the counters were empty but they refused to let us go to the empty counters. Unfortunately for those who got angry they got told off like a ten-year old would be if he had been up to some very bad mischief.

We had to queue 25 mins for an automatic passport check queued 20 minutes to see an immigration official then picked up luggage then queued again to someone to check our reason for visiting rechecked bags then had to clear security again (more queuing). On top of that the boarding cards from LHR didn't work so we were sent back to the American Airlines desk to be reissued new ones. Until we got to a gate staff were almost universally unhelpful (we were told by all that we had time to make our flight easily). American airlines blame the airport and take no responsibility for the systematic chaos and the airport staff apparently don't get any feedback that people are missing their flights because of the queuing. We missed our flight to SLC were put on standby for the next one late at night were booked onto one the following day in the end which was cancelled when we arrived at the airport the next morning. Not to mention last minute gate changes causing havoc and confusion for passengers. We did get to SLC in the end having been issued 5 separate lots of boarding cards.

Upon arrival we were at a remote stand and had to take a bus to the terminal. The immigration line was about one hour but most stands were manned so we figured that this was a result of multiple international flights arriving at the primary entry point to Turkey. While it wasn't fun we understood why the line was that long. A couple of days later we returned to depart for Bucharest early morning arrival. Security to enter the terminal was not long at all and the check-in for the airline was about a 10 minute wait. Same for outbound immigration and security. We had breakfast at the food court it was more expensive than downtown Istanbul but comparable to Western airports. Boarding was not a problem but no seating at the departure gate (again by bus). Returning home we were transiting from Bucharest through IST to Boston and we didn't have connecting boarding passes (although our luggage was checked through). No line at the transit desk to get the connecting boarding pass friendly staff. No line at the international transfer security checkpoint. Although our transfer time was only 1 hr 20 mins we had plenty of time to go through duty free between flights.

This airport is a huge improvement on the one it replaced. However I have used the new airport at least a dozen times a year since it opened and in my view it is greatly overrated an opportunity missed reflecting the small-mindedness of the state of South Australia itself. The long straight layout may help plane movements on the tarmac but is a nuisance for passengers inside. The walk to a toilet can be quite long and the way some of the boarding gates are sealed off for international flights is cumbersome and must surely make future expansion of this business difficult. Signposting on the access roads outside is unclear and about the only plus is that the new parking station has made traffic movement better.

I had 5 hrs before my flight was not allowed into the international area for at least 2 hrs no suggestion of where you could rest. I spoke to the security staff at the visitors viewing gallery and was let in and sat around for 2 hrs unable to use the washroom facilities as I was unable to leave my baggage unsupervised. Once International check-in was completed had to sit in the gate lounge for nearly 2 hrs. Washroom facilities were filthy toilets were filthy awash with water no soap to wash hands.

Had organised a wheelchair as I have breathing problems but it didn't turn up. I struggled along to stand in Passport Control for an hour or more. The queues were horrendous. I got through eventually and got to baggage reclaim to find out like hundreds of other people did that there were no trolleys. I tried to get help but there was none and they did not know when the trolleys would be collected from the car parks. I am 70 years old and had to struggle trying to pull 2 small suitcases and my hand luggage. I will never fly from Heathrow again.

poznan-airport,/airport-reviews/poznan-airport,Poznan Airport customer review,Rolf Heelas,NA,2006-07-10,A smallish airport but modern and lots of facilities for an airport of that size. Longish queues at checkin but it was a fully booked Ryanair flight so this was to be expected. Instead of parking planes right up to the terminal where there is usually lots of space they use buses to ferry people the 100meters or so. The airport is very close to the city center but the travel time is longer than expected due to the stop start nature of the route taxi fare from center to Airport for me was 20PLZ. For some odd reason there are duplication of services at this airport which is odd for its size. by the exit/entrance there are 2 very small newsagents opposite each other. In the tiny departures area there are 2 different tiny duty free shops both selling same kinds of goods.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,J Christie,United Kingdom,2014-07-27,Marseille MP2 is frankly a bit of a pit - presumably the airlines that use it benefit from reduced fees which they pass on to customer. Definitely feels like the steerage option and I shudder to think how this works for the very old the very young and those with reduced mobility for disabilities whether temporary or permanent. Felt like a visit to a DIY store with service on same basis. It feels as if there is a complicit acceptance of you have paid your money and made your choice about this place. The only positive to the recent air traffic controller strike in June is that we took an Easyjet flight to Nice instead of MP2 - I had been warned by a friend who flew last year but my wife and I were still surprised on our return leg.

Ordinary busses available to reach Bruxelles the cost is €8 for a no- return ticket and takes 1hr to get to the Bruxelles Midi railway station. Fast baggage delivery. On the coming back fast check-in and self check-in terminals are available just select your flight and enter your booking code. Clear audio message in English French and Flemish. In the public area you can find a chemist a bar-restaurant and a cafe where they sell sandwiches and sweets plus a very good press shop. The boarding area is quite small there is a big duty free shop selling usual things you can find there but also a good selection of chocolate. Unfortunately the prices are a bit higher than in other places. Also available is a small restaurant. Drinks do cost much more than in Rome: €3.00 for a 0.5l bottle of Coke!

We had planned on eating at one of the food outlets but there wasn't even time for us to visit the toilets before going to the gate! There was not time to buy anything (other than the sandwich) sit down catch our breath. It was very stressful and got our otherwise enjoyable holiday off to a very bad start.

The automated gates would also not work and when I went to the only person I could see to help at the Express queue he told me I would have to wait as the £3 people take priority.

Be warned long queues causing passengers to miss their flights. The airport is not taking responsibility for long queues - they must know the volumes of expected passengers and when peak times are and are not providing enough facilities to cope. They should inform the airlines to tell their passengers to allow more time. Easyjet say if you've checked in online arriving 40 mins before a flight is sufficient time when it clearly is not especially for early morning flights.

When we finally reached a member of staff after waiting over an hour we complained only to be told in a flippant response ""Well it is a busy time of the year"".

The family security lane are brilliant especially considering that we were travelling at 5am with 6 tired children the staff were very nice and made the experience very easy. The range of shops is good however it could do with some new restaurants.

What really annoys me is there do not seem to be enough airbridges so there is a trek down lots of stairs to get to aircraft. Added to that is the walking distance to some of the gates even younger passengers were out of breath. Why did BHX not install a moving walkway when building the International Pier. Same thing happened on return. Not connected to airbridge parked close to arrivals door but then long trek to passport control.

Access via public transport is lousy and in order to make more money they moved the airport from the B-zone to the C-zone in the public transportation map. So now you pay more for your ticket but have less trains running due to the S-Bahn in Berlin having technical difficulties. Also late at night and especially on weekends you find lots of young drunken people and hooligans on these trains - no safety staff there.

vienna-airport,/airport-reviews/vienna-airport,Vienna Airport customer review,Pavel Iosad,Norway,2010-05-01,Arrival OK bussed to the gate butthat's pretty normal with low-cost carriers here. Once inside met by airport employees giving out tourist booklets. Some waiting for luggage but nothing too bad. Out through customs slightly cramped and signage could be better. Signs to the train steers you towards the airport train which is the same as S-Bahn but costs much more: make sure you go for the S-Bahn it is very easy to miss. Departure: if you arrive by train (whether S-Bahn or CAT) you have to go through the arrivals area and a narrow corridor to find an elevator to departures: suboptimal. But the worst part was that our flight to Oslo was not on the screens! It turned out that low-cost carriers have a separate check-in building across the road from the main terminal. Though HG flights which also have to be checked in in that building are on the screens. There is basically no information on that: very bad. Once we found the check-in desk and dropped the luggage (which went reasonably fast) the rest was OK. Security is at the gate so you go first to a very decent selection of shops and cafes. The ground-floor boarding area (the bus-gates) is shambolic though lots of flights with probably three security channels and while the security people were doing their best there was some queuing. Once in it's very packed and there is a pretty useless shop wedged in between the gates so there were two chaotic queues trying to get through some very narrow space. Overall: does the job but needs work in many areas. Good shopping though.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Even went through US Customs on the way and the waits were all reasonable. We made our connecting flight with time to spare. Our return trip was not so easy. In San Francisco we were given a brief explanation about getting our luggage near Canada Customs and having to transfer it ourselves. Once through Customs (the line was very short so there was no problem - but getting there from the plane was a long walk) on the way to picking up our luggage we asked one of the information people (right beside carousel 25) about getting our luggage to our connecting flight. She was totally useless!!! She told us we had to exit the terminal and go back in to the check-in area. That made no sense to us. My daughter had noticed the sign for connecting flights in Canada and that made more sense to me. Of course the helper overheard us and then asked for our boarding cards and then changed her mind and agreed with us!

Since EVA's departure was at 1 AM I did not go through security until after midnight. Unfortunately shops were closed. Could not buy water for the trip which was not good. Despite the renovated area the departure gate did not have enough seats for everyone. The bathroom close by looked newly renovated but cleaning crew did a poor job of keeping it clean. On the return we lucked out since TBIT was not yet busy. Friendly immigration officer. Baggage carousels were awful. Although they were new the carousels couldn't handle the volume of bags from one 744. The carousel would stop and a baggage handler would have to make room for the bags.

The airport's a tip and it's important to check the time of your connecting flight to avoid being stuck there for an extended period. The air-conditioning system seems to be fighting a losing battle with the temperature and humidity. The airport and indeed the country are third world but the people are nice so you feel everyone’s in the same boat. A western or Japanese woman will full of complaints “too hot too dirty too third world smells bad” as well as hanging on your gun arm. But don’t think you are going to pick up some local company. You go in alone you are likely to stay that way. Myanmar's are far nicer and less bent and violent than Thais so a misunderstanding with a taxi driver is unlikely to end in unpleasantness.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,M Jensen,NA,2009-02-27,Orlando airport is in dire need of renovation which it appears they are working on but if you are traveling through this airport currently prepare for less-than-comfortable surroundings. I fly through many airports and this is by far on the low end of major airports. In the 1-29 wing the ceilings have been removed revealing the structure and it looks as if asbestos is exposed to all. There are air ducts in plastic running overhead that shoot a brisk breeze to all below. There are minimal food options and restrooms. The line at Starbucks is huge because it's the only game in town in this wing of the airport. The airport does nothing to help their cause. If you have the option fly into Tampa which is much nicer especially if you're on business. You can avoid the families and retirees who know little about navigating through security etc.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There was so much wrong it's hard to know where to start. Starting with having to climb down some steep stairs with our carry-on luggage after deplaning wander along a long hallway only to have to take an escalator back up. Miles later customs. Drag luggage to re-check it in for the remainder of the flight home. Through TSA because we had touched our checked baggage to drag it from customs. Then running with luggage from one end of the airport to another - including having to exit the secured area and cross a ticket lobby to get to the gate we needed to depart on. Had to then wait in a huge line to go through TSA again. Then running to make our gate at the end of another terminal. Showed up with barely a minute to spare only to find out they had changed our departure gate and did not announce it in the areas we were. The gate agent said they would call to tell the people at the new gate we were on the way and to wait. Once again running to the end of yet another terminal only to find the plane had left. Gate agent not only didn't care but was extremely rude. Others missed the flight as well - for the same reason. We were stranded in the airport overnight.

Once a gate is called there is now an extremely long walk some of it uphill and involving stairs. There is no seating and no facilities for half-a-mile!

Arrivals was quick. (I recommend getting your visa prior to arriving in ADD as the visa application process does take a while) Clearing immigration and getting your passport stamp took no longer than 3 minutes. Bags took about 20 minutes to arrive and came out sporadically but all came safely and thats all that matters. Ethiopian customs x-rays all luggage prior to exiting so that took some time as well but you are dealt with in a professional and polite manner. As for departures your tickets and passports are checked prior to entering the terminal building and there is an x-ray and metal detector immediately upon entering. Check-in was efficient USA departures have their own area where you are asked the typical security questions. Your passports/visas are heavily scrutinized (presumably because of the large amount of fraudulent documents that make their way through ADD and airlines getting charged large fines for transporting these people.) Passing through immigration is a simple exit stamp and you proceed upstairs where there is a fair amount of duty free shops and eateries. There is another security check to enter the specific gate area (and might I add the metal detector in the gate is extremely sensitive). Overall ADD is a clean and efficient airport with no major problems or difficulties encountered. 4 stars only because they could use a better selection of eateries.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The only drawback is terminal 3 because you have to walk for at least 20 minutes from car parks and it offers nearly no shops and bars and not enough seats! But I assume they will modify it a bit. As a frequent airport user I can tell you that this is one of the best in europe conserving human scale even though traffic is growing. LYS is now hub of Easyjet with many european destinations and a direct route to New-York will be opened this July (with 5 flights a week!).

How this is supposed to improve security (the officially stated reason) is beyond me - but it does provide additional income for touts who pounce on passenger's luggage and lift it into the buses.

Once into departures area I searched for some kind of pain relief for chronic headache only to be informed that there was no pharmacy anywhere throughout the whole airport due to the recent fire.

I arrived at 7pm to board a 10pm flight to Singapore. The airport was sparsely populated at that time. The environment was clean too. So what was lacking? 1) WiFi - Apparently the airport offers a 30 minute complementary WiFi. If you have a laptop iPad or mobile phone all you need to do is to give your mobile phone number to receive a serial number and password. Beyond 30 minutes you need to purchase WiFI. I made several attempts but I did not receive a text message at all. 2) Food If you are hoping to get a bite before you enter the departure lounge you will be bitterly disappointed. There are a handful of cafes offering unappetizing snacks. I would strongly suggest you bring packed food if you are going to be a long while in this airport. 3) Security Tags - When you are checking in be sure you ask for security tags for your hand-carrying bags. They will not tell you this. At the Customs check point the officers will stamp this tag. If you don't have one they would have to find one and then you will get a ticking off for not getting one. How are we to know we need one if this is not practised world-wide and the person at the check-in counter does not tell you?

rome-fiumicino-airport,/airport-reviews/rome-fiumicino-airport,Rome Fiumicino Airport customer review,W Far,United States,2015-04-03,Immigration security and check-in/ticketing for US airlines departing FCO is in Terminal 5. If arriving via the Leonardo Express you must take a bus from T3 to T5. There is a disconnect between where the signs direct you to and where the actual bus pick up is located. At T5 you're asked a number of questions at a security kiosk before being allowed to proceed to check-in/ticketing. After ticketing you proceed to security screening. Maybe it's just my bad luck but three or four couples immediately before me all set off the metal detector (multiple times) and it took 15-20 minutes for me to pass through security. At immigration there were only two agents working and the line grew quickly. (US airlines departures times from FCO are all late mornings.) After immigration you must take a second bus from T3 to Terminal G. Surprisingly Terminal G is actually modern clean and had many shops and restaurants. However like an IKEA store the signage directs you to walk the entirety of the terminal in a clockwise direction to get from gate G1 to gate G14. I suppose this is great for the restaurants and shops but horrible for the traveler rushing to catch a flight. Once you successfully arrive at your gate you discover the lack of available seating. Fortunately there is free wifi. While surfing the internet standing up I wanted a drink of water and possibly fill my empty water bottle for the upcoming 11 hour long flight. I was politely informed there is no drinking fountain available in the terminal and to get 'free' water I must ask one of the restaurants/cafes. How can a major international airport terminal not have one single drinking fountain?! I relented and bought bottled water. Boarding was painless but there is a chance of random secondary screening immediately prior to boarding.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,5,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

It worked. Signage there is useless as it doesn't explain difference between Shengen and non-Schengen wings. Went through both terminals. Overall impression was very depressing. Badly planned and poorly managed. I had no problem at security due to late departure time. Otherwise ten minutes spent on scanning my bag wouldn't work in big crowd. Immigration had just one manned desk for all outbound non-EU traffic. Regular passengers crews fast track - all served in one line in total chaos by one officer. I gave up my turn in the line for 12 crew members 2 business class passengers and one family with a baby. So many people jumping the queue before me! On arrival with Lufthansa from Nice we were parked somewhere within 10 minutes bus ride. Arrival hall had just one narrow escalator (supermarket type) for 300 people with hand luggage. On departure we were asked to use automated gate with bar code readers with no staff to assist. Many people with home printed and mobile boarding passes were confused with no help at all. Staff at the restaurant landside near b24 gate didn't speak English. Toilets near gates packed with people and not very clean.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,Steve Wadham,NA,2009-03-13,Travelled LHR to MIA and arrived at rear of 90 min queue for immigration late afternoon. Lucky we changed our plans 2 months earlier as a result of reading this site. We had allowed 1 hr 45 mins to change to AA flight to Cancun which was OK with airlines who allow 1 hr 35 for transfer but clearly not enough time. We therefore stayed overnight and travelled the next day. On our return flight it could not have been more different we arrived early afternoon and there were no queues at all we were through immigration in 5 mins. That was great but we will never transfer through an airport again unless we can overnight as you just don't know how long the Immigration Q will be not just in the USA but worldwide. Miami is an older airport in the BA and AA areas and reminded me of 1960's 'Thunderbirds' film settings. Real vintage stuff but it has all you need with regard to toilets and food. Passenger search was reasonably quick and no complaints there. It is confusing checking in with AA but if you memorise the airport layout on the website you get an idea of where to go to checkin which helped us find BA check-in.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Held in the corridor and released in batches because immigration was dangerously overcrowded. Then had to wait with my wife for over 90 minutes in the queue.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,Anthony Robinson,United Kingdom,2013-10-07,This reviews not just based upon my most recent visit it is based upon both visits this year as they were both as bad. If the operating problems were just a one off they would not have been identical on both occasions. I realize that airports like everywhere else have busy periods but it is up to the management team to manage those times and as they should know when most flights are due to take off and land be prepared for them. Arrive at the airport you cannot drop passengers outside the terminal without paying £2 for the privilege so all the party must go to the car park and get on the 16 seat mini bus. Early morning there can be 16 people waiting at each bus stop so give yourself plenty of time to transfer to the airport. Once at the airport the check ins do move reasonably fast but that's the airlines ground services who have made that possible. Then the nightmare of security. Please allow an hour or so for this unless of course you pay extra to fast track. Now I begrudge this as I've already paid for security in my initial not insubstantial charges made by the airline. Once through security you are taken through a maze of shops with no where to sit. As I usually have my elderly parents with me and they've had to endure the security line this is a requirement. The cafes bars and restaurants are all very over priced I know airports are not cheap places to eat and drink but LBA is a lot more expensive then Manchester or East Midlands near by. Once you land back the real nightmare begins. It always seems to take the airport by surprise that more then one plane lands within an hour. The walk outside to the terminal building can be 400m in a covered walk way then a further 3 to 400 m inside up stairs and crossing the path of other passengers getting onto departing planes. Once you arrive at the passport control area there are only a maximum of 6 border guards yesterday this was full manned however I have known only 4 with 1 taken up by priority line (extra fees apply). It has taken me so long to get through this debacle that they had taken my case off the carousel and into left luggage and I was not the only passenger on my flight that this happened to. Once through the buses to the car parks are the same. The drivers are great but with only 3 of them and 16 sweater buses they are fighting a losing battle. All in all avoid if possible. Which is a pity as its a great local resource badly managed.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

I must say that it is a major upgrade from the other terminals in terms of facilities and passenger flow but still needs some major work. Less queueing to get airside but the waiting lounges are still quite cramped especially for the international flights. I think they forgot that most of these flights involve wide body 777s or A330s and there just isn't enough room. Respectably better eating places than the other terminals but still need more choices. Shopping stalls are wanting. Toilet facilities are still severely lacking but much cleaner than T1 or T2. On arrival less queuing in the immigration area and smooth access through customs.

I must say that CLT is the most efficient airport I've ever seen in my life of traveling and I've traveled to some of the largest and most reputable airports in the world. From disembarking to claiming luggage immigration customs and going through security it was all literally a matter of 20 minutes give or take. I'd like to see any airport in the United States come anywhere close to that. Customs and immigration officers for international arrivals were friendly and cheerful. TSA were also surprisingly very polite and helpful too. Shopping and food choices are unbelievable not even JFK has such a selection.

When we arrived at the correct terminal located in an industrial-looking area the driver instructed me to walk up a metal staircase. At the top of the stairs sat an employee of my airline. I showed him my boarding pass he told me the gate number had been changed and I set off to find my way there. Upon arrival at the new gate I was surprised to see no airline employees at the desk and no other passengers waiting. Ten minutes before my connecting flight was to leave I walked across the terminal again showed my boarding pass only to be told the gate had been changed again. The employee berated me for not listening to the announcements which I don't remember hearing then showed me how I could quickly get to the correct gate.

It amazes me that the US with all its other attractions for visitors would continue to discourage international visitors by treating them the way the Immigration Customs and Homeland Security do at LAX. On my last visit there I spent 1.5 hours in a queue standing in a dirty hot arrival hall. The staff were disinterested and rude. No smiles or 'welcome to the US'. Whoever is responsible for the management of this place should hang their head in shame.

Ryanair  who base 6 737-800`s here use the area directly in front of the terminal. Passport/Border control can be busy and crowded if more than one aircraft in-especially for UK passengers. Luggage collection hall is large with six carousels but again can get very busy as the Ryanair flights go out together in the morning and return at a similar time at 4-5 hour intervals during the day with final flights about 22.30.Other charter flights are spread out throughout the day and night with  as has been traditional for many years at holiday destinations - a ""German day""  a ""British day"" a ""Dutch day"" etc.No Customs as such  just out through the doors to a full length and narrow area where Holiday and Car Hire reps. await. Coaches and a car park is straight opposite and since Ryanair arrived there has been a substantial investment by the airport including a new multi storey car park access roads and a new filling station/car hire area. The whole arrival system generally seems to work quite well . Departures- Check in is generally a nightmare the area is far too small for the numbers and Ryanair will not start check in until 2 hours before departure leaving queues of 150+ sometimes snaking out of the entrance doors (and in amongst the smokers). This problem is made worse by passengers repacking luggage at the front of the line to save paying excess.It is also exasperated by the charter companies dropping off their clients 3 hours before making the whole area very busy.There is a large cafe/bar which is again very busy. Once checked in it gets much better and you pass upstairs  through very strict security and scanning to the large and airy departure lounge with views of most of the airfield. Two decent sensibly priced snack restaurantst hree large shops and loads of seating including an open area with bar at high season. There is no executive lounge but with business users using the Madrid shuttle and many leisure travellers now having Priority Pass there is a gap in the market. Announcements and signs are good with departure gates normally shown well in advance  saving the last minute dash. Boarding staff are efficient and motivated for a quick turnaround.

No paper no soap but a smell that can guide you from any corner of the arrival hall. During peak season such as May Holiday they have probably 2-3000 people leaving within one hour. But there are less than 100 trollys. Many flights are after 9PM check out time in mot hotels is noon. Many tourists spend the last three or four hours at the airport! So the few trollys are quickly snapped up and kept for hours by those arriving early and leaving late. On the other hand it's really only a short way from the car to the check-in counter. The waiting area is definitely too small for this peak-travel season both before and after security check. Best to arrive no more than 45 min before departure and get straight on the plane.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,2013-01-02,Return flight from LHR with BA. Everything about this airport appears to be designed to make things as awkward for pax as possible or to get them to spend as much money as possible. From the £2.00 drop-off charge to the poor pedestrian access to the long-stay car parks it's mostly bad. The airport had few arrivals at the time we landed yet it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive. On the return leg it took 25 minutes to check-in just 6 passengers in front of me then another 20 minutes to clear security. For an airport which only had 5 flights within the hour this is unacceptable. Airside is crowded and poorly-ventilated with lots of unpleasant drunken locals staggering around. Although the number of shops/restaurants is much better now this is at the expense of space. Seating is minimal unless you are willing to spend money to eat in the overpriced restaurants. I've flown from several similar-sized airports abroad and it's been a breeze compared to this. LHR T1 is heaven compared to LBA. It's been 4 years since I last used this airport and I hope it's at least another 4 after this experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

One pay machine for the car park if you can find it and when you do there is a queue. All designed to rip you off.

Anyone who wants a plain cheese roll/sandwich without industrial mayonnaise or antisocial onions is out of luck. The usual dank offerings are on sale. Everything is grossly overpriced. The croissants are quite nice but ludicrously expensive. The miniature ones are over a pound. Sometimes the selection is not available because the oven is churning out those tasteless muffins. There is no proper bookshop only a Smith’s. The choice of reading material is not inspiring. Luckily we’ve never been delayed much.

newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,Ronda Wright,United States,2014-12-10,If I could rate this airport a 0 I would! There were a number of problems here: luggage taking 25 minutes to be released from an international flight when so many people had connecting flights about to leave only 2 security lines open after 4 international flights just landed and over half those people trying to go back through security to catch a domestic flight. The absolute worst experience was due to a police office/security guard. As I was heading to the immigration line after securing my luggage I decided to head further up the side of the line to say goodbye to my friends that had already been in the massive line for awhile. As I started calling out to them the officer started yelling at me that I had no right to cut the line. I tried to explain to him that I wasn't cutting the line I was just trying to say goodbye. (In fact I have global entry so there is a separate much quicker line for me to enter through immigration.) He continued to engage with me and loudly yell that I have no right to cut people that have been in line the entire time. I kept trying to explain to him that I was not cutting and that I was trying to say goodbye but he would not listen in fact he kept cutting me off and loudly shouting at me. I eventually decided to just stop engaging with him but he I was so shocked at how he was trying to make a scene and wouldn't listen to anything I had to say.

Flew from and returned to the airport on a domestic flight. Security wasn't too bad. Duties were dispensed efficiently enough on a Sunday evening. Although as usual a little more smile and basic customer service wouldn't go amiss they were a far cry from the surly folks of the international airport. Once airside I was impressed by the improvements. What was once a small airport is now a small airport that feels a good deal bigger with facilities that punch above the weight of its small stature. Only problem is that from departures all flight board first through doors A B or C and then on to the gate number.

barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,Margaret Burford,NA,2009-09-23,"Terminal 1 - after checking in we were given boarding passes for Gate D.

We could see passports were being checked at D so we proceeded forward. Wrong. Don't go through passport control until you are ready to board your plane. Once through the security check go straight down the escalator to the shops and restaurants. The big glass balcony that houses the security check area and Gates D and E give you the impression that once you have passed through passport control you can still proceed downstairs to the shops and restaurants - you can't. Once we realised our mistake I felt such a fool that I thought I would not be telling anyone until I realised that the balcony had loads of people wandering around wondering how they could now get down to the shopping area. Although the passport booth had a sign saying you cannot return back once having passed through this just conveyed the message to most people that you could not leave the airport. We did not realise it meant you would no longer have access to the shopping/restaurant area!

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,M Birks,United Kingdom,2014-10-31,Landed at terminal 2 at 14.20 and was greeted by what can only be described as chaos. 3 planes had landed in quick succession and the queues at passport control were horrendous - at least 500 people waiting even though we had an e-passport we were told to join the huge queue as the line at the e-passport gate was in danger of blocking the exits. After a very long wait we were greeted by the chaos that was the baggage of two planes being put on the one carousel. After a lovely holiday to come home to be greeted by what only can be described as utter chaos was too much - will I be travelling from Manchester again?

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,B Scott,United States,2012-06-18,Once you are actually in the airport it's lovely. Getting to the airport however is not nearly as pleasant. Flew in and out of Denver in June 2012. On the return from the time we arrived at the rental car return lot it took 45 minutes to get to the gate and the security line was just a couple of minutes. The car rental lots are a long bus ride from the terminal and if you are returning to Terminal West there's now a detour. If you don't need to check in take a bus to Terminal East if you can. Car rental prices at DIA are much higher than in Denver and the taxes are fees are very high - about 25%. If you can pick up your rental car downtown - admittedly not very practical with the transit options to downtown you can save a lot of money. I'm sure the airport works well for connections - but watch out for thunderstorm delays in summer - but for actually visiting Denver it's not very convenient.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,Vincent Smith,NA,2008-01-10,"MIA is my hometown airport. For someone who has been using this airport all his life I'm use to the construction/traffic etc - so I know how to plan my way around these obstacles. Concourse J (the new one) is beautiful and different to the rest of the terminal. Immigration lines are a breeze as well as check in. As for the rest of the airport; and I mean AA territory (literally) this is where most of the complaints stem from. The check in area is very small the roof is low it feels gloomy the carpet is outdated etc. Then you have the entrance to Concourse D in addition to a very popular restaurant all established right smack in the middle of this small check in area. In other words it does get very crowded at times in this extremely busy part of MIA. To add insult to injury Concourse A is temporarily closed - so all traffic that was shifted to that area at one point is now back to Concourse C/D. Folks brace yourselves if you are flying AA from MIA for the next 2-3 years because the lines will be outrageous. Check in online at home if you can (unless you have bags or traveling internationally) and get to the airport EARLY. Regarding customs/immigration arriving with AA this should no longer be an issue (time wise) as most other carriers that shared the E immigration facility together with AA have now moved to the new Concourse J. So AA (together with only a few OneWorld partners) has the E immigration facility to themselves. The frustration may start once immigration/customs is clear - bags have been rechecked and one has to ""find"" the connecting gate. The signage is pretty clear for those who have to endure this but it can be a bit complicated I will admit. Just ask for directions and you will be guided accordingly. It does involve having to go to level 2 since the exit for E Immigration is in level 1. The elevators and escalators are behind recheck. Once all construction to what will be known as ""The North Terminal"" for AA is complete (someday) then things will start to ease out for AA passengers at MIA. Unfortunately it will still take some time as building an airport on top of another one without being able to close it is extremely time consuming. For those with a layover in MIA its like any other airport - you have your shops restaurants and there is a hotel inside the terminal by Concourse E where you can go to the Top of the Port Restaurant and enjoy a meal or cocktail while waiting for your next flight - away from all the terminal drama. It almost feels like an airline frequent flyer club. Surprisingly the hotel is known as ""The Miami International Airport Hotel"". Regarding some comments complaining about how everyone at the airport only speaks Spanish or speak something that sounds like French Miami's population is predominantly from Latin America and the Caribbean. Please don't feel stunned or out of place just because you hear anything but English in your surroundings. All employees that work directly with customer service do need to speak English. For someone who lives in South Florida I will continue to use MIA. Even if the fare is slightly higher then departing from FLL unless the drive is worth it I will stick to MIA. FLL is also becoming heavily congested perhaps worst then MIA.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

KLIA is far better than LCCT. Check-in was efficient and easy. The skytrain was good too. Overall the terminal is very clean and spacious. However there are a few issues/problems: The toilets/bathrooms are not clearly marked on the map. The lifts to the mezzanine level are too few and far away from the gates. Due to poor lift access the food outlets are difficult to access. The pricing of the food (compared to normal KL pricing of food) is expensive. I don't understand why there are 2 security scans. The first is simple and quick (no taking out laptops and jackets etc.) but the second is more thorough (take out laptops etc). They airport staff should warn passengers about this. Security/airport staff at the security check were not helpful and attentive. I had to wait some time for the security staff to take the box I used to scan my laptop. Once at the gate there is no clear signage clearly stating which one is the boarding gate. I say this because none of the screens in front of the 3 gates told which one is our boarding gate.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Security officials and border officials are rude aggressive and intimidating. On the last few times travelling out of YVR I have been subjected to intrusive pat down searches.

When we got to the Air France agent he was arrogant and dismissive and then said that the carousel had broken down and we would have to wait for it to be fixed. His attitude was horrible.

Forget the £2 drop off charge with no time limit for free drop offs you then have the pleasure of getting wet going to the terminal building and a repeat on your return. In reference to the food if you think that the motorway service areas are expensive and poor quality try the airport. On returning on the inbound flight we arrived at 16.45 and it was the worst that I have ever experienced getting to customs the excuse given was that 3 aircraft's had arrived all within 20 minutes of one another. This begs the question what are they doing making a big thing of all the extra flights that we hear about when it is clear that they cannot cope with their existing flights.

Before getting into the main transit hall transit passangers (even does not entry the country) are subject to the queue of the immigration control. After that yet another baggage scanning. First many didn't understand what was needed of them (look at the web-cam for photo shoot) and this makes the officer angry.

The positives are the relatively friendly staff good express bus service to the city center available right outside the terminal doors free WiFi in the terminals and ability to withstand winter weather (I've flown through three times during light/moderate snow and no problems with delays).

On my first leg I seemed to be the only person doing an international transfer so it was quick and easy. There was no one at the transfer desk so I made my way straight to security. The maze you walk through following the international transfer arrows was easy enough. On the return transferring was a nightmare. My flight landed at 4.30am along with at least 3 other flights and when we arrived in the transfer hall there was again no one at the transfer desk. I didn't see a single staff member anywhere for a good hour. I bypassed the desk it and waited in security line which at that point was also unmanned. Everyone waiting was confused about where to go and what to do. We didn't see a single staff member until nearly 6am when they told us we needed to go to the transfer desk first and kicked us all out of line. At that point several other flights had landed and we found ourselves at the back of the line. Took 1.5 hours before I finally got to the desk where they looked at my ticket and passport than waved me through. With probably more than 6 planes worth of people waiting they only had one lane open in security? That added another 45 minutes of wait time. So that was over 3 hours just to transfer flights.

Whilst waiting observed many passengers late at gate missing flight due to severe delays at check-in - never again - Luton is the pits.

Curiously I noticed a rather dramatic increase in the cost of car rentals. When I arrived I was taken by shuttle to a brand new common rental car facility built atop the garage where the rentals are kept. Apparently the drastic increase in rental rates (before gas price increases) is due to an outrageous assessment levied against the rental companies those fees are then charged through to arriving passengers renting vehicles. Weather is seldom a problem in PHX and the signage and traffic patterns of the airport roads make navigating around fairly easy.

She didn't care that no one was checking in the rest of us. The check in area is unbelievably small - I think they expect that planes holding hundreds of passengers don't actually fly out of their airport.

As the flight arrival was the late evening Ryan air flight and we were staying near the Termini decided to book the Terravission bus which I did across the web. Worked out £9 pp for a return trip. There were two busses waiting in arrival so no problem leaving from Ciampino. Coming back at 7.00AM a few days later was a bit more fun. Got to the termini station at 1/4 to 7 just to see a full bus leave. A big crowd then began to form which the Teravission ticket staff buzzed around taking tickets and money from. Then a single decker bus turned up  which obviously could not take all the people present. Therefore a scrum to try to get on which the Teravission staff failed miserably to manage. Then a second bus turned up meaning that there was no problem to take every one back to Ciampino. It's a shame the local staff didn't communicate this. And yes  you do have to load and unload your own luggage so be prepared for this. The actual bus service was good - the issue was the complete lack of organisation and communication of the local staff. Ciampino is a small airport with minimal facilities (and seats) but I have been in a lot worse.

Departures are one big level up - only way as far as we could discover was to climb the stairs. Prepare yourself or try to see if your driver/ porter can help you but don't pay until you're up there. 2. The customs form with detailed declaration of how much money you've brought in and take out can frighten the life out of you if you can't prove every penny of expenditure. Nowadays it seems they pay scant attention to even reading it so don't get too stressed out if you think you have a problem.

The terminal is very poorly designed with unnecessarily long distances. What really drives me crazy is that when you arrive you end up in a hall which is not located at the same level of ground transportation so you must take either an elevator (there are just two of them!) or an escalator to reach the taxis / buses or the parking lot. If you have a large piece of luggage this can be quite difficult to manage. On the plus side I have never waited too long for immigration. Baggage collection on the other hand is variable (up to 1 hour once for a flight from Europe). Food choices are really limited considering the size of this airport.

port-moresby-airport,/airport-reviews/port-moresby-airport,Port Moresby Airport customer review,K Joseph,NA,2010-01-14,Arriving late at night from Brisbane on a delayed flight we were quickly off the plane and through customs without a long delay for baggage - but remember PGK100 for a visitors visa! Security is fairly tight due to the general problems of PNG and only passengers with tickets are allowed into the terminals. The domestic terminal is somewhat more crowded and more confusing with limited facilities but is relatively clean. Returning from outside POM you may well find that there is no international baggage transfer - you need to walk the three hundred or so metres between the terminals with your baggage - but it is a covered walkway with lots of security staff everywhere. After check-in there is then a wait (with few available chairs) until customs is opened about an hour before the flight. Once through things go fairly smoothly though there is not much airside apart from the small Air Niugini lounge which is pleasant enough. For the size of Port Moresby a reasonable enough experience though more seating would be good.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The only way to get out of the plane is by stairs. They use one set of stairs per plane. Expect long queues at check in - usually there is only one desk per flight available. Before customs the airport has 1 bar 1 restaurant 2 souvenir shops and small chemist. After customs there is one bar and a duty free store. Prices are decent but the quality at the restaurant requires a Russian stomach in to appreciate the food. Make sure to use the toilet in the plane before landing after landing before customs there is only 1 toilet. The other toilets before customs are dirty and smelly. There is an information desk but they only speak Russian. There are enough taxi's available - choose a registered taxi (with a sign) to avoid being ripped off. There are no other means of transport (bus lines or trains) to leave the airport. The sound installation in the terminal is lousy.

Used the auto immigration desk we scanned our own passports and were through in about 3 mins staff on hand should we have had a problem. Suitcases were on the carousel waiting for us. Getting the underground train from B satellite to the main terminal was a problem in that they automatic doors kept trying to close but people were forcing their way on the trains causing the doors to keep opening.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,Steve England,United Kingdom,2012-11-22,Flew into MIA today from Las Vegas. I'd previously sworn never to use this airport again after a nightmare transfer a few years ago. However I wanted to see the city and thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I was actually leaving the airport rather than just transferring. More so as it was a domestic flight so no immigration. WRONG!! The airport is poorly signed it is an incredibly long hike to baggage reclaim and by the time I got to the correct belt the carousel had stopped. On asking what had happened to the remaining baggage including mine a rude young lady merely said that it would be on the adjoining belt. I told her that I'd checked and the signs did not indicate the arriving flight from Las Vegas she told me to go to the baggage service desk which I had to find by myself. The staff there said that I should just go to my hotel and they would deliver my missing suitcase there. Not trusting MIA staff to do this I said I'd wait at the desk until they found it which they did surprisingly quickly. Two other passengers on my flight were at the desk with the same problem. The airport is poorly laid out long long walks past the gates to baggage reclaim rude uncaring staff and generally a total dump. The differences between MIA and McCarran Airport (Las Vegas) are stark McCarran being a very pleasant experience in contrast. MIA is by a mile the worst airport I've been to (and I've been to scores around the world). If you want to visit Miami try flying into Fort Lauderdale (not far from Miami).

There is the usual selection of rubbish repetitive shops with nothing exciting that I could find. The departure lounge is pretty dull there is very little to do and the food and shops won't excite anyone who regularly flies. Perhaps this airport has gone out of its way to make everything as standardised as possible compared to other big regional airports. The other gripe is that this airport is poorly connected to Taipei proper - road is still the only option although buses are frequent and take under an hour.

Check in at easyJet  was brilliant but only because I had upgraded my seat and had speedy boarding. The queue for none speedy boarders was huge the famous Gatwick snake. At security I was stopped as usual because I have a replacement hip, I told the security guy of this as he asked me if I had anything sharp on me as he needed to search me. He replied I know you have I can tell. I asked him why he needed to search me if he knew what had set the scanner of. He then called his supervisor, I explained what had happened and he glared at the security guy and said sorry its procedure. Interestingly coming back from Corfu I didn't even set their security equipment off. Why do I need to show my boarding card to buy a newspaper at Smiths?

malaga-airport,/airport-reviews/malaga-airport,Malaga Airport customer review,John Atkins,NA,2008-09-17,Flew through Malaga Airport last month. Baggage didn't appear until well after the flight had vanished causing some concern amongst the remaining passengers off the flight. The bags just appeared eventually apparently from no where. Returning the queues for check in were as lengthy as ever with only a terrible chain coffee outlet for comfort - it wasn't a surprise that the staff were so grumpy. Our check in took the best part of two hours an we only just made the flight. I don't understand why the check in took so long because when eventually got to the desk check in was very fast indeed. It is difficult to understand why the construction work (apparently the cause of all problems at Malaga) is taking so long. I opted to pay extra and hire a car from Sixt which is off airport and easy to use. May pay readers to do the same especially using the on-line check in for the car. We were in and out in 10 minutes.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The fee can be avoided by dropping off in the long stay car park but then you are faced with a 20min walk - not so good if you are old infirm or have infants. What should be an excellent regional airport is currently let down by additional fees for goods and services which have traditionally been free or remain free at other airports £1.00 for 2 plastic security bags is a further example. The owners have stated an aim to improved service to the airport users but at present the customer experience is that of having your pockets picked at every opportunity which does not usually encourage repeat business.,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Clearing security is always a pleasure at Narita - efficient and professional staff (unlike London Heathrow - where you are treated as a potential terrorist).

It seemed to me we had been herded into a newly updated security area. I travel through this airport on a monthly basis and have never been so delayed. I chose to travel on a Monday as this is usually a quiet day. I was delayed further as I detoured to pick up a complaints form. Due to the delay I had no time to pick up papers etc. so the inefficiency of the security area resulted in no extra income for the airport authority.

Although after midnight has passport examined quite detailed. Outside was very confusing as you exit into the car park full of coaches. Going back to the UK was OK. Arrive early as all luggage is x-ray'd before checking in. We made a mistake and went in the intra-schengan lounge (gates 1-6) rather than the extra (gates 7+). This proved quite a find as it was very quite and the duty free shop was very empty. Only found out the mistake when they asked us to go to gate 10. The other lounge was very busy and noisy.

There are no-where near enough seats and I did not see any facilities allocated for families with young children such as a play area. this was not an issue for me but I did see many frustrated parents and tired fidgety children.

I continued into the airport and there were no signs to tell me where my airline was flying out of. My info from United was that it departed from Terminal Z. There is no terminal Z.

A-Terminal is LOUD. There is no acoustic treatment to soften the constant PA boarding banter terror warnings etc. Additionally one of the three food vendors located almost in the middle of the room (yes it's a large circular room) runs a high-powered blender about every 8 minutes. There were only 4 electrical outlets that worked to charge cellphones or laptops - all occupied of course by the hundred of people crammed into this too-small space.

ontario-airport,/airport-reviews/ontario-airport,Ontario Airport customer review,John Tseng,NA,2006-06-20,I've flown many times through Ontario and found it a great alternative to LAX or Orange County Airport when flying into Los Angeles/Southern California. The airport is relatively new as Terminals 2 and 4 were opened in the late 1990s. I've yet to use the International Arrivals Terminal so can't comment on it. The terminal entrances are all on the first level with arrivals and departures on the second level where security is also located. Each terminal has a few restaurants and shops after clearing security but these generally are timed with the last departures so passengers arriving late night or very early morning will find few options beyond the vending machines. The facilities inside the terminals are clean and well kept. With the exception of one outbound flight that was canceled I've been able to get from the check-in counter through security and to my gate in under 30 minutes with 15-20 minutes for baggage retrieval. In the near ten years I've traveled through ONT the number of passengers/visitors has increased but luckily that hasn't translated into any delays in or around the airport. In addition I've found that flying in or out of ONT isn't more expensive than LAX or some of the other regional airports since ONT is served by many airlines. Currently international flights are to/from Mexico with departures out of either Terminal 2 or 4 but any direct flight from Mexico would arrive at the International Arrivals Terminal located just before Terminal 2. I'd recommend ONT to any one looking for an alternative to LAX.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Check-in counters (bulk of them are in the main hall up to counter 88). If you are checking in from 89 onwards these are just before the Virgin domestic terminal - the illogical layout makes this a baffling ordeal for travellers. Security and immigration have recently been upgraded and it shows but then there is the hike through retail shops to get to departure gates which are old and outmoded. A collection of four or five gates serviced by toilets and a few overpriced drink and snack machines. Returning was an endurance test. On arrival one is greeted by a low-ceilinged shabby corridor and queues at immigration. My baggage was on carousel 5 which is the newer one but to get to it you have to cut through waiting throngs of passengers lining up afor the exit and waiting for baggage at carousels 3 and 4. The queue to exit begins between two baggage carousels a winding path to customs officers and then another trek with queues to quarantine to have your luggage scanned. Total time elapsed from aircraft arrival at gate to exiting this overcrowded mess: 1hr 55 minutes.

If you travel from England (for instance) and you are in transit you have to collect your luggage and book in with LIAT or what other airline you are travelling with and then when you check-in at customs they take your duty free that you have with you. Surely people are entitled to take their duty free to their destination. I think the airport should have a transit lounge so that travellers don't have to go outside and back in again. Its very frustrating and tiring after travelling for over 8 hours to be queuing to get your luggage then queuing again to send it to its final destination.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,Jeffrey Abbott,NA,2005-01-19,Adelaide International airport is a very small airport. Upon arrival it always take me up to one hour for Customs clearance and quarantine check-up. The belt is too short in the international terminal. On departure check-in was ok. But the customs clearance took quite a long time. As what other has mentioned there is no enough seats in the terminal. Ground officers are friendly kind and helpful. Looking forward for the new terminal.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
leon-guanajuato-airport,/airport-reviews/leon-guanajuato-airport,Leon Guanajuato Airport customer review,Edgar Solis,NA,2006-05-31,This is a small and nice airport. I've landed and departed from this airport before and it has changed a lot. I don't know why it is called Leon Airport if it is closer to Silao Gto. I landed there a few months ago my destination was Romita Gto my mother's hometown. This airport is very convenient for us since it is only about 25-30 mins away from Romita. Also this airport is not very far from Guanajuato city. I recommend people to visit Guanajuato this is perhaps the most European style city in Mexico.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Plenty of place to seat and relax all the facilities you might expect at a class airport are there. Well ventilated large and clean smoking zones close at hand in all terminals they are many not just one as in many airports. Simply perfect.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Your luggage is off almost before you and you just grab it from the trailer. Did not leave from this airport so cannot say what facilities are like but it is tiny so doubt if there is much.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
helsinki-vantaa-airport,/airport-reviews/helsinki-vantaa-airport,Helsinki Vantaa Airport customer review,Nigel Barnsley,NA,2007-01-19,I've transferred here twice in the last two weeks and have been impressed by the user friendly layout friendliness of the staff and the clean modern design - great wood block floors. It's one of the few airports that has a sense of identity and individuality and there are some interesting shops and a couple of good places for a snack and a drink apart from the inevitable Starbucks.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
barbados-grantley-adams-airport,/airport-reviews/barbados-grantley-adams-airport,Barbados Grantley Adams Airport customer review,John Jemmott,Canada,2011-01-31,I have experienced both the old and new BGI and the new one is certainly an improvement. I have to admit I miss those little huts in a garden that used to house the duty free shopping in the landside departure area but they have a nice new sunken bar area with vegetation and I do believe a water feature. I do seem to remember long lineups at immigration before but they don't seem very bad at all now. I don't mind the lack of jetways because for me part of the whole experience is stepping off the plane and getting hit by that blast of hot air. I do however understand that it may be somewhat unpleasant if you arrive/depart in poor weather conditions. Reading through the comments I saw someone claim that one crosses a runway to get to one's plane. This is a fallacy. I also noticed a pattern that transit travellers seem to be decidedly unsatisfied with their experience. Travelling with connecting flight is generally unpleasant and often stressful and their bad experience may be more a reflection of that than a reflection of the quality of the airport. I think it is terribly unfair of them to judge an airport let alone a whole nation due to one bad experience.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,M Pemberton,France,2014-01-08,It has all been said by other reviewers but I am so angry with this airport that I will add to the comments. Long bus ride long queues for everything (passport control duty free toilets - I tried three and gave up) then another long bus ride. In and out of the planes up outside steps in the heat or rain. Truly horrible experience at 1am after an already long flight surreal really. Would not fly Qatar again whilst they are using this airport (and I may not bother even when they move to the new airport).,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
