aeroflot-russian-airlines,/lounge-reviews/aeroflot-russian-airlines,Galaxy - Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport,H Dalem,Netherlands,2015-06-20,"The Galaxy Lounge at the E-Terminal looks a bit dated. It is a large and very open space. Enough different seating arrangements. A separate space for computers. And a food and drinks counter. Due to the open space one can hear almost every conversation. To make things worse they play loud music. Food is ok. Enough choice but not much of a display. Drinks are also ok. Enough choice. Alcohol you have to ask (except beer). WiFi speed is great and free. Shower room is a strange affair. You get a 'space towel' and some slippers. If you don't bring your own shampoo and/or soap, you are left with only water to wash yourself. The towel is a big paper cloth you can dispose of after the shower. Slippers have the same design. You don't enter this space for a spa treatment, but it does refresh. If you have to sit here for a long time this will not be a relaxing experience.",Galaxy,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport,Business Class,NA,Business,6,3,4,3,3,3,5,4,1
aeromexico,/lounge-reviews/aeromexico,Aeromexico Business Class Lounge - Mexico City Airport,Ray Miles,NA,2008-02-20,Mexico City's new terminal 2 was barely up and running when I flew out on a Copa Airlines flight that gave me access to the Aeromexico lounge. The lounge is upstairs and is light elegant and airy albeit with no windows onto the tarmac. Comfy seating a separate computer area wifi throughout and attractive palm trees add a festive air. There is a circular bar that was unmanned during my visit plus a smaller self-service bar with an excellent selection of drinks and classy snacks. There is a separate screened-off TV lounge and another wine bar at the back for paying customers only. Since the lounge was brand-new it was obvious an effort was being made to impress. It will be important to monitor progress as time passes to see if the high standard in maintained.,AEROMEXICO BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE,Mexico City Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,0

The place was packed at 4:30 and stayed that way when we left at 6:00. Two planes including ours had slight delays. The food selection was nice especially the Thai soup. Because it was so busy the cleaning staff had a lot of work and empty dishes sat for 20-30 minutes. There didn't seem to be a place for us to drop off our used plates.

air-france,/lounge-reviews/air-france,Air France Business Class Lounge - Paris CDG Airport,A Smith,France,2014-10-04,It's worth noting that it very much depends on the terminal; typically if you are in 2E and 2F it's good level of lounge with showers fresh food coffee/ tea internet and power - all a business traveller wants. If you go to a lesser terminal 2D for example there really is nothing more than a seat coffee and power. It's worth noting that if you do have a long haul flight and you arrive before 2pm you can use the lounge in the arrivals area of 2C.. this has around 6 showers and the usual... not the most comfortable but the staff are polite and it's a hell of allot better waiting for your TGV (Train) in here after a shower.,AIR FRANCE BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Paris CDG Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,3,3,2,1,2,3,0

Curry or Curry with rice for a meal. Samosas in an oven that had been there for at least a week. 2 beers in the fridge dirty plates stacked everywhere toilets that need a pressure cleaner desperately.

air-france,/lounge-reviews/air-france,Air France Business Class Lounge - Paris CDG Airport,D Rose,United States,2012-05-21,I don't understand the Air France business class product at all particularly compared to similarly priced business class products like British Airways or Virgin Atlantic (which actually are less expensive). At a BA or Virgin lounge you get a fully stocked and staffed bar. At Air France the self- service selections at Air France are limited. At a BAR or Virgin Lounge I can order a full sit down meal. At Air France I got to chose from slices of cold pork some cheese some crackers and potato chips.

air-india,/lounge-reviews/air-india,Air India Maharajah First/business Class Lounge - Delhi Airport,Vikramaditya Singh,United States,2014-08-05,I was traveling first class to US from Delhi and had 3 h to spend in the Air India lounge. I was shocked to see that this is the flagship lounge of Air India in India's capital. What a shame. First the first and Executive lounges are not separate. They are separated by a barricade nthat was easily crossed. There is no wait staff even for first class passengers. When one flies Emirates or Lufthansa in first class the respective lounges provide an opportunity for a high quality sit down meal from an a la carte menu. In the AI lounge food left a lot to be desired. The bathroom was in shambles and there was no lotion. Magazine choice was non existent. Wifi was spotty and complicated. why can't they provide free wifi without the need for passwords cell phones etc ? Very absurd. And the bar service was pitiful and most of the time non existent. Again no waiters even in first class section. In summary the premium lounge in the airport shared by many airlines is similar but at least predictable in service (albeit poor). The AI lounge is awful and takes away from first class experience. The managers don't care and are never around to receive feedback leave alone make changes. Best avoided for same reason AI is best avoided. First class pax are not escorted to the plane either.,AIR INDIA MAHARAJAH FIRST/BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Delhi Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,0

air-india,/lounge-reviews/air-india,Air India Maharaja Business Class Lounge - Mumbai Airport,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,Visited whilst in international transit. Good points - this new lounge is huge has a varied selection of seats including recliners shower facilities are good OKAY selection of reading material and half a dozen internet terminals for free internet access. The bad points are that whilst Air India's website shows alcohol is available to international travellers none is available or on show. In fact there's one small fridge with water pepsi 7 up fanta or fruit juice - that's it. The food selection is similarly limited and the hot selection was particularly unsatisfactory (2 veg 1 meat - however there appeared to be no chicken in this!). Wifi is the airports and not the lounges - limited and very slow - had to use the dedicated terminals instead.

Good points - plenty of seating good wi-fi newspaper selection tv drinks selection notified when it was time to board. Bad points - except for the shami kebabs the food selection was poor and in the case of the sheesh kebabs revolting. Had the crackers and crisps instead once the shami had run out. The staff were overstretched (there appeared to be only 2 of them) and as a result items were not cleared or refreshed.

I went to the Maharaja lounge by gate 3 passed security on 14th April 2012. I would not recommend this lounge to anyone. I arrived in this Room full of mosquitoes old worn out furniture with people trying to sleep on the worn out shabby settees I do not know how they could sleep with all that noise and constant phone going off and people just entering the lounge asking questions about other air lines. They will only serve you water or juice as apparently they will not serve alcohol to business or first class passengers on International flights since 1st April so a dry room. When I arrived in this excuse of a lounge there were about 20 children screaming and running around without any supervision apparently they were being looked after by a member of staff so they were not booked as business or first class passengers she then moved them to a more suitable area after about 10 minutes. You have to ask for water or juice. I asked for tea and they do serve this. Snacks are from a microwave and again you have to ask but I would not recommend these over microwave snacks.

Lounge in Boston was much better in my opinion. Great views, better service and showers were lovely. It was spacious, filled with amenities. I decided to buy one of the items on their menu, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was perfect. It was fresh and delicious, well worth the 9 bucks. Overall, both locations were excellent.

avianca,/lounge-reviews/avianca,Avianca El Dorado Business Class Lounge Customer - Bogota Airport,M Chia,Australia,2013-11-15,After being deprived of a lounge in Santiago I was hoping to be compensated by the new lounge in Bogota. But I was rather disappointed. First the directions given by the checkin agent was go straight after security. Unfortunately there was a T-junction where the sign board had an arrow pointing UP. I asked a staff but the directions was confusing. Having heard that it was past the food court I look for this sign reach a dead end a construction area. So I backtracked and saw the food court UPSTAIRS. Going into the lift I pressed 2 the floor the agent told me. It didn't move. I try 3 and it moves. Actually the lounge is no longer after the food court but to the side especially if you take the lift. Next I looked for the toilet. I could see the female toilet but not the male one. I walked to the other end - still no toilet. Backtracked all the way to exit still no toilet. You see the male toilet is beyond the ladies but it is not visible from this direction or that. And there are no signs to overcome this. Then I went for the food. The spread was astonishingly poor. Many plates of ham and cheese. Some salad and juices. That's it for food. (I hadn't checked the alcoholic section.) I gathered some food and look for the cutlery. Not obvious again. After going around i found forks and knives but no spoon. I asked the cleaning lady and she obliged. Huge traffic during lunch time is no excuse Then I go the work area. Plugged in my video camera to recharge. Power light doesn't come on. I jiggled here and there. Still no power. So I waited for another table to be vacant. And there's power. So my verdict. Great potential. Lots of shortcomings which can be easily rectified. I hope Avianca realises that most people only use the lounge once.

At peak hours it can be really packed especially between 7pm and 9:30pm when many AV international flights leave. Nevertheless a nice place to relax after check-in and security procedure.

Visited twice in the last 2 weeks and I'd say that this lounge is below average. No outside view of any kind. Boarding notifications shouted by staff. Stir fries and rice offered during meal time but not delicious and attractive at all. Some salad sandwiches dessert and other snacks available. Soft drinks plenty with some beer and wine. Used plates collected from time to time. Washrooms were clean. Biggest complaint is the wifi - uses public wifi which is extremely slow.

I therefore entered the lounge alone: packed as usual (for Chinese it is extremely easy to join the lounge through their credit card membership) some average noodles sandwiches and fruit.

All the passengers were all hooked up to their in-ear phones and speaking loudly to people somewhere else about business making it really loud and strange.

No self service for coffee tea etc you go to the bar and have your drink prepared for you - I think this gives a more personal service. On the bar is a menu listing available sandwiches. Around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to Heathrow T5 where there are no announcements. I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often.

There are only two (men's) shower stalls but they have always both been free and immaculate and the staff supply a hotel style bundle of towels. Plenty of hot water and decent pressure.

emirates,/lounge-reviews/emirates,Emirates A380 First Class Lounge - Dubai Airport,H Dalem,Netherlands,2014-02-20,Looks like a very posh lounge at the beginning. Almost deserted. Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet.

I can't compare it to the Pearl lounge in T3 (I've never accessed it) but as a business class lounge it was good with plenty of breakfast options available stocked and manned bar area plenty of seating (if in a somewhat weird 3 tiered room) and newspapers and magazines available. However Wi-Fi was unavailable whilst I was there (and the staff couldn't fix it) and there was only 3 staff to man the bar clear plates and update the breakfast area and thus they struggled to keep up with demand in a less than half full lounge.

It was certainly a retreat from the main terminal and as you get refreshments for 'free' to be honest even though it was very full I cannot complain and I did enjoy being there.,ROYAL JORDANIAN AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Amman Queen Alia Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,4,4,3,0,3,4,0

A dining area is equipped with dining tables and chairs, in front of a well stocked bar and food buffet. As a nice touch there was a big jug of ready made Pimms (with lots of fruit garnish) available as a celebration of Wimbledon. In the morning the food on offer was bacon, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, plenty of breads, cold meats and various garnishes. At about 11am this changed to hot lunch items: rice, chicken casserole, pasta with sauce, soup and various other items. The staff were very unobtrusive and kept the place clean and tidy.

The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find.

They have the same rude unprofessional receptionists who immediately banned my friend from joining me as a guest in the lounge (with my first-class ticket) and asked for 50$. I understand this is their rule but it was not handled very well. The breakfast food was cheap and basic lounge was extremely crowded and noisy and it was difficult finding seats. I spent five minutes there and was happy to leave. I won't be returning to this lounge and I couldn't imagine paying for it.

I obtained access because I have Star Alliance Gold status and was on an international flight.

Good selection of magazines poor selection of food (it was around 0800) with a few cereals and bagels and a couple of juices. Nothing hot besides coffee and tea. Free wifi but it seemed like a bit of a zoo definitely not worth waiting 10 minutes for. People taking long flights would be best using this lounge for the free wifi and then buy some food elsewhere in the terminal.

The Virgin Loft Lounge only caters for Shorthaul passengers - lacking any decent food (a cookie and a grape at best with cheese cut to the size for a mousetrap!) No showers small toilet and wash facilities. We have always used Air NZ lounge previously which was excellent. Virgin must rectify this situation quickly otherwise Upper Class passengers will seek alternatives.

I visited on New Years Eve when there was not much traffic in the lounge which is probably the only nice thing worth mentioning. The catering was appalling and range of drinks very limited since several machines were out of order. There were no newspapers and the very few magazines in the lounge were a few months old. I am sure this place was decent in the 1970's but it has not seen much upgrade ever since. Since I find United to be the worst US airline by far this lounge did nothing to change my point of view. On a final note if you are considering paying 50 USD to enter the lounge (ie. if you do not hold credentials to give you free access) I would seriously recommend you to stay way from this stale and tame lounge.,UNITED AIRLINES RED CARPET BUSINESS CLASS / STAR ALLIANCE LOUNGE REVIEW,San Francisco Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0

Plenty of staff doing next to nothing can see no reason why there are 8 people in this lounge when it charges for any decent food and drink several staff just stand around doing nothing. The worst is the excuse for snacks which comprises a platter of cubed American style (ie rubber) cheese of three different colours under a lid with a selection of crackers. Wifi not free. Why does United bother? It may as well get rid of all staff bar an entry guard and cleaner and just let it be a quiet place to sit.

Seating is comfortable and it is usually quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to chill and read or do work. Don't expect to get anything decent to eat though. On my last visit (almost identical to my previous 3 visits this year) - which was more than 4 hours - the offerings consisted of one small EMPTY platter with sign that said 'Sushi' one small EMPTY hot plate with sign that said 'Chicken WIngs'. Food that was actually there consisted of a handful of pretzels with orange 'cheese' paste that tasted like wax a meagre salad bar with undercooked unseasoned flavourless potato salad and four large baskets of dry bread offered with jam and butter. About 10 tiny vegetable sandwiches made an appearance for 30 seconds - but they were immediately hoovered up by patrons desperate for anything decent to munch on. Three cups of vegetable rice also appeared briefly - but it looked and tasted like it was leftover from 3 weeks ago. Oh - and lest I forget two small cereal bowls with thimble sized cookies were offered for dessert. There are also cheap paper instant noodle cups always on offer.

There is no hot food but some stale Bagels that if brave could be toasted in a machine that had not been cleaned out of crumbs since it was opened. Having said this I should not have been surprised after a 14 hour flight into SFO with United where they did one drinks run and two food runs. Most of the staff hid in the back until landing.

As a result no 'personal space' and very crowded as everybody was close to each other. Chairs not comfy. No sign to the toilets had to ask staff for it. The toilet was so basic and small. Food selection adequate but not extensive. It's understandable due to their religion practice they set up the bar way off the main dining area and very close to the main entrance and had a walk a fair bit to get a glass of drinks.

I didn't use the showers nor many of the other amenities but the one's I tried to take advantage of didn't instil confidence. I wasn't impressed with the lounge: I thought they might be having an ""off"" day so I asked to speak to someone in charge. It took nearly a half an hour to find someone. the excuse for not having an available manager in the lounge was that it wasn't a busy time of the day despite it being 3:30 in the afternoon on a Friday and packed. It was far too busy and loud. If indeed the mornings are busier I would hate to see it. After sorting through the piles of newspapers that seemed to be tossed haphazardly on the tables - they don't use magazine racks - I found that there were no English newspapers in the lounge. According to the lounge manager they ""have them but they typically run out in the morning"". Knowing that the idea of having some more for the afternoon passengers hadn't occurred to her. Food quality seemed good but accessing catering was very chaotic. For example there are two chefs working in tandem; rather than create a staggered system where some food is constantly coming out of the oven the two of them prepare food together load the ovens together then stand around until they take everything out then start the process again. Of course by the time each batch is ready there is a hoard of people are lined up and instantly they run out until another batch is made. Lockers were an excellent touch and the library was nice though I think that it's more for show than actual use in that it is as exposed and equally noisy as everywhere else in the lounge. A lot of people seemed to be highly irritated with the service on the day I was there and although each one of us seemed to be complaining about smallish problems I got the overall sense that things were simply not up to standard.",TURKISH AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Istanbul Ataturk Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,2,5,3,4,3,0,2,0

The lounge itself was fair comfortable seating an ample drinks selection. If one wanted a hot drink one was confronted with a dispenser only labelled in Japanese/Korean staff quite unwilling to help. As there was no catering (only rice crackers and savoury crackers) for this just-after-lunchtime departure. This added to an unsatisfactory experience mostly on the account of the rude and unhelpful staff. I do not consider it a problem to have a limited command of English in a non-english speaking country and working in a mostly non-english speaking place but it is very problematic to combine this with such a rude attitude.,KOREAN AIR BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Tokyo Narita Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,3,3,0,4,0,1,0

malaysia-airlines,/lounge-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines Business Class Golden Lounge - KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,Dean Potaka,Australia,2013-12-30,After a flight into KLIA from PER I was looking forward to using their flagship lounge to freshen up and relax before continuing onto LHR late that evening. What a let down. Trying to find a seat was the first obstacle my wife and I encountered and when we finally did trying to locate staff to clean the area was our next. Requesting use of the showers was met with a courteous and immediate response of yes. However when I entered through the doors it was like the area had not been serviced since the first flight of the day. No toilet tissue to be found unless you raided every cubicle prior. And the floors needed a hose down. Showers only saving grace was that the water pressure and temperature was very good as they were not very clean to begin with. With half an hour before boarding MH2 to LHR I decided to have a drink at the bar by the entrance to lounge. Selections are only average at best with no champagne only a French sparkling but that was no bother as I knew the best was to come on board. To wrap up the experience of what is meant to be their flagship lounge I have noticed its gradual decline since I first started using this service on numerous occasions since 2000. I will be returning from LHR mid Jan and look forward to experiencing the Golden Lounge of Terminal 4 as I have heard great reviews of this one.

I'm sure the a la Carte restaurants are excellent but my wife and I had less than 2 hr stopover and after you've made the lengthy walk from the gate had a freshen up etc the only thing we had time for is a cool beer and a selection from a quick and easy 'help yourself 'buffet (sandwich etc). The trouble is that this does not seem to exist because the food and drink section is located at the far end of the lounge and you have to put in orders for tailor made sandwiches. We did not have the time for that so downed a beer and left. Surely it would be possible to put a small selection of buffet sandwiches nachos crisps nuts etc for people who were in our position ? The lounge gets very busy around 11pm to 1 am and it was pretty difficult to find two seats together during that time though when we left it was a lot less crowded.,"QATAR AIRWAYS ""AL MOURJAN"" BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW",Doha Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,3,5,3,3,5,5,4,1

Now Delta is opting for a $695 annual fee for frequent fliers and Diamond travelers will have to pay in one year/January 2015. I'm not sure what Delta is trying to prove with this new scheme. Perhaps to let everyone know that they care more about executive pay and bonuses than the customer. Personally I'm now going to stop my loyalty to Delta and start using other better airlines.

First impressions were that this is a high- quality lounge spacious and a lot more capacity than the existing lounge. Food and beverages on a par with existing buffet-style business lounges which are very good. Good business area and nice childrens area. Where this lounge really fails is the SiX Senses Spa which is shambolic. I have just queued for 65 minutes for a shower. They had no waitlist so you had to just grab a seat and wait (could not nip out to get food). They had a booking system for spa treatments but the earliest slot was over two hours later so most people could not avail of this. I use their First lounge normally as Gold Elite so the experience going through Abu Dhabi today is significantly worse than before. Lot of unhappy people here. I believe that when they renovate the old lounge area near the shops it will be a dedicated First lounge which will hopefully take the pressure off in this lounge.

Food and drink selection was extremely mediocre. There was a selection of overcooked tomato pasta a huge bread mountain with toaster which nobody touched. The salad bar and grilled vegetables were depleted and obviously the most popular. No dessert except some cut pineapple and sliced oranges. Pot noodles was obvious choice for Asian travellers. Compared to the business lounges in HK London and Dubai the Asiana lounge really needs to step up. At that time in evening the last thing we want is a carb overload. Suggest you cut out all the pasta and serve cold cuts salads and a decent cheese board some chocolates or dessert of some sort and not the plastic Kraft cheese on display. If we are playing business class fares then I expect half way decent food in the lounge. If I knew it was going to be this bad I would elected to eat in one of the restaurants in the airport but unfortunately everything closes at 10pm in Incheon Airport.

It was very crowded and from the destinations people were travelling too full of passengers not travelling in First - it is supposed to be only for First passengers according to the BA hype. The staff spent much time discussing their work issues loudly in full hearing of the passengers. Staff do not actively patrol to see if anyone needs anything which is odd since nothing on offer is available self-service.

american-airlines,/lounge-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines Admirals Club Business Class Lounge - Chicago O'Hare Airport,J Katnic,United States,2013-07-07,Purchased a day pass to use at DFW/ORD/LAX. This review is for the lounge at ORD only. Lounge amenities lacking. The only self-serve beverages are coffee/tea/water. Free food consists of supermarket type cookies and two choices of apples. The latter are acceptable due to the fact that AA flights in Business/First more than make up for this with food/beverage/alcohol service. What was especially appalling about this lounge is the restroom/toilet facilities. AA terminal restrooms are usually crowded and dirty so I though that the lounge restrooms would be clean and inviting: quite the opposite! To start there are not private stalls like the lounges at DFW/LAX. I was carrying multiple carryon bags and tried to find a stall which would accommodate them. The stall closest to the wall was occupied the next one over had a broken lock the next one over was missing the hook in which to hang bags/coats and the handicapped stall had an almost one inch gap between the door and where it is supposed to lock. The lock maybe jutted out 1/16 of an inch and opened several times when I tried to hang my bag on the door hook. Making things worse there seemed to be no air conditioning in the restroom and a male employee kept pacing the area in front of the stalls with a bag of toilet paper rolls loudly conversing on the phone in a foreign language. All of the above factors made me leave the restroom and lounge early (sweating bullets by this point) for the family restroom outside of gate H6. Not worth the money paid and I would not pay the annual membership fees for such discomfort/lack of amenities.,AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Chicago O'Hare Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,4,2,1,1,0,1,0

The first is the design fault which allows all the noise of the concourse into the lounge as the plate glass windows have large areas open to the main terminal area. This is particularly noticeable in the private sitting rooms. The second also relates to those sitting rooms. Although comfortable they have one draw back. It is very difficult to get the attention of staff without getting up and going to the corridor which runs along the front of the row of sitting rooms. Staff are always passing by but never glance into the rooms. This problem could be easily solved by adding a call button which switched a light outside the room.

avianca,/lounge-reviews/avianca,Avianca (swiss) Business Class Lounge Customer - New York JFK Airport,D Ruckel,United States,2014-11-19,I entered the lounge at 7 AM. The food was passable but flimsy. There was a coffee machine which worked with various types of coffee old and freezing pieces of fruit cereals. There were old croissants and peanut butter. No butter. The internet was free but I was on line checking my banking when twice my e mail was interrupted and the Swissair logo appeared. One of the woman at the desk said that there have been problems and I asked her why an out of order sign was not put on the machine. No answer except that people have had trouble recently with the machines. The lounge is long but not so bad nothing to do no tv no reading material and no staff. On the way out the same woman said that I was the first to complain about the machine which contradicted her previous statement. It was an unpleasant experience and I left. I will not return to that lounge when I return to the States from Buenos Aires. It is unprofessional; perhaps that is for the morning travelers and the Swissair evening travelers are treated differently but it was just a waiting room with broken internet a large area with lounge chairs and no staff and a chilly room at that no warmth at all. I am by no means a business traveler but have used the lounge before and it was the same. It is called the Swissair lounge but doesn't cut the mustard. No staff? Just two people sitting at the front desk? Maybe it was the hour but again I quote the European gentleman who was appalled. JFK is not a luxury airport although they have made improvements for passengers. They do not allow baggage to be wrapped in the building where the lounge is they do in other terminals. It is risky but no one will tell me why it is permisable in other terminals (the lounge is in terminal 4) and no airline can wrap a bag in plastic.

The desk staff are generally curt and rude which I have come to expect at airport lounges. Open full bar consists of self-pour liquor. Pretty decent brands not top-shelf or anything but respectable. The house wines are decent enough i.e. a step above boxed wine. The snacks are laughable carrots celery packaged ranch mixed nuts and crackers abound. The bar area wasn't that clean either. The advantage of this lounge is that it is quiet (in spite of how many people were there) a function of the numerous small rooms. The chairs are comfortable and the soft lighting was nice.

Now that's service! The menu is the restaurant is short sharp simple and of excellent quality. The facilities are great I like that you can choose to use either Mac or PC in this lounge. They have a very nice day spa hard to get into but when you do very much worth the effort. The bathrooms are not that great but you really are not there to spend too much time in there. It's wonderfully spacious with plenty of places to sit. The only annoying factor was the number of children in the lounge. All in all a great place.

The lounge is quite big and very clean. It comprised of two main halls. The first hall near the entrance is quite packed. The first hall offers both sofa and bar seating for lone traveler. However I found the bar seats are quite tight. There are power outlets at every seat. Food served at buffet station are quite limited, yet we can order a decent options of freshly prepared Japanese food at the noodle station. There are a wide variety of drinks available (spirits, including varieties of Japanese sake, coffee, and soda dispenser). I favor the coffee a lot. If you like reading, there are a wide variety of Japanese and international newspapers and magazines available. I found that the toilet and shower rooms are very convenient and clean. Luxurious amenities are provided to ensure you are pampered and refreshed for your next flight. If you decide to take a shower, be cautious about the timing as the queue is quite long.

Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new. Once I found a seat I was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where I eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses. There was food on offer as well but I gave it a miss as I did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned. To be fair to BA though the lounge appears to be shared by many airlines so they probably don't have much influence over how its run.

Breakfast before transatlantic flight was largely a selection of pastries and other unhealthy options. No cheese no eggs just lots of toast and low quality croissants. The food bar is not well maintained and everything reeks of cheapness and cost cutting from the biscuits and crisps to the wine selection. I asked for cheese and was rudely told there's none available before noon if then. The toilets are often smelly and not clean enough. There is often a queue to get in. It's a shame BA don't realize how this damages their brand. They've been cutting down on meals on board too of course but in the lounges it's really apparent.

The staff on front desk surly and totally not interested in their customers who pay their wages they need to be reminded food options non existent. Coffee machine broken not in use . I think Delta need to look around and maybe visit their Atlanta lounge.

That allowed us entry to the SATS Lounge in Changi Terminal 2. It is shown on the barcode of your boarding pass and that is scanned at entry. The lounge is quite big and well worth the cost. Plenty of drinks, alcoholic (whiskey, wine, gin, vodka) and soft. The coffee is delicious.. Everything is self serve, so you can eat as much as you like. Best was the beef stew, nice and tender. Staff were cleaning all the time and topping things up.

We travelled on the 09:15 departure to Abu Dhabi with our seven month old daughter and made use of the (sound-proofed!) children's room. We had the a la carte breakfast and recommend the eggs benedict and pancakes. Hot and cold drinks regularly offered. There was a buffet with all the usual staples. The fifteen minute complimentary massage at the Six Senses Spa was a nice touch.

Staff welcoming and smiley. Food limited but more than just snacks. Could do with computer terminals in case you don't have a wifi device with you. Two let downs are it not having a flight screen at all in the lounge. Also they had a row of clocks for world time and had taken the Mumbai one down - I couldn't work out why if that one broke they didn't put the Singapore clock in its place and change its time.,LUFTHANSA SENATOR BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Mumbai Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,4,5,3,3,4,4,5,1

Plenty of seats - I was there mid morning. The food was excellent. Hot breakfast items still being served Well stocked bar with beer wine and spirits. An excellent coffer machine. Despite being a Spanish lounge in a Spanish city there were plenty of English language newspapers despite what other miserable people had previously stated. Some people should take a chill pill or get back to the public area. Timely flight announcements made allowing a relaxed short walk to the gate and straight onto the plane. Staff very friendly.

Overcrowded with wear and tear generally showing throughout. Noodle bars in Business Class lounge or seated dining area okay if you can get a table. Most of the times better to grab a bite to eat outside and use the chairs available at the gates.

lufthansa,/lounge-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa Business Class Lounge - Frankfurt Main Airport,William Dunn,United States,2012-01-23,I splurged on business class tickets to take my 92 yr old mother to Russia. A reason for going business class was to have a comfortable place to wait during layovers in Frankfurt. What a mistake! The business class lounges were so crowded people were waiting in line to get in. Inside there was a cattle car feeling with no place to sit and no fresh air. I was mortified that my mother was forced to sit out in the airport lobby after I had promised her the luxury of business class.
