"289","00:11:20.320","00:11:21.799","Just kind of hard to believe, you know?","Season_1",1,4
"290","00:11:21.820","00:11:22.830","Believe it, Morty.","Season_1",1,4
"291","00:11:22.850","00:11:25.799","And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry,","Season_1",1,4

"296","00:11:39.590","00:11:40.870","I mean, let's face it,","Season_1",1,4
"297","00:11:40.889","00:11:43.529","""hungry for apples"" is just a rip-off of ""got milk?""","Season_1",1,4
"298","00:11:43.549","00:11:44.729","It's almost identical.","Season_1",1,4

"308","00:12:09.720","00:12:11.769","It's a completely different slogan.","Season_1",1,4
"309","00:12:11.789","00:12:13.529","It's different!","Season_1",1,4
"310","00:12:13.549","00:12:15.299","And I shouldn't be fired.","Season_1",1,4

"333","00:13:10.820","00:13:13.899","Because it looks like you're inside a simulation...","Season_1",1,4

"183","00:08:39.687","00:08:41.187","What are you talking about, Rick?","Season_1",1,10
"184","00:08:41.189","00:08:44.357","Ricks have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius.","Season_1",1,10
"185","00:08:44.359","00:08:46.926","The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near","Season_1",1,10
"186","00:08:46.928","00:08:49.725","someone with complementary brain waves that make ours invisible.","Season_1",1,10
"187","00:08:49.731","00:08:52.297","See, when a Rick is with a Morty,","Season_1",1,10
"188","00:08:52.299","00:08:55.869","the genius waves get canceled out by the, uh...","Season_1",1,10
"189","00:08:56.838","00:08:58.039","...Morty waves.","Season_1",1,10
"190","00:08:58.041","00:09:01.508","Um... Because o-our personalities are so different?","Season_1",1,10
"191","00:09:01.510","00:09:03.276","Oh, shit, dawg.","Season_1",1,10
"192","00:09:03.278","00:09:05.345","My portal gun was hacked remotely, Morty--","Season_1",1,10
"193","00:09:05.347","00:09:07.379","obviously by the real killer, to frame me.","Season_1",1,10
"194","00:09:07.381","00:09:08.914","But I was able to trace the signal.","Season_1",1,10
"195","00:09:08.916","00:09:10.249","Come on. Let's go.","Season_1",1,10
"196","00:09:10.251","00:09:11.285","- Uh-oh. - Excuse me.","Season_1",1,10
"197","00:09:11.286","00:09:14.320","We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location.","Season_1",1,10

"199","00:09:17.091","00:09:19.091","I'm gonna mark us each with a red ""X"" right now.","Season_1",1,10
"200","00:09:19.093","00:09:21.794","That way, if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot","Season_1",1,10
"201","00:09:21.796","00:09:24.797","the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying.","Season_1",1,10
"202","00:09:24.799","00:09:26.800","Hey, check it out.","Season_1",1,10
"203","00:09:27.302","00:09:29.068","Damn it!","Season_1",1,10
"204","00:09:31.470","00:09:34.941","- Hey, you didn't pay your bill! - The red ""X""! Red ""X""!","Season_1",1,10

"206","00:09:37.611","00:09:39.511","and your favorite kind of shirt in stock, huh, Morty?","Season_1",1,10
"207","00:09:39.513","00:09:41.147","Yeah, Rick, I-I heard you the first time.","Season_1",1,10
"208","00:09:41.149","00:09:42.815","You don't have to keep saying it over and over.","Season_1",1,10
"209","00:09:42.817","00:09:44.784","Man, this place is way off the grid.","Season_1",1,10
"210","00:09:44.786","00:09:46.152","This guy does not want to be found.","Season_1",1,10
"211","00:09:46.154","00:09:47.320","Well, if he's a Rick,","Season_1",1,10
"212","00:09:47.322","00:09:49.288","doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide?","Season_1",1,10
"213","00:09:49.290","00:09:51.490","I mean, isn't that what Mortys are -- human cloaking devices?","Season_1",1,10
"214","00:09:51.492","00:09:54.927","Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is.","Season_1",1,10
"215","00:09:55.997","00:09:57.930","Oh, my God, Rick, look!","Season_1",1,10
"216","00:09:57.932","00:10:00.366","There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building!","Season_1",1,10
"217","00:10:00.368","00:10:03.869","Not people, Morty -- Mortys.","Season_1",1,10
"218","00:10:10.107","00:10:11.379","Oh, God!","Season_1",1,10
"219","00:10:11.481","00:10:14.347","W-w-why would somebody do this? It's horrible!","Season_1",1,10
"220","00:10:14.349","00:10:16.048","Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats,","Season_1",1,10
"221","00:10:16.050","00:10:18.050","but you get -- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and","Season_1",1,10
"222","00:10:18.052","00:10:19.218","put them in agonizing pain,","Season_1",1,10
"223","00:10:19.220","00:10:22.488","that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks [beep].","Season_1",1,10
"224","00:10:22.490","00:10:25.858","I fiddled with a concept like this once.","Season_1",1,10
"225","00:10:26.060","00:10:27.960","On paper, Morty. On paper.","Season_1",1,10
"226","00:10:27.962","00:10:30.162","I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill.","Season_1",1,10
"227","00:10:30.164","00:10:32.397","I mean, you could accomplish the same result with, like,","Season_1",1,10
"228","00:10:32.399","00:10:34.233","five Mortys and a jumper cable.","Season_1",1,10
"229","00:10:35.635","00:10:37.778","Which I also wouldn't do!","Season_1",1,10
"230","00:10:37.804","00:10:40.206","I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship.","Season_1",1,10

"237","00:10:50.051","00:10:52.051","W-w-w-what do you do?","Season_1",1,10
"238","00:10:52.053","00:10:54.220","I-I'm -- I'm in between advertising jobs.","Season_1",1,10

"240","00:10:56.190","00:10:57.423","So, people need help figuring","Season_1",1,10
"241","00:10:57.425","00:10:59.525","out what to buy, and then y-y-you help 'em?","Season_1",1,10
"242","00:10:59.527","00:11:02.424","Well, it's a little more complicated than that.","Season_1",1,10
"243","00:11:02.430","00:11:03.829","Well, I mean, you do it,","Season_1",1,10
"244","00:11:03.831","00:11:06.265","and you seem like a guy who really has it all together.","Season_1",1,10

"342","00:14:42.085","00:14:44.387","Tend to your garden, kids. I'm kind of doing a thing here.","Season_2",2,3
"343","00:14:44.421","00:14:46.622","Whoo!","Season_2",2,3
"344","00:14:46.657","00:14:48.591","Grandpa Rick, we're not leaving without you.","Season_2",2,3

"346","00:14:50.594","00:14:52.728","You're afraid the big, bad hive mind","Season_2",2,3
"347","00:14:52.763","00:14:54.764","is gonna steal your grandpa away.","Season_2",2,3
"348","00:14:54.798","00:14:55.412","Actually, no.","Season_2",2,3
"349","00:14:55.437","00:14:58.234","I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it.","Season_2",2,3
"350","00:14:58.268","00:14:59.902","- What? - This isn't healthy, Rick.","Season_2",2,3
"351","00:14:59.937","00:15:02.571","You know, you're really up to no good","Season_2",2,3
"352","00:15:02.606","00:15:04.707","around here a-at this place, you know?","Season_2",2,3
"353","00:15:04.741","00:15:07.677","You and Unity are like... like leggings and mid-calf boots.","Season_2",2,3
"354","00:15:07.711","00:15:09.078","You think you're great together,","Season_2",2,3
"355","00:15:09.112","00:15:11.714","but you're just bringing out the worst in each other.","Season_2",2,3
"356","00:15:11.748","00:15:14.283","Oh, gee. Boy, Summer. Well put.","Season_2",2,3
"357","00:15:14.318","00:15:16.252","Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks?","Season_2",2,3
"358","00:15:16.286","00:15:17.553","Unity?","Season_2",2,3
"359","00:15:17.587","00:15:19.355","I'm just taking a little break from stuff.","Season_2",2,3
"360","00:15:19.389","00:15:21.324","You know? I need to relax.","Season_2",2,3
"361","00:15:21.358","00:15:23.526","Oh, hey, w-what's this on the news, guys?","Season_2",2,3
"362","00:15:23.560","00:15:24.860","Let me turn it up.","Season_2",2,3
"363","00:15:24.895","00:15:27.830","In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is.","Season_2",2,3
"364","00:15:27.864","00:15:29.498","We're really just having a good time.","Season_2",2,3
"365","00:15:29.533","00:15:30.866","- Karen? - Thanks, Todd.","Season_2",2,3
"366","00:15:30.901","00:15:34.503","Up next, are you a concerned grandchild or just a buzzkill?","Season_2",2,3
"367","00:15:34.538","00:15:36.405","We'll tell you how you can know for sure.","Season_2",2,3
"368","00:15:36.440","00:15:38.441","I think you two are a little outnumbered.","Season_2",2,3
"369","00:15:38.475","00:15:40.576","Okay, well, what if you did it for me?","Season_2",2,3
"370","00:15:40.610","00:15:44.680","What if you came with us as a favor to us because you love us?","Season_2",2,3
"371","00:15:44.715","00:15:46.349","What? Dumb. Bye.","Season_2",2,3
"372","00:15:46.383","00:15:47.750","But Rick, Summer's just...-","Season_2",2,3
"373","00:15:47.784","00:15:49.552","Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little...","Season_2",2,3
"374","00:15:49.586","00:15:51.120","What's the word I'm looking for here?","Season_2",2,3
"375","00:15:51.154","00:15:52.555","Uh... Human.","Season_2",2,3
"376","00:15:52.589","00:15:53.656","It runs in the family.","Season_2",2,3
"377","00:15:53.690","00:15:56.225","I can tolerate it, but I can't give a crap about it.","Season_2",2,3
"378","00:15:56.259","00:15:57.660","Take a hike.","Season_2",2,3
"379","00:15:57.694","00:16:00.930","Take care of yourself, Unity.","Season_2",2,3
"380","00:16:03.700","00:16:06.168","I'm not looking for judgment, just a yes or no...","Season_2",2,3
"381","00:16:06.203","00:16:08.104","can you assimilate a giraffe?","Season_2",2,3
"382","00:16:08.138","00:16:09.703","- You're the worst! - No, you're the worst!","Season_2",2,3
"383","00:16:09.728","00:16:12.241","You don't support this family! All you care about is yourself!","Season_2",2,3
"384","00:16:12.275","00:16:14.243","- Is about supporting you emotionally... - You've got two children...","Season_2",2,3
"385","00:16:14.277","00:16:16.445","- ...but you're unsupportable. - ...Being dragged across the cosmos...","Season_2",2,3
"386","00:16:16.480","00:16:18.647","- ...because it's never enough, Jerry! - ...By your dangerously ill father!","Season_2",2,3
"387","00:16:18.682","00:16:21.017","And you force me to watch it happen because you'd rather lose them and lose me...","Season_2",2,3
"388","00:16:21.051","00:16:23.486","And you don't even know what it's like to be afraid of losing anything ...Than lose him!","Season_2",2,3
"389","00:16:23.520","00:16:26.088","- Because you cling and you cling - Because you're the child, Beth!","Season_2",2,3
"390","00:16:26.123","00:16:29.291","You, not me! You!","Season_2",2,3
"391","00:16:29.326","00:16:30.760","- Aah! - Aah!","Season_2",2,3
"392","00:16:30.794","00:16:32.328","- Oh, my god. - Aah!","Season_2",2,3
"393","00:16:37.667","00:16:39.902","Um, first of all, hello.","Season_2",2,3
"394","00:16:39.936","00:16:42.138","Uh, my name is Blim Blam the Korblok.","Season_2",2,3
"395","00:16:42.172","00:16:43.806","Second of all, cards on the table,","Season_2",2,3
"396","00:16:43.840","00:16:45.674","I'm a murderer that eats babies,","Season_2",2,3
"397","00:16:45.709","00:16:48.144","and I came to this planet to eat babies.","Season_2",2,3
"398","00:16:48.178","00:16:52.214","However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease","Season_2",2,3
"399","00:16:52.249","00:16:56.585","that I suppose you could call ""space AIDS"" as you put it.","Season_2",2,3
"400","00:16:56.620","00:16:59.889","And Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it.","Season_2",2,3
"401","00:16:59.923","00:17:01.891","At the same time,","Season_2",2,3
"402","00:17:01.925","00:17:03.926","Rick's motivation to cure my disease","Season_2",2,3
"403","00:17:03.960","00:17:06.028","was not to save my life or anyone else's,","Season_2",2,3
"404","00:17:06.063","00:17:09.298","but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarcks.","Season_2",2,3
"405","00:17:09.332","00:17:12.868","But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall?","Season_2",2,3
"406","00:17:12.903","00:17:15.738","And do you know why I'm never coming back to this planet?","Season_2",2,3
"407","00:17:15.772","00:17:19.742","Because the two of you are the [bleep] worst!","Season_2",2,3
"408","00:17:19.776","00:17:22.311","You both hate yourselves and each other.","Season_2",2,3
"409","00:17:22.345","00:17:26.315","And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable.","Season_2",2,3
"410","00:17:26.349","00:17:28.584","I'd laugh, but I'm biologically incapable.","Season_2",2,3
"411","00:17:28.618","00:17:30.219","That's how alien I am.","Season_2",2,3
"412","00:17:30.253","00:17:32.855","And even I'm sitting here listening to the two of you","Season_2",2,3
"413","00:17:32.889","00:17:35.758","and being like, ""What the [beep]""?","Season_2",2,3
"414","00:17:35.792","00:17:37.927","So good luck with your shitty marriage,","Season_2",2,3
"415","00:17:37.961","00:17:41.297","and tell Rick I'm sorry he has to deal with either of you.","Season_2",2,3
"416","00:17:41.331","00:17:43.732","Blim Blam out.","Season_2",2,3
"417","00:17:48.371","00:17:50.039","You know what? I'm taking this.","Season_2",2,3
"418","00:17:54.554","00:17:57.256","How do you... What is this?","Season_2",2,3
"419","00:17:59.559","00:18:02.361","Uh, is there a slow setting?","Season_2",2,3
"420","00:18:02.396","00:18:05.598","Best door ever.","Season_2",2,3
"421","00:18:12.773","00:18:15.942","Okay, okay. Now make them cry, but happy crying.","Season_2",2,3
"422","00:18:15.976","00:18:18.110","Now make them all make fun of the blonde one.","Season_2",2,3
"423","00:18:18.145","00:18:19.645","Now make them all do it on the table.","Season_2",2,3
"424","00:18:19.680","00:18:22.081","I can't believe you created a whole show for me.","Season_2",2,3
"425","00:18:22.115","00:18:23.549","Now cancel it.","Season_2",2,3
"426","00:18:23.583","00:18:24.817","Okay, now put it back on.","Season_2",2,3
"427","00:18:25.986","00:18:27.253","All right, I'm bored.","Season_2",2,3
"428","00:18:27.287","00:18:30.289","Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty?","Season_2",2,3
"429","00:18:30.324","00:18:32.925","- I feel bad that they... - Pbht. Screw those guys.","Season_2",2,3
"430","00:18:32.960","00:18:35.227","Ugh. I'll be right back.","Season_2",2,3
"431","00:18:35.262","00:18:37.296","Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity.","Season_2",2,3
"432","00:18:37.331","00:18:39.865","They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy.","Season_2",2,3
"433","00:18:39.899","00:18:42.601","They just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful.","Season_2",2,3
"434","00:18:42.636","00:18:44.170","And then because they put you there,","Season_2",2,3
"435","00:18:44.204","00:18:45.571","they want you to be less powerful.","Season_2",2,3
"436","00:18:45.605","00:18:46.806","Never gonna happen though, right?","Season_2",2,3
"437","00:18:46.840","00:18:47.974","Never.","Season_2",2,3
"438","00:18:48.008","00:18:50.076","Never. Back in a flash.","Season_2",2,3
"439","00:18:55.082","00:18:56.949","Best weekend ever, Rick.","Season_2",2,3
"440","00:18:56.984","00:19:00.419","I agree, Rick. Let's see how long we can go.","Season_2",2,3
"441","00:19:00.454","00:19:03.489","Hey, Une. You got any more...","Season_2",2,3
"442","00:19:05.792","00:19:08.027","Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes.","Season_2",2,3
"443","00:19:08.061","00:19:10.296","I'm not strong enough to do it in persons.","Season_2",2,3
"444","00:19:10.330","00:19:13.632","I realize now that I'm attracted to you","Season_2",2,3
"445","00:19:13.667","00:19:16.135","for the same reason I can't be with you.","Season_2",2,3
"446","00:19:16.169","00:19:17.603","You can't change.","Season_2",2,3
"447","00:19:17.637","00:19:19.939","And I have no problem with that,","Season_2",2,3
"448","00:19:19.973","00:19:22.808","but it clearly means I have a problem with myself.","Season_2",2,3
"449","00:19:22.843","00:19:25.011","I'm sure there's no perfect version of me.","Season_2",2,3
"450","00:19:25.045","00:19:28.180","I'm sure I'll just unify species after species","Season_2",2,3
"451","00:19:28.215","00:19:29.882","and never really be complete.","Season_2",2,3
"452","00:19:29.916","00:19:32.718","But I know how it goes with us.","Season_2",2,3
"453","00:19:32.753","00:19:35.121","I lose who I am and become part of you.","Season_2",2,3
"454","00:19:35.155","00:19:36.722","Because in a strange way,","Season_2",2,3
"455","00:19:36.757","00:19:39.258","you're better at what I do without even trying.","Season_2",2,3
"456","00:19:39.292","00:19:44.730","Yours, and nobody else's, Unity.","Season_2",2,3
"457","00:19:44.765","00:19:47.666","P.S., I don't know where those coal miners were","Season_2",2,3
"458","00:19:47.701","00:19:48.734","before they were assimilated.","Season_2",2,3
"459","00:19:48.769","00:19:50.469","You might want to get checked.","Season_2",2,3
"460","00:19:53.774","00:19:55.908","Hey.","Season_2",2,3
"461","00:19:55.942","00:19:57.309","Dad.","Season_2",2,3
"462","00:19:58.378","00:20:01.847","I, um Jerry and I","Season_2",2,3
"463","00:20:01.882","00:20:04.450","were looking for our weed whacker","Season_2",2,3
"464","00:20:04.484","00:20:07.219","and found your subterranean lair","Season_2",2,3
"465","00:20:07.254","00:20:11.590","and your alien prisoner, and he got away.","Season_2",2,3
"466","00:20:11.625","00:20:13.092","And I know I sound like mom,","Season_2",2,3
"467","00:20:13.126","00:20:14.927","but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety","Season_2",2,3
"468","00:20:14.961","00:20:16.862","just because I'm afraid you'll leave again,","Season_2",2,3
"469","00:20:16.897","00:20:18.731","so no more alien prisoners","Season_2",2,3
"470","00:20:18.765","00:20:23.235","and no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.","Season_2",2,3
"471","00:20:23.270","00:20:25.171","- Okay. - Okay?","Season_2",2,3
"472","00:20:25.205","00:20:28.274","""Okay"" like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere","Season_2",2,3
"473","00:20:28.308","00:20:30.709","- and never come back? - No. It's your house.","Season_2",2,3
"474","00:20:30.744","00:20:34.046","Grandpa Rick, what happened with Unity?","Season_2",2,3
"475","00:20:34.081","00:20:36.582","Who? Oh, Unity. Yeah, well...","Season_2",2,3
"476","00:20:36.616","00:20:38.417","I mean, honestly, we're talking about an entity","Season_2",2,3
"477","00:20:38.452","00:20:39.885","that thrives on enslavement, you know?","Season_2",2,3
"478","00:20:39.920","00:20:42.154","It's not cool. Fun's fun, but who needs it?","Season_2",2,3
"479","00:20:42.189","00:20:43.456","I'll be in the garage.","Season_2",2,3
"480","00:20:56.903","00:20:58.804","* Lay it, lay it down *","Season_2",2,3
"481","00:20:58.839","00:21:00.706","* Let me see your hand *","Season_2",2,3
"482","00:21:00.740","00:21:03.909","* Show me what you got *","Season_2",2,3
