air-new-zealand,/seat-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,G Graham,United States,2008-08-20,We were in seats 22 A and B (upper deck) but were fortunate enough not to have a third passenger in seat C giving us more room to spread out although I believe we would have been comfortable even with a third person. These seats are in the exit row so leg room is not an issue nor is the narrowness of the seats. I've heard complaints about the temperature but that wasn't a problem with the blankets provided. There really isn't much of a window for this row. The side storage bin is a little awkward to reach and can disturb the passenger behind you when accessing. Our return flight LHR to LAX – 747-400 – we had seats H and K in row 25. We found these seats to be extremely comfortable especially with no one behind us.

Seats were thin and as hard, legroom was tight but the worst part was that when you reclined, the seat base slid forward, causing less legroom. The plane was amazing, though, and it was quite an experience to try out the new Dreamliner. The windows dimmed by pressing a button, cabin pressure and humidity was higher and you could feel the difference after a long flight. Cabin crew service was great and the food was, as usual, really tasty and of high standard. I will fly ANA again.",Boeing 787-800,3x3x3,16-07-2015,Economy,FamilyLeisure,6,2,2,1,3,5,5,4,1

When preparing for take off the stewardess didn't even notice the reclining seat. They really don't check properly.

This was a major mistake as 22G has a large metal box directly adjacent to the anchor stays of the seat in front so it means that leg space for 22G is reduced by about half. Of course this does not appear on the seating chart at check-in but had I known this I would have stayed in 14A.

qantas-airways,/seat-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,M Eggleton,United Kingdom,2013-01-03,"This review is for economy seat 48A which is an exit seat if it were a normal seat it would be much lower score (London-Singapore-Melbourne). I think this is one of the best seats to get in economy. You are the last to board and the first to get off. The seat is a window seat so you have the storage thing on the wall to your left to put things in where as if you were 48B or 48C you would have no where. It has part of the door sticking out in front of your left leg so if your over 6'0 you can't really stretch your leg out fully. I'm 6'4 and didn't have a problem with this as you can angle both legs to one side and not obstruct the person to your right and it was intrusive either.. and the best thing is this seat only cost $25 to book compared to the $160-180 they charge for the other extra leg room seats/exit seats (including the two next to you). People say the seats are bad and in August I said this myself I felt they were too hard but for some reason it was fine this time almost like the cushions have been replaced and I really enjoyed the ride. If flying on an A380 with 31"" or less leg room like Qantas you'll want to book a better seat as passengers behind you have no room and can hardly see the TV's quite ridiculous. The seats recline too much. I think a better foot rest would be better than 2"" extra recline.",A380,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,5,4,3,5,NA,NA,1
qantas-airways,/seat-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Alan Mackenzie,Australia,2011-04-17,I fly to and from London from Melbourne about 10 times a year and try to fly premium economy or business as much as I can. With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins. Unfortunately not. The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control.

Snacks and drinks available throughout the flight in the galley. Although there were not any personal TV's, a few movies were played on the overhead screens. We were seated in 21A and 21C, therefore we had a good view of the TV's. A flaw with United is the movies they show everyone on the overhead TV screens. I was shocked at amount of explicit sexual stuff in the movies, and adding onto that - theft, crime, violence, lots of kissing - in the movies they show. There were toddlers on the flight, and lots of children/teenagers that mostly were on a school trip. As a teenager, I was appalled by the entertainment shown to everyone - I believe that United should choose the movies that are shown carefully.

However it didn't reach a position which was comfortable. The ""footrest"" was terrible it was really a ""legrest"" that only extended about 2/3 the way from my knees to my ankles but all it did was press against my calves and cut off the circulation. It was also difficult to put back had to press hard against it with my legs while pushing a button on the inside arm of the seat. The table which was stored in the seat arm did not slide forward enough to provide room between it and my stomach - I'm not particularly large so I don't know how someone who is heavier would even manage to use the table. I had to have the seat completely in the upright position to be able to use the table at all and it was rather awkward trying to eat with it that close. Also the seat adjustment buttons are right under where the table hinges so it's essentially impossible to adjust the seat when the table is out. We were sitting in the first row on the right side of the plane so had lots of legroom; I give the normal seats 4 of 5 based on my observation but I'm not very tall so don't need a lot of legroom.

I prefer the leg rests the other rows have as they are adjustable. The recline was pretty generous and I didn't feel too crowded when the seat in front of me was down. The seat width could've been a bit wider. I had some room but if you are a larger individual you will fill up the seat. With my seat reclined and my feet on the leg rest in the top position I was almost all the way stretched out. (I am 5'6"") I found it very comfortable. For 2 people the side rows are great. They are just two seats and we felt like it was our own little area. Getting out of the window seat was pretty good. The VOD system was pretty good. They had a seat-to-seat text chat feature and games you can play against other passengers. The movie selection was good. They provide noise-canceling headphones and they worked very well.

You don't have many airline options flying in/out of Tahiti so Air Tahiti Nui is kind of the only way to go. That being said I'm not sure who designed the seats in Moana Economy Class but I have no idea what they were thinking with the headrest. The seats are as expected in economy class - not much leg room narrow worn and used seats. I'm your average 5'5 female and felt the space was adequate enough although man spreaders definitely make the space more cramped. My biggest gripe is the headrest which can move up or down but for the most part feels like someone is shoving your head forward into the most uncomfortable position in the world. There's just no way to get comfortable. For an 8 hour flight from LAX it makes sleeping difficult even if the seat is all the way reclined. The best you can do is sleep with your head tilted forward and arms crossed over your chest. Most positive comment would be the IFE which had a number of on demand movies/shows which was easy to use.

Rather we had a CRT every 10 rows (and ours was broken). This means that the Seat arms go up all the way and no boxes to block legroom. The bad - well seat back IFE is essentially ""the standard"" now. So I am of two minds. The leg room and fully disappearing arm rests are good. The old cushionless cushions very bad.

I was lucky to sit at the emergency exit so legroom was not a problem. In the normal rows I can barely squeeze in (I tried). Also the seat is barely wide enough to sit in. Consequently there is not enough space for the upper body. I had physical contact with my neighbour the whole time. The seat is also quite hard. The only good thing I can say is the head rest. You can adapt it to keep your head from rolling to the side so you will not need a neck pillow.,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,3,2,1,5,NA,NA,0

virgin-atlantic-airways,/seat-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,Tim Collins,United Kingdom,2014-07-18,Far from ideal economy seats for a long haul flight - you book Virgin with the expectation of getting something a little better but this is definitely not true anymore with economy. Very modest incline on the seat certainly no where close to feeling like a natural sleeping position. Just about enough leg room for me as a 5'8 tall man but in some seats the seat mounting will stop you being able to stretch out. Food was average - standard meal tray with a cold starter (pasta salad) rubbery bread roll and a small hot element (either lasagna or chicken) which reminded me of a cheap ready meal. Second meal was a cold snack consisting of a very small sandwich and a very small packet of premium crisps. Other than that got one hot and one cold drink service with and just after the main meal. Our plane had being recently refitted so the new touch screen entertainment system was in place and I have to say this was excellent with a very good selection of recent films and TV. Very small screen but this didn't matter so much in economy as you are never too far away from the seat in front! Other than that the cabin in the 747 was starting to show its age which I guess was not surprising considering it has being flying since 2001.

If no one else pays for and reserves an exit row seat you may be th eonly person sitting in the exit row even if the rest of the aircraft is packed. Exit row seats are not assigned to regular passengers. The leg room is great which compensates from the fact that none of the seats on Ryanair recline which is a good thing in that you never have the seat in front of you pressed against your face or run the risk of a passenger in front pushing back their seat while you are eating a meal or when you have a drink on the drop-down tray and it ends up on your lap.

swiss-international-air-lines,/seat-reviews/swiss-international-air-lines,Swiss Intl Air Lines customer review,Konrad Brynda,Switzerland,2014-11-19,Although less comfortable than at the times of Swissair Swiss has fairly good economy seats on their A320 fleet. They are much better compared to many other airlines in Europe (Lufthansa SAS Air France) and simply superior in comparison to United's domestic fleet. The seats are thin leather seats with a reasonable recline the only real negative point is the lack of larger armrests. Hopefully they will go back to the classic large seats they used to have that still provided much comfort in a 3x3 configuration. *Note: no PTV enjoy the view of the Alps!,AIRBUS A320,3x3,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,1
air-new-zealand,/seat-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,Diane Budres,New Zealand,1970-01-01,Premium Economy Class was perfect for someone like me who has to travel between LA and AKL every month but doesn't want to pay the price to spread out in business class. The leg room is spacious leaving enough work space so that I can work on my lap top without disturbing the person next to me - coach seating has become so cramped on airlines that you tend to overlap each other). Plus the blankets were comfortable and there were extra pillows for my flight - it was great! Some over weight people may find the seat width a little small for premium economy (Qantas Premium Economy seems a little larger) but for a normal sized woman it is perfect.,B747-400,3x2,NA,Premium Economy,NA,9,5,4,4,5,5,NA,NA,1

emirates,/seat-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,John Broussard,United States,2010-08-07,I don't like that you can't get your seat assigned on some legs (Dubai-Houston) until checking in. The 3-4-3 seat arrangement in Economy makes for extremely narrow seats which create an uncomfortable flight experience. Sitting in an aisle seat means your shoulder will be banged repeatedly by anyone walking by or by passing carts. It is reason to fly another airline.,B777,3x4x3,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,3,1,3,3,NA,NA,0
cathay-pacific-airways,/seat-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,David Lloyd,New Zealand,2010-10-22,For an economy seat leg room was good even with the seat recline. The new seat doesn't give a good sleeping position but few economy seats do. My big gripe is the cushion thickness. While just about bearable on the LHR-HKG leg it became very painful on the HKG-AKL leg. Take cushions and break your journey!,B777/A340,2x4x2,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,3,2,4,5,NA,NA,0

I will go out of my way not to fly this plane again. Though the seats were slightly wider than other economy seats the lack of padding and lack of lumbar support made this horrible for me.

qatar-airways,/seat-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,Ivana Pantovic,Argentina,2014-11-19,One of the best economy class seats I know. I am 5'9'' and legroom was more than enough. Recline was better than most airlines. Screen had a pretty wide adjustment angle so I had no problem to watch the program regardless of how reclined was the seat in front of me. At the meal time there was enough room to use the tray table without the passenger in front putting their seat in the upright position. Good choice of entertainment. the only downside was that the seat was a little hard. Summing it up a very good overall experience.,BOEING 777-200LR,3x3x3,NA,Economy,NA,8,5,4,4,5,5,NA,NA,1

They just started refitting the cabin but I my opinion it's a waste of money and time. Even though the whole cabin was redone legroom is still very poor. Seat width is ok so is the recline.

Air Canada as a concession to passengers flying in aircraft without PE seating assigned us to ""preferred seats"" which in this case was 12A and 12C which were immediately behind the business class section of the cabin. Boarding was reasonably efficient but hampered by the rush of passengers scrambling to find storage for their massive carry ons. As we had no under seat storage we also had to scramble to ensure our few small carry ons were stowed. Our IFES and almost everyone else's on the port side of the aircraft did not work; AC did give us vouchers which when filed on line gave us a 5% discount on future bookings until spring 2015. Legroom was comfortable and our seats had 3"" more pitch than other Economy class seats; but this is a small aircraft (better than a CRJ) and things still felt cramped.

klm-royal-dutch-airlines,/seat-reviews/klm-royal-dutch-airlines,KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,S Mcqueen,Singapore,2015-02-21,Flew from SIN to AMS return. Very very poor economy class seat especially for intercontinental flights above 10 hours. Seats are extremely squeezy (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for a overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats. The seats are so cramped that passengers have so much difficulty getting in and out of their seats to use the lavatory!
