19950722,19950723,"Santa Clara, CA",NA,30 min.,"Mr. Peter Davenport National UFO Reporting CenterPO Box 45623, University StationSeattle, WA 98145Dear Peter,Along with my report, I have enclosed a hand-written report from Ben Kwong who witnessed the same UFO&apos;s with me on Saturday, July 22, 1995.  Mr. Kwong is an engineer and lives in San Jose.  I did not get a written report from his 12-year-old son, Michael, but will send it to you if he writes one.  I believe that the reports from Mr. Kwong and myself should be thorough enough.  The only difficulty in writing our reports would be regarding the order in which we saw everything happen.  This is due to the fact that we saw up to five UFO&apos;s (four to five in the air at once).  We were not always looking at the same UFO at the same time.  Since there were several UFO&apos;s in the sky at once during our sighting, we didn&apos;t always focus on the same UFO&apos;s.  Anyway, the following is my accounting of what we saw.  Also, please note that I may have incorrectly given you the time of the sighting as being between 10:30 AM and 11:00 to 11:15.  The time was between 9:30 AM to 10:00 or later.  It was definitely for at least a half hour, maybe an hour (I began teaching my tennis lesson at 9:00 and noticed the first UFO at about 9:30.  When I arrived at home, 2 min. away, it was about 11:00 but I don&apos;t recall watching the UFO&apos;s for more than 45 min. to an hour at the very most -very minimum was a half hour).To whom it may concern:On Saturday, July 22, 1995 at 9:30 AM I, along with Michael Kwong (age 12), and his father (Ben Kwong), had a UFO&apos;s sighting which lasted for at least a half hour (to 10:15 AM or later) over the sky of Santa Clara, CA, from the Marina Playa Apt. complex tennis courts located at 3500 Granada Ave. and Lawrence Expressway (El Camino is a close cross street of Lawrence Expressway).  The sighting first began at 9:30 AM when I was teaching Michael Kwong a tennis lesson.  Michael was practicing his serve and was tossing the ball in the air.  I looked at the ball toss as it went up and noticed that the moon was out.  I also noticed an object by the moon which I took to be a star and appeared stationary like a star.  I looked at the object again and thought it might be moving slowly.  The object appeared to be moving slowly at a very high altitude, perhaps just within the atmosphere or at least at a very high altitude.  I spoke to Michael and began to say things out loud like, &quot;What is that?  What the heck is that?  It&apos;s not an airplane.&quot;  Michael looked up at it as well.  I stopped the lesson out of curiosity to watch this object.  I walked over to the fence and yelled to Ben Kwong, who was sitting in his car reading the newspaper.  I asked him to come out of his car to get a look a the object so we could figure out what it was.  He stood down below the tennis courts, looking up at the object as I and Michael were too.  Then Mr. Kwong came up to the court and all three of us continued to watch the object.  The object looked completely round and whitish in appearance (perhaps due to the altitude or even entering the atmosphere?).  The object slowly moved away from the moon and then curved a slowly headed back toward its original position, and then it appeared to hover and then start to move slowly again.  We watched this object for a few minutes and then we saw another object which looked had the same appearance as the first object.  I don&apos;t remember if Mr. Kwong or I spotted the next object first (Mr. Kwong&apos;s son is near sighted, so he had a harder time seeing).  I believe we watched until finally we saw at least four of the whitish objects in the sky.  At one point it appeared like they were hovering and moving slowly in four corners of the sky.  When they were closer to us, they appeared metallic, sort of a metallic, silver to silver-blue in color.  When they were higher up they initially appeared to be more whitish in color.  Anyway, we continued watching several of these objects as they moved slowly, stop, and move in bizarre paths, unlike airplanes.  They were very high but left no exhaust trail.  They moved and changed direction, unlike weather balloons or satellites.  At some point, after watching the (I&apos;ll call them silver, or metallic-silver/blue) objects, Ben and I noticed a red UFO, completely round like the others, but a metallic-red in color.  We then both observed a silver UFO and the red UFO in a staggered formation, with the silver UFO leading in front to the left of the red UFO (doing what appeared to be the same speed).  We noticed another red object at a lower altitude slowly moving up into the sky (not metallic, but more of an all orange to orange-red in color).  I didn&apos;t, nor did Ben, take much notice of this object as it slowly went up into the sky.  It could have been a balloon and didn&apos;t have the metallic look of the other objects which were very high in the sky.  At some point, the silver UFO&apos;s would just disappear from sight.  I don&apos;t know where they went, maybe out into the upper atmosphere,  Then sometimes one would come back into view.  The red UFO really caught my attention next.  Ben had lost sight of it (you really had to &quot;track&quot; with your eyes without looking away from the UFO&apos;s or it would take a few seconds to find some of them again).  Anyway, I told Ben that I could see the red UFO again.  I saw it moving very slowly up in the sky and then it suddenly shot through the sky at an amazing speed.  I said, &quot; There it goes! There it goes! Look at it go!&quot;  Ben kept saying that he couldn&apos;t find it.  We watched some of the other UFO&apos;s until it seemed that there were no more to see (they had all gone, but we didn&apos;t see them leave).  We had about given up on seeing any more UFO&apos;s up there when I caught sight of the first or perhaps another red UFO.  I told Ben to look up as I pointed to its location.  Ben said he could see it.  Suddenly the red UFO shot across the sky at an amazing speed, much much faster than any jet or rocket could fly (we were watching regular passenger jets crawl across the sky every once in awhile as we watched the UFO&apos;s.  The passenger jets, and some jets which may have been military from Moffet Field, were at a much lower altitude than the UFO&apos;s, a testimony to the speed of the UFO&apos;s).  I kept pointing at the red UFO as it sped across the sky.  We were both in awe, and were both speaking out loud in our amazement of the speed of the object (&quot;There is no way that can be a jet.  Nothing is that fast.  Look at it go.&quot; -etc., etc.).  As I was moving my finger across the sky, tracking the object (in what would take a jet several minutes to travel, I followed the object across the sky in less than ten seconds.  It was still at a very high altitude as well), Ben said he could see a silver UFO right next to the red one.  I said I only could see the red one, but just before the red UFO completely went out of sight, I could see another UFO, a silver one, very close to the red UFO or joined to it.  We were then completely convinced that we saw UFO&apos;s, things which are not man-made.  We didn&apos;t see any more UFO&apos;s for a few minutes, so I resumed my tennis lesson, although I had a very hard time teaching.  We stopped a few minutes later.  I looked up again and saw one lone silver UFO (up so high that it appeared white).  It was hovering and then started to move slowly again.  I told Ben and Michael that there was another one up there.  At this point, we already saw the most exciting part of our sighting (the red UFO &amp; silver UFO shooting off).  Our necks were tired from the strain of looking up, almost straight up at times for over a half hour (possibly an hour or more, as Ben stated, although I can&apos;t be sure).  We really didn&apos;t take much notice of this UFO and we didn&apos;t see it disappear from sight, but it did a couple of minutes later.  We parted between 10:30 and 11:00 AM.  I went back to my apartment and called some TV stations to see if anyone had reported anything (I really thought SOMEONE would have witnessed what we saw and would report it.  The TV station personnel said nobody else called in, plus they seemed rather skeptical of my story.  That annoyed me a bit.  I then called the Air Force in Santa Clara County.  They switched me from command post to command post.  I gave my story up to three times perhaps.  They asked me at what time I saw the UFO&apos;s, took my story, and then said they would transfer me to another command post and to just tell them the same thing (that I told the first people I contacted).  Finally, the Air Force gave me the phone # of the National UFO Reporting Agency (for whom I am writing this report).  I, after giving my story to Peter Davenport, was made aware of the fact that another person in California reported seeing up to five UFO&apos;s on the same day I had my sighting.  This was my first time every seeing anything like this in my life (I&apos;m 29-years-old, teach tennis and am also a computer specialist teaching elementary school.  Ben, like I said, is an engineer.  So I believe we are both credible people).End of ReportI&apos;m waiting to get my grandmother&apos;s written report of her two sightings and my mother&apos;s report of a sighting (these all happened many years ago).  I was afraid to mention their sightings because I thought it might make my sighting less credible.  I indeed immediately felt I had something to share with them and also wanted them to retell of their sightings as well.  My grandmother&apos;s sightings are of particular interest to me since she saw a UFO in the Almaden area of San Jose, CA some 58 years ago.  I teach in this area and my ancestors first settled there in the 1860&apos;s.  Someone emailed me who lives in Almaden to tell me she and her daughter &amp; 14-year-old son had sightings in Almaden.  She said that her son saw one hovering over the school that I teach at.  This was before she even knew that I teach at this school!  Anyway, I don&apos;t know how many people you can believe on the Internet re. sightings, but I know what I saw, and that&apos;s good enough for me.  The only other strange thing I observed in my life was described to me by someone on the Internet as being &quot;ball lightening&quot; or something like it.  I was twelve-years-old at the time.  I don&apos;t know if that is UFO related or not.  Is it just a normal phenomenon.  It happened indoors.  It went under a cot.  The cot shot straight up in the air, about five feet, and there was nothing underneath the cot!  The object was indefinable in shape, just grayish/white, and swirling.  It seemed to react to me as I entered the room and skimmed across the floor.  Any ideas?Sincerely,William D. Baileywbailey@cello.gina.calstate.edu"

Sheriff had received many credible reports about red and blue &quot;roman candle&quot; like objects shooting down out of the sky to the ground.

One red object appeared to be the largest; green ones were smaller.  They were reported to appear to be descending to the earth slowly, at which point a huge white flash of light occurred. Subsequent reports by investigators suggest that some kind(s) of officials were in the area shortly after event, requesting that local and state officials say nothing.((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, this event was not only dramatic, but quite bizarre, as well.  We were first contacted Saturday night, January 7, 1995, by an Operations Officer in TEMA, who reported to us that the event had occurred, and that their offices had been activated, as a result of the strange event, and subsequent explosion.  The latter was so dramatic that a member of the local aviation community, who had witnessed the event, immediately following the explosion, drove to the airport and took off in an aircraft to search for what he was certain had been an airliner that had exploded in midair.  TEMA contacted the U. S. Air Force, apparently informing them that a possible UFO event had occurred, and inquiring what TEMA should do.  According to the TEMA official we spoke with, TEMA was informed by the USAF to contact the National UFO Reporting Center.  TEMA did contact our Center by telephone, and faxed to our offices a seven-page document, written by a Warren County Deputy Sheriff, in which that officer describeded the explosion, according to eyewitnesses. We express our sincere gratitude to TEMA for their effort in sharing the information with our Center. Peter Davenport, Director))"

(eastern), she was riding the Staten Island Ferry from the tip of Manhattan to Staten Island.  Just as the ferry was passing Governor&apos;s Island, she became aware of a commotion on the east side of the ferry boat.  People were rushing to that side of the ferry, shouting, pointing, and generally raising a ruckus.  She decided to try to determine was the cause of the disturbance, and walked outside onto the passenger deck.  What she saw shocked her.  The object was huge, and it obscured the passengers&apos; view of Governor&apos;s Island.  Many of them reported that the object looked like a city, with lights and a skyline.  However, its presence apparently roiled the water beneath it, causing a froth to appear on the water&apos;s surface!! For days afterward, the witnessed handed out leaflets at the ferry terminal, hoping to contact other passengers who had seen the object.  Those same people approached 9-1-1 facilities, requesting copies of the tape recorded reports of the object, which was also seen from Governor&apos;s Island, but the tapes were either missing, or not made available, they were told. A video tape about the incident was prepared, a copy of which is in the possession of NUFORC. This incident apparently was VERY dramatic, and it was witnessed by dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of people.  We would be most grateful if anyone else who was present that night would please submit a report about what they saw that night."

This was Sunday, August 20 1995, at 1345 EST.  We both saw a bright reflection in the sky, the sun was reflecting off of it and we thought it was an airplane.  I guess it turned a little because the brightness stopped.  We both watched for a few seconds, and noticed it didn&apos;t have any wings or tail like an airplane would have.  It was cigar shaped, (it looked like a 747 w/o wings or a tail).  All of a sudden it was gone!  I looked down at the road for a second (I was driving), looked back up and couldn&apos;t find it.  My fiance&apos; said it just disappeared!Please let me know if any other sightings were reported on the East Coast this weekend.  Was I seeing things?

Upon approaching Pilot Rock, OR, the brother driving the lead vehicle, a Suzuki (Samurai?) noticed a peculiar cluster of blue-white colored round lights, positioned in a square or rectangular pattern, ahead.  He called his brother on CB radio (Ch. 4) to ask is he saw it, and the brother answered that he certainly did.  The lights disappeared from sight, then reappeared on the other side of the road.  They passed through Pilot Rock, and the object became visible again as they were leaving that town.  The object had the same appearance as it had had before they arrived at Pilot Rock, and it stayed with them (according to their conscious recollection, for another 30 minutes. The brothers made several interesting observations at the time of the incident.  Most interesting was the fact that even though they were talking over a CB channel that traditionally is used very heavily by loggers, and other users in that area of Oregon (Ch. 4), they heard no other users during the entire experience!  Also, they saw no other traffic on their side of the highway,. even though they remember seeing oncoming traffic in the other lane.  When they got home, they topped off the fuel tanks in their trucks.  Craig&apos;s vehicle indicated that he had driven 98.7 miles from deer camp, where both he and his brother had filled their vehicles&apos; fuel tanks from fuel cans.  When they got to Pendleton, his vehicle, which was getting about 25 miles per gallon, took less than 2 gallons of fuel!Craig had spent 9 years in the military, during which time, he said, he had seen many different types of weapons used.

When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tail&quot;fired&quot; twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen. My friend and I know alot about airplanes and this fits no description we could make. Planes appear to be moving slowly from afar, not this thing.We have absoultly no explanation for this.It !must have traveled 50 or 60 miles in the extent of 60 to 90 seconds.Please post this so I can find out if anyone else saw it. There were plenty of other cars on the road at this time. Thanks Dan This story also appears at http://mother.com/~green3/ufo/dan.htm"

He looked at the night sky to the southwest, because that is the direction where there is no treeline, and he suddenly noticed a light, which at first he thought might be a star, although it appeared to him to be rather large to be a star. When he looked back at a a couple of minutes later, it was now larger than a full moon!  Also, it appeared to be getting closer to him, and was lower to the horizon, he thought.  Then he realized that it had become two distinct lights, both bright white.  At this point, he summoned his wife, who also saw the object as it passed directly overhead.  they both agreed it was less that 500 feet above them. It was not a helicopter, and it was too slow for an aircraft.  The two lights were on the bottom, and they were glowing.  They could see an outline of the object as it passed overhead, and it appeared to be &quot;pie-shaped.&quot; They both heard a really low hum as the object passed overhead very slowly.  The object suddenly disappeared approximately 2 seconds after it had passed overhead.  The caller added that he and his wife have three cats, one of which is an &quot;outside&quot; cat, and two that are &quot;indoor&quot; cats.  After the incident, all of the them were gone, and they did not return until approximately one week later. Their dog, which normally is very eager to go outside, would not go outside for several days without coaxing from his owner.  The dog, a pit bull (?) was apparently very upset for several days afterward.  At 2315 hrs. that night, after the sighting, the dog started barking and snapping at the front door, and he would not go through that door for 4-5 days."

19970206,19970212,"Coober Pedy, S.A. (Approx. 250km south of) (Australia),",light,NA,"SUMMARY:  A stormy night on the Stuart Highway. Sighting of a UFO which appeared to land,  a UFO chasing the car some 50m behind, and the sighting of a man which was extremely unusual looking.The first event to happen was the sighting of a &apos;roadwork&apos; man sweeping the highway.  Whilst driving along the highway, an extremely bright light suddenly appeared in front of us. At first we thought it was a truck coming towards us - common on the highway-but as we drove towards it we realised it was a stationary truck with a bright light attatched to the front of the grill. Upon getting closer to the light, it was that bright and blinding that we had to slow down to 10kms just to see the road and where we were going. Half the road was closed and suddenly we were able to see a man. There he was sweeping the road at 21:30(approx) 200kms from the nearest roadhouse. We slowly drove up to him to explain that we could not see the road due to the light and essentialy could not see him. We now believe that not being able to see him was what he wanted. The man hardly showed his face and what we did see - he had an extremely high forehead and very wide set eyes. He was approx. 7 fee!t tall and of stocky build. He did not want us talking to him and made every attempt to get us to move on quickly. As we drove off the light slowly disappeared - which is what got us thinking. Due to the cloud cover that night, a light of that intensity would have cast quite a bit of glare i.e. we would have seen the light from quite a distance, however the light suddenly flashed on and we were not descending or ascending a hill! My questions at the time were who was he, what was he doing that far out of town at that time of night and what was he sweeping off the road?Eventually that passed as we drove along the highway again.Approximately 30mins after this happened an extremely bright light came up from behind us - we had not passed a car since the roadwork man - to within 50m of us. It followed  our car for about 4 seconds before disappearing. The lights intensity was similar to that of a cars high-beam headlights and was orange-yellow in colour. Neither of us said anything - we were starting to get spooked.As we were driving up the road we were heading into a storm. As we got closer to the storm I was checking the stars to see where the storm cloud started - it was that black that there was a definite black line where the storm cloud startes. As I was watching the stars I noticed an extremely orange star. As I continued watching it moved forward so it kept up with the car, not falling behind like the other stars were. From where we were this &apos;star&apos; was about 5-6mm across. As I continued watching the light moved on a diagonal path towards the horizon and was now in front of the car. This light continued downwards until it reached a point slightly above the horizon, if not on the horizon, and that is where it stayed until the blackness of the strom blocked my view.Among these happenings we passed a military style vehicle with no insignia which was cruising up the highway rather slowly. We could not see the driver as we passed the vehicle.The storm that we drove through was extremely active for about 2 hours until we actually reached it. (there had been continuous lightning for these two hours). Yet as soon as the light was blocked out by the clouds all lightning stopped. As far as we know a storm does not just stop suddenly.As we neared Coober Pedy, a white 4WD suddenly pulled out from the side of the road and forced our car to slow down considerably. In the back window of this car two shapes could be seen moving and I can tell you with all honesty that they did not look like dogs or humans or any other animal but I did not get a very good look at them so I cannot accurately say or judge what they were.We eventually made it to Coober Pedy and were relieved to see other humans.The whole event really spooked both me and my fiance and we have vowed never to travel on the highway agein at night. (the highway runs directly from Adelaide to Alice Springs and continues to Darwin, passing through townships and roadhouses.It passes through some of the most lonely land in Australia).As we checked out of our motel the next morning we metioned these events to the receptionist who just smiled and said oh well you wouldn&apos;t be the first to talk about things like that. That was all we could get out of her,she wouldn&apos;t talk anymore.For my fiance, it is the second time that he has witnessed events of a &apos;supernatural&apos; kind - he is in his late twenties. I have witnessed other happenings including metallic cigar shaped objects and other orange lights resembling stars but moving otherwise to indicate that they were not a star. I am 18.I am not providing my address as yet for security reasons - as well as I only connected to the net yesterday and haven&apos;t bothered yet to set up an e-mail address on my computer. I will watch this site for further information.I have provided this report because I know how hard it is to gain information on these matters.

We were driving a 24Ft. rental truck loaded with items for our employer&apos;s winter home.We were approximately 60-70 miles north-east of Las Vegas when we heard cargo in the rear of the truck shift. I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects. This was truly a hair-raising experience for all of us and we did not waste any time in exiting the area."

It didn&apos;t move like any familiar airplane, so we pulled over to watch for a minute.  The object was shaped similar to a Stealth, except with a thinner, smoother head-on profile, and with much more bluntly squared-off wingtips and nose.  It moved extremely slowly, no faster than a motorized hangglider,  and completely without engine noise, although it was at a relatively low altitude. (below low-hanging clouds.)  As it passed over our vehicle, its span covered the length of the Suburban.  It had a very large white spotlight at its nose and two bright lights at each wingtip.  The underside had many patterned rows of small colored lights, with an amber double row down the center.  The underside gave the impression of being textured or plated.  There was absolutely no engine noise, even though the craft was very low and very slow.  After pass!ing overhead, two or three small, blue &quot;sparkles&quot; dropped from the craft.  Not quite believing what we had witnessed, and not being fervent UFO watchers, we decided not to report the sighting.

The observers first noticed two aircraft, which appeared to be flying a parallel course directly south, in tandem formation, at the same altitude, and separated by only 1/2 to 1 mile.  The apparent close proximity of the two aircraft is what first drew the observers&apos; attention and caused them to conclude that they were military aircraft, as opposed to commercial or private aircraft.  The individual who called and who submitted the written report stated that he and the other observers are familiar with the general flight characteristics of aircraft flying out of Roanoke, VA, airport, and they invariably maintain greater separation than what they observed for these two aircraft that had drawn their attention. Suddenly, the observers became aware of a third &quot;aircraft,&quot; which was directly ahead of the first two aircraft.  The observers immediately developed the impression that the third &quot;aircraft&quot; was being pursued by the first two they had witnessed.  The third object was less well illuminated that the first two, and its lighting pattern consisted of three red, somewhat &quot;subdued&quot; lights, arranged in a triangular pattern. Its size was approximately that of the other two aircraft. Approximately 30-60 seconds after the observers had spotted the first two conventional aircraft, they suddenly noticed that a third aircraft was flying from the northwest directly toward the triangular aircraft, apparently on a &quot;collision&quot; course with it, closing from the starboard side of the triangular-shaped aircraft, and flying at a somewhat higher speed that the triangular ship exhibited. Within seconds of sighting the fourth aircraft, the observers realized that none of the conventional aircraft were able to keep up with the triangular craft, all of them beginning to fall behind at the latter apparently began to accelerate.  The third conventional aircraft fell behind the triangle, and began to fly parallel to the other conventional aircraft. The incident was reported to the FAA in Roanoke, VA, and to Andrews AFB."

The lights were larger than a visible planet would appear; the closest description I can give as to size was that they were similar in size to street lights viewed from a car, only they were clearly very high in the sky, so the actual size of the objects had to be enormous.  We watched the objects, which were hovering in place, the one on the left a little higher than the one on the right.  Suddenly, the objects moved, rotating around one another (top to bottom) to switch places with one another.  Then, the one which had moved to the top winked out, just vanished.

We stopped at a car dealership which had a clear view of that part of the sky (I&apos;d say, south, maybe south east part of the sky--I&apos;d have to look at a map to be more specific--we were driving generally south at the time).   We got out of the Jeep and stood in the lot, watching the remaining light.  It kept its position.  After a few minutes, we got back into the Jeep, and I continued to drive to Norwalk.  We watched the light all the way to Norwalk; it remained the in the same part of the sky the entire way (probably for a total of 20 miles or so), so it had to be pretty high up.  When I dropped ((name deleted)) off at her home, I had one more look at the object by a running track near her house, then I headed home (driving north, so I could no longer see it in front of me).  I couldn&apos;t see the part of the sky where it was when I got home, so I just went inside. The lights were pale yellow or white-ish in color.  I thought they seemed round, but ((name deleted)) said at the time (and has maintained) that they seemed triangular to her.  They were definitely not airplanes (we saw plenty of planes in the sky that night--no comparison).  They also didn&apos;t behave like planes.I&apos;m 29 years old, female, married, a webmaster/graphic designer by profession.  I&apos;ve never seen any unusual phenomena in the sky before, and have always been skeptical about the whole UFO thing.  While these lights may not be alien in nature, I certainly can&apos;t explain them (if you figure out what they were, please let me know!)  I don&apos;t know ((name deleted)) age (mid to late 40s perhaps).   She is currently attending college full time to get her masters in painting, and I believe a certificate to teach (or something of that nature).  If I can give you any further specifics, please contact me."

The weather was clear and the windwas minimal.  This Isl. is about 90 miles so.of N.Y. City, there at least two military basesrelatively close by.  There was 5 0r 6 of us sittingclose to the waterline at Beach Haven Terrace beach.  As this is a summer recreation areaand I was 19 years old at the time we were partying at the time of the sighting.  At thetime of the viewing I was not out of control perhaps slightly high but nowhere near to the point of halucinating (sorry about the spelling). I was facing the Ocean and I was just taking in the veiw, for example I noticed some boats and ships out for an evening cruise and that the Moon illuminated the sky enoughto see the eastern horizen very clearly. At thispoint out of my left eye I saw a very bright light parallel with the horizen, using my thumb at arms length I would estimate it at 1 or 2 degrees above the clearly seen horizen. Afterabout a second or two I shouted out to the othersto look over there. All but one of us saw it(the guy with his back to the sea was&apos;nt quickenough). by the time everyone looked it startedto do a 90 degree turn over the horizen and it did not appear to slow down, the fireball&apos;slight faded over the horizen within a secondor two.  And thinking back on the moment (later on that night whenI was tring to get to sleep) I believe I saw the siloutte of a cigar shape craft in frontos the fireball. This I can not be absolutly sure since my eyes did not have enough time to focus in on any details of what ever it was.I am also aware of the fact that it seemed to be reacting to my excitementfor the 90 deg. turn accured directly striaghtout from our position, a coincidence maybe, butI wonder.  I hope you can coralate this report with someoneelse who witnessed this event,I sure some of thefolkes on board some of those ships got an evenbetter look at it since they were much closer.I&apos;m just guessing but I believe it traveled atleast 2 or so in the time it was flying strightThe fireball did not get much bigger whenit was straight out from our position on the beachwhich is as close to sea level as one can get.With the help of a math oriented person you could get a rough ideaof how far it traveled and approx. speed.By the way I realize that CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND had just come out in 77 and I really did want to see a UFO but at that timein my life I just had a passing interest inthe subject.

19970112,19970210,"Billings, MT",light,5 minutes or less,"SUMMARY:  Two bright red lights moving in perfect formation flew over Billings on the evening of Jan.12, 1997.  They were&nbsp;flying at an altitude normally too low for conventional aircraft.  Too slow for an airplane. . .almost as if they were gliding.  They made no sound.On the evening of January 12, 1997 around 11 pm I was at my girlfriend&apos;s house and went outside to try to start her car (it had been very cold that week and we had been trying to start it for a couple of days).  I went inside the car, tried to turn it on and it didn&apos;t start.  I got out of the car and two bright lights hovering over a set of trees caught my attention.  I knew that there were no lights (city or otherwise) that should have been there so I looked at them for a second or two.  They were really bright but at the same time kind of dull (hard to describe).  I moved a few steps away from the car and they started to move in a northeasterly direction.  When I first spotted the lights they were probably 1/4 to 1/2 a mile away.  I ran inside and told my girlfriend to come out and check them out.  She got on her boots and saw them but went back inside because it was at least 10 degrees below zero outside.  I ran out onto the street and followed their flight path.  They fl!ew from a southwest to northeast direction and were probably 60-70 degrees off of the horizon.  The two lights upon closer inspection appeared to be made up of more than one light, possibly five. . .occasionally they would blink (they blinked quickly, unlike any other airplane light I have ever seen)  The thing that struck me the most is how they stayed _perfect_ formation. . .not straying an inch from their formation.  It was as almost they were part of the same craft.  This might be the case, but if this is so that means that this craft was at least the size of 2 football fields.  They were completely silent.  Billings is set against a continuous series of cliffs which are about 60-100 feet in height.  In comparison to the Rims (as they are called) they were about 200 feet off of the ground.  They were flying too slow for any airplane that I know  of (plus, as i said they made no sound)  It was if they were gliding.  I ran up a side street and watched them pass over the rims!and pass just south of the airport, if not right over it.  I watched them glide off until they went over the horizon.  It was very strange, as the entire time I knew this was something that I have never seen before in person.  I tried to call the airport to confirm any unidentified aircraft but couldnt get through.  If there are any questions please email me.  I can positively state this was not any conventioal airplane."

It glides by quickly and silently, then disappearsMy husband and I had just finished dinner at the restaurant at our Honeymoon Resort when we decided to walk along the beach back to our rooms. Most of the resort guests were at a barbeque on the nearby (50 yards away) island called Kokomo, so the resort was fairly quiet and we were alone, except for maybe an employee now and then. We decided to stop and enjoy the stars. We were both silently enjoying the view when I noticed a huge black object. ( I cannot however, determine how far away it was) it cast a slight reflection on the underneath side of it, as if the moon were glowing on it. The only way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a large stingray without a tail sailing through the sky. It did not make a sound, and it lasted only seconds. I could not figure out what I had seen, I hesitated, and then asked my husband if he had seen it too. He said yes, and said he was glad I had seen it because he though it was his imagination. We tried to explain it to ourselve!s, but the only thing we could come up with was that maybe it was a large black bird gliding over the water. But the only birds we had ever seen near the bay were totally white. The bird would have also had to have been within 5 feet in front of us to appear so large. We would have seen the bird clearly because the resort had small lamps that lit the nearby walkways, and we were able to view a gazebo that stretched out in front of us about 25 feet away. We tried unsuccessfully to see the object again, and finally gave up after about 15 minutes. I don&apos;t really recall the exact moment of the sighting, because it happened over a year ago, but we did immediately tell our family about in when we returned home.

It moved along a ridge of a mountain before it suddenly disappeared.A friend and I were driving from Phoenix to Las Vegas (I believe that the number of the highway is 93). We passed through Kingman, Az and a little later, around 10 pm, I noticed a light moving to our right. I brought it to my friends attention and we watched a single object come out of the east, travelling west over the ridge of a small mountain. There was only one object. It was small and luminous, but not very bright. It looked about three times the size of a regular star. I would have considered it to be a conventional aircraft, had it not been for the way it moved. It was extremely fast. It came in, slowed down somewhat, and then accelerated. Also, its path was a little erratic, not very smooth. After about only five seconds I lost sight of it. It could have disappeared behind the ridge, but to me it looked like it simply vanished. My friend and I are both senior psychology students at Arizona State University. My friend is extremely skeptic with regard to UFOs, but we both agree that it wasn&apos;t an airplane, a helicopter, or a satelite."

There was no haze or bluriness at all. The object was circular with very clear edges. It appeared to have either a raised middle section or a lighted area around the center. It was travelling at tremendous speed and was out of sight in just a couple of seconds. At first I thought it was a reflection but there are no street lights in the area and it was going too fast. It definitely was not an airplane nor a shooting star. It was too sharp and clear for a shooting star and too round for an airplane. Besides, it was going too fast for a plane, even a jet. I have worked at the University of Connecticut since 1961 and have never seen anything like this on any of the roads I travel to get to and from wor!k which is 28 miles from home. I have seen another strange sighting at home in Moosup, CT 06354. I was outside one night with my dog. While she was doing her business, I was looking at the stars.

Saw red-green halo light moving across opposite ridgetop where no road existed.  Traversed ridge at medium speed then stopped, shot up to higher altitude, performed some unusual aerial manuevers before parking in the sky to the SE. It was soon joined by another identical light which also became stationary.  A large, flat, silent dark perfect triangular craft came down between the two lights and proceeded directly by them up the valley. It flew below the top of the ridge and was clearly visible for 30 seconds to a minute before it passed out of sight. The two lights remained where they were and were visible even after daylight.&quot;Dunn sighting&quot; two. The brothers were hunting near Highland Springs and were again sitting in their truck parked in a pullout near the ridgetop facing east, looking out over the valley between them and the opposite ridge.  It was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 mile across. Suddenly a light appeared to the NE over the opposite ridge.  They both thought it was a vehicle at first but having hunted the ridge they knew there was no road there only brush.  At brushtop height and as large as a truck the light progressed along the ridge.  Viewing it with a 20power spotting scope they describe it as a redish-green pulsing light with a clear white light in the middle.they didn&apos;t know what it was but were able to follow it in the scope,(on a tripod), until it reached the end of the ridge to the SE. There it &apos;jumped&apos; back and forth in the sky for a number of minutes. They were unable to keep it in the viewfinder during these &apos;jumps&apos;.  It then became stationary in the sky.  After a while, from the SE and much further away, a second identical light appeared and flew toward the first one, joining it slightly further to the west but also stationary.  The two lights never moved again.  About 04:30 a large flat, dark and perfectly triangular craft came from between the two lights.  At first they thought it was a plane but it came directly down the canyon they were looking out over, from SE to NW, and lower than the opposite ridge.  It flew at a steady crusing speed and made no sound except for the sound of air being pushed, like a hissing breeze. There was a slight haloed gaseous effect coming from the craft that made it difficult to observe with !the scope but didn&apos;t affect the nnaked eye.  A single spotting clear light shone out ahead from the middle underside of the craft.  What appeared to be windows also were apparent.  They both felt that if they could see it, it could see them and they felt like sitting ducks!  However they were not as frightened as the first time they witnessed a sighting. The way it cruised by reminded them of tourists driving through town.  They estimated it at approximately 25 yards wide.  As it passed two red lights, like taillights shone out from the back of the craft.  They waited for the noise but none came.  They stayed at the spot until dawn, viewing the two original bright lights.  These lights remained in exactly the same location and were so bright they could still be observed after daylight.  They finally got tired of watching and drove home.  Two interesting questions are posed by their two sightings in different wilderness locations.  Either they are simply fortunate to have been !in the direct paths, away from civilization, of these vehicles and their sightings are mere coincidences, or the crafts flew by them purposely.  In both cass they were entirely visible to any vehicle at a higher altitude from great distances away.  Also it seems outlandishly coincidental that they just happened on the particular routes of these crafts, when miles of alternative wilderness areas exist. It may also indicate a similar flight pattern of wilderness routing though it seems odd that if this routing exists to decrease sightings, no attempt was made to hide themselves from these two entirely visible observers.  The Dunn&apos;s are totally reputable men, from midland farm families, as down to earth as you can get!  They never even considered the possibility of what they witnessed until it was before them.  they still exhibit some fear as to the identity and purpose of the crafts and have not discussed or reported the events publicly. But they are now watching continually.  D!unn sighting one contains the report of their first sighting as well as their most recent land -based phenomena sighting.  They are taking me to the sights soon. I&apos;m looking forward to it!    wolf"

Object was at time below the horizon in a slight valley just to the west of the Bel-ford theater on IL RT 20 which runs between Rockford and Belvidere.  This object was extremely large and seemed massive-heavy but suspended in the air and wobbling slowly like when you spin a frisbee on a string. spin it slowly and then strike one side.  At the time I told Hynek&apos;s secretary that I thought that the windows measured about 20&apos; x 70&quot;. 20 wide - 70 high.  In retrospect, I underestimated these dimensions.  Probably more like 50 by 300.  At that time John Anderson from Rockford was running for president.  Haven&apos;t heard much about him lately. He lost as a third party candidate.  I am 49 years old now but it is still vivid in our memories.  Most people look us strangely when we mention it.  Neither of us have seen anything similar since.  We also called the Rockford Airport the next day and they said they had seen nothing unusual on rader the night before.  They said it was probably an advertising plane pulling a lighted banner.  Yea, right!  I have never seen an ad plane that makes no sound, flying around at midnight with a lighted sign the size of Commisky Park.  I just gave up trying to convince peiople.

Within 45 minutes we observed 2 fighter jets flying in tight wing formation going in the same direction as the UFO.The ufo appeared to be a slightly flattened egg shape. It was a clear cloudless day, with only con trails from the airplanes in the sky. Sunlight glinted off the top and the bottom.  The object was heading toward was the Malibu, CA area.  The area where we were observing is comprised of hills and agricultral zones.  Because of the cooler temperature, all planes in the sky were leaving con trails, however the ufo did not.  I am unable to estimate how high, or how big the object was, although it did not appear to be all that high, or all that large.  The hill directly beneath the object when it stopped had sheep grazing at the time.  The speed the object moved was amazing, as were the complicated maneuvers it performed.  Approximately 45 minutes later we observed 2 fighter jets flying in close tight wing formation and heading in the direction the ufo had taken.  One of the gentlemen with me if familar with planes and fighter jets as his father was a lifer in the Air Force, and!he spent nearly all of his growing up years on AF bases.  One other interesting point, the ufo was going in the direction of Rockadyne, a company facility that builds and tests rocket engines. That is all I can think of at the moment. I am a scheduler/ dispatcher for a technical service and support department.  My educational back ground is 2 years of college, and working in the Customer Service and Support field for 23 years.  I am interested in ufology, although I am not involved with any ufo groups.  There were 2 men beside myself who saw the ufo.  They are both in the sales field for our company, and other than the gentlemen with the AF background, I am not sure of the complete back ground of the men."

19950101,19970214,"Tucson, AZ",triangle,5-10 minutes,"SUMMARY:  120-140 ft, X 35-40 ft, X 30 ft, triangler craft, metalic colored, 4 lights directly down the center with 2 strobes and 3 very large lights on the backOn or between Dec 27th 1994 and Jan 5, 1996 at 2100 hours, I went out to get my dog in from the back yard of my home, (6350 East Hayne).  He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it&apos;s true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it&apos;s the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can&apos;t stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don&apos;t care who says they don&apos;t.  That includes our goverment."

19970124,19970129,"Alta, UT",other,3 hours plus,"SUMMARY:  A &quot;moving star&quot; similar to a satellite stopped, hovered, and darted around for over 3 hours.  A telescope revealed a round shape.I observed what I took to be a satellite, until it shifted direction, and then stopped.  It was slightly brighter than the brightest stars in the sky, and not an unusual color.  It would hover for awhile, then move, sometimes appearing to spin in circles.  I first looked at my watch at 19:11, after having watched the object for perhaps 10 minutes.The object hovered in basically the same part of the sky for over three hours, at times appearing to drift, and then bring itself back to where it was before.  It often just hovered perfectly still, and looked like a star. It was roughly overhead of Alta, very high, a little  to the northeast.  Witnesses who saw it move included a member of the Alta Fire Department, a dispatcher for the Alta Marshall&apos;s office,And two members of the astronomical society at the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake.  They happened to have a nice 3inch wide telescope, and were photographing the moon.  With a higher powered eyepiece, the telescope showed the object to be pefectly round, with a darker round circle in the center.  I think the telescope was about 12000x, if I recall correctly.  The object was absolutely still in the telescope.I think the image in the telescope was consistent with looking up at the underside of a perfectly round flying saucer.  No lights were apparent on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting light from the sun which gave it the appearance of a star to the naked eye. Conceivably, this was some type of satellite being put into a fixed orbit, except for the erratic motion.  With my arm outstretched, it moved the length of my thumb, at the most.  I would like more information on types of satellites.  Personnel at the Hansen Planetarium weren&apos;t aware of any satellites that can behave like that.

It made no sound and did not disturbe the trees it was very close to.Then a group of lights on the bottom rotated to the back and it rotated away from us. We noticed that we could see the color of the lights reflecting off the clouds overhead. The clouds were very low, almost a fog. It then headed south away from us.I have known my friend for 18 years, and he attends Western Washington University. I hesitated to submit this form, because everyone I have told has not believed.

One window in the center moved down.The round bottom displayed a metallic gold color. She viewed it from30ft.for 5-10 min. before it zig-zagged and shot up into the sky.I was facing north an object appeared to be hovering over a group of power lines in my backyard near a ten foot tall shed. When I saw the UFO, I felt as if I was being watched and I watched for about 5 or 10 minutes. I felt very scared  and I felt as if something drawed me outof my house. When I got outside, I saw this. (drawing will be sent later) I saw the window marked &quot;x&quot;    move open as if something was opening it. The window seemed to move  down like rolling down a car window. Teen states that at 2:15 on 8-20-1996 she was making frozen french fries and she felt drawn to go outside. She states that she never goes around back at night , but something drew  her out thereand when she looked up  she saw an object about 10 feet away  and 10-115ft. above her.&quot; well the object was really low and I saw alot of windows and appeared as if someone or something was opening it. But anyway, I nver believed in UFOs until recently. Anyway, the object was circular and the lights on the !UFO was orange, green, and reddish-orange color, but the bottom was a goldish metallic color which was a round shape. Anyway, I watched the object for a good5 or 10 minutes and then I went inside looked out the window and the object was still there but then it zig-zagged in a pattern and it was really fast and then it was gone! Then I went to bed aat about 2:45, it started about 2:15, &quot; as stated in writing by (name deleted) on August 20,1996. Note: I saw her the morning after she witnessed this and the first words out of her mouth were ,  I saw a UFO in my backyard last night. I have known her for about ten years as a neighborand I coukd tell something had happened to upset her. I sat with her and ner sister in my backyard for the day trying to calm her and asking her to write down what happened and to draw if she could the object. After a long day together she calmed down after talking about her experience. I must include that a Deputy Sheriff had been dispatc!hed to our town to look in a nearby woods after a sighting of 8 UFOsby her brother less than two weeks before. We tried to tell him what happened to her, but he didn&apos;t act interested. He just wanted to let me know he had checked out the woods at my request to the Sheriffs office and found nothing. He advised we find out who owns the woods so no one would possibly file a trespassing complaint on us for entering the woods about a week after the event became known. I checked with our County Courthouse Records and found a number of possible owners. I called each one to ask about ownership. A woman north of town told me the owner. I called the Sheriff&apos;s office back to let them know I had the owners name and then I called to get permission to reenter the woods for my husband to look around. There were some trees down in the woods, but it looked like someone had notched them out before they fell. There is an area in the woods that has a circular patch where no vegetation grows. It is barren. I had my family take pictures while in there , but when the!film was developed some prints  were lost.I still have some pictures of the teen boy standing at the end of the street and pointing to the woods he saw  light up red and where all the Ufo activity took place as described in a report filed to the Nat&apos;l UFO R.C. as having happened on Aug. 7,1996, The reports being filed with the Center for Aug. ,Sept., and Oct. 1996 by me  will include a map and drawing for each sighting as soon as I can redraw the original from my files. I am submitting a video for the Center to review for the events that happened on Oct.18,1996. I am trying to get that tape ready to mail this weekend 1-04-1997 and will include the written report to you as soon as possible using your very handy on-line report form.Thanks so much to all of you there for helping us here in Ohio with all the problems we are encountering here of late in our backyards and over our houses.Take Care all of you and a special thanks goes to Mr Gribble, not Gripple. Please excuse my wro!ng pronunciation of your name. You should have corrected me. Thans not only for the time and trouble to look at and have analyzed the video tapes  I&apos;ve been sending , but for having founded the Center in the first place. I&apos;m only sorry to have been such a troublesome part of your life in 1996, maybe I can help in the future by filing things electronically now. Thanks again to all of you so much for your help and to Mr. Davenport, I ask you to forgive me for calling in at pesky hours of the morning.

We decided to go there because it was very dark and it was basically a large field in which we could park our pickup.  We had binoculars and a mid-size telescope with us.  As we were watching the meteor shower, we all noticed moving, starlike points which changed color from white to red.  There were 3 such objects, and they appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (at least where commercial aircraft would fly).  They were mostly directly above us or at least 3/4 up from the horizon.  We were not certain of their altitude since there were no reference points.  Through binoculars the objects appeared to be executing extremely high-speed maneuvers (looping and passing close to one another) and they could accelerate or turn VERY quickly.  The telescope was impossible to use while viewing the objects because of their speed.  There is no way these were planes, helicopters, meteors, or flyin!g insects like fireflies (there are no fireflies that change color or live west of the Rockies).

I thought it was a plane crashing to the groud a few miles from my home.  It changed angles as it turned and it appeared as a metallic bottom with a glowing orange haze.  At each point there was a bright colored light. As I ran out the front door to witness the crash I saw it quickly change direction and ascend toward the east.  It disappeared from sight at a high rate of speed.  I think it was some weird new stealth like plane or a UFO. I was alone when it happened.

19740801,19970110,"Campbell, CA",triangle,12 seconds,"SUMMARY:  Sighting of a pair of triangular UFO&apos;s over the SF Bay Area,  August 1974In the summer of 1974,  I saw a pair of triangular objects while stargazing with binoculars.  At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it&apos;s been a long time since then,  and I haven&apos;t ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of &quot;triangular UFO&apos;s&quot;, which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of &quot;triangular&quot;UFO&apos;s.  Here&apos;s what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o&apos;clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.  It looked something like this:left (north)-                       .if this diagram doesn&apos;t-             -                .line up, select a fixed-                  -             .font (like courier).

The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I&apos;ve given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.((NUFORC Note:  As the reader probably has noted, the formation did not survive the transfer from our e-mail program to our website.

But I am very good atj udging distance, adn have very good eyesight. I also feel that I am a UFO skeptic even though I am very intrigued. I don&apos;t believe that they were necessarily extraterrestrial space craft, but they were notjust a simple flare or &quot;plasma displacment&quot;.They could have been a number of different things. We have both tried to come up with explinations of the event and truely believe that that would be some what difficult toachieve. The way that they decended was thefact that forced us to come to that conclusion. It was a straight fall. But tookway too long to be a &quot;fall&quot;.

The gas formed a halo appearance and no other lights were visible.But it was bright enough from a long distance to be clearly visible beyond the mine lights glow.It flew to the south west passing over Mt St Helena and then turned directly west toward the ocean.Note:  Almost a year later these two men witnessed another sighting of a completely different craft at another location in Lake County.This sighting lasted almost 5 hours.Additionally only a few months ago,(fall 96), they witnessed a strange phenomena on the ground near the location of the first sighting.Described as a &apos;puddle of soft black metallic shavings, maggot-like but not easily described- moving as if a magnet were being passed over themand seeming to grow before their eyes as if feeding on the landscape.They report it looked like something out of a science fiction movie!It was late morning.

EST. I observed a commercial aircraft at altitude, traveling in a westernly or northwesterly direction.  I was initially attracted to this as the commercial aircraft was trailing a beautiful con trail.  I took my eyes off the aircraft several times as I was driving, but I continued to glance up at it intermittantly, and suddenly I observed another object following behing the first aircraft at what I would estimate at under 1 mile, although I cannot be certain of exact distance.  First observed second object as it began to glow brightly as if the sunlight were glaring off of it.  Second object appeared behind and just outside of con trail at what appeared to be same altitude and speed, and traveling in same direction.  Found it somewhat puzzeling that there was no sun glare off of first aircraft, and also that there was no con trail from the second object even though it appeared to be at same a!ltitude and airspeed as the commercial aircraft.  Also, this second aircraft seemed to be following much closer than any I&apos;ve ever witnessed within the local flight corridors.  With the recent events concerning military aircraft closing on commercial aircraft from behind and triggering the commercial aircrafts anti-collision warning system, and it struck me as being rather odd that these two were reletively near one another in flight to not have such systems activate.  I observed the second object for about 10 or 12 seconds as it appeared to reflect the sunlight, it then stopped reflecting light and the glare stopped, and I continued to see an obhject but could not determine shape.  Within a few seconds of the glare from the sunlight reflecting off the second object had ceased, I lost sight of the 2nd object.  I continued to observe the first aircraft and it&apos;s con trail as it flew off into the distance.  The best I can estimate, the first aircraft was approximately over or nea!r Gettysburg at the time I made this observation.  I&apos;m sorry to say that I did not observe any unusual flight characteristics such as phenomenal or unusual speed or course deviations.  When I stated a commercial aircraft I was inferring larger sized, it may have been a large military aircraft I suppose.  I just found it unusual that  one of two objects that were apparently at the same altitude and speed, one reflecting sun and one not, and with one apparently following the other, one with a con trail and one without, was a bit &quot;unusual&quot; especially considering there relative distance of seperation!  It&apos;s probably nothing, but thought you&apos;d like to see the report, perhaps someone else has reported something else that will make further sense to someone there."

From her vantage point, they were on paths that would cross, or the aircraft might even have been on collision courses. Suddenly, and peculiarly, the sound emanating from the helicopter ceased!!  Then, she looked back at the other object, which she had taken to be a twin-engine aircraft, and it had a different appearance.  It now looked like a collection of what looked like &quot;slivers of metal in the sky.&quot;These objects, apparently several of them, were &quot;flipping and doing formation flying.&quot;  They did not appear to be going fast, their (angular) velocity slower than a commercial airplane, for example.

It hovered overhead then slowly moved to the right, then down, then leftand then up, to form a complete square.  It hovered some more than shot diagonally up and out of sight.I was 14 years old at the time.  It was Christmastime, cause I rember sitting next to our tree watching television.  It was dusk, so there was still some daylight left.  My father was sitting in our kitchen watching the birds outside.  I heard him yell for me to come see something.  I went into the kitchen and sat next to my Dad.  He then pointed out thewindow, up into the sky.  &quot;Watch that silver disc up there,&quot; he said.  The objectI looked at was not exactly round, it was kind of a cross between round and oval.  It was really high up but you could still see it clearly.  The color of it was silver, not unlike the way some jets look today.   As I watched the silver disc, it slowly moved to the right and stopped.  Next it moved slowly down and stopped.  Now it moved directly left and stopped.  And the last move it made was up and stopped.   At the time, I don&rsquo;t remember being really amazed by it, I just thought it was&quot;kinda neat&quot; is how I think I put it then! (chuckle).  As we watched the silver disc just hover in the one spot, it suddenly shot really fast diagonally up and was gone!  Later that night, after I had gone to bed, something woke me up.  I didn&rsquo;tknow what, but I had this strange sensation (not unlike dreaming).  I was being drawn to the back of the house.  So I walked slowly to our back door and pulled the shade on the window.  Normally what I would see is the silhoutte of our backyard trees against the streetlamp.  What I saw instead was a hugh, bright, white, light!   The light was so bright it was blinding!   I was suddenly startled, like waking up from a dream. I hurtled the shade down and ran back to my bedroom!  It took awhile, but I finally fell back to sleep and to my knowledge, nothing else happened.  My Father owned his own agency.  Me, I was a sophmore at Huntington Park High School at the time.

19970510,19970512,"Provo/Orem/Salt Lake City, UT",light,2 mins,"Summary : Saw a white yellowish light performing vertical and horizontial maneouvers in the northern sky.  At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously.At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white &apos;star&apos; with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large &apos;star&apos; before.  It didn&apos;t twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn&apos;t circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the &apos;star&apos;.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the &apos;white&apos; light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; position to the &apos;center of the clock&apos; position&apos; and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; position. in a fraction of a second.  There was no gradient climb from the &apos;9 o&apos;clock&apos; to the &apos;12 o&apos;clock&apos; positions, even in the other movements mentioned below.It remained for several seconds in the &apos;12&apos; position, and performed a vertical descent to the &apos;6 o&apos;clock&apos; position.  (No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the &apos;3 o&apos;clock&apos; position.At one point in its movements, from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the &apos;9&apos; to the &apos;center&apos; positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half."

No lights, no sound, just a monstrous huge black vehicle.  My impression was it was like a rectangle.  We only new it was there because it was blocking out the stars (there were no clouds that night), that is what drew our attention to it, blocking out a large section of the sky and it&apos;s movement.  I have no idea how high it might have been although it was at least above 3500 feet.  Myself and my associates were all standing together talking when one of the guys said what is that coming from the &quot;North?&quot;  We all looked and then could make it out, it was awsome.  We were all &quot;on duty police officers&quot; taking a break in our favorite spot where the ambient lights of the city didn&apos;t block the stars.  The north valley is known for it&apos;s clear nights and fantastic views of the night sky.  If we hadn&apos;t been taking that break and watching the sky while we talked we would never have seen this object.  And no, I have not said anything before this time.  We all looked at each other and basically said &quot;what the hell was that thing!&quot;We were all Chico or Butte County Deputies at the time who often worked the same areas of the county/city together.  This location we were standing in was on a sight rise or hill on the SE side of town, leading up to the foothills of the Sierras.  It was away from public view where we could park four or five police cars, drink some coffee and relax for a few minutes without scrutiny or criticism from passing motorists; and the sky gazing was superb from that location. We were all veteran cops as well as military veterans.  I was a combat air-defense control officer in the military and have somewhat of a good idea of what anything man made can accomplish in the air.  This was not anything that we could possibly have built.  I don&apos;t know why I thought it was a rectangle, but I just had that feeling about it.  Whatever shape it was, it was huge!"

It lit up the yard for a moment --not brightly ... but, more so than moonlightor fireworks.  Slightly less than lightning.The fact that it moved so smoothly and quicklymade me think it was a shooting star ... a closeone because of the &quot;thickness&quot; of the trail.But, it shifted course a little, heading morenorthwest than west, which I found odd.

Structure of object not visible, only rotating lights.Departed Salt Lake Airport by car at 2200 MDT on I-80 westbound at 75 mph toward Wendover, Nv. At 2305 driver saw what appeared to be two close, low flying aircraft, one seen as two lights and the other seen as one light approaching quickly from S.E.  Driver told passenger to look up to see jets.  No noise or visual above so driver looked to S. E. again to see the three lights now flying parallel to vehicle.  Now three lights could be seen to be rotating with more lights being added  from the one and the other two disappearing.  The lights were on the outer circumference of a disk and were rotating.  Rotation was approx. three revs during a 30 second visual.  After about 30 seconds, and into the third rev, while only one light was visible, this light went out and although we looked and looked for the lights, they were gone.  We never saw another thing.  I called HAFB to check on night aircraft operations and determined the 388 TFW was in the general area that night.  I also !checked with the Salt Lake Airport Authority and found that a movie was being filmed, using a helicopter with a camera pod below, outside Tooele, Ut., approximately 80 miles west of our sighting.

Then a few minutes later back to the bright ball of light. I watched for about 25 minutes altogether.  Finally it turned back into the orange ball and quickly got smaller and smaller until it disappeared about 15 seconds later.

At approximately 2115, I was looking up at helicoptors that were moving around the river and immediate airspace over the city near the Arch.  At about that time, I happened to notice an object, moving at an extremely rapid rate through the sky, almost directly overhead. The duration of the event was so short that I thought that it might have been some kind of meteorite or something similar.  The object was bluish-green in color, like a streaking fireball in shape, and moving east to west at a speed much faster than any aircraft, flare, fireworks, or shooting star/meteorite I have ever seen before.  The light gave off no observable sound, nor was there some kind of sonic boom or anything of the sort. I commented on it to my friend who missed it and wasn&apos;t interested in my observation.  I overheard others in the crowd in my immediate area comment on the light, so I&apos;m pretty sure that there are others who can comment on seeing the light.  I am writing this, only because I happened to see a report in the news today about a similar series of observations across the river in Illinois."

No sound except wind rushing past.  NE direction and never swerved, swayed, turned or changed speed. Light shown on ground, briefly.While coming home from working the 4-12 shift as a Police Officer, I noticed an &quot;airplane&quot; flying in the direction in which I was traveling.  After driving a few miles, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still on it&apos;s course. It should have been far away by that time. I was curious, but soon forgot about it. As I was turning onto the final rode that leads to my housing plan, I noticed that the &quot;airplane&quot; was still there.The PLan where I lived was on the highest point in the area and as I got to the Plan, my visibility was practically unlimited except for some trees.  I could see the &quot;airplane&quot;better at this point and I suspected that it was a helicopter because of the slow speed.  The &quot;helicopter&quot; displayed a search type light at the ground and I thought it was a medical helicopter looking for a landing zone.  I&apos;ve seen helicopters do this in my capacity as a Police Officer, and I was worried that someone might have been badly injured in my neighborhood. While thinking these thoughts, the &quot;helicopter&quot; turned off the search light and continued in a straight line heading directly toward my housing plan.I hurried my vehicle to a point where I figured the &quot;helicopter&quot; would pass over, and I turned off my head lights. Then I shut off my engine and got out of the vehicle to get a better look at the &quot;helicopter&quot;. When I got out of the vehicle and looked up in the sky, I noticed that I was not looking at a helicopter, airplane, blimp or anything I could recognize.  I was looking at a triagular shaped craft with a light at each point, smaller lights were dotted underneath as this was my point of reference, and no strobe lights like a commercial aircraft would have.  The object made no sound, although it seemed to me that I could hear wind rushing past. Faintly, albeit.  The altitude was very low, a few hundred feet or less, and the speed was radically slow. The object was huge.the night was crystal clear and warm, and I saw it but can&apos;t believe what I saw.  It has taken me this long to report it.  I told this story to Mike Frizzell of the Enigma Project and he told me to write to you."

I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.  I immediately looked at that area with my naked eye, as did my husband, but we saw nothing.  Approximately 10 minutes later,my husband was viewing M42 with a 15-mm eyepiece.  He, too, witnesses a small &quot;yellow-orange&quot; light, traveling at the same apparent speed - although he describes its movement as &quot;erratic&quot;.Again, our attempts at immediate naked-eye confirmation yield nothing.  We continue to observe M42 in the hopes that we will see another light.  This time, we alternate: oneviews through the scope while the other observes M42 with the naked eye - at this point, we have ruled out satellites (&quot;erratic&quot; movement of the second light) and insects flying in front of our lens(none observed with naked eye - lights are in focus through scope - lights are visually quite small).  Approximately 10-15 minutes later (19:45), my husband is viewing through the scope,and I&apos;m watching Orion like a hawk.  With my naked eye, I witness a white light, again visually star-sized, &quot;come out&quot; of the bottom star of Orion&apos;s sword, travel in a small curve or hook, and then travel at a visualangle of about 45 degrees.  It moves in a straight line until it is approximately under the right star of the belt, and it simply &quot;turns off&quot;.  This takes about 2 seconds.The previous night, my brother and his friend were over observing M42 and Betelgeuse (19:00) and reported seeing &quot;shooting stars&quot; through the telescope.  My husband and I are amateurastronomers, and have seen meteors, satellites, airplanes - all of the &quot;reasonable&quot; explanations.  These three lights do not fit in with those explanations.  We have attempted over the past few months to figure this out, but cannot.  I can only say that we both have had an unshakably strange feeling about these observations, and I decided that posting this sighting might bring other observers of this phenomenon to us."

Object was round and did not move.Driving West Bound on 164th St SW (6th Ave W cross street)in Martha Lake area of Lynnwood, WA and noticed a bright round object in the setting sun light.  It looked far off in the distance like out over the Pacific Ocean.  It looked large.  It seemed odd that it was large enough to block enough of the setting sun light to be visible and to aparently twinkle (emit its own light).  Intreagued I watched it intently.  It did not move relative to the horizon or the setting sun.  I then turned south on 13th Ave W past ELDEC (Crane) Electronics and lost sight of the object behind trees.  I then kept driving and eventually got to the Target store at Alderwood Mall (184th and Alderwood Mall Blvd in Lynnwood) and the object was still there and had not moved in the sky and still looked the same in terms of the light being emitted and the ability of the object to be seen through the brightness of the setting sun.  I got out of my truck and observed the object for approximately 2 minutes! and said wow it just isn&apos;t moving.  I went into the Target Store at 9:22 pm and the object was still there.

Injuries to three members of the party include symptoms similar to slight radiation poisoning,  burns and scarring,  massive headaches,  personality changes,  massive tinnitus to three witnesses which commenced spontaneously and at the same approx. time.  All  attempts to investigate the incident have come to a dead-end in Australia.  This includes approaches to the Services, C.S.I.R.O, academia generally and to many of the local UFO and Paranormal Organisations.   I would appreciate any assistance forthcoming from the U.S.A. or any other reputable source to allow me to continue my investigations."

19971216,19971217,"Allison Park, PA",hexagon,3 to 4 minutes,"Summary : A long hexagon shaped object crossed the sky just north of Pittsburgh,PA, with heading northeast and moving at a speed that I estimate to be around 50 knots.I saw the object cross the sky on Tuesday night(12/16) at around 7:55 PM EST. It was dark outside but the sky was complete clear except for stars(The moon was still below the horizon). I was looking out the window when I saw what appeared at first to be a low flying airplane, but the shape was odd. As it came closer I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane so I grabbed a pair of binoculars from my closet and headed outside to take a look. By this time the object was coming directly over my house. It was a long hexagon shaped object with 6 large lights and several smaller illuminations. The two lights at the end points of the object were red, while the four lights that made up the center of the object were white. In the inner surface of the object were what looked like a smaller ring of lights, but the were very dim. These lights on the object were different from what a normal aircraft lights look like. First off, they did not blink. Second, the appeared diffused like the light from a LED, not the bright bulb type lights that you would see on a airplane. While the object was at a fairly high altitude I was able to see the actual body of the object. It was definitely a solid mass, hexagon in shape. I couldn&apos;t make out anything on the surface but it appeared to be a dark grey or black. The total time I could see the object was about 4 minutes. It didn&apos;t seem to be moving very fast but it velocity and direction were constant. The object also made almost no noise. I live 25 miles from Pittsburgh Intl. Airport so a lot of plane fly over head at a fairly frequent pace and you can hear the engine drone from miles away, but this thing made only a slight hum even as it flew away. If you would like a more in-depth description or drawing of what I saw let me know by e-mail and I can call or fax your office. I don&apos;t know if that makes any sense or not, or if you have had any other reports from the part of the country. I don&apos;t know what it was I saw but I can say for almost certain that it was not a airplane and not a blimp."

The light disappeared into the sky after about two minutes.Back in 1990,  I was going home around 11:00 P.M. and witnessed a police car stopping a car while I was waiting for a signal light to turn green.  As I passed the police car,  I noticed a bright light above the police car at 60 degree angle and coming from a western direction.  At first,  I though it was a police chopper serving as a back up to the police car.  However, after looking at it for a couple of seconds I did not notice any characterisitcs of a chopper.  In other words,  the police chopper was not doing its typical circular patterns that is common to see when looking at a cop chopper, and it was not shining it&apos;s strong bright light on any thing on the ground.  A block later I got home and got out of my Jeep to find two neighbors looking at the object.  However, minutes later the bright light disappeared into the night sky.

At about a 45 degree angle we observed a flight of ???? moving from left to right in a formation.Upon entering my driveway I observed some objects moving across the northern sky from left to right at about a 45 degree angle. They appeared to be in formation. Some of the were trailing sparks...looked kind of like a childs sparler used on the 4th of July. There must of been 6 to 10 objects.

I was taking the dogs out before bed (I&apos;mnot exactly sure what the time was, around 2100 I think)and I looked to the north and saw 5 very bright white lightsin a triangle (or V) formation moving really fast southeast.Then they broke formation.  The light in the back and below(from my angle) slowed up.  Now I started to wonder what I waslooking at because most planes would keep formation or at leastbreak formation completely.  Never saw a plane with lights asbright as these also.  The group seemed to rotate 90 degrees tothe left and go a little south of Mingus mountain.  I was suprisedthat I couldn&apos;t hear them so I listened harder.  I did hear thesound of a faint rustling in the sky, not like a jet, but of somethinmoving extremely fast through the air.  The sound was a ways behindthem also and did seem to follow them.  I then started lookingaround at two other planes flying.  Sessna&apos;s by the sound andspeed of them.  Also by the red flashing lights.  I saw the lights fadeinto the distance and I headed back inside.  My first notion was whathas our government got up there?  New stealth technology?  Then whythe lights?  I also thought the lack of sound could have been some formof some top secret frequency cancellation system that the governmentis checking out.  But still, why the lights?It didn&apos;t hit home that these could possibly be UFO&apos;s until I heardpeople talking about it on Friday.  Then I knew I had seen somethingthat was definately unexplainable.  At least by me.It was definately not the comet, flair, balloon, or any other thing ofthat nature.Anyway, feel free to call if you want more information"

I was sitting in my patrol car at about 0300 hrs., when I noticed movement in the sky to the north. What I saw was a very large, triangular shaped object with off-white lights at each corner slowing moving from north to southeast. The craft could have only been maybe 300-500 feet high and there was absoulutely no sound coming from it. I watched in dis-belief and tried to make sense of it. I thought about the Stealth bomber, but wouldn&apos;t that at least make some sound? I could tell that this object was solid, as the middle of it darkened out the clear sky behind it. The lights seemed erie, not bright, but not dull, and they were steady, but also seemed to flicker. It took maybe two minutes for the craft to pass over me and as it began leaving my field of vision, I finally realized that I needed to follow it. I followed it for about another two minutes as it travelled southeast out of my city limits and Im not sure why, but I decided to stop my &quot;pursuit&quot;. I also am not sure why I didn&apos;t tell anyone about this incident until fairly recently, when I told my wife. I&apos;m a 15 year police veteran, who has seen alot of weird stuff late at night, but I&apos;ve never seen anything like this.

19970924,19971202,"Huffman, TX",teardrop,5-10 sec.s,"Summary : Large object seen running N. of FM 1960 bearing W.  It was about 1,000 through 4,000&apos; feet in altitude.  Looked to be between 5-8mi away.I was driving west on FM 1960 about 5 mi.s east of FM 2100.  I had been working on a car and was at this time test driving it.  The event occoured at 20:47.  I was driving and looking at the stars since it was a CLEAR night. (visibility only distorted by minor upper- atmosphere turbulence)  I then noticed the object.  It caught my eye because of it&apos;s intense brightness.  I stared at it allowing myself to accuire a good sight of the object.  It possessed the likeness of a comet.  It was shaped as a &quot;tear-drop&quot;.  It turned out a tremendous light.  Even brighter than the moon on it&apos;s most radiant nights.  It&apos;s light was pure white with no distortion apparent.  There is a tall radio antenna with warning strobe lights situated on it; however, this is not at all what I witnessed.  The object, though described as a comet had none of a comet&apos;s properties; i.e.  A tail, haze behind the comet, small size and the other distinguishing features of a comet.  The object not only very brigh! t but also seemed to be very low (between 1,000 to 3,000&apos;) and able to acchieve great speed.  The object was headed west on about a 280 degree heading.   Although I was driving between 75-80mph it seemed to pull away from me unlike anything I have ever seen.  I attempted to try and keep up with it but I lost sight of it  when The trees alongside the road blocked my vision of the object.   Make note I live near an airport and I used to live near an Air Force base.  I know how planes fly and I know the acceleration an airplane can obtain.  But as this object was 5-8mi.s out.  For an airplane to accelerate such as this thing did it and to dissapear from my field of view it would have to have an extrodinary engine, acceleration rate, and exaust hider (afterburner, it would be needed if this were even to be tried).  I have NEVER seen such a feat.  This event escapes my mind.  I have been made fun of and discredited even by almost everyone, including friends.  Anything you could tel! l me would be GREATLY appreciated!!!! I have tried to find out if something was going on that night, plane problem, U.S. Military trial of new plane but nobody has said anything.  If you have anymore questions I can be E-Mailed at((address deleted)) I would like to try and resolve this matter. I am a very observant person. When I observed the object I was trying to remimber details of it.  I studied it closely in the short time that it remained in my vision. Thank You, ((Name deleted))"

He said there were some in the 70&apos;s and a couple of officers reported them.  They were flown down to Washington. And when they  came back they reported NOTHING.  My ex partner who worked for a time in West Ellicott, NY, went up to a golf course after reports and found a scorched part.  There was a pond nearby and all the fish were floating on top."

19771228,19970614,"Worcester, MA",disk,15 sec,Summary : We observed a 60-80 ft diameter metalic craft (disk shaped- flat on top) move by us at 70 ft high &amp; 100 yards of dista-nce.The craft made no sound and was moving at approx 10 mph. The outside surface had a metalic appearence. Much like stainless steel. The underneath had many interweaved objects. They looked like pipes or metal counduits. The craft was moving over a parking lot that was illuminated by bright lights. The light intensity was magnified by the snow that was on the ground. The craft continued to move away at tree top level and move out of our line of sight. I have never seen a UFO since this incident in 1977.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

19951127,19970704,"Lyons, CO",other,20 minutes,"Summary : Hole (50 feet by 30 feet) opens up on hill side.  Light streams from it along with motor noise.  Closes again and leaves no sign of existence.The following event has been something I have kept quiet about for almost one and  a half years.  It was not until I read an account on this site about a UFO sighting east of my area on 11-27-95 that I realized it might be UFO related.The  phenomena occurred on the night of 11-27-95.  At that period my wife and I would often walk around the hills of our small mountain town during the evening.   It was near 8 PM when we were ascending up a small gulch to the NE of our town.  I happened to look up the east hill slope and saw a large black area.  At that moment a light came on  in the area: it was a large hole in the ground about 50 feet long and maybe 30 feet wide.  It was slightly above us and about 170 feet away.   There was for a short time the sound of a motor, like that of an air-compressor.  The sound was a steady &lsquo;puut puut puut puut&rsquo; like a one cylinder engine.  The light illuminated the sides of the hole (actually it was very bright) and we saw the fresh surface of broken rock around the hole&apos;s sides.  As we continued to ascend the gulch I told my wife that it was probably the site of a new house being built.  I figured that it was a hole for a basement.  The light was bluish-white like that seen in !the older mercury vapor lights.  The motor sound only lasted a minute and once the light went off only come on again.  I assumed that the owner was in the hole doing work.  Other than wondering how such a hole was dug into solid sandstone I gave no special thought to the event.  I almost decided to walk over and look in but decided not to since the owner might not want me on his land.  We ended up seeing the hole from several heights (both from below and slightly above) and several angles as we walked on towards home.  Several months passed.  On 3-10-96 it was a fine Spring morning and my wife and I decided to go up and see how the new house was coming along.  As we topped the rise above the small gulch all that met our eyes was a smooth hillside covered with old weeds and grass with a few small stones.  Nothing appeared to have been moved for decades!  As a child I had read about such things, but that type of phenomena was one kind that I had refused to believe possible."
19790601,19971207,"Alameda, CA",disk,three minutes,This is a very delayed report: While stationed at the Alameda Naval air station in California. It was I believe early in 1979 when their was much publicity concerning the NASA &quot;Sky Lab&quot;. Much information was being given out via the media concerning the sky lab and it decaying orbit. It was being reported to the public by several radio and TV stations that sometime with a few days skylab would eventually fall to earth. I recall overhearing this on a late news segment. The broadcast also indicated that it would possible to observe the sky lab as it passed overhead. They news gave a general direction in which to look and a general time also. My now ex-wife and a friend went outside to attempt to watch for the ill fated sky lab. It was a very clear and calm night. There was no wind or other noises to speak of. We were watching the sky for about 20 seconds when from the northwest moved right overhead was a giagantic object. So large it covered the entire sky above us. The object was very dark possible either black (or it seemed to not reflect light). or opague. It had some very small dim white light placed in random order around its hull. It was completely silent. We heard no engine noise or any other noise for that matter. The object rotated approx 90% as it &quot;hovered&quot; slowly. it then moved off over the hoizon. As the object moved off we then observed the &quot;sky lab&quot; pass overhead. Which resembled a regular satalite as it passed
19971114,19971117,"Olympia, WA",formation,10-20 seconds,"Summary : Cluster of lights moving from West to East (I think) very slowly.  Similar to shooting stars, but much slower.I was driving on a well-trafficked road in Olympia (Division St.)  I believe this road runs North-South (I would have been driving North), although I could be wrong .  I noticed a cluster of lights in the sky, all of varying size, and all larger than stars.  There were more than five and less than a dozen, but I&apos;m unsure of the exact count.  If I was in fact driving north, then the lights would have been moving from West to East.  I was not the only one on the road at the time, and I know other drivers witnessed the event as well, because many were slowing down and craning their necks.  I also noticed some pedestrians pointing toward the sky in the direction of the lights.  I watched the lights for 10 to 15 seconds before they arced toward the ground as if they were falling, and disappeared behind some trees.  All the lights appeared to be moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  I am unsure of their color, although my initial guess would be white.  Also, my firs! t thought was that the lights were not aircraft lights, as in lightbulbs or some other electrically-produced lights, but were instead produced by flames or heat (which is why I compared them to shooting stars rather than planes)."

19970503,19970506,"Stafford, TX",other,10 seconds,"Summary : Through telescope,observed amoeba or translucent object containing lights of blue red and white.Seemed distorted though could not see through itObserving Mars through C-8 telescope and 30mm eye piece when an object came into view.  I immediately thought it was odd and tracked it through the eye piece.  It must have been heading roughly due north since I only adjusted declination to track it. It appeared to be like an &quot;amoeba&quot; containing lights of red, blue and white.  It seemed there was distortion and the lights varied in position as if mildly bouncing yet constrained by individual points and still all part of the same object.  That described distortion was nothing like atmospheric and since I spotted the polar ice cap and terrain colors in a town near Houston, it seems odd.  I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and allowed my wife to look into the eye piece as I spun the declination knob at an appropriate speed.  Apparently I had only captured part of the object since she described the end section I had described plus a disc of lights numbering a dozen, half circle of red and half blue with two white lights!opposite each other outside of the circle.  Further, there were two fainter lights inside the circle and one outside towards the trailing section.  She reported sharper detail in some of the lights.  I moved back to view and had lost the object.  I scanned and found nothing.  We looked to the sky and saw nothing.  There was no noise.  We only got a few seconds each to look at it.  I&rsquo;m sorry I let my wife look since I may have been able to track it longer and get a better look.  I spent the rest of the evening tracking airplanes and could not get the same results.  I later heard of sightings like this with terms like &quot;jellyfish&quot; and &quot;translucent&quot; which prompted me to report that I think I&rsquo;ve seen the same thing.

AT FIRST I THOUGH I SAW A BLIMP WITH LIGHTED ADVERTISING (THE KIND THAT IS COMPUTERIZED) OFF IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE CLEARLY. A UFO WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND. BUT AS I STARED AT IT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS  ITSTARTED COMING DOWN TOWARD ME  FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED JUST IN FRONT OF ME  ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SAUCER SHAPE AND IT  WAS SILENT, IT WAS GOLD AND THE CENTER OF IT  LOOKED LIKE REVOLVING MIRRORED PANELS THAT NOW I WOULD SAY WERE SOLAR COLLECTORS BUT BACK THEN I HAD NO IDEAL WHAT SOLAR POWER WAS.

I DO NOT KNOW IF THE GUN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ITS INTEREST IN ME BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN  THE REASON.

I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY BEINGS FROM OUTER SPACE COULD TRAVEL SUCH A VAST DISTANCE BUT MAYBE IT&apos;S JUST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION.

We were hoping to see a clear night so we could later come back and photograph the comet.We drove out to the airport farthest from town. The road going in is dirt, and scary, but he grew up here, where I am from the east coast of the states. To me, it was extremely dark out, even with the clear sky.When we arrived at the final part of the road into the airport, we were facing an south easterly direction. In front of us in the sky, were some objects flying from east to west, as best I could tell.I asked my husband to stop, and we got out and watched them fly just under mars and disappear. Later I discovered he had seen two objects closer to the horizon, flying west to east, and flying in a closer formation than what I saw. They were orange in color, and round in shape, but also very far away.They were also flying to fast to be the usual satellite, and too high up to be a plane.I&apos;d seen a light like that last year while looking up at the comet of 1996, while at a pit stop, so I didn&apos;t think much of it.There is a light at the actual airport that didn&apos;t give us very good viewing of the comet, so we drove back onto the road where we could see. We looked around, and decided to go back home for the camera as picture taking would be excellent, and saw a car comingtowards us. He started up the car, and we took off to home, when out of my window, facing mars, I saw the light returning from the west...just one. I asked him to stop again, I see it I said. As soon as I said it, the object turned straight towards usand I started to scream to him, oh my God, it&apos;s coming at us! They&apos;re coming for us! I was so scared, and it seemed to fly from a high altitude to a lower one, at which point I began to get very afraid, and I started to yell at it to go away, that we didn&apos;t want it here, and it couldn&apos;t take us.By the time he had stopped and turned off the car, the object was already speeding away up into the sky, and as he jumped out of the car, I saw the last of it disappear.It happened so quickly, and I was so afraid that we went home to calm down a bit....he still wanted a picture of the comet, and I wasn&apos;t about to stay home alone, so I went with him, and we saw nothing, probably because we were prepared with a camera this time!Just this past weekend, a friend of ours said they saw something similiar flying over Hinton, around three am, when he was driving back from Edmonton.I also note that an earthquake, unusual for this area, happened the morning before our sighting, and was a 4.2 (?) located just southeast of Jasper. I reported this to a an association up here called AUFORA, but I haven&apos;t heard anything from them. We also checked the flight log at the airport when we went back, andthere was no flight recorded, although there was a plane landed from out of town, and a few unoccupied cars.My husband and I are 30 and 24 repectively, and lead fairly normal lives. Both of us have art degrees, and are planning our first business venture as I write this."

It veered, in a wavering motion as if seeing it through heat, from side to side along its flight path, growing brighter then going dim or off at the apex of its pendular movement, then reappearing to the other side of its flight path as it grew bright again.  The movement along the path was reminiscent of a butterfly&apos;s erratic path, but this wasn&apos;t erratic. The four light panels/spots were also similar to a butterfly&apos;s in that the forward two were slightly larger or brighter than the rear two.  The object came from the east, continued west, and eventually veered to the N/NW.  This occured on a completely cloudless night at approximately 2335.  The sighting only lasted as long as it took the object to pass.  The speed required to continually make the turns it was making was what really caught my eye as not being any typical craft. No flying object in my experience flies or lights up like that one did. over; perhaps 5 minutes at most.  My best guess as to its velocity would place it between 200-300kts.

I thought it was my eyes but my wife and two kids saw it too.

We were with a tour to see the event of Haley&apos;s comet leaving earth that day. It was too hazy to see the comet,so we watched the clear sky overhead. Lights started to appear &amp; move at great speed in all directions &amp; angles. We counted at least 30 or more. It was like play, as there was no pattern to moves. They cavorted all around each other. This lasted 1 hour. Just before dawn,about 5 am, one craft broke away &amp; swooped down towards us at great speed.  It did a pass over our heads &amp; disappeared into the dawn sky very fast. It showed us a definate round flat disc as it came close. It appeared like a celebration at the exact time of the comet&apos;s last view from earth. It was awesome. The observers were the Tour leader, myself a registered nurse &amp; another registered nurse. I have observed other ufo displays similar to this, but have never seen the disc so clearly or low.

Prior to the event I had said to myself that I travel this section of road when going to work but this was a different time of day. Felt very alert during event , as if taking a college final exam.The event lasted more than 4 seconds because I did so much thinking while it was happening. Estimate 14 seconds based on all my thoughts. I remember thinking during the event that this light was from a star that had been engineered by intelligent  life to improve the quality of light above the quality of sunlight. Just thinking this takes 3 or 4 seconds. My nephew was 15 years old and never had any dreams he could remember. His first dream he ever remembered was when he was about 23. I slept well that night. I am baffled by the event. It isn&apos;t logical. When I drive I sometimes look off the road for 2 or 3 seconds. 4 seconds would be a little dangerous and that is why I feel the event took 4 seconds. The light came on and ! went off instantly. My nephew&apos;s feet were positioned such that his toes were slightly pointing towards the toes of the opposite foot. His heels were touching his seat. This knowledge takes time. Also,  I spent at least 7 seconds trying real hard to see any shadow. I was aware that I could not see through the windshield but wasn&apos;t scared."

19950519,19970419,"Glendale, CA",triangle,1:30,"Summary : Girlfriend and I saw three red lights forming a triangle shape moving north. My first thought, Helicopter, but no sound was heard, from anything, when I think about it.approx (3) white smaller lights traveling with it. I&apos;m starting to wonder if we were looking at something that , maybe..droped us off?I know how that sounds. This is gut feeling purely.First, this is all in retrospect, accuacy would require meeting with ex-girlfriend due to my lack of memory regarding anything prior to that sight.Sholl Canyon Park, top of Glenoaks Blvd, in Glendale, CA. A park is there where we would go to spend time  together, ie, the view..a couple thing. I recall being in the middle of the street with her, walking uphill, it seems we both recognized it at the same time.  Three points of lights (all red) forming a triangle shape.  We were walking up hill maybe eastbound  facing the mountains, Mt Wilson to be more accurate.  What got our attention was my saying, &quot;shsss, I can&apos;t hear anything&quot;  Approx; (3) other white lights were in it&apos;s immediate vacinity. I say approx, because the Burbank Glendale skies are always lit up considering the Burbanks airport. My closest comparison would be this description. I though maybe it was three different helicopters flying in a triangle formation.  Being that the lights were lower that the top of Mt wilson, that tells me it was very close ( a few miles if that) Only no blinking lights that usually gives us a human identification. I don&apos;t know if yo!u could see through the center   because it was the same color as the backround mountains, which is black. Anyway we both stood like dazed children, lost in the middle of the street. And watched it move slowly north untill it looked like it vanish behind Burbanks city lights. not once did we here anything we could associate with what we know is in our skies.  And for some reason I dismissed it and labled it three helicopters., because if it wasn&apos;t three different light sources generating that triangular or greater than sign &quot; &lt; &quot;  tilt that about 90 degrees, so that the bottom light is where the rear propeller would be a single craft. If it wasn&apos;t 3 choppers, then it was truly massive in my eyes. No sound what so ever, no wind no traffic, no nothing but us talking and saying &quot;look at that!&quot; &quot;what is that&quot;? &quot;shhh, let me listen&quot; In retrospect, I wonder, is it a valid possibility, ...ok, hear it go..that we were looking at something that dropped us off?..I&apos;m not mental or at lea!st no ones labled me that, yet. I say this because, we simply did not have the excitement that I feel now. It&apos;s like remembering a faint dream, or just residue of a dream. I need to speak to my ex-girlfriend, (Sandie) I know she remembers it. She said &quot;it my first  sighting&quot;"

While the others were still inside I looked up at the stars for no particular reason. In the northwest sky, just above the big dipper I noticed about 6 orange amber dots in a V formation moving north above the big dipper. I told the others &quot;hey come check this out&quot;. One dot in the V seemed to be moving in towards one leg then back out, yet keeping pace with the formation. We moved to the backyard to get a better look. As this formation started to fade it seemed to rotate into a circle formation just before disappearing. The formation definitely seemed as though it was very far away (not in our atmosphere), and possibly leaving our planet. I have seen shooting stars and satellites many times before. This was not one of them."

It was very visible against the Superstition Mountains. It moved slowly from north to south and back again in what appeared to be a ric-rac pattern. It was quite large, I agree with the others who put their arm up and measured with a closed fist. It appeared triangular in shape, I related it to a &quot;squashed&quot; pyramid. I saw three very bright white lights, one in each corner and one at the top of the  &quot;pyramid&quot;.  In the center was a very, very bright pulsating red light, bigger in circumference than the three white lights. I would describe the white lights as three powerful strobe lights. We watched the object for several minutes and we amazed that something that large could move so gracefully! and so silently. We could hear no sound at all.

At first it was a small orange body giving me the impresion that I was looking at another meteor but the object just got larger and brighter, after seeing the object grow in size and brightness it continued to travel across the sky with a slight wobble in it path (like viewing a object through hot air). This wobble lasted for about 30 seconds then it continued to travel in a stright line. Its speed also slowed down as it crossed the sky. As it passed overhead the bright orange glow started to disapate. This allowed me to make out a flashing light on the upper surface of the craft the light flashed about every second.

We were on the first floor of a building on the south side of the street.&gt;From our angle near the window, we could see over the top of the buildings to the north of our position.  People on the street were screened by the opposite buildings, and people farther inside the room where we were could not seeout over the buildings due to the low overhang of the window.Both of us, at the time, were in the Navy base stationed in San Diego.  Both of us held jobs in navigation. We were usedto using our eyes to identify far off lights. I have heard over the previous four yearsmany stories from veteran sailors, of many instances in the last few decades that ships have actually followed {or been followed)by UFO&apos;s on the open sea.  Before this happened, though, I was unsure of the truth to many of the stories.  Whilelooking to the north over the buildings across the street, I noticed two, bright red lights up in the sky.  What caughtattention is that one of them moved back and forth across the sky in an extreme fashion, though the arc of movement wassmall, maybe two or three degrees.  The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.  During that time the two lights would hover for a few moments and then move in formation.  At the end, they both accelerated away at a very high speed. Aftertalking about it for a few days, we soon dexcAfter we witnessed this, we looked around to see if anyone else had been watching.  As mentioned before, we were the only onesthat had a vantage point.  We tried to think of any possible explanation for the sighting. We quickly eliminated jets orhelicopters, celestial bodies, or reflected light.  We had no idea what the lights were.  At the time, I did not really know anybodythat we could tell.

19970317,19970321,"Aquaduct (near, over desert, before entering California), CA",triangle,1-2 min.,"Summary : Flying Westward in a UAL plane over the desert near the aquaduct before entering CA, another UAL plane approached and passed beneath us. I noticed its approach and then realized that it had a unusual, triangular-shaped aircraft flying close and to the left of its tail.  This craft? was about 1/4 the size of the UAL plane, triangular-shaped, flat, light grey color. Why?On Feb. 17, I was returned from Chicago on a United Airlines flight to Ontario, CA at about 10AM in the morning. We were flying at about 32,000 feet and the weather conditions were very clear.  Approaching us from the south going north and a bit easterly, I noticed another aircraft flying beneath us.  I am no expert, but I could identify the aircraft as a UAL aircraft. What originally got my attention was that it didn&apos;t seem too far beneath our flight and it seemed so clear because of the lack of clouds, dust, etc.  Then, I noticed that something (another craft?) was tagging along with it, rather close and off the left side of the UAL&apos;s tail.  When I looked closer, I couldn&apos;t figure out what it was or why it was following so closely.  I am not sure of the model of the UAL aircraft, but the &quot;unknown&quot; flying with it was about a quarter of the UAL&apos;s size, triangular shaped, point forward (but the forward point was slightly rounded toward the tip).  Its color was a flat, light g!rey - not shiny as a usual, unpainted aircraft would be.  It was as though the two crafts were flying in formation - that close.I keep them plain in sight until they had passed completely beneath our flight.There is probably a logical explanation for this, but it seemed very strange to me and when I review the sight in my mind, it still seems strange.   Others on the plane may have noted it, but no one else mentioned it.  I was sitting in a row next to a window, just forward of the leading edge of the aircraft, by myself.  My husband picked me up at the airport in Ontario and I mentioned it to him right away.  He guessed maybe it was some kind of target or balloon, but it did have some depth to it, yet nothing on top that I could see which might be like a raised cockpit area, nor did it have any tail(s) or projections, nor any indentation on the back edge like I have seen on some experimental aircraft.  Strange color, too, not too noticeable in the distance and if it had not been so clear, it might have disappeared into the desert sands and dust.  If there is an obvious answer to this one, I would appreciate some feed back.  Thanks"

We were at sea on our way back to the U.S. from Japan. Lights were simular to the Phoenix &quot;V&quot; lights.Me and my friend M. B. were walking accross the flight deck, I don&apos;t remember why anymore. It was at dusk but not dark yet. We first saw a bright light on the horizon directly behind the ship. It rose up and then there were 3 which continued to rise to 5 lights. They stayed there for awhile not moving or anything. I told my friend I should go get my camera but he said the lights would be gone by then. Shortly after that the lights descended to below the horizon. We went the the CIC room and asked the radar operator if there was anything behind us, he said no. We never said why we were asking or said anything about what we had saw. I can&apos;t remember that we ever talked about it after that because M. said no one would believe us anyway and I agreed. Until I heard about  the Phoenix lights on 3-13-97 I haven&apos;t mentioned this to a whole lot of people. As to when this happened I am thinking it was 3 days out of Japan and the ship was traveling about 30 knots. It was a warm night as I remember. I don&apos;t remember that the lights flickered but do remember that they were white."

Had a bright light on the side of the craft that was white/yellow.  The light would fade out and dissapear , and then reapper, we know it was not a clould in the path of vision because none were present at the time.  From the rear of the craft there were 4 lights closely together, they were tiny compared to the one on the side, and they wren&apos;t as bright.  The light on the side when it went out would reappear half way across the sky  so it was moving at a very incredible speed much faster than a plane."

It was low to the ground, sort of shadowing the top of the trees. In other words the craft was following the contour of the landscape. As it got closer the light divided into two lights of which they appeared to be some type of flood light. It also looked like shafts of light the farther away it got. It proceeded to come in and the closer it came to the road the lower it got. I was so amazed with the sight that I stopped the car and got out, my wife was in the car with me. I had completely cut the motor of the vehicle off. This craft was flying soundlessly over the road and us.  It was shaped like a rectangular box, with a slanted plexiglass looking windshield. It was moving very slowly, and my wife was telling me to get into the car and lets go. It was a full moon night and we both saw the ufo very plainly. Not like some kind of light in the sky, we saw the entire vehicle. And I have not been the same until this very day. My wife and I are not mental patients and have never been.

19970403,19970412,"Melbourne (VIC, Australia),",egg,10 seconds ?,"Summary : At aprox. 20.45 I noticed 2 light emitting pinkish egg shaped objects n/w of my position. They were aprox 50 miles away travelling extremely fast thru a 90 degree arc in aprox 10 sec. One turned sharply right then sharply left back to its  original course. The other followed seemingly to the millimetre. Finally at about s/w they turned right &amp; disapeared into the distance. I rang the Victorian UFO Society who had received reports of UFO&apos;s in the areas we viewed 40 to 50 miles away. My son also witnessed them. Too fast &amp; cornered too sharp to be anything we Know.Just prior to closing shop I had been informing the boys about comet Hale Bopp which should be visible at the end of the month; this conversation natuarally induced me to look at the sky once exiting the factory. The first thing which I believe caught the corner of my eye from the N/W was the speed of the two objects then the colour. I stared at them trying to define what they were. My curiosity turned to astonishment when one object turned hard right. ( I then yelled to my son &quot; check out the pink lights&quot; which he sighted directly without assistance) the object then banked hard left to its original course. To further my astonishment was the second object which followed the first through its flight path seemingly to the millimeter as if they were playing follow the leader. The objects continued on their course until they were aprox s/w where they turned right and rapidly disapeared into the distance.1/ Due to comprehending(as best my mind can) distance to the nearest star 4.2 LY which may support planets  I have never really believed in UFO&apos;s. Now not so sure.2/I am an amatuer astronomer &amp; therefore familiar with the night sky; I know the differance between stars,planets,satelites,lights &amp; reflections,planes, balloons, distance etc. These objects were definately none of the above.3/I would estimate these objects to be aprox 50 miles away.4/Today I received notification of one sighting in Werribee &amp; 2 sightings in Melton verifying our sighting and placing the objects at the same time and flight path.5/They travelled thru an arc of about 90 degrees in about 10 secs aprox 50 miles away.Too fast for anything known to me.6/They were at aprox 40 deg altitude.7/ They cornered to sharply for anything known to me. Very direct 45deg right/45 deg left- no arc.8/Referring to a map with the information available it is possibble they did a Zig-Zag turn to avoid flying directly over Melton or another small town in that proximity.9/It was possible to see they were solid egg shaped objects emitting a pinkish glow.10/They were to far away for sound if they making any.11/Both I (age 40) &amp; my son (age 20) believe what we saw to be controlled flight, flying solid objects without obvious propulsion  outside the limitations of anything we know."

I was getting cold and it seemed like the eclipse wasn&apos;t really getting &quot;full&quot;, I was getting ready to head in and I noticed a very faint light, like a blur, kind of like when a search light goes across the sky.I looked back up and I seen 4 very soft or faint lights directly overhead and very high up.  I looked up with my binoculars to get a better look and I could see 4 lights, shaped like a triangle with 1 of the lights sort of trailing off the back right one, closer to it than the rest were to each other.  I watched them through thebinoculars for about 10 -15 seconds before they were out of sight.  The whole thing happened in about 20 - 25 seconds.  The lights were very faint sort of a hazy yellow color.  The sky at the time was crystal clear, about 10 minutes before the &quot;sighting&quot; the last of some clouds had passed by.  In comparison to any airplanes flying aroundtonight these lights were probably 3 or 4 times as high and 10 times faster.  I didn&apos;t hear any engines.  The whole thing is a bit of exciting also a bit of alarming, its the first time I&apos;ve ever seen something in the sky and couldn&apos;t figure out what it was.  It might have been military stuff but I don&apos;t think so, it was really very fast.I would just like to know what it was, I figure with all the people observing the eclipse tonight someone else should have seen it too.

19970721,19970721,"Nun&apos;s Island (Canada), PQ",formation,8 seconds,"Summary : Formation of silent, pale round objects on top of cloud ceiling ( about 15% cloud cover).I can&apos;t believe what I saw! I am still bewildered. I was at a friend&apos;s place discussing a future project. About 10:20 PM I left the building to go back home. I got out of the side door and walked across the parking lot. The sky tonight is fairly clear, except a few clouds here and there. Suddenly on top of the clouds I saw what I first thought a cloud moving faily quick towards the North. As it passed the small group of clouds it was actually a group of five circles in some V formation, with 4 of the cricles on the right side, and one on the left. They were, and I noticed, evenly spaced. The color was some sort of light gray, paler than the clouds. I look down then up and it was still there, moving at a nonchalant speed direction North. Wow! Whatever it was it faded in the sky as it moved away (not because it disappeared, but because of the distance). I ran back to  my friend Mike&apos;s place and tried to reach him but the intercom was dead (usual). I ran under is porch and yell! ed his name. He and his girlfriend ran down to see what was happening. After telling them and looking for a while (it had been gone for a few minutes by then) I ran upstairs and drew what I saw on an envelop ( 4 frames ). Don&apos;t take me wrong, I am not a hardcore disbeliever, but I tend to believe that everything can be explained (especially UFO cases) but this one is a little tougher. It was not a reflection on the clouds, it was on top of them (they were really sparse too). It was not an airplane, it was too high. I called places to find out what the ceiling was but I could not find a place that would report that. I got on the web trying to find something and I got here by curiosity. It was not balloons, it travelled to fast (when I say it, I mean the formation). The formation was going at the same speed throughout the experience. I don&apos;t know what it was! I need to find out what the cloud ceiling was tonight a top Montreal so I can make approximations as to the size of the circles. Also was there a radar somewhere that could have recorded this? I&apos;m sending this then going back outside."

It then occured to me that it was in the wrong area to be either leaving or arriving at the airport. I then noticed that the lights which I had though were the wing tip lights, (which as you know blink red and green) were only white and that they were blinking in a circular pattern. There appeared to be a red light on the underside of the object which did not blink. The white lights were very bright and continued flashing the entire time that the object was visible to me. The object appeared to be cruising very slowly approximately 1 to 2 miles away. I could not hear any sounds coming from the object even though it is very quiet at that time of morning.The object appeared to be circular in shape but overall was similar to the shape of a derby hat with a domed section on top. from my vantage point I would estimate the size to be approximately 25 feet in diameter. As ti travelled I eventually lost sight of it as trees in the area blocked my view. I am a 45 year old male, I wear glasses and the other observer was my son who is a 15 year old male, he does not wear glasses. The entire sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes."
19950327,19971201,"Loveland/Estes Park (between), CO",light,45 min,"Summary : It looked like a star that was moving across the night sky.  But it stopped and changed direction again and again.  It changed color and became up to 5 separate lights always moving closer to us.  Near the end we could see spotlights from the craft(s).  It disapeared straight up so fast it could not have been man made.We were all camping, and sober.  It was green at first and when it was clear it was not a star or satalite it changed into up to 5 lights.  They were all changing colors sometimes when forming shapes.  Squares with the bottm red and top green.  Then a diamond all blue then white.  We watched for 25 min. then our vision was blocked by a rock face.  We all discussed what we saw and decided if we climbed on top of this rock and we were able to see it again it was certainly not our imaginations.  we viewed it again from on top of this rock face for 20 min more.  We could now see spot lights coming from it- them...  It continued to change the shapes it was forming and color of the lights that were visable. The spotlights were changing color too.  It went back to a single light, brighter than it was befoe.  Then it changed in to 3 then 5 then 9 lights forming a hoop of white lights only.  No other colors just white.  It accelerated to the west and upward so fast that the hoop i! mprint of light was visable for atleast a full second after it was gone.  If it was man made I would like to meet the men who built it-them.  We were all pretty quiet for the last min or so just watching, but when it flashed away that fast all of us screamed at the same time in aknowledgemnet.  Witnesses I am sure ((Name deleted)) of Ft.

19960531,19970509,"Chinquipin (Matagorda county, 10 miles southeast of se, TX",light,5 minutes,"Summary : A single point of light resembling a satallitebut moving very fast and making instant sharp turnsunlike any known object can.Me and my brother were sitting on the dock at our bay house fishing. My brothers attention was drawn away bywhat he believed to be a shooting star.He pointed at it but i was unable to locate it due to partial cloud cover, and its dimmness. He lost sight of it in the clouds, but regained sightof it comming out from the other side of the cloud. At that point he noted that the object made a course change of about 20 degrees and continuedout of sight over the horizon. The object followed an almost perfect north to south course untill the change which was slightly more to the east.I was unable to see this object as it was moving so fast it was gone in less than 10 seconds. There was no &apos;tail&apos; on the object, nor was theremore than one single point of light. its dimmness was equivilent to that of a satellite reflecting the sun in the evening and reflecting the suns light.After he settled down, and finished explaining his idea about it being a UFO, we went back to fishing, both of us now watching the sky.  Less than5 minutes later, the object reappeared, again from the north. this time I was the one who spotted it first and pointed it out to my brother. He confirmedthat it was the same object he viewed previously. With both of us watching, the object started a series of right angle turns that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It made about 6 or 7 course changes overhead and continued towards the south like origionally, and disappeared behind our bay house. It AGAIN reappeared out fromthe side of the bay house low on the horizon to the south over the gulf of mexico. at this point it was moving horizonally and was moving extremely fast the entire way.By extremely fast I mean like a shooting star moves fast. We both watched it move horizontally about 30-40 degrees across the horizon, then it turned again, in a very sharpzero curve turn to a northerly direction. It proceeded across the sky making one final course change of about 10-20 degrees comming to an almost perfect north direction andproceeded out of sight into the clouds along the north horizon.I need to note here that it is uncanny how familiar it is to the looks of a satellite in orbit. We both had the perception that the object was VERY far away. With the exceptionof a few low clouds, it was VERY dark and MANY stars were visible. I think city lights (like from Houston 60 miles away) would easily have drowned out the light.its my personal view that the object was not in our atmosphere.Also, i emphasize that every single turn it made had no &apos;curves&apos; in them. If you drew a right angle, thats the path it was following.I would have been more skepticle of what we saw, but increadibly, there was a report the following monday (we saw it on the first saturday morning following memorial day)in the Houston Chronicle (June 2nd i believe) reporting that there were 16 reported sightings of a UFO from Galveston Island. This island is approx. 80-100 miles WNW of ourlocation."

At approx. 3:00 a.m. I noticed a glowing object in the eastern sky at about horizon level.  It was far enough away that when it moved around, the telephone and electrical wires were hiding it.  My husband asked me if I saw it and I told him yes.  We did not have the camcorder or binoculars unpacked, but we did have the site from his telescope.  You could see that the thing was changing colors from white to blue to green.  We live very close to an airport (practically at the end of the runway) and noted that there was no airplane activity.  This is very unusual for Lambert Field.  The next night at about the same time my husband and a friend saw the same light, but this time there were approx 3 objects doing the same thing as the night before.  They were convinved thath what they saw that night was a UFO.  My husband said they were much more active thath night than the night before when we saw it together.  I do not be! lieve it was a star and we have discussed if it was possible to be some type of new aircraft that McDonnell/Boeing could be testing.  We heard no noise or saw any other activity."

Only by naked eyeobservations.I was visting a friend and she and I werelooking at the comet on Easter night andshe said hey, look at that satellite! I wasfacing north and I focused my Meade telescopeon it.

I was stillfacing north. I looked to my left and thereit was! It was so close(low)that a one blockdrive was enough to move it over. So it meansit was positioned in between my friends houseand mine!

Plus later, after2 days of clouds, it was no where to be seen!Ive never seen anything out of the ordinarybefore. I know what venus and mars and theother planets look like through my scope, soI&apos;m sure it wasnt a planet!My friend saw the colored lights, cause shepointed it out to me, but she went intoher house while I stayed outside and lookedat the sky and the &quot;object&quot;. It was too coldfor her! I didnt really think too much aboutthe strange erie lights until I got home andrealized that the object was WAY TOO LOW,cause it moved to my left, to be a satellitelike my friend first thought it was."

My wife ((deleted)) was in the hot tub outside at the time and my four sons and myself were inside the house.  My wife appeared at the front door very excited/frantic calling for us to come outside.  When I got outside she pointed to the northeast and sad in a load voice &quot;Whats that!!&quot;  I didn&apos;t answer her at the time because I was in awe of what I was seeing.  My 12 year old son ((Name deleted)) and my 16 year old son ((Name deleted)) had also come outside with me and were witness to this event as well.  My wife was viewing this object for about 1 to 2 minutes before she summond me.  During this time the object looked very different.  She described it a appearing as a white ball with flames or trails of sparks shouting out behind it.  When I first saw it the object was travelling northeast at a slow rate of speed approximately 300 to 500 feet above the ground.  The object was large (about the size of a football field) and appeared to be translucent.  Weather at the time was extremely clear with the tempe! rature between 35-40F.  Multiple lights surrounded the perimeter (reddish/orange) and varied in intensity.  The dark outline of the superstructure could be seen outlined by the lights.  Object was 200-250 yards from our position of observation.  No sound eminated from the object and there was no other noise (cars, planes, stereos, etc.) at the time.  It was very quiet.  Object was pursued in a vehicle but sighting was not regained.  Various news reports speculated that the sighting was due to Leonid Meteor shower or a Russion spacecraft reentering earths atmosphere.  Meteors do not fly subsonically in formation horizontally for 10 seconds.  It was not that.  While there was a Russian spacecraft that did reenter the earths atmosphere and was seen by many people on the west coast at about this time, the reckage supposedly ended up in the Pacific ocean.  The object we saw was traveling northeast,  had a very clear symmetry/structure and was close enough to us for us to  want to p! ursue it.  I have read many books on astronomy and the UFO phenomenon and have worked at The ((Name deleted)) Company for 18 years as a business analyst.  This sighting did not have anything to do with the Leonid meteor shower, Russian space junk or planes flying in formation!"

I can give a vivid drawing but I dont know how to send it,would you contact me please?"

My husband and I were traveling to Tucson in February 1991 on a very dark night.  At about 10:00 I noticed a row of lights in the distance.  I thought there must have been a house on a hill with all its lights on.  It looked like it was about a mile or so away.  As we approached it appeared that the brightness of the lights suddenly increased, as if the &quot;house&quot; had tilted.  We approached a rest stop, about 20 or 25 miles east of Quartzite, Arizona, where the lights were hovering.  There were about six white lights in a row.  Since it was so dark I thought they were some high antennas over the rest stop.  I could see no object, only the lights.  We had never been there before and were not familiar with the area.  There were also two smaller red lights in the area that seemed to be slowly moving.  Since our car was traveling at about 65 miles per hour, I thought they were also antennas, but !thought it was odd that they seemed to be moving.  As we passed the white lights, I said to my husband, who was driving, &quot;There are some strange lights up there.&quot;  He only had an opportunity to glance up and see the white lights, but since they were quite high in the sky, perhaps 100 feet, he only saw them momentarily. As we passed, I looked back, and there were the same number of red lights on the other side, which were blinking somewhat randomly, not in any pattern.  We continued on to Tucson, and I asked someone who was familiar with that road if they ever saw any odd lights at that rest stop, and he said he thought he had, so I dismissed them as antennas.  On the way home, we took at good look at that rest stop during the day, and there were no high antennas and no hills or mountains nearby.  We have been on that road several times since then, and once we took a frontage road near that rest stop and noticed there was a power plant about 1/4 mile from there that could not b!e seen from the highway.  Last February my husband and I again traveled to Tucson at night and stopped at that rest stop to get a few hours sleep.  The only lights we saw were some red ones on a low post that were more or less vertical, and definitely much closer to the ground than the ones we had witnessed that night.  We have mentioned the sighting to a few people but never have officially reported it."

Theywould have needed sunglasses!&quot;Charlie Goodyear checked withlocal police and sheriff&apos;sdept. and found there were noreportings of the anamoly. Ichecked with the local firemarshall whom is in charge of,and lives in, the range landswhere the incident occured.  Hestated he was not aware of theoccurance or anyone reportingit, but would call me if heheard anything.According to the witness&apos;sdescriptions, this light didnot move across the sky and didnot seem to originate from aphysical object, but simplyexisted as its own source withno density. No noise could beheard and it did not travel ormove from its active location.It would however, shift andtransform from being round(size of dime), then enlargingto round (silver dollar), thenwould stretch out &quot;like gum&quot; inlength (dollar bill), thenseparating into two. Then itwould come back together like around dime and would then fadeout to size of a pinpoint, likea TV tuner turned off. Then itwould come back repeating theprocess. Witnesses stated thisprocess repeated about 6 times.One time upon separation, thetwo lights  moved diagonally toeach other, like a &quot;chevron&quot;with 2 strips, shimmering likea reflection on water.Eventually when fadeing itnever came back. While cloudswere scattered through the skysthe area where the lights wereshowing contained none.

Both areinterested in spiritual/psychictype information, but do notkeep up with latest gossip orhappenings in that regard.Mary stated she did not read orwatch the news reports, andthat as she did not even knowabout the comet, until sheasked Tom one night what shewas seeing in the sky. Bothhave had a light interest inUFO&apos;s but again do not keep upwith latest gossip etc...Together through the interview,they seemed to mutually agreeupon their story, as theyshared enthusiasm andexcitement about it.  Neitherwould speculate as to what itwas they saw, except that theyboth &apos;felt&apos; it was not aterrestial source orphenomenon. Both did not feelfrightened by the expierienceand talked about it as apositive expierience. Therewere no physical effectsreported.  Witnesses reportedaprox. 5 vehicles passed onHighway 12 during theirstationary 5 miniute viewing.They found it strange that thevehicles passed as withoutnotice of the event.

Contact was madeeither in person or by leavinga note, with ranches in theimmediate vicinity of thesighting location.Birdslanding, a rural communityof ranches, is directly acrossHighway 12,  may containwitnesses.  Many events of thisnature, in the past, have beenreported in the Birdslandingarea.  I made contact with thepostmaster for this area andgave her cards with a requestfor contact if she heardanything.  She readily agreed.I went out to view the site andcheck for any natural sourceswhich may explain this event. Idid so on 4/21 at 23:00 to gainperspective with a similarnight environment. It wasobserved that radio towersexisted aprox. 15 miles NE ofthe sighting area. Thesetransmission towers are highand thin.  2 of them had lightswhich were greenish and wouldflash on and off.  Both towerswere aprox. 3 miles apart andwould alternatly do this in aregular sequence.  Whileconsidering this as a possiblesource it was eliminated whilereinacting their viewpoint.The towers were to far off inan easterly direction and theirproximity to the horizon couldnever have contributed to thesize and altitude of the event.Additionaly the descriptionwhich was given did not matchthe constant sequence in whichthese towers flashed.Daytime observation of the areawas also made.

19971121,19971208,"North Kingstown, RI",triangle,10sec or less,"Summary : While driving at dusk my daughter and I noticed an airplaine flying up in the sky w/ it&apos;s lights on heading in an easternly dirtection to Green Airport.  We were driving on route 1 heading north onto route 4 Just as we came to a location on rt.4 near a combination miniture golf/batters cages/golf hitting range that is when we noticed the airplaine w/ it&apos;s lights on.  In this same are there are no tall trees and the area has a considerable panoramic view.  The air plaine was a couple hundred feet in the air, and I had a view of about  100 to 120 degrees.  A friend of mine has informed that jet airliners go a maximum speed of about 200-250 mph.  I would assume that the airplane was going less than 200 mph if it was heading for a landing at green.  No sooner than I had seen this plane I then saw another plane above the 1st,  it was 2 time the hight of the 1st it too had its lights on and both had a triangular look to then. BUT as I watched both airplane&apos;s the 2nd passed the 1st as if it was standing still.  W/ in  5 seconds it was compleatly out of my sight as it to headed easterly direction. I would estimate that the other plane?!?!? was going about 10 time the speed of the 1st.  Even my youg daughter mentioned &quot;look at that dad&quot;I have a back ground in science/natural history.  I have seen the jets at the airshows in the summer at Quonsett base at the old sea-bees base.  The only time I have ever seen them disappeare that fast, they were close to the  ground.  I would estimate that both objects were about 1000 feet to 1/2 a mile away. Since it was dusk and dark I could not see  much except that both had a grey outline and both had their lights on.  dividing my windsheld up into 10 units by the time the 1st airplaine went one unite the second had disappeared.  I would basicly estimate that the 2nd object/plane was going 10 times the speed of the 1st. So if the 1st plane was going about 180 to 200 mph then the 2nd&quot;plane/object&quot; was going about  1800 to 2000 mph or more.  I have never seen a &quot;plane&quot; dissapear from my field of view like that in my life.  I have never seen a ufo in my life but because of the speed that this &quot;plane&quot;  was  going and that it dissapeared out of my viewing area w/in 5 + seconds I thought I should report this. I do not want to leave my name because I have heard about another person who has witnessed triangular and cigar shaped ufo&apos;s here in RI and that this same person who has recorded these ufo&apos;s, has since reported them on line.  I was also told that since this person reported these sightings several months later but use his own computer.  Later I was told that the ufo reporter was literally  visited by people in a white lincoln and the &apos;visitors&apos; were taking pictures of this persons house.  These visitors stoped the picture taking only after having their picture taken by the person who made the ufo reporting.  I was also told that the visitors inthe white lincoln had no plates on it at all, because they had watched it arrive and leave.  In fact on its way in twords this persons house, a cop had stoped the white lincoln and then left the lincoln alone. Depending who these people  in the white lincoln are be it &quot;men in black&quot; or &quot;government military personell&quot; I for one do not want my life subject to what ever hell these people put  ufo reporters through. All my daughter knows of ufo&apos;s is what she saw in the men in black video, I don&apos;t want her or myself subjected to anysort of &quot;interogation terror tactics&quot;.

The movements were smooth and not jerky or bobbing (like balloonswould do) then sped off to the south faster than any wind might propell them.  I waswishing I had a pair of binoculars as they grew smaller above a building to the south.When I first saw them circling each other it appeared almost as if they were linked bya tether since they moved in tandem, but then when their path became straight they seemedto be at a greater distance appart than if this were the case.  Strangely, a dark heli-copter was circling the area directly above the closest approach of the objects at the time.It performed a pretty tight loop that seemed to focus on the area and was quite low as well.I looked up at it only two or three times and didn&apos;t notice any markings.  It didn&apos;t strikeme as a traffic helicopter and was in the wrong location if it were so if they were doingtheir job.  After the sighting I pondered whether what I saw were ballons, but this possibilityjust didn&apos;t seem to fit.  I didn&apos;t notice any wind that could account for it and the windusually comes from the west off the coast.  These objects flew from north to south.  Asmentioned in the abreviated report, the first two objects were followed by two more on thesame path, but without any circling maneuvers."
19950107,19971116,"Lake Grove (Portland Metro), OR",disk,&lt; 1 min,"Summary : Round silvery disk quickly passing from W to E in a straight lineI was enjoying the weather from my second- floor apartment deck on that fine Saturday July 1, 1995 afternoon. The 2pm (PDT) sky was partly cloudy, mostly evenly scattered cumulus with a clear blue sky behind them. I am sometimes given to looking straight up into the sky in search of high-flying raptors or other soaring birds. As I looked directly overhead,I noticed something moving well above the cumulus clouds. It was a silvery object about the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length moving in an unwavering straight line from west to east. I watched as it passed behind the clouds which were moving so slowly as to appear to be completely still. I would not want to hazard a guess as to its altitude or airspeed. My first thought was that it was simply a weather balloon. (In fact, I&apos;m still leaning towards that explanation.) As I studied it I wondered if it was in fact not silver, but translucent. It had a bluish cast but was darker around a well-defined edge and had no irregularities in its shape or surface. However, a few things didn&apos;t rest well with me. I&apos;ve seen weather balloons in flight before and this wasn&apos;t like either of them. This was perfectly round and had no visible payload. The others I had seen weren&apos;t nearly so symmetrical and were visibly balloons with something suspended underneath. Also, given that this object was well above the clouds, it would have been a *very* large balloon. As far as I know, there aren&apos;t any launch sites west of Portland used for such launchings. (That may just be my ignorance in this instance; the only launch site for high- altitude balloons that I know of is near Palestine, Texas.) I found it odd that it moved so much faster than the lower clouds, though of course the possibility of the jet stream comes to mind. I was also impressed that it moved in such a straight line. It covered about 30 degrees of the sky in 4-5 seconds. It disappeared behind a solid line of clouds banked up against Mt. Hood and the Oregon Cascades to the east. I have no idea if this was a *real* UFO or not. In fact, the most remarkable aspect of this incindent may simply be that I saw an ordinary thing in a place most people wouldn&apos;t ordinarily look--straight overhead--without some other motivation. It just to be odd enought to warrant reporting to you. Had I known how to contact anyone regarding this prior, I would have. When the UFO Center was on the news with the space junk reentry story, I knew where to go. If you need more info, contact me via email. Thanks!"

The first and what would also be the largest of the craft was the firstlight seen.  It was the brightest light we had ever seen in the sky except sun and moon.  The craft was triangular in shape with lights on the corners.  When it was right overhead, a small triangular structure could be seen on the underside.

Then after they were overthe horizon, more of the smaller sized craft began to be seen from the south moving north.They appeared one at a time in approx. two minute intervals.  It took them less than two minutes to go from horizon to horizon.  We had never seen any craft move that quickly.  Many of them maneuvered in distint manners:forward-reverse, forward-reverse; hover; very quick zigzag; 45+ degree banks in a matter of seconds:  almost as if a display.

19960901,19970620,"Fort Collins, CO",disk,45 sec,"Summary : 9/1/96 SIGHTINGAround 9:30 pm, Sunday, September 1st, 1996, my wife and I were in our backyard watching the sky.  This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded &ldquo;God, I do.&rdquo;As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, &ldquo;Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there&rdquo; to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.  If so, please e-mail us at: ((email address deleted.))"

I havn&apos;t reported this officially until now because I thought we were probably the only ones to see such a thing, and that few would believe us.  Recent news reports of sightings in that exact area promted me to write this in the case it could be helpful.  My fiance and I split up not too long after this event and havn&apos;t spoken since.  She could be contacted for independent verification, if someone wanted to do so.  She was really frightened by what happened and hence missed some of what I saw, but I think she saw the majority of what I am about to report.  The incidident:  I drove out cross-country to my favorite area in my 4Runner and parked it facing East, about 100 ya!rds from the edge of a long, low mesa extending North and South.  The landscape dropped off to the East towards the Little Colorado River and the Navajo Res.  We built a campfire near my lowered tailgate and began to enjoy the evening.  At one point, I was sitting on the tailgate facing West while my fiance was tending the fire.  I looked straight up at the sky, and in my peripheral vision caught sight of a blinking light.  At first, I just thought it was an airplane, but I noticed it wasn&apos;t moving at all.  Then, I noticed from 5-7 other blinking lights in the same general quadrant of the sky--and outstretched hand would probably &quot;capture&quot; the space they all occupied.  I think they were whitish blue, but they may have been light red (I&apos;m sorry, I really can&apos;t recall exactly) and were not blinking in unison.  None were moveing at all.  This is why I kept watching them and told my fiance to look at them.  Then, we saw a lazer-like pulse of light shoot from one to another.  I thi!nk I saw this happen 2, maybe 3 times.  Then we noticed a whitish yellow light--much like a distant headlight--travelling near the ground in the distance ahead (East) of us.  At first I thought it was a car or motorcyle--but I&apos;ve never seen any other person out as far as I went, and certainly never at night... About the time I was beginning to worry that it was someone travelling toward I light, it went up and then back down a few degrees offf the horizen.  It continued to repeat this as it travellied along.  Most of the terrain there is fairly level, so I started doubting it was a car.  I put out the fire and had my fieance turn off her headlamp (she was too scared to do so).  When I looked back at the whitish light, it was apparently moving in our direction--but I couldn&apos;t tell how far away it was...at one point I thought for certain it was only 50 yards in front of us.  But there was no sound at all, so I figured I must be wrong.  Then we looked back up to the sky to see if!the other lights were still there; they were.  But when we looked out to the East for the whitish light, it was gone.  Then I noticed the same bluish or reddish (I think blue) lights blinking in the NW sky!  They had moved from the SE to the NW.  And then, to the N, we saw the whitish light travelling along the ground again...going up and down periodically like no car or earthbound vehicle could have done.  I t was almost as if it was searching for something.  Then it disappeared and the lights in the NW sky were gone too.  We slept in the back of my truck and had a restless night&apos;s sleep.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen (though we both did sight one UFO each when much younger).  I always wondered if the military was conducting some advanced lazer weaponry by sattelites--but this never does quite explain the white object hovering near the ground.....The next day, oberservations of the terrain in the directions we saw the white light made it even more clear that it!could not have been a vehicle.  Background information:  I was 33 at the time, and my fiance 29.  We both have bachelors degrees and some other training.  We were very healthy and didn&apos;t do any drugs or drink alcohol, etc.  We had each worked as National Park Rangers, and I was/am more of a skeptic than anything else.  I used to love to read the Skeptical Inquirerer!  Now I am more open to various possibilities, but I still thing it could have been some type of military operation.  I sure would like to know!  Hope this helpful in some way; if you need more into, please contact me at any time."

Saw the lights in the sky.  They were heading North horizontally arcoss the sky.  Very visible.  Other witnesses on the road in front of us thought they were UFOs bombs.  We didn&apos;t know, and we frightened.  When we lost sight of the lights it was not because they dissipated, but rather moved behind some trees and out of our range of vision.  Seemed to move faster than airplane, but much slower than shooting star. Local news is very vauge on what this could have been. Would like to find out more - what are the possibilities?  Wondering if it could have been a natural phenomenon, that no one has considered?  Could it be some military exercise, or experiment?  Mass in sky much larger than could be created by Russian rocket - mass would indicate debris from something the size of Washington State - can&apos;t think of anything man made that could have created that much debris in the sky, with the light so bright, rocket should have burnt out and dissipated."

I saw a large round yellow glowing object close to the ground far off in the distance and did not take note of it because I thought it was a full moon close to the ground.  It was partially blocked by some thin trees.As I lay there, the object began to ascend very very slowly.  As it began moving, I jumped out of bed and ran to the window watching as it rose above the tree level and house level.  I cannot tell how far off it was -- perhaps a few miles.Once it finished rising, it sat in the sky for a few seconds not moving -- then in a split second shot off to the right, disappearing.  I ran out of my room, down the hall, and into the living room which was the direction that the object flew.  I looked out of the sliding glass door in the living room, but the object was gone.Again, it was just a round, glowing, yellow object, with no other distinctive features.I have only told a very few select individuals about this over the past almost 20 years -- people that I knew would at least believe that I was not lying to them -- even if they don&apos;t happen to believe in UFO&apos;s.

Me and a friend began to examine the craft and noticed a strange light configuration.  Three small lights in each corner (red) and a pulsating lght in the center (orange).  Until that day we were both sceptics.The ship was making making no sound at all and was sitting absolutely still.  We exited the car and began to get a better look.  It was very large in a perfect triangular shape.  The lights at each corner were very small in comparison to the large center light and were also not pulsating.  They were red in color but appeared to fade slightly into an orange in the center.  In the middle of the craft was at first glance an orange light but after careful examination was hanging down like a large ball of light pulsating and fading and then restoring to full brightness.  We then realized that the road permitted a closer look.  We entered the car and began towards it.  We ran under a passing of trees and then cleared them.  the veiw of the ship was elliminated by the trees.  Upon reaching the other side the ship was gone from sight.  The sides appeared to slope inward at an angle from bottom to top.
19890101,19971103,"Memphis, TN",light,varying,"Summary : On sequential nights during the month of January, 1988, I witnessed from 2-4 bright amber lights hovering or slowly moving in the western sky over Memphis. On one night, these lights appeared to be performing some sort of synchronized movements, moving in large circles at antipodes from each other, and reversing direction.I just finished watching the special on the Discovery channel about the lights seen over Phoenix during March of &apos;97. I was impressed by the videos of the supposed &apos;flares&apos;, and was reminded of a similar occurance many years ago. Over the course of the month of January 1988, only on weekend nights as these were the only nights I was out, I witnessed in the western sky over Memphis, sometimes 2, and sometimes 4, bright amber lights similar in appearance, color, and &apos;texture&apos; to flames seen from a great distance. Each night after 0100, while driving south down Old Germantown Road, I saw these lights above the western horizon, in the direction of Memphis International Airport. Sometimes the lights merely hovered, or moved very slowly, almost too slow to notice movement, but on one occasion, my curiosity having been excited by previous sightings, I noticed two objects moving in a large circle, as though orbiting a central point- the circle being approxiamtely 3x the size of a fu! ll moon. The objects maintained a 180 degree opposition to each other as they circled, and once a circle was completed, they reversed direction to complete another circle, before reversing direction again. On this particular night (I cannot remember the exact date), I stopped the car to watch them, and sat parked for about 15 minutes before I got bored, having watched them perform 3 complete circles, so i continued on my way, sure that I would see them again on some other night. And I did, but never again were they so active as on that night. Since then I have seen similar phenomena which proved to be landing lights of comercial aircraft approaching over a great distance on a clear night: the same color and quality of light, the same apparent slow movement, but I have never before or since witnessed such a &apos;ballet&apos; in the sky. It seems remarkable and highly unlikely that any comercial or military aircraft could move with such precision being separated over so large an area as ! was suggested by the apparent distance from my vantage point, and even more unlikley that such aircraft could stop and reverse direction without slowing.  I have never before reported this because it seemed to me too weak a sighting to be of much consequence; I was never able to identify the objects as anything more than &apos;lights in the sky.&apos; But after seeing the Phoenix videotapes, I was amazed by the similarity to what I saw over those nights so long ago. These were not my only encounters during the same 12-month period, but it has been so long now, I don&apos;t that my information can be of much value. I am, however, interested in relating what I have seen, both in the sky and elsewhere, to interested scientific and documentary authorities.  If needed, i can supply photocopies of maps showing my position and the direction of the sightings."
19971102,19971103,"Green Bay, WI",light,appx. 10 mins.,"Summary : A loose formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights observed slowly crossing evening sky.A formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights was observed  11/02/97  18:50  Green Bay, WI  When first spotted by my mother[49], they were in a roughly triangular formation, moving slowly east.  She called for me to come outside and look at somthing.  I went out and watched them for about 5 minutes until the upper two were slowly enveloped in the cloud cover.  I went inside and got my SLR camera &amp; 400mm lens.  I went back out and looked at the remaining light, but the strong lens showed revealed no shape behind the light.  The other two lights now began to emerge from the clouds and the formation of the three was now close to linear and vertical.  I would estimate their distance to be about 2-3 miles.  I couldn&apos;t tell if they were making any sound because a helicopter was hovering 1.3 miles to the west, over the football stadium.  The orange lights had no accompanying aircraft-style strobes or red/blue positioning lights.  They did not move constantly, as a sattelite would and! the cloud cover was dense enough to obscure anything that high or faint.  I am 34 and I am quite familiar with the way civil and military aircraft move.  These lights moved similarly to helicopters, but had no regulation lights and didn&apos;t generate the sounds that a group of 3 military helicopters would make.  I asked a neighbor to look at them.  He did, but looked for 3 seconds, said &quot;Oh, airplanes&quot;, and went back inside. I was looking for film inside for 2 minutes and when I went back outside, the 3 lights had vanished."

Then from the East it flew around Forked Butte and came at us less than ten ft. off the snow covered ground.The vehicle then rapidly (popped) approached us from the East and landed ten ft. in front of us, turned out its bright white light and turned on an interior light revealing the semi-transparent red, green &amp; blue lens. The vehicle then exited rapidly and climbed into space and disappeared behinfd Mt. Jefferson. The vehicle emitted sparks from the stern much like a 1930&apos;s &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; space vehicle. On Sunday evening at approx. 10 pm Dec. 22, 1981 myself, my 11 yr. old son and another person were &quot;buzzed&quot; by over 12 of these same vehicles. We witnessed them flying up to a larger cigar shaped vehicle and started orbiting around it. The whole system then rose up into the night sky and disappeared. I interviwed Police catain Ellidge ! and Lt. Horton who recieved over a thousand phone calls concerning individuals from Eugene in February 1982. I reported the incident to the FBI. Since then we have studyed in depth the technology we were shown and hence got a U.S. patent ont the technology in 1989. We intend to build and test prototypes soon. Please visit our website to review this technology at http://www.unitelnw.com. The Medford incident may be the same vehicles. I believe they are our own vehicles that we are about to build attempting to return to the correct spacetime departure point. Thank you, Sincerely,"

19650101,19970525,"Conway, AR",light,1 hour,Summary : At a drive-in during the summer my brother and I saw three lights above and to the right of the screen.  The movie was &quot;CAT BALOU.&quot; We observed them for approx. 20 minutes while one of them flew figure eights around the other two.  Then one of the other lights would switch positions with the moving light and fly the same figure eight pattern.  Suddenly two of the lights took off with great velocity and dissappeared.  The other light stayed in its orginal position.  Approx. 1 hr. later a light came speeding back and started circling the stationary light then took a position next to it and stopped.  I am at home with my sick child today and watching the learning channel and heard a pilot report a similar sighting.  I finally decided to go public

We both remember a sence of absolute shock and severe fright, when our covers were suddenly and yet gently drawn from our beds.  At the foot of my bed I saw a   the silouette of a tall thin figure with  large black eyes that had a shiney luster to them, it was as if I could see myself in them,(after this moment I regret to say that the rest is the account of my friend because I cannot remember anything else)......I looked over at Patty and I remember thinking that she was dead because she lie so still.  her body began to rise above the bed into the arms of the figure described above. I also was &quot;carried&quot; into the figures arms, but i did not pass out. Before I knew it, we were in a different place that is defficult to describe because i was surrounded by these figures.  I was laying on a strange surface that was both hot and cold at the same time. It felt as if there was a sheet over my body put there so that i could not move.  The only part of my body that i could move was my eyes.  I did not see Patty anywhere, until the beings parted for a split second, and i caught sight of them carrying her body out of the room, i was sure she was dead. i then directed my eyes toward the celing and saw an  object slowly and silently descending toward my stomach.  It resembled a very large needle, and it was then that i fainted.  i awoke in the morning laying beside Patty on the kitchen floor. We vaguely (at first) remembered what had happened.  We noticed three strange triangular marks on our bodies--one behind the left ear, one on our stomachs, and one on our lower back.  Now Patty and i feel that if we ever separate after this experience together, somthing bad will happen."

From the hill where the church sat, I could see the terminal station of the Sao Paulo subway system. Suddenly I noticed an orange light that changed intensity, sometimes changing to red. I called my parents and the other church members who came out to see. We were there for about 20 minutes. The location of the light was exactly on the path of the Sao Paulo International Airport (Congonhas) final approach. As airplanes would align with final, the light moved very fast and dissapeared, to reappear when tha plane had passed. Later that evening, channel 5 (Globo television network) reported the incident and interviewed several eye witnesses, who reported the same story.

19530615,19970718,"North Bend, WA",circle,2 minutes,"Summary : My cousin and I who were children at the time, watched a round, smooth, silent object which had a pinkish glow, come across his field from the direction of the Snoqualmie River.  It was about 20&apos;-30&apos; from the ground.  We were standing on his front porch.  It came in our direction and then stopped above a fruit tree directly across the driveway from where we were.  It was about the size of a VW Beetle, perfectly circular, with a triangular projection at the &quot;back.  My aunt had locked the front door to prevent us kids from running through the house.  I pounded on the door to get the adults to come out and see this thing.  My cousin said that when I started pounding and yelling, the object took off and streaked up over the mountain in the direction of the mountain (Rattlesnake mtn.), in the direction of Seattle.  Our parents brought us into the house and put us into different rooms and had us draw a picture of what we had seen.  Our pictures matched, and I remember that our par! ents believed that we had seen something.  The next day (as I remember it) my father told my mother that &quot;something &quot; was reported in the Seattle paper, streaking across the sky at about the right time for it to have been the thing we saw.  I was 9yo at the time as was my cousin.  We had both lived in Alaska and had watched airplanes and heliocopters landing near our home and knew that this was nothing like conventional aircraft.  It was perfectly silent; if we hadn&apos;t been looking we would never have known it was there.   It was completely featureless also. I remember people asking if there were windows or portholes or doors but we were firm that there were not.  We were very close to this object, no more than 50&apos; at the most.  It excited me and frightened me a little bit.  I thought that it stopped opposite us because it &quot;saw&quot; us.  I have never heard any other report of an object which looked like the one we saw.  It looked to me as though it had been manufactured, did not lo! ok like a natural object, was definitely not gaseous.  Anyone else out there ever see anything like this?  I am not sure of the date.  It is most likely that it was 1953 because I was still living in the Snoqualmie/North Bend area at the time and my family was visiting my cousin&apos;s family.  Interestingly and dissapointingly, my cousin does not remember the object as looking the way I describe it.  He now says it was silver and saucer-shaped.  It was not, and we agreed at the time on how it looked.  I remember being frustrated at not being able to really draw the way it looked.  I realize now that I couldn&apos;t replicate the geometrical precision of the thing.We were children of the same age, and had no background as such.  We knew nothing about &quot;flying saucers&quot; except that we must have heard talk about them because I remember explaining that it was not a &quot;flying saucer&quot;, it was round and had a tail.  My father was an employee of Seattle City Light and my mother did not work outside the home.  I was an only child at the time.  My cousin was one of 4 children,  His father was a logger and his mother was employed but I don&apos;t remember at what at that time.  We were semi-sophisticated kids in that we had traveled to Alaska by stemship with our families several times and had had the experience of living on the fringes of civilization as well as in the Seattle area.  Perhaps because I was an only child, I have an excellent memory and clear early memories. I realize that this is OLD information and not at all scientific but I don&apos;t know anyone else who has seen something like this so &quot;Up close and personal&quot;.  If I hadn&apos;t seen this thing! , I would never believe the reports I&apos;ve read about the objects other people have seen.  I empathize with the skeptics, it&apos;s just too fantastic.  But, since I have seen it, I can no longer doubt that there is something more to this world than we now &quot;know&quot;.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"

He  saw what appeared as a shiny orb traveling southeasterly.Standing in my backyard, around 10 in the morning, I saw what appeared to be a jet in the northeastern sky.

19970409,19970409,"Sarnia (Canada), ON",unknown,30 seconds,"Summary : On this particular night my sister and I went out to our side porch to have a cigarette when she noticed something suddenly appear to the east.  An aircraft of some sort appeared suddenly, sped across the sky at an unbelievable rate of speed, and then vanished.My sister was the first to notice the object as she was scanning the sky to see if she could catch a glimpse of the Hale-Bop comet, when she grabbed my arm and told me to look.  I glanced up at the sky towards the east and saw what I thought to be a small airplane taking off from the local Sarnia Airport.  The craft was probably only about 300 or so feet off the ground, well below the scattered clouds.  It flew slow at first, and I noticed a very bright white light, which looked like it was coming from the side of the craft due to it&apos;s direction.  The light flickered very quickly a few times, went out and then came back on.  It was flying quite slow at that time. Then all of a sudden it accellerated, darted across the sky towards the west and Michigan untill we couldn&apos;t see it any more.  It looked to have four light type things, one at the front, back, and the side facing us.  The light at the side was a very bright white light, that looked like it was sort of pointed downward!  It was very loud and sounded like a gigantic jet engine roaring extremely loud. The lights on the front and on the back were much dimmer, and looked to be green.  Judging by the lights on it, it looked to me like it was sort of round or had very short wings.  What I mean is that all the lights looked as though they were exactly the same distance apart giving it a square or circular looking shape. As it flew further away from us there looked to be a cluster of about 20 small white lights giving off an enormous glare.  It looked like it was about the same size as a fighter plane would be.  Once whatever it was sped up it moved across the sky faster than anything I&apos;ve seen and within about 15 seconds was too far away for us to see.  Neither my sister nor I have ever seen what we thought to be an alien craft or anything like that. Particularly, I am a very logical and scientific person who needs to see something to really believe it.  I recently had an argument with a friend who was trying to convince me that there are such things as bearded ladies.  My arguement to her was that I would never be able to truly believe something like that unless I saw it with my own eyes in person, because how can you really know? My point is that if I wouldn&apos;t have seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it.  I am usually very sceptical of UFO sightings and stuff on tv because the stories always have to many holes, and of course I had never seen one.  I have a 156 I.Q. and have always been thought of as very clear minded and mature far beyond my years."

It was in the northwestern sky above the mountains.  It changed direction after going up for about 5 minutes.  It then turned to a more northerly direction as it got smaller and higher.  As we looked at it, my son and I both saw what looked like a wide beam of light coming from this object shining down to earth.  We couldn&apos;t see it go all the way down because the light was partly behind the mountains at that time.As the object kept getting higher, we also noticed a smaller light below this object, approximately 3 inches below, if using your fingers to measure.  It was moving in a northeastly direction and moved very fast and again, using your fingers to measure, it moved approximately 5 inches in that direction and then it disappeared.  The first object continued moving higher and then it too disappeared.We watched for a few minutes longer but could not see either object anymore."

We have seen this once before in the same spot in the sky in late July. Of the two ships one was really bright and one was not very bright. The bright one was glowing a hot white color, and when viewed with binoculars, it had what appeared to be two rocket boosters, which were tapering off in width, and where at about a 120 degree angle from eachother.  Also a white hot ring seemed to be floating around the ship.  Sort of like some sort of force feild.  The smaller ship was keeping a constant distance from the brighter bigger ship. Like it was bing controlled by it. The strangest and weirdest thing thathappened though was this bright band of light that crossed the sky. It was like a twisted plane or ribbon, twisting at the left, and then ging straight across the sky.  Then at the right side or the end of it it looped and went up.  Then it dissapeared. &gt;From the beginning of the sighting to the end, the brighter ship moved down and over a little to the right. The smaller ship seemed to move a lot more.  Then about an half hour later, the ribbon instantly vanished."

The newspaper said sighting was seen south of Kingsport, south of Bristol in the direction of South Holton Lake, I live near I-81 exit 22 and it was southwest of my home.  My son and I saw a vertical silver object (bright as if the sun was refecting off it) with a tail like a jet but more dense and one and three-fouths the lenght of the object. It did not change location during the time we would look at it.  I would not have even thought anything of it but for the fact that WXBQ-AM morning talk show was talking about it the next morning and right at the end of the program someone said they had seen it around 7:00 pm.  The newspaper had not printed a time but if others who phoned the local police and airport saw it about the same time, the sun was going down and it was far from being dark. The paper said one caller with binoculars saw what appeared to be an illuminated crystal shape similar to a snowflake with a dark center and number of red spots darting around it.  A BVPD Sgt.

19971216,19971217,"North San Diego, CA",fireball,apx. one second,"Summary : Green fireball.  Seemed to be too low for a celestial event.  Definitely not fireworks.I&apos;m an engineer.  See myself as a careful, objective observer.  Know planes, seen lots of meteors, fireworks, and the like. This brief phenomenon defied my logic. It was a light green &quot;fireball&quot; lasting about a second.  It showed a short-persistance trail (1/4-1/2 sec). I&apos;m 5-10 miles north of downtown San Diego.  It was south of my observation point, maybe 30 deg. above horizon.  It faded out at about 15-20 deg.  It may have been visible higher in the sky, but my view was restricted. The object seemed to be falling, moving towards the southwest.  It showed a straight, fast trajectory - like a meteor.  Quite bright but not extremely so. It left me with the distinct impression that it was generated within the atmosphere, that it was not a celestial event.  However, because of its motion and the characteristics of its luminance, it was definitely not fireworks.  It seemed like it could have been only a few thousand feet away.  Seeing a meteor is much different than was seeing this. Interesting too, it occurred right where I was looking, but not expecting anything. Would be interested to know if anybody else saw a similar thing it this time. Email me if you could use or provide further information.

At first I thought that the light could be a reflection from one of the navigation lights of the DC-10.  After watching the light for about an hour we decided that that wasn&apos;t the case.  It would change position and color.  We could simply tell that it was some sort of object. After a while, we would just take a look out the window every 20 minuets or so. Every time we looked out it was still out there. At one point we asked another passenger and a steward to take a look and they were amazed as well.  The light dissapeared when we started to overfly some shipping, probably about 200 miles from Ireland. After the flight we joked about the &quot;UFO&quot; that we saw, but we were still left with an unsettling feeling. I am a private pilot and I have seen nav light reflections and air traffic at night, this light was not even similar."

I believe it was big enough to cover an acre of land. It had one large middle light like a large bulb in the center and on the outer corners were two small lights. It hovered 45 minutes with no noise whatsoever. I stood outside and watched it for 45 minutes. The most amazing thing was the two lights on each point of this triangle then departed going opposite ways of each other and did some very strange things like loops and things and left the hovering thing there. These two little things that left the large thing were much smaller but they were like points of light. It then formed in a line and flew out towards the mountains but it was very unusual for something to hover for solong but the two points departing was really strange. I phoned this in at the center that night and no ! one has called me back. I can draw it and show you where it was. It was right over our pasture and not that high above ground. I thought at first sight it must be a plane going to land, but planes cannot hover for 45 minutes that I know of and things cannot just depart and :do their own little air show&quot;.

Traveling east on I80 i started to approach the Mifflinville bridge. At 710 i seen this Large round bright green light flying above the river. i thought it was a plane cause the Bloomsburg airport was near by. I knew it could not fly above the river cause of the islands in it. the object was about 100 feet in diameter and was quiet.It flew above the water about 40 feet. By the time i got to the middle of the bridge the object made a hard 90 degree turn and flew over the mountain right above the trees. now going south. when i went home i told my father about it. he believed me. the next day in the paper was a writing about green lights seen in Washington DC at 715 pm the same night i seen my light. they said that it was a meteor. tell me this how can a meteor fly up a river then make a left turn before hitting a bridge and then fly over a mountain abofe the trees heading south in the direction which DC is in.

It drifted to the west, alternately blinking out and reappearing.  As I parked and got out of my car, it stopped.  I ran inside and got a pair of binoculars (Tasco 7x35mm). When I got back outside, the light was still in the same place.  When I aimed the binoculars at the object, it had three lights on it, two white and one blue. It looked like a helicopter, but I continued to track it as it moved slowly back toward the east. After about two minutes, four or five more lights appeared, two white and the others blinking red, orange, and blue. As it acclerated, I could make out a vague triangular shape which contained the lights. The object took up a good portion of the lenses of the binocs, and with the naked eye was about the size of a dime. There was no discernible sound coming from the object, and the rustling of nearby trees made it hard to tell if there was any noise. The! object continued to accelerate to a speed which made it difficult to track, and disappeared behind the home across the street from mine.

19971115,19971116,"Reno, NV",triangle,20 min,"Summary : Listened to radio on the way from San Jose to Reno, NV.  We listened to Artbell on his AM talk radio.  We just viewed what we thought were UFOs in the bay area and wondered if there was any news about our sighting.  We heard about the 9 PM Oregon, Washington, and Reno sightings of UFOs and this sort of confirmed our sightings and wondered if they were related.  We kept hearing about triangular shaped objects being sited so we were observing the sky.  The moon was unusually bright that morning.  When I got into Reno, I was headed south on Highway 395 toward our destination and I saw three dots of light that was about 30 degrees from the horizon almost directly toward the south.  The three lights looked like stars but were unusually bright.  I have been star gazing for a couple of years since my wife and I have been interested in UFOs.  I&apos;ve witnessed the landing of the Space Shuttle above the skies in Vallejo.  I also saw the Mir streak across the sky one evening when a local newscaster told me when and where to look for the Mir.  I tried to get a better view and get closer to the lights but the three lights moved toward the west and one of the lights went behind Mount Rose near Lake Tahoe.  We went climbing near Mt Rose about three weeks earlier so we were familiar with locations. The strange thing was the exact symmetry of the three points of light from each other as they slowly moved across the sky.  It seemed like they were guided exactly by the movement of the other lights.  We got out of the car and I took photos and I&apos;m not sure if they will come out.  I should get the photos back on Tuesday.  As my wife and I looked at the two lights as they hovered behind Mt Rose, the right most light flared up in brightness and appeared like it got brighter, then suddenly dimmed.  The lights appeared to me to about 100 miles south west of Reno, somewhere above the Sierras in California.  It could be deceiving and the objects even further out like hundreds of miles.  It is hard to tell unless someone triangulates the movements as I described them.  Now my wife and I and the kids are convinced that we are not alone in this galaxy.  The numerous reports of triangle shaped objects may have merit If I am correct, the object could be miles across and may be cloaked.   The tips of the triangle are the size of stars to throw off our perception and blend in with the stars at night.  Without a telescope, it was difficult to determine if  these were craft that were navigating and controlled by equidistance between each other or one huge vessel. We were excited and contacted the local TV news stations but no one called us back.  You are our only hope to describe this UFO.  Please advise what to do next.I am a Project Manager working for ((Name deleted)) Corp and have a scientific background.  This defies all logic and we are not sure if these were astronomic bodies that we were observing.

We had just bought a 74 Pinto from a welder on the job we worked at.  We rode home with him and drove the car back from N. of Mount Airy,  NC on Dec 31, 1986.  Andy was driving S. on Hwy. 52 when I saw 3 lights in a triangular formation ascend from the trees on the left side of the highway.  I pointed in amazement at which time Andy hunched over the wheel and saw the lights also.  They were about a hundred yards away and rotating as they ascended.  Andy slowed down and we stared at the lights for about 10 seconds.  The lights then moved rapidly east, kind of swirlinga bit before zipping almost straight up and completely out of sight.  At the rate the lights accelerated, it left us in a total state of shock. Since this occured on New Years Eve, we&apos;ve had a hard time convincing anyone that we really saw it and I never heard of any other sightings.  We used to talk about it a lot but people think we&apos;re crazy and heated arguments would ensue.

I didn&apos;t even touch the keyboard when she was hysterically yelling for me to come outside.  I ran outside as quickly as I could because I thought there was something happening to her. She pointed into the sky and told me to look at these lights.  It was clearly obvious that it was a craft of some sort. We could see the area between the lights which had a tiangular shape, was solid and was a different shade (darker) of black than the night sky.  It moved towards Sky Harbor airport as it moved away from us. It made no noise as it went by.We are in the flight path of Sky Harbor and look at the planes as they go over (about 5000 feet).

The blinds that were covering the glass door were closed so all I could see was the light and almost nothing else. Later that night I was still very shaken up when I saw a humanoid figure, I say humanoid because the head was much too big and it was only  about 4 feet tall, it had a amazingly smoth stride, almost like it was walking on air. I left the mini-blinds closed out of pure fear so all i ever did see were shadows but I know what I saw wasn&apos;t human.I&apos;ve been afraid to report it out of fear my family would think I was nuts, because the next day when I told my family none of them belived me.For this reason I ask that you not call and only contact me be mail or e-mail,((Name deleted))((NUFORC:  Similar incident reported by Cameron, MO, Police Dept. for 21JN95.))"
19971114,19971115,"McMinnville, OR",formation,approx. 10 sec.,"Summary : We were out enjoying the full moon.  These things appeared, from over the hills.  I was the first to see them, and it took me about 3 seconds to speak!  I said, &quot;What the hell is THAT?!&quot;  We all stood up to watch.  Then ran over to the crest of the hill to see if we could see them anymore.  It was an incredible sight.  They came from the West and were heading East.  There were 3 at first, then the last (smallest) faded.  They were beautiful!!  We sat there for another hour, dumbfounded; could hardly speak.There were 3, it seemed.  Each had 3, I think, bright white lights in front of them. I think there may have been something in between those 3 lights, but I couldn&apos;t see it clearly.  One of those 3 lights seemed to be a bit bigger and brighter than the other two. They each had these &quot;tails&quot; that were golden, and came out of those front lights like perfect rectangles!  I mean, the tops and bottoms were a perfect straight line, and there was golden glittery stuff in them.  The &quot;glitter&quot; was of different sizes, too.  Not all the same size.  And NO glitter was outside of those rectangles!  They were cruising right along, but not zipping by.  They were absolutely silent.  They followed the contour of the land.  It seemed they were about a mile away from us (very hard to judge), so taking that into consideration, with my hand as a guide, I&apos;d say they were about 6&quot; above the horizon.  The first two were overlapping each other, but the 3rd, and smallest, was behind a bit.  I could se! e it more clearly.  I thought about reporting it, but didn&apos;t know who to call!  Then, as one of the women was driving home, she heard on the radio that there&apos;d been sightings all the way up to Seattle!  The Oregonian tried to say it was &quot;Space Junk&quot;. A rocket!!

It didn&apos;t have any blinking beacon lights, and we could not make out shape.  The 4 lights were orange/yellow color, somewhat bright, and and they were positioned in the shape of a diamond around the object.  It was very low, compared to most aircraft that fly, at night, and made no sound.  We viewed it for about a 7 or 8 second duration, in which time it just flew over our heads and over the trees out of our view.  I do not know what the object was,because I figured that if it was airplane flying at night, it would have beacons, which the object i saw did not.  And it went very slow for the altitude it was at, which must not have bee more than a few hundred feet up.  To this day, i have never again seen an air-plane or jet fly at night with no blinking beacons and lights at the head, each wing tip, and tail."
19971128,19971203,"Lake Geneva, WI",fireball,abt 1 hr,"Summary : Follow-up to article in Chicago Sun Times 12/3/97 re &quot;Fireball&quot; in Will Co, Illinois 12/30.  Saw similar in Lake Geneva, WI 11/28/97 around 7:30pm.  Appeared to be an elxposion or electrical fire; presented with a huge red-orange glow that pulsated and flickered, but without sound.  Saw no craft, but noticed three electrical surges during this time period.  No reports of downed aircraft, substation fires or explosions to local authorities.  If you saw any similar display please report it here.After finishing dinner 11/28/97, a friend and I were watching TV in a condo on Lake Como near Lake Geneva Wisconsin.  There were suddenly three power surges/interruptions in rapid succession, but without any sound of explosive nature.  I got up to check out the electrical system, and noticed a huge pulsating red-orange glow to the northeast appearing to be just beyond the tree line near the lake.  However, no sound could be heard only the strange pulsating, flickering red-orange glow.  We went out to the balcony, but could not determine any more about the visualization.  We heard only one distant siren, but observed several autos heading down our cul de sac and on the roads nearby.  So we apparently were not the only ones to see this occurrence.  Since the weather was inclement, we did not got out to pursue this any further.  Unfortunately, we did not report this event to local authorities either.  I have since called the local police, but without any result.  I have contacted the Sun Times reporter in hopes of discussing his article and what we saw.  Possibly there is some reasonable explanation, but it seemed to be very strange and unworld-like!  The sighting in Will Co Illinois on Sunday 11/30 had similar characteristics.  The observer, a local businessman and pilot, reported seeing a brilliant &quot;fireball&quot; about the size of a full moon descend straight down form the clouds at about 125-150mph.  Within 20 seconds it disappeared. Authorities could find no evidence of any downed craft or debris.  Our experience was similar except that we saw no object/craft/etc and the color display lasted for about one hour.  The pulsating/flickering reached intensities that almost totally illuminated the night sky; then suddenly it would stop, start up again, vary in intensity, then flicker and pulsate wildly!  All without any sound!  My first impression was of some sort of electrical fire/explosion, space debris, a meterorite, or possible a UFO!  This event was witnessed by two adult males, approximately 50 years old, ! who had not been drinking, taking drugs, or otherwise mind altered!  One is a business man, the other(myself) a medical professional and student pilot.  This seemed too bizzare an incident not to report to someone; maybe you can shed some light on all this!!"

They would descend, go left, bo right, go back up, go down again, and disappear. To me what I thought it was, was the military testing missles. I got seven friends who all saw the same thing.

It was late at night and we were going a little over the speed limit.  When I noticed a object flying in front of me, just off the road.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, then I noted that it wasn&apos;t making any sound and the lights on the aircraft were unconventional in that they rotated around the craft instead of flashing in place.  There were three colors of lights, I remember blue and green with either red or white lights.  They were rotating from my left to my right on the vehicle, which appeared as a dark shadow against the night sky.  The object was within a hundred yards of me and was cigar shaped, roughtly 20 feet wide and 8 feet with no wings or any appendages.  It was flying about 20 feet off the ground  In an attempt to get closer I speeded up to 90 miles an hour and the craft stayed in relative position to me.  Suddenly, the ship instantly speeded off to the nort!h and disappeared over a hill.  It moved with incredible speed.Suddenly my head lights went out.  I took my foot off the gas pedal and started breaking my vehicle.  I pressed the pedal a few times when the headlights came on again.  I was going to excelerate when they went off again.

I was looking towards the SE. There was no sound. Several small airplanes also crossed over head that night, and those were quite loud. No light reflected on the low cloud cover, as did the many airplanes I saw that night, indicating it was very low in the sky. One could clearly see the airplanes white, red and blue flashing lights in distinct formation. What I saw actually became obscurred behind the trees in my yard at one point. It appeard to be only about 1 mile away, traveling over Bothell Way!The above description captures most of the information. I wish I had been more conscient of looking at relative surrounds to get a better idea of the objects size. I would say it was close to half the size of a lightbulb at 10 ft from the observer. I was very keen to observe the airplanes that night, to base my observations a the conditions and weather circumstances that night. It proved to me that it was definitely NOT an airplane, It was also not weather related. I do not believe it was an asteroid of some sort. There was no tail that I could see.I have lived in my house, where I observed this, for over 7 years. Occasionally airplanes on the horizon &quot;fool&quot; me into thinking they are not airplanes, when they come straight towards me, and their WHITE light seems unusually bright, and they dont appear to move. However, eventually they change course and I can see their distinctive colored lights and patters. In fact what I saw entered my vision from my left and crossed to my right. It never came straight at me. It&apos;s light was consistent in radiance.My background: I am a 32 year old female, and a graphic designer and artist. I will send you an illustration of what I saw. I may even be able to send you an actual animation, for that is also something I do for a living! I consider myself extremely open-minded to things of this nature, but to this point in my life I have never seen anything like what I saw June 6th!

As I walk past the patio door I look out and saw a inverted triangle of soft golden white light. It was moving at about 60-70mph north along the flight path for Reno Cannon International Airport. At first I thought It was a planes landing lights, but I saw No blinking transponder! I stepped out side and the city was unusually quite. I listened and could hear no engine or jet noise! That is when I knew it was no plane! The flight path Is about 3 miles from my house and I can hear every plane that lands or takes off, and I have watched hundereds of planes take off and land in the 33 years I have lived here. I watched it move from just over the Reno Hilton Hotel, which is about 4-5 miles south west of my house, untill It was just over the dark line of my neighbors house due west off me when it just blinked off! At that distance I would estimate the size to be about 100 by 100 ft. The sides of the triangel were equal and the golden white light was soft enough that the glow did not distort the shape of the object. It was flying level at about a thousand ft. I own a dental laboratory and am use to paying attention to small details. It had travelled about 5 miles from the time I sppotted it untill it vanished about 90 sec. later. It travelled slow and level, it did not turn, pulsate or do any thing unusual except blink off with out even saying goodby. I thought that was very rude. They have the nerve to fly over, get people all excited then leave with out so much as even a thank you."

It looked far-away, it had trees in front of it. I had my brother look at it and he thought it was the moon. But I told him to watch it and he said it couldn&apos;t be since it was changing shape and color. I watched it and it kept getting smaller, then larger. When it got small it turned yellow and then it turned really dark outside. When it got big it started changing shapes an and colors, and outside got lit up. Then it disappeared. Then a couple minutes later, it came back and turned into a baseball field shape, there was a blue and red light coming off it. The middle was missing, like a ring. The object was white and lit up.

Six of us noticed it from a balcony at a party. I am a working daily journalist. With me were two Oceanside city council members. This object &quot;floated&quot; north for about two or three minutes, then stopped. After about a minute or so, it began moving back south-southwest over the water. Altitude was hard to determine, but it appeared to be climbing, albeit ever-so slowly. At one point, a small &quot;spark&quot; like object slowly fell from the main object. Through biconculars I was able to see four (4) distinct lights in a diamond shape. This object slowly faded from sight directly above our city&apos;s Pier. I honestly thought it was a balloon someone had set afire and let drift, but it wouldn&apos;t have burned that long and, because of our off-shore breeze, which was slight that night blowing inland, no balloon would have drifted p!arallel against the wind, then reverse course. Yes, we were at a party. No, no one was drunk. In fact, at least two of the people had nothing to drink.One object.Orange (as in fire) in color.At first appeared to be burning.Binocs revealed four (4) distinct lights.Object &quot;floated&quot; slowly at about a speed of 20 to 40 knots in a northernly direction over the California coastline near the city harbor of Oceanside.Speed was tough to determine because altitude appeared to be at about 500 to 600 feet. But the longer watched, the more it seemed to be gaining in altitude.Altitude: 500 to 600 feet.A second object &quot;drifted&quot; off to the southeast for about what seemed to be a short distance, as if it were a spark falling away, but then it seemed to hover in mid-air.Observers:1.

As I watched it, I ruled out the possibility of a plane or fire work.Well, I was standing outside watching the firecrackers go off through binoculars, when i noticed something in the air. I focused in on it, and i saw that it wasn&apos;t a plane. it had red/orange lights on it, and around it. it was just kind of hovering, not moving like you see a plane. Then I lost site of it. I scanned the sky, and found it. It had shooted up at a very fast speed, and at a really steep angle. Now it was hovering over a field. I went inside to get my camera, and when i came back outside, it was gone. It never appeared again. Also, this has nothing to do with it, but a picture taked in the 50&apos;s of a UFO, well the people are my neighbors!

This is something I have needed to talk about for a long time.  The event happened as follows: Clear spring day me and friend working on car  (no drugs or acho involved) and I broke a spark plug.  We had to go into town (approx 7 miles away).  I lived out in a very unpopulated area next to a Boy Scout Wilderness Camp.  Houses are several miles apart.  On the way into town about a mile and a half from my house I turn right to take the road to the Hiway into town and there sitting on the left side of the road, a road I drove at least twice a day for the past several years was a UFO.  We pulled up alongside and stopped, it was huge.  70-90 feet across 25-35 high.  Color:  dark gray, not shiny but almost a dull or parkerized type finish, smooth but not shiny smooth.  Typical of a nitrided or titaimum applied finished metal.  Shape.  Clearly saucer like with rounded edges and viewing ports (round) at the top.  Lite smoke or steam from the grass was drifting up around the UFO.  The UFO seemed to be bathed in a glow, even tho this was around noon on a clear day.  The glow was almost ultraviolet, it seemed to be glowing around the edges.  We stopped and looked at it, it being about 30 feet from the truck, then we &quot;got the hell out of there&quot;.  We went down the road for about 3/4 of a mile then we went back and it was gone.  We got out and there was nothing but a large depression in the grass where it had set and the ground was warm to the touch.  As the days went by, I noticed the grass died in a large round area where the UFO had sat down.I have thought of this many times since 1964 and every once in a great while I see the guy who was with me, we have never talked about this to anyone since it happened.

19940515,19970310,"Fallon, NV",light,45 seconds,"Summary : USN trained weather observer sighted 3 &quot;solid&quot; colored lights, two red, one white, moving south to north silently and periodically&quot;rocketing&quot; forward at a tremendous burst of speed, independently and in unison.While on active duty and attached to NAS Fallon, NV, I witnessed 3 strange lights cross the field during the spring of 94&apos;. I don&apos;t remember the exact date but I do remember the day and time. It was a Saturday evening minutes after 18:00, the field had just closed. I stepped outside of the &quot;old&quot; tower, which houses the weather office and flight filing services,to observe the twilight. It was very quiet as was typical for a Saturday evening after the field closes, no planes, no engines, no cars, you could hear a pin drop (almost). I was facing east looking at the mountains which are about 35 miles away. The objects or lights caught my eye to the south and I turned my head to view them. I saw three &quot;solid&quot; coloredlights traveling abreast, moving north, at a relatively high rate of speed, they appeared to be about 2500&apos; AGL and about 10 miles south. The two on the outside were red and the one in the middle was white (unfourtunately I am colored blind and cannot be 100% sure of the colors but two were definately dark and one was light). The objects wers solid coloredand appeared to be &quot;lit&quot; or illuminated rather than reflected light. I observed no strobes or marker lights of the kind you would expect to see on conventional aircraft and they were silent. I could not discern any particular shape or other features of any kind, they just appeared to be circular or oval.  About ten seconds into the sighting the red or &quot;outside&quot;objects seemed to jet or rocket forward at a tremendous rate of speed for 3-4 seconds then, just as abrubtly, resume their previous rate of speed. At the same instant that the red ones slowed down the white one, which had been in the center duplicated the maneuver, catching up and resuming it&apos;s previous position in the center.  This happened two more timesand by this time the craft were to my north and heading out of site. When they were abreast or directly to my east, they seemed to be about 5-7 miles away. At this particular site you can see about 75 miles to the south and about 100 miles to the north. The three things that struck me as strange were 1)The solid colored lighting with no detectable conventionalmarkings or lighting. 2)The strange and abrubt maneuvering. 3) The sound, there wasn&apos;t any. At the time I was a USN trained weather observer/forecaster with 10 years of experience. I had been working at this particular location for a little over two years and was used to identifing military and commercial aircraft of all types. I later asked a local resident, aformer WWII Army Air Corp veteran who still flew privately, if he had ever seen anything unusual in this area. He said yes but would not elaborate. I&apos;ve thought that maybe they were something from Dreamland or Area 51, which is reportedly just to the south of this location, approximately halfway to Nellis AFB. But who knows, I may have imagined the whole thing."

It covered the complete sky at a speed slightly slower than a falling star.. but this was not a falling star.My friend and I were floating on rafts on Pickeral lake not too far from Sprinkle Road and Kilgore.. by a Winery in Climax Scotts.  We were just relaxing on the lake, it was quiet on the lake and were were anckored down so we wouldn&apos;t move.  The night was slightly chilly so we didn&apos;t go swimming like usual, but the stars were very clear, and everything was rather calm.  I saw something moving very fast across the sky at first I thought it was a shooting star because I have seen a number of them at that lake, but this did not dissipate like meteors do.  Then I noticed that it was making strange and sharp turns and jumps side to side, I alerted my friend who then quickly picked up on the sight.  He saw the strange jigs and jumps it was making and the speed at which it was traveling.  We were both amazed because we had never seen anything like that before.  We have told a couple of people but most just say &quot;Oh.. that&apos;s nice.&quot;"

It had a tail above it. Then 2 other objects appeared moving toward the first one. They all had vapor trails, or tails.  Then, they all three changed course, moving together horizontal to the earth, from our left to right.  They stopped at one point and appeared to hang in the sky.  We had parked the car to look and I measured one of the objects against a tree limb, and it did not move for some minutes.  Gradually, they grew smaller as they moved away, but the orange color was clearly visible until they disappeared behind a mountain.      The conditions:  it was aclear evening, at sunset.

19970812,19970813,"Canyon Country, CA",light,about 1 minute,"Summary : Two adults witness three dim yellow lights flying in rough triangle formation, moving from north to south.  The three lights jockey for position, speeding ahead, falling behind, and crossing over each other.My husband and I are working artists in the fields of traditional and computer animation. While meteor-watching in our backyard on the evening of Aug 12 he spotted three small lights moving just below the pole star.  I saw them, then, and we both watched as they moved, a little faster than a commercial aircraft, from north to south, where they disappeared from sight behind the hills.  The lights began in a rough line, from top to bottom, with the middle light slightly ahead of the others. As they crossed the sky, one would speed ahead, then fall behind as another sped ahead, and at intervals one would cross over another in almost a playful manner. The impression I received at first was that of a three-cornered object tumbling, but when the lights passed in front of stars it was clear they were distinct from one another and not part of a larger solid object, as the stars were clearly visible between the lights. The lights were about the brighness of the dimmest of the stars visible, and a warm yellow color. This same night we had observed several meteors and several commercial aircraft. These lights were at a lower altitude and exhibited vastly different behavior than the commercial craft we saw, and were definitely not meteorites, as they were neither bright nor fast enough and left no trails."

19841107,19970716,"Carrollton (6 miles west of, on Garrett Circle), GA",other,10-12 minutes,"Summary : For 10 minutes, moving from north to south 25 feet above the ground, moving at 1 to 2 miles an hour, a 150 ft tall, 30 ft wide vertically fying object marked by blind white lights, but no surface illumination of the craft flew over our house at 364 Garrett Circle.  It vaguely had the shape of a giant iol rig, but had no clearly discernible surface despite the arc-bright lights.  A deafening sound of an electric generator, at possibly 90 decibels, with extreme low bass wave undertones was heard, but no down drafts, wind, jet blast or discernable means of levitation (moving wind) was observThe 150 ft tall, 30 ft wide craft, vaguely resembling an extremely brightly lit, vertically flying oil rig or wide-width broad cast tower, flew over our house at 364 Garret Circle, at 2:30 Am Nov 7, 1984, 6 miles west of Carrollton, Georgia. Initially the object rose up from a forest 100 yeards to the north of our house, and was spinning head over heels vertically in the air, making deafening rumbling and electrical generator sounds.  It was the deafening waves of sound and the bright lights that woke both me and my wife up.  I am a fairly prominent political scientist in my field, a two-time Fulbright scholar, a Ph.D. with long interests in astronomy, and my wife has a Masters in public administration.  I am a Scout leader, and a responsible college administrator now (1997).  My wife and I instantly woke up, flew to the front yard ard, and observed the craft cease spinning and it floated towards us 25 to 30 feet above the ground in a VERTICAL flying position.  You must imagine it is unreasonable to think that aerodynamics allow such a huge object to fly without wings, moving air, jet-blast, or any discernible means of propulsion, to fly vertically in position, but move horizontally at 1 to 2 miles an hour.  We watched for 10 to 12 minutes as the craft approached, passed over our pecan tree and house, clearing it by 8 to 10 feet, and floating south-southwest, it slowly disappeared over the horizon.  The craft was followed within about 100 ft by two approx 10 to 15 ft in diameter, red translucent and free-floating globes.  The large craft had immensely bright lights (as bright as an arc welders light), none of which were directional. The craft passed slowly over our front yard, from the forest across the street north, above our pecan tree, and our one story home, passing approximately 1 to 15 ft above the! house.  I could walk along with the craft across our yard slowly and keep up with it, until I hit our back fence line 70 yards behind the house.  I could easily see for several minutes the craft from no more than 20 feet below it.  As hard as I tried, I could not see past the bright lights to a surface of the craft.  This was extremely weird, since a street light illuminates the surface of it&apos;s pole, but these immensely bright lights would not illuminate the surface of the craft, which appeared as black mat invisible.  The lights were randomly distributed, with maybe 3 dozen lights, 5% red-colored.  I stress that the craft had NO WIND DRAFTS,  no down drafts, no jet stream or sound, no discernible flying mechanism -- just a 90 decibel level sound of electric whine as with a giant generator, and waves and waves of deep bass undertones.  The translucent globes had no discernible content inside, and were randomly floating behind the large craft, following it but not gaining on i! t, nor attached to each other or the large craft in any way.  They floated like directionally motivated soap bubbles, following the craft.  The craft was so near me I could have lobbed an apple upwards with a hand and hit it.  I recall being extremely intense about observing the environment, watching how the craft flew almost over our pecan tree, and cast moving shadows through it but did not disturb its branches in any way -- all to verify the physical reality of the observation.  My wife observed it with me, but for 1 minute moved into the house to flash lights from the porches at it to see if it would respond, to no avail.  She immediately came back out to observe it with me again as we moved to the backyard.  We kept confirming to each other we were awake verbally, but we agreed not to describe it to each other until we independently wrote a description up, with drawings -- without conversation -- and traded the descriptions to check each others observations.  The only dis! crepancy I can remember in our descriptions is that she thought there were a different number of red globes than I (I remember two, I think she recalled three, or one, but not two).  We were up discussing our reports to each other until one half hour later, we heard the drone of helicopter and airplan engines outside.  We went outside and coul clearly see that 1/2 mile to the east two black and low-flying military tyope helicopters, with forward looking light beams, were accompanying a low- and slow flying two engine plane.  They circled around our territory in a radius of about 1 mile, and criss-crossed once going from north to south and followed the trajectory of the crafts which had vanished.  We advertised in the Carrollton paper about a week later for other potential observers, but got no takers.  We interviewed neighbors, one of which was a pilot immediately to the north of us, but noone reported any perceptions or sightings.  We called the local sherrif&apos;s office, and th! e Carrollton police that morning to ask if anyone reported anything to them, and they said no reports were turned in.  At one point we gave an interview to someone who may have been connected to Mufon -- at least he was a friend of a friend who said he had connections with some reporting organization, but we never heard anything back from him.  We possibly could trace back who that person was, as he was a son of an elderly woman in our faith, who is now deceased.  We simply had NOONE to report the information to in those days of no internet or organized reporting networks.  I have read sporadically in the UFO literature, but have never run across a similar description.  I would be grateful to know of similar descriptions in a sighting.  The only ones that vaguely resemble ours are two reports in Alien Update by Tim Good by two UK couples in the early 1990s, but their sighting was of an orange colored rectangular (vertical) craft, and the description was not too close, or clear! ly written.  That night was slightly hazy if I remember correctly, with no winds.  We aver very curious to this day as to the purpose behind the military recon helicopters and plane.  I would like to request public anonymity, but I would talk to a researcher, as I am sure my wife would.  I attempted to use a camera, but I had no film in it at the time, to my regret. ((Name and number deleted)).  Sincere thanks.  Again, I WILL talk to a researcher, but I&apos;d prefer at this time that my name not be used, until I am convinced of the credentials of a researcher."

The body was slender with long arms and legs, a small head and to the best of my recall, large eyes.  The body was reported to be 3.5 to 4 feet in lenght with silver skin that was deteriorating (presumably over the winter).  The news sources reported that the remains had been taken to Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mi,for examination.  Suspiciously, there was never again any mention of this unusual find in the newspaper, on TV or over the radio.  It would seem that the media was instructed to drop the story, even though it was one having great public appeal and would draw large audiences.

During this time the oddest thing about this, was there was no noise at all. There was no moon to backlight this so we could only see the lights. I thought perhaps because there was no noise that it might have been a pedal plane that I saw on the discovery channel once. It appeared to be about 1000 feet in the air.

19560715,19970704,"Yellowstone Park (near South entrance), WY",disk,60 sec,"Summary : Three year old boy witnesses from back the seat of a car the approach of three flying disks.I am sending this because I your site I found out that there was a UFO flap in 1956.  Until today I was unaware of this.In the summer of 1956 my parents and I lived in Wyoming.  They decided to go to Yellowstone and it was there that I saw what I am telling you now.  Even though I was three I recall much about the trip because Yellowstone was such a special place.  I think my parents were probably very impressed so it stuck in my mind.  Anyway we had spent the night parked along the road, not in a camp ground or in a cabin.  My mother recalled that it had been a very spooky night, very dark.  As we left the park the next day we traveled south along a narrow highway.  We were in a black Hudson, and I was laying in the back window-well (it was my favorite place to ride on long trips).  As I looked up at the sky and trees I saw three objects coming up from behind us about 100 feet above us.  They followed behind the car staying in between the trees that lined both sides of the road.  I remember I had seen them as we were coming around a curve.  They looked like metal painted orange with yellow rib!s on their undersides.  Each was a disk about 20 feet wide and on top was a dome with a large glass or window.  In each was a human like figure.  One disk pulled away while the other two closed in on the car dropping to about 30 feet altitude.  The disk nearest the car tilted downwards at an angle so that I could see the pilot clearly.  In my three year old memories I recall thinking of the pilot in the lead craft as a HELICOPTER PILOT wearing dark sun-glasses.  My family at that time was too poor to go to movies and we did not own a TV, so the only thing I could relate the objects to were helicopters.  I waved at the pilot and he held up his left hand palm facing me and waved his hand kind of slowly back and forth.  I jumped down into the back seat and leaned over to tell my parents that there were HELICOPTERS behind us.  They looked out the windows but the objects were gone.  All I recall is that they didn&apos;t really question me about it much and dropped it.  This memory alway!s stayed with me and was never forgotten.  I didn&apos;t dwell on it but every time I saw our Yellowstone pictures or recalled the trip I also recalled the 3 crafts.  However it wasn&apos;t until I was about 10 that it suddenly dawned on me (being older and wiser) THOSE WERE NOT HELICOPTERS!  DO you know it was not until last year (1996) that it suddenly dawned on me that those guys might not have been wearing sunglasses.  Last year I did a little study and began to notice that appearances of 3 saucers with the outlines I had seen also seemed to turn up in other areas.  But there is more to my story.  neither of my parents recalled the incident (which seems normal since at the time I had told them it was helicopters and hence it wouldn&apos;t have been something to stick in their memory for several years.  Note: in about 1989 my mother called me in a panic one day to tell me a dream she&apos;d had (my mother almost never recalled dreams and claimed she never dreamed).  She told me that she had dr!eamed that a UFO was over her house and that beings were coming into her bedroom and surrounding her.  But she said she woke up to hear a real noise over her house: it was a National Guard helicopter (there was a helicopter training base north of town: Norman Okla.).  What I wondered about was the connection of the helicopter noise to the intense UFO dream she was having."

19970510,19970513,"Los Padres National Forest (Ventura Co.), CA",other,5min.,"Summary : Observed two objects. One with flashing multi-colored lights, the second, somewhat bell-shaped with two white-yellow lights. They hovered above us and appeared to be observing us.On May 10, 1997 we were camping in a remote part of Los Padres National Forest. Our party consisted of myself, my wife ((Three names deleted)). Our location was a campsite known as Thorn Meadows, approximately 20 miles west of the small town of Lake of the Woods, in Ventura county. The elevation there is approximately 4000 ft., the winds were calm, the sky was clear, the stars were bright. A crescent moon was descending. We had camped at this site on two other occasions and although it is very remote, this was the first time we had not seen any other people in the area all day.At approximately 10:45 PM, we were finishing cleaning up after dinner. We had a fire burning. ((Name deleted)), pointing to the northeastern sky, said something to effect of, &quot;Hey, what is that thing? I&rsquo;ve been watching it for a while and I can&rsquo;t figure out what it is.&quot; I looked in the direction he was pointing and I saw a flashing light, at approximately 50 degrees. At first I thought it was someone walking down the hill with a flashlight because of the erratic way it was flashing. I then realised that this could not be because there was no hill in that direction. After watching it for approx. 30 seconds, I realised two things: one, the flashing light it was emitting was rapidly changing color; two, it was moving in an unpredictable, erratic manner that could not possibly have been an airplane or helicopter. It was moving in a way that seemed to indicate it was searching for something. At that instant, I realised immediately it was not an ordinary aircraft. The object then changed dire!ction and came directly at us in a straight line moving at a high rate of speed which I could not quantify. The object then stopped in plain view, at roughly the same angle to the horizon. I found this very disturbing. Then ((Name deleted)) said, &quot;Look, there&rsquo;s another one.&quot; I turned my head and saw to the southeast, at approximately 30 degrees, another object that had, to me, appeared out of nowhere and was now hovering almost directly above us. This object was different from the other, it had two bright, white-yellow lights and seemed vaguely bell-shaped. Both objects were completely silent and up there you can hear a plane from miles away. I had the distinct but inexplicable sense that they were looking at us. I could not estimate the size or altitude of the objects, but the second object had a similar appearance to a helicopter hovering at maybe 1500 ft. In other words, it was clearly visible.I was quite frightened but ((Name deleted))was absolutely terror-stricken. She was completely resolute that we needed to leave immediately. Seeing the second object sitting up above us was all I needed to make up my mind to go. In seconds we gathered up the dogs, extinguished the fire and got in the truck and I drove as fast as I could down the dirt road. At one point, my wife saw the first object off to the right of our vehicle and believes it was following us. I did not see it and so cannot verify. Later I realised that we were in a classic abduction scenario and I&rsquo;m glad we left, although I wonder if I would have had it not been for my wife&rsquo;s urging. I also realise that if they really wanted us, we wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance. We spent the night in a motel room in town and went back early in the morning to gather up our things.Let me give you some background here for a frame of reference. I am a skeptical person by nature. In my youth I heard the stories of UFOs and thought, &quot;Well, that could be, but I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.&quot; Then, a number of years ago I read Communion which led to my reading a few other books on the subject. Then I realised what was really going on. However, I am most certainly not one of those people that goes around trying to spot UFOs, in fact the opposite is true. After reading Communion, I hoped to never see one of those things. I have spent a lot of time looking at the night sky and have never, until now, seen anything that was completely inexplicable. I am convinced that there is no way these objects that we witnessed could have been some experimental aircraft. The way they accelerated, stopped, changed direction, I don&rsquo;t believe that a human would be able to withstand the g forces that would have been generated."

The lights started moving slowly to our right, and then went out, kind of like turning out a light.Me and my two best friends were sitting out in my back yard, because we wer having a sleep over, at around 10:00 p.m. We had got a nice conversation going, when all of a sudden Kim, one of my friends, pointed out toward the sky. Me and Megan turned our heads. Staring in amzement we saw five big, bright lights, too bright to be stars. We all noticed that the lights were arranged as the points of a pentagon. I belive that there was only one object. The lights moved rather slow to the right, then disapeared. It all seamed so fast. Right after that we ran inside, and started writting stuff down, like the time, the shape of the lights and other stuff. I remembered my dad, and my brother talking about a contest, and how they were stuck on a question. thats when I noticed this report place. I ran to the basement turned on the computer and came here.      My two friends as far as I know are very trust worthy. I have known them all through elementary school."

19971215,19971225,"Marlette, MI",circle,approx. 3 minutes,"Summary : A large solid noiseless object, possibly round, with four lights, passed slowly over a residential neighborhood in Marlette, MI.  It had two large steady lights, a yellowish white light trailed by a large red light.  Two small lights strobed simultaneously, one on each side of the craft.A large golden light was observed in the eastern sky at 23:35 pm EST in Marlette, Michigan.  The witness, a 52 year old professional, was frightened as she knew instantly that this light, coming towards her home, was not an aircraft.  Her son is an ET experiencer that has worked with Michigan MUFON representatives and has had several close-proximity UFO sightings himself.  He was out of state at the time of this sighting.  The woman, opened her doorwall to go onto her patio to look up at the approaching object but became scared and retreated back indoors.  She again opened her door to go out but again retreated indoors.  As this object slowly appoached she could distinguish other lights on it.  She heard absolutely no sound from it through the sighting.  As the object came nearer she could make out two very large steady lights that seemed to be structures lit from inside.  A large yellowish white light trailed closely by a large steady red light.  There were two small blinking lights, one on each edge at the 3 o&apos;clock and 9 o&apos;clock positions (she believes this was a solid round object although she could not actually see the structure).  As it silently drifted over the house at the speed of a small single engine aircraft, which is common in Marlette, she remembered her son&apos;s insistance that she should measure any object with her two fingers at arm&apos;s length.  The object was approximately 2 1/2 to 3 inches at arm&apos;s length.  She ran back in doors frightened as it passed over.  The sighting duration was approximately 2-3 minutes.  It should also be noted that her husband had reported a UFO to Michigan MUFON at the beginning of December.  His sighting was of a bank of approximately seven bright lights that hovered stationary at 35 degrees from his parked car and then vanished.  This occurred in Peck, MI. I am the witness&apos;s son.."

It was dusk. As we neared afield, I saw a large saucer, grey with alarge white highly luminescent dome on top.There were what appeared to be portholes or windows around it. My sister was not paying attention as we sped past it but I started yelling &apos;Oh my God! Look over the trees! Seeit? See it?&apos; She said she saw a very bright object in the sky but could not quite make itout. By the time she looked up it was pretty much obscured. I turned the car around as soon as I hada chance to get another look, but it was no longer there.I have also seen instances of bizarre lights in the sky which appear to be above the clouds, and they make really odd formations. At first I thought they were searchlights that stores and discos usesometime, but the stream of light coming down from the sky that usually tells youthese are earth-based lights were notpresent. The formations these lights created could not have been made by aircraft.There were usually four to five lights.At some point, they would all convert together to create a single point of light and thensplit up again. I saw these on numerous occaisions when heading east on Route 2 nearConcord, MA, going toward Boston last year.On one occaision, my sister Paula also saw these.It is interesting to note, I guess, that Hanscom AFB is off Route 2 (actually, it&apos;s on2A), in Bedford, MA, which is just north ofConcord. I believe Dover AFB in NH is closeby as well.What took me so long to report these incidents? I did not know who to go to. I did not want to contact Hanscom for fear ofridicule.

19970915,19971101,"Farrell, PA",disk,3-5 min,"Summary : Low-flying, object prior to west to east moving severe storm on PA/OH border.I was returning home from work on a Friday afternoon.  A major thunder storm was approaching from the west.  Hozel road heads north from Swamp Road.  It then takes a 90 degree turn west for about 800 yards before intersecting Radio Road, which runs north.  About 300 yards prior to the intersection, I observed an object about 700-800 yards distant at tree-top level.  I took no immediate notice because there is a large blue-green water tower located in the general direction.  This tower, however, is only visible from Radio Road about 200 yards north of the mentioned intersection.  When I took deliberate notice, I observed a disk-shaped object with a small cylindrical superstructure centered on the upper half of the disk. This structure&apos;s top came to a point.  The object was silver in color but didn&apos;t shine; like lead. I saw no movement or heard no noise.  I glanced at the road then back at the tree-tops and the craft was gone.  This had taken seconds so I was not sure what had just happened (or if it happened.)  As I turned north on Radio Road, I glanced to my left, over a farmer&apos;s  field and again saw the object, this time almost totally below the tree-tops and on a sharp (45 degree+) angle (north side lower than south side of craft.) This was at about 300 yards.  From this point I could also see the water tower.  It was clear they were not the same object. The flying object did, however, closely resemble the top of the water tower in shape (definetly not in color or direction.) I turned my attention back to the road and once again, the object was gone.  Several months later, I was relating this story to my Brother-in-law and his girlfriend.  The girl got a little upset.  Talking to her, I found that her bedroom window looked out over this same field from it&apos;s northern edge.  She said she had occasion to witness bright lights coming from the field at night, more than once."

The object faded out and the mountain valley had the odor of smoke.My brothers were standing on the back porch, around 10:00 pm. One of them noticed a slow moving firey orange light traveling in a north to south direction in the eastern sky. He called it to the attention of my other brother, so both of them witnessed the site. My brothers noticed that our horses became excited as the intensity of the object&apos;s brightness decreased. The object appeared to burn out and the mountain valley appeared to become foggy. The odor smoke was quite strong and noted by others who had no idea of what had just happened. I, myself, witnessed the smokey odor and the fogginess of the mountian valley (as seen through the security lights at night). Because of the smokiness, we were concerned about the possibility of a fire, so we reported this event to the sheriff&apos;s office by calling 911. No noise was noted when the object disappeared, so we assumed that the object disintegrated in the air and that there was no impact. We believe this object was possibly a meteriote, and would like to report this to whoever would be interested. Please forward this report to the proper parties."

Shortly after takeoff witnessed a black, semi-matte, metallic craft fly right past the airplane through the window.  It was traveling east - opposite direction of the plane - and was visible as it flew past for about 6 seconds.  Size and distance from plane couldn&apos;t accurately be determined, but it was incredibly close to the plane. It had a triangular upper half, but the lower half was rounded and dome-shaped.  This occured at 28,000 feet (the pilot had announced the plane&apos;s altitude only minutes before.)  3 to 4 other people also witnessed the object as it flew by.  It was daylight and it was clear enough to see the object had definate edges and form (i.e. it wasn&apos;t just a dark shape seen out of the corner of the eye.)

After noticing, I jokingly said, &quot;Hey guys, I think i see a UFO!&quot;  This was more of a gut fealing than a joke.  My four friends then saw what I was looking at. Since we were right by Skyharbor Airport, there were commercial planes flying East and West.  The red lights seamed to be lower in altittued and oblivious to the fact that it was flying directly toward commercial aircraft traffic.  They were in a V formation, three red lights in front, two red lights behind and to each side.  As they moved closer to us we moved into our parking lot.  There seemed to be no &quot;body&quot; to this aircraft, only lights.  When directly overhead, it was so large, it wouldnt fit it into direct vision, I had to shift my eyes to see the entire object.  At this time, we realized that this was not one object, it was five, or more.  The red light in back and to my right, was trailing slightly.  In talking !with my co-workers, some say the lights were red, and some say they were orange.  The lights slowly moved to the South, and then they were gone.

We travelled to Porter which is off of HWY 59.  My 11 year old asked &quot;Mom, oh my God, what is that in the sky?&quot;  I turned around at the Kroger right under the underpass.  She sounded frantic.  I looked and safely said&quot;Probably parachutes.&quot;  I drove back to 59 and proceeded to travel slowly on the feeder road going south towards Houston.  I was shocked and amazed at what I saw.  I looked around me and cars were pulling over on the sides of the road to see the objects.  There were about 15-20.  They looked like rocks or meteors floating suspended in the air.  I pulled over at a car dealership on the right and stared at them.  It was so unreal.  Like I was in a movie and it wasn&apos;t really happening.  One of the rocks looked very strange.  They were all at different altitudes and they were moving slowly towards the west/southwest.  I became aware of the fact that these objects could drop strait on our heads at any second,!so I backed out and left.  I turned around at the next exit.  By the time I got back to the spot and on the other side of the road heading north, the last of them could be seen just over the tree tops.  I headed up 1314 to Conroe.  I thought I could see them from the 242 loop, but no luck.  I don&apos;t know where they went or what in the world they were, but I would like to know if something like meteors can come into our atmosphere and float that way.

We were alone at the road and when we stopped to verify it stopped too. It was not a helicopter &apos;cause there were no sound at all and it mooved almost 25 km. so it wasn&apos;t a light comming from the ground neither.We were 4 people comming from a practice session with our salsa band. We had to drive app. 30 km to get home and when we got out of the city the girl in the back saw &quot;something iin the sky&quot; so first we thought that there was a party going on somewhere. But as it was still there 5 minutes later we thought that it could bea car mooving with a light on lthe roof or something like that. But when we realized that it was a forest ti couldn&apos;t be that neither. Therefore, even I, who normally does not belive in such things, started to get nervous. We tried to stop the car to see if we could hear something but no sounds were there besides some birds. The sky was not cloudy but not totally free from clouds neither. There were som kindof fog. But it could not be a helicopter; if it were a helicopter I would have been able to see it above. An det light was not comming from the ground neither. We started the car again an drove app. 10 kmBut as it was &quot;following&quot; us we stopped the car once more. When we stopped the car it stopped too. It was always right beside us. When we passed through a small village we thought that we had lost it, but when we got through it rejoined us beside the road. We were driving from Fos sur Mer to Salon de Provence in South France. The singer who was sitting in the back (the girl who first saw the thing) claimed that she had seen exately the same ting in December last year with 2 friends as they were taking a walk in the forest. But it has only lasted for app. 10 seconds. This time the light followed the car for app. 25 km even when we took some sharp turns and when wh changed the road etc. it was right beside us.The Light:It was round but not like a circle. It was more like some small sqaures of light that was turning first one way and then the other in a smooth way. The center changed size all the time; it was like someting pulsing - like a heart. Around of the center there were the smaller squars of light og allwas turned in the same direction.It was like one of the best science fiction moovies ! It changed size, higth and speed. And it was sure that it followed us because wo drove app. 3 km through the city and made some very sharp turns. If it had been something from the ground id would have had to pass through a forest, a lake and one more forest. If it was comming from the sky it made no sound at all and it could see us even when we drove with the lights out. When we arrived at Salon de Provence it stopped following us and returned to where we came from.We were all affraid as it was clear that this could not be explained. Even the driver who is a non-believer was affraid.The persons in the car:  ((4 names deleted)).

0000,19971202,"Morrice, MI",cigar,3-5 minutes,"Summary : Large and small identical craft hovered at tree top level for several minutes 2- yards from 2 observers in small, rural Michigan community of 500 people.On a warm, clear, dark and moonless summer night (June, July or August ?), circa 1962, my grand mother and I watched in dumbstruck silence as a 100&apos; long object closely resembling a DC-3/6 fuselage sans wings, a tail or exterior lights, approached and hovered over the rural residential community of Morrice, MI at tree-top level. From a distance of 20 yards, the UFO displayed multiple lighted windows ala a commercial airliner of that era....along entire length of body.  After hovering motionless for 1-2 minutes, the tail ramp of craft dropped open in fashion similar to ramps of &apos;60&apos;s military cargo planes and subsequent Boeing 727 aircraft.  A coverall clad, normal sized human looking &quot;man&quot; walked out on the lowered ramp and physically signaled to the  visible pilot of an identical air craft 1/10 the size of the first vessel,that quickly apporached and stopped (hovered) 10 yards aft the larger aircraft.  The smaller aircraft entered the rear of the larger &quot;mother&quot; vessel in a! matter of seconds and the ramp door closed behind it, curtailing the yellow incandescent type light emitted from the larger aircraft&apos;s interior.  After a few moments, the droning RPM&apos;s of the unidentified craft increased as it moved off to the west at an estimated speed of 25 MPH, still just above the tree tops.  Local TV news the following night (Sunday) reported that UFO&apos;s (&quot;Ha!, Ha!) were sighted over Flint and Lansidng the night before.  Morrice is located just about half-way between those two larger cities. Both vessels were dark in color, but presumably metalic.  At first we could only see the outline of the larger vessel, but as our eyes adjusted and focused, we could the vessel rather well against a dark, cloudless, night sky.  The propulsion noise of the large vessel was similar to, yet, different than the sound of two diesel locomotive&apos;s whose engines, side by side, non-synchronously vibrating the air. The larger aircraft, again, lacked both wings and a tail, but was roundly &quot;pointed&quot; in the front akin to the shape of a traditional commercial or military aircraft. In fact, at first sight, I thought I was observing a slow moving airliner.  The shape of the larger vessel(s) in retrospect, was cigar like.  The smaller &quot;scout&quot; or &quot;shuttle&quot; vessel bore a front window large (possibly a clear canopy) enough to evidence a pilots head sillouhetted by background lighting from within the cockpit interior.  The shape of that head appeared to be that of what I would consider a normal hum! an being. The smaller craft could not be heard over the propulsion noise of the larger vessel, accounting perhaps for it&apos;s unexpected appearance out of the completely dark sky.  The beings I observed, looked like ordinary human individuals, the one on the larger craft being approximately 5&apos;8&quot; to 6&apos;0&quot; in height, and again, wearing what I described then at age 12 or 13, coveralls.  I would, today, after having served in the military, refer to the same clothing as a jump suit or a flight suit.  There was nothing extra terrestrial about this sighting.  In fact, the only thing that seemed unusual to me at the time and to this day, was the absence of wings, an air speed too low for even a four place Cesna to stay aloft, the stationary hovering, and the surprising appearance of the second smaller, identical vessel. The event reminded me the recovery of an amphibeous landing craft seen in WWII movies and in photographs. I recently spoke with a retired USAF Colonel, who claimed that &quot;TOP-TOP-SECRET-SECRET&quot; design and testing of aircraft was rumored to be taking place at one or more of the AF bases in Michigan (Wurtsmith, K.A. Sawyer, Kincheloe, Kinross, Selfridge ?) in the nineteen fifties and sixties.  Perhaps that is precisely what my grand mother and I observed.  I can recall being frightened enough by what I saw, that I didn&apos;t walk from the backyard down the driveway to the street where I could have watched the vessel in question fly across two or three hundred more yards of open sky before being obstructed from view by trees and houses.  Oddly, I don&apos;t recall having a conversation about our shared sighting with my grandmother on that eventful night or the next day.  I can clearly remember telling my parents on the following evening upon my return home, about what we saw, and becoming quite excited when the eleven O&apos;clock news backed up my most unusual account."

An Air Force jet was in pursuit.  The metal object was at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.In 1971, when I lived in Spokane, WA, I saw a UFO.  I was finished with my shift as a Registered Nurse at Deaconess Hospital, enroute to meet my fiance.  We planned to see a movie at the Garland Theater on the north end of the city.  It was midweek, a Wednesday or Thursday, and the date may have been 6/10/71.As I drove north up the Monroe Street hill at approximately 3:50 PM (my shift ended at 3:30 PM), I had to put down the sun visor because a bright light was hitting me in the eyes.  When I reached the top of the hill, I stopped for a traffic light.  It was then that I noticed that the bright light was reflecting off a metal flying object that I can only describe as a &quot;flying saucer&quot;.  The surface of the object was metal, the color of aluminum or stainless steel.  The object was round, flat on the bottom, and with a sloped dome in the center.  This &quot;flying saucer&quot; was not high in the sky, but at a low altitude, as if it were about to land.  An Air Force jet of similar size was in pursuit of the UFO at the same altitude and close behind.I thought the jet might be based at nearby Fairchild Air Force Base.When the traffic light turned green, I proceeded on my way and lost sight of the UFO.  I have no explanation as to what it was, only that I have never seen anything like it before or since."
19970522,19970523,"Simi Valley, CA",formation,4 Min.,"Summary : &quot;Delta&quot; shaped group of motionless bright red lights sighted over Simi Valley, Calif.At about 9:25 p.m. on the evening of May 22, 1997 in the Southern California city of Simi Valley (about 25 miles NW of L.A.), while returning home from a Boy Scout meeting, my 12 year old son and I noticed an unusually bright red object in the Northern sky.  We pulled into the parking lot of a local school and exited our vehicle to get a better observation.  What we saw appeared to be not one but a &quot;tight&quot; group of perhaps 10-15 extremely bright red lights in the shape of a flat triangle or &quot;delta&quot; at about 330 degrees (looking towards the Big Dipper constellation).  The objects semed perfectly motionless and emitted a constant bright reddish glow.  We observed no blinking of the lights, nor any other lights of another color (such as white aircraft lights).  After approximately 4-5 minutes of observing these objects, they appeared to suddenly dim and then suddenly disappeared from sight as if they lifted vertically at an extremely high rate of speed.  We heard no particular !sounds during this event.   We then returned home and shortly thereafter telephoned NUFORC to report the event as aforesaid.   We have not previously observed such an event as this and are very &quot;impressed&quot; at whatever our sighting was.   We have since accesses the NUFORC web site and have noticed very similar sightings in North America in the recent past.  We would be pleased to further discuss our sighting with NUFORC."

I finished and went for a walk on the sand. A long wooden stair case led down the cliffs to the beach and the waves appeared to be in the cliffs&apos; shadow from Highway 1 headlights. I saw a series of lights glowing from behind the waves about 5 ? feet apart and 8 ? inches in diameter. It/they gave the appearance of portholes on the side of a submersible. I have no explanation.

19970528,19970720,"Urubamba (outside Cusco, Peruvian Andes) (Peru),",light,few seconds,"Summary : A fast moving &quot;body of Light&quot; sweeps over us as we star watch in the Sacred Valley of the Incas outside Cusco Peru at an elevation of l0,000&apos;  The night was clear, cold and very dark (no moon).  The &quot;Light&quot; was seen coming from the southwest directly over a 600&apos; peak just in front of us.  It was bright white and seemed to have mass, but no structure was perceived by the two witnesses.  It was approximately a half mile in width and moving at a &quot;very high speed&quot; ...I had been asked to build a &quot;walking meditation garden maze&quot; for a large resort in the Peruvian Andes.  Upon completion of the maze I invited the owners and a friend for a small ceremony to dedicate the Classical 7-Path Labyrinth to the healing and well being of our planet Earth.  It was the last few days of late May around 9pm in the evening on a star lit clear night, no moon.  Following the short dedication ceremony the four of us stood watching the heavens, Maria del Carmen and I faced the sacred mountain &quot;Yawar Maki&quot; which juts up from the Urubamba river a few feet from where we stood.  She and I were looking up over the peak at the Southern Cross when suddenly a &quot;large body&quot; of fast moving light sped directly over our heads.  In fact both of us almost fell backwards as we followed the light with our heads craning backwards.  Across the sky overhead it moved and then just disappeared into thin air.  The two men were looking in the other direction and by the time they hea! rd our squeals and looked in our direction, the body of light has completely disappeared.  The entire event took not more than a matter of seconds.  This was neither airplane or lightning, this we know, what is was through is still to be known.  The creation of this particular Labyrinth is as a healing center for tourists and pilgrims visiting the ancient sacred sites in this area of the Andes.  In myth and folklore, the Labyrinth traditions tell of many unusual stories such as that of Scandinavian sailors who would use the labyrinth in a form of sympathetic magic to control the weather.  It is also energetically linked with the seven major energy centers in the bodies auric field, the tones on the scale, and the 7 primary colors in the rainbow.  Unusual phenomena has been recounted in relation to the labyrinth for the past 3,500 years and in fact the act of walking a labyrinth still seems to draw transformative events to the practitioner.  I and maria del Carman both feel thi! s ususal &quot;event&quot; and our walking and dedication somehow are united.  I have never seen a UFO but I came away from this experience feeling like I had seen something I could not explain by conventional terms.  Both Maria del Carmen and her husband, a famous British journalist recounted several sightings during the past year and a half they&apos;ve owned the hotel and lived in this part of the Andes.  They tell me these type stories are common and knowledge of &quot;craft&quot; is widespread and seen by many.  In fact, a lake just over the peak we had stood in front of  called &quot;Chequerec&quot; is known locally as the &quot;UFO Lake&quot; and for the past l00 years (and probably more) stories have been told of craft coming and going from the lake and tales of &quot;little green men&quot; etc.  After this experience I asked around to the native people, the Quechua.  Everyone had a story which was usually told in a matter of fact demeanor as something as natural as the sun coming up each day. Another Indian friend that I ! would describe as being educated, soft-spoken and extremely low profile, and who&apos;d lived many years at the ancient site of Machu Picchu recounted a story.  He claims to have seen up to l7 &quot;ships&quot; on one night last November 1996.  As he told it, he was guiding an American woman into the sacred ruins late after midnight (which is allowed with special permission) when they both witnessed a litany of unusual &quot;lights&quot; above and around the old city.  He said he&apos;s not seen anything of this nature in the past  seven years, and believed that they&apos;d (the star people) returned.  This site has been known in local lore to be a place of intense UFO phenomena throughout the ages."

Biggest and most unusual thing I have ever seen.I am writing about a &quot;phenomenon&quot; that I witnessed that was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seenbefore, so I guess it would fall under the description of a &quot;UFO&quot;. As a scientist with areasonable understanding of astronomy and meteorology, and with an equally good knowledgeof aircraft (both military and civilian), I can safely say that what my colleague and I witnessedwas something that I&apos;m sure would not fall into most of the easily explainable categories. On aclear night during the Memorial Day weekend (24th of May), I saw something that lookedabsolutely enormous moving across the sky in a westerly direction. Since all I could see werethe lights to this thing (very bright white lights), I couldn&apos;t make out the shape precisely.What was even more puzzling was that the lights seemed to move, ever so slightly, withrespect to each other, but it was definitely not a &quot;formation&quot; of any kind of aircraft like I hadever seen. Although I couldn&apos;t guage the exact size of the object since I didn&apos;t know whataltitude it was at (although I would guess it was pretty high), it appeared to be bigger thananything I&apos;ve ever seen flying before, maybe several times the size of a jumbo jet. There wasabsolutely no noise and it seemed to be moving very slowly. We were on a little stretch ofroad between Lake Tahoe and Interstate 80 and there were a lot of stars out, so I&apos;d be reallysurprized if others in the Lake Tahoe area didn&apos;t spot these strange lights, also.

We thought it was somthing fun looking so ran towards it and it shot up in a zig zag fashion then disappeared. Later my mother found a circle of coffee can sized holes in the field. A family outside of town had a strange craft hover over their house near the same time.My cosin and I were both 7. We were playing in a small field behind our Great grand mother&apos;s ,on the north edge of town. I don&apos;t remember exactly when but we both became aware of a silver metal object in the field. I remember thinking it was a metal pig hut because my older brother showed me one in the woods and told me that the pigs had gone feral and they would kill me if I went in the woods. I guess that was his attempt to protect me! Anyway, the object seemed to shimmer with heat waves and at some point we saw that it was a disc about twice as tall as a car and 3 times as long. I seem to remember that I could see under it like it was hovering close to the ground. We were not afraid at that time and decided to run up to it. we were about 50 feet away when it shot up on an angle to the right and appeared to be the size of a nickle , barely paused then shot up again on an angle to the left till at appeaed the size of a small pea then shot up to the right and disappeared. I !don&apos;t remember leaving the field but I remember running into my gramma&apos;s house and being very excited. My cousin moved to Washington state in the 70&apos;s. In 1983 he came to our grampa&apos;s funeral and I asked if he remembered it. He did. My mother did not believe us until we went on about it for several days. When she finally looked there was a series of coffee can sized holes near where the object was. A woman who lived 2 miles north of town told that at about that same time she and her kids (around my age) were watching TV at night when they heard sound like roof shingles slapping and the kids ran and looked out the windows. The kids claimed there was something hovering over the house with colored lights but the mother wouldn&apos;t look because she was afraid. I as female and my cousin is male. As far as I can nail it down, this was about 1966."

A plane was crashing from SkyHarbor Airport in Phoenix, the angle andspeed would not allow a plane to survive.I ran to the living room, grabbed my glasses,and told my wife of 25 years, Get outside,NOW! Never said that before, in that tone.We were standing on our porch within 8-10seconds. This craft was 3000 ft. off thesurface. at least 1 mile in length. Thereis no doubt in our minds that what we wereseeing, was one object. It appeared to betriangular or wedge shaped.

As thecraft passed thru the light of the moon, thecolor of the moon changed to dingy yellow,and we could see horizontal &quot;waves&quot; as itpassed.

For some reason, I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it. After about 45 minutes, I saw that it was in the same position, and had not moved. I looked at it with my 11x80 binoculars (on a tripod) and it started to move (at about 1&quot;/second) steadily parallel to the horizon (eastward). I do not know the exact date, but it was sometime in March and I told a friend about it the next day. A few weeks later, several very bright orange lights were seen to the south all over Eastern Ontario. My friend saw them (I did not) and said that they were bright enough to cast a shadow - his wife and several neighbours watched them for a few minutes. The Ottawa Citizen newspaper had an article about them (with photos) a couple of days later and claimed that they were flares being tested as Fort Drum, USA (about 70 miles due south of this sighting). When my friend&apos;s wife phoned Fort Drum, she was told that the Canadian Government was testing flares near Prescott!! (approx. 20 miles south of the sighting).

19970919,19971202,"Orland Park, IL",rectangle,3-4 minutes,"Summary : When pulling out of my driveway headed north I noticed a stationary bright white light above the west horizon which suddenly sped off traveling north. I turned east off the main road since there was another vehicle behind me in order to view the object. I was putting my car window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left and above me. It measured four to five palm breadths and was a metallic bronze color with a narrow nose/head and a short fan shaped tail.  It was relatively flat with a rectangular shape with two rows of red lights and two rows of blue lights on each side and a single row of red or blue lights on the tail.  It passed over in five to six seconds and no engine sound was heard.When pulling out of my driveway on 09/19/97 to go to work, I turned north onto West Ave. and stopped at the stop sign.  A bright white stationary light caught my eye which I thought was an airplane against the west horizon. I remained stopped at the sign because the light was so bright. As I watched it, it appeared to stop and start very quickly several times.  I pulled away from the stop sign when I saw another vehicle behind me only to see the object speed off faster than any plane goes traveling in the same direction as my car.  To view it better I decided to turn off the main road in an east direction, put my car in park, shut off the radio and was putting my automatic window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left of my car and above me.  Thinking this was the bright object I had seen, it would have been necessary for it to have made a sharp 45 degree angle in order for me to have seen it so quickly. It scared me tremendously and I remember reminding myself that there were other vehicles on the road at this time and I must not be the only one seeing this. With my car window down I was looking out to see the bright light but instead saw an aircraft that seemed unusual, rectangular in shape, large, ( it would have taken four to five palm breadths to cover the length) but not wide, (it would have taken one=half a palm breadths to  cover the width) It was a metallic bronze/chocolate color with a narrow head and fan shaped horizontal small tail compared to the large rectangular body.  No white light was visible and there was no sound made by the craft.  It seemed to move slowly above me taking five to six seconds  to pass and was not visible in the eastern horizon afterwards, however the area is densley populated with homes and large trees. I was afraid it was some type of military aircraft that had gotten off course and flying so low, I thought it would crash into the surrounding homes. Two rows of eight to twelve lights which were circular and not revolving or shining a beam were on each side of the craft. Each row was single in color and one row was red and the other blue but I cannot remember the sequence of the color.  The tail also had a row of either red or blue lights but were perpendicular to the craft and only five or six circular non-beaming lights.  The body of the craft was wider than the sides and angled down like a single step to the edges.  The lights were beneath each edge although I could not see the entire left edge of the craft. After it passed, I remember sitting in my car for several seconds wondering what it was and what I should do.  Not wanting to be late for work, I continued east on the side street to LaGrange Road thinking any aircraft that big and that low I would be able to see when I was past the trees and houses.  However, it was no where to be seen.  I went to work and returned home at approximately 1600  when I contacted the Federal Aviation Agency only to be told that most of their personnel had left for the day and they had no reports of unusual aircraft that day.  I contacted our local newspaper - The Daily Southtown - and asked about any reportings. They informed me they got their information from the local police and they had received none.  Not wanting any to think I was strange, I tried to find somewhere to report this without telling the police.  The local phone numbers for the UFO agency were disconnected.  Although I am reminded daily of the event, only today 12/02/97 did I find the phone number and web site for the National UFO Reporting Center due to a report in the Daily Southtown about another local sighting  of unusual lights two days ago.  I would like for someone to explain that what I saw was an experimental military aircraft or I would think perhaps others on their way to work may have seen the same thing I did."
19970810,19970820,"Bellingham, WA",light,3 minutes,"Summary : Saw a dim moving light.  Thought I was watching a satellite.  Yellow light flashed brilliantly, then faded to near invisibility.  It was a clear night and I was out to watch the Perseid meteor shower.I am a university teacher who has lived in Bellingham for 7 years.  I am interested in UFO phenomena, but have never seen anything unusual before.  On the evening of August 10, 1997, I was outside at 11:30 pm watching for shooting stars when I saw what I thought was a satellite.  It was very dim, almost invisible, and I only noticed it because of the faint movement.  As I watched, the &quot;satellite&quot; suddenly flashed a brilliant yellow light.  The original light in the sky was barely a pinprick, but the flash was as large as my pinky nail held at arms length.  After the flash, the &quot;satellite&quot; seemed to disappear.  I could then make out faint movement and a tiny pinprick of light and then the object flashed again.  It moved in an east-to-west trajectory and flashed about every ten seconds until it went out of my line of sight.  I estimate that I watched the object for approximately 2, maybe 3 minutes.  I went inside, through the house, to see if it was visible from my front porch! (I had been on my back deck).  It wasn&apos;t.  I wonder is anyone else has seen something similar?"

19970215,19971122,"La Puente, CA",other,2.0 seconds,"Summary : From a stand-still... to a one-second period of ignition... followed by one-second of what sounded like the after-burner of a massive- powered jet... then, silence.appologies for the un-sure-of exact date. This could have been a few months prior to the date stated above, or a few moths after. It was approximately 3:00am and myself, and two friends (brothers) were standing in front yard, talking before two of us departed to our homes.  All of a sudden, a noise sounded from the sky...a very solid-like sound which resembled that of a clothes dryer starting its first turn or two of the drum... but much, much more powerful and solid and what seemed like would be extremely loud...however, was shelled-like...retained to paremeters. This sound was approximately one-second in length.  Following this sound (as in sequence of process) was what sounded like a jets exhaust...however, much more determined-soundinding, and of much more power.   The duration of this sound was also approximately one-second. Reactions of all three of us were the same... which was turning our heads up to look in the direction of where these sounds came from and went to.  All three of our opinions of the directions were within the South to Southeast direction (in the sky) from where first started and took-off in the directoin of the sounds and headed in the direction (opinions) varying) somewhere in the South to South West direction.   I describe it as this&gt; Something was sitting in a dead-standstill position...in the sky and, was able to &quot;start&quot; (whatever it is that was started) and accelerate to speeds that enabled them to disappear (so-to- speak)."

19971029,19971031,"Childress (approx 20 miles north of, TX",light,5-7 seconds,"Summary : A bright light, which I thought was a &quot;falling star&quot;, suddenly leveled off at my altitude, veered to the north, then came directly at me, at very high speed.On the evening of October 29, 1997, I was flying my Cessna 170, at an altitude of 9,500 ft., and a heading of 060 degrees. (N.E.).  I was approx. 70 nautical miles S.W. of the Hobart VOR. on the 240 radial.  At around 1900 CST, I observed what I thought at first was a meteorite, and wondered why it didn&apos;t burn up like they usually do.  I remember saying to myself, &quot;Gosh, I could of made a wish on this one!&quot;  Then I thought it was going to make it all the way to the ground.  When it got to my altitude, it suddenly leveled off, veered slightly to the north, then turned and came directly at me, still at what I, out of lack of a better term, will call &quot;meteorite speed&quot;.  I was in awe, and remember thinking, &quot;nothing travels that fast!!!&quot; After a few seconds in awe, I was terror stricken, as I realized the object was on a direct collision course. My reflex reaction made me bank the plane 90 degrees, and pull back hard to avoid collision. (As if my 120 mph airplane could possibly avoid something that fast!?)  When there was no impact, or wake, or anything else, I turned around to see what it was, but it was gone.  I immediately went for my charts to find the frequency to call ATC on, to see if they had painted a target, but was so upset, and shaking, I couldn&apos;t look at my chart and fly the plane at the same time.  As for the size, and relative speed of the object, I can only make an analogy.  I have already compared it to a meteorite.  Assuming a meteorite appears about the size of a kernel of corn, held at arms length, then this object went from that size, when I first observed it, to about the size of a beach ball, held at arms length, when I maneuvered abruptly to &quot;avoid it&quot;. I am a commercial pilot with ten years, and several thousand flight hours of experience, and am certainly used to seeing lights in the sky, and judging their speed and altitude, for collision avoidance. I live near an Air Force base, and am used to seeing, and sharing the airspace with military aircraft.   I can say with certainty, nothing the military has, goes that fast.      If anyone wants to check the radar tapes, my transponder was on all the way, so there should be a good plot of my course.   I departed Roswell, N. M., at approx. 16:00 mountain time.   The tower at ROW will have a log with the exact time.   My aircraft call sign is N((Numbers))A."

I have never seen anything like it in my life it was a bright greenish cigar shaped light with a thin streak of white light behind it. The one thing we all noticed was how strait and steady it was as strait as could possibly be. There was no sound at all. The object seemed to be moving at the speed of light. It sent chills through me as I saw it and my wife and sister. We all believe this was without a dought a ufo.

I was playing in the front yard when a ball like object slowly came down from the sky. it was the size of a baseball.I was sitting on the grass when i looked up above the parking lot across the street in front of my grandmother&apos;s house. in the sky was a dot. i could barely see it . it caught my attention. as I sat there it came a little closer. I still could not see it clearly.I went inside for lunch. I came back out and it was still there about 75 to 90 feet away. I sat on the driveway and stared at it. it was neat.there it stayed all day.the next day I looked up and was looking for it interested and curious.it came back and got closer. the object came up to me only 2 feet from me.  I tried to touch it but I would move just out of my reach.it stayed all week and left as it arived.it was clear yet solid it would be constantly changing its surface like clouds and solids interfacing it reacted to me and communicated with me. it was like unconditional love. it taught me and gave me great intellegence and insight.

19970623,19971008,"Willow Creek Campground, CA",other,2 hrs,"Summary : Late in the evening, just before retiring, A luminous object was spotted just above a mountain, and in between two trees. It appeared to be one mile to the south/southeast of the campground. It remained &apos;flickering&apos; in a cross pattern, until I signaled with a flashlight, which caused it to abruptly change its pattern and speed; changing its location extremely quickly. and then coming back to its original spot and remain flickering once again. just above the mountain.The object appeared to be of a spherical shape, maybe 15-20ft across, from where it was observed. The object &apos;flickered&apos; rapidly and it moved in a tight, &apos;tic tac toe&apos; like movement, intensifying in luminensce as it moved. After 30 min. object was &apos;signaled&apos; with a small flashlight, to which the object reacted by flashing brighter and moving even more erratically; much faster and farther. After, it would come back to its original position. There were no changes in color,as far as the light is concerned. I watched for about 2 hrs until I became extremely tired, even though I was very interested, and slept.

One fellow pointed at a bright &quot;star&quot; approaching from the east (like Las Vegas). He felt it was unusual and we all watched. It was not a helicopter although it moved at about that speed. It hovered over Downey (probably more like La Mirada) for a few minutes. Then it took off on a new coarse (NW - like Point Mugu). We were all sure that it was not a plane. The curious thing is that the arc it described on the sky seemed to maintain a constant speed as it approached the horizon. That is, there was none of the normal &quot;gradual loss of motion due to the distance&quot; that one normally experiences. It was really booking!That&apos;s all folks!Sorry - no green women with galactic eyes and no abductions.But hey! a UFO is a UFO, right!"

19970313,19970318,"Phoenix (Ahwatukee), AZ",triangle,10 min,"Summary : Sighted red to white horizontal line on the north west horizon. As the object got closer it looked like a 5 light triangle. It passed over head and diasppeared into the south east horizon in about 10 to 15 minutes.The object was first spoted by ((name deleted)) at approximately 2015 on 3/13/97.  The object was seen on the northwestern horizon.  It appeared as a horizontal line with a red glow.  We arrived home and got some binoculars to see what it was.By this time it had changed color to a brilliant white and was in the shape of a triangle.  The best discription at this time was the leading edge of the B2 bomber.  A light on the nose, one on either side and toward the back, then one moreon either side spaced farther back than the first pair.  There were five lights in all.  The object moved from the northwest to the southeast, almost directly over head of our house.  As it moved across the sky is believe I was able to seethe stars between the light formation.  We tried to hear a sound from the objects, thinking it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no strobe or red and green marker lights.  The formation of the five objects did not changeas you would expect from aircraft.  There was no change in spacing, no noise and it was as bright overhead as it was comming or going.  We could not tell how high the objects were, but while discussing what we saw the next day we realized thatwe might have see these objects while they were over Prescott because they started out red then changed to white while over Phoenix.  We do not have any explanation for what we saw, but we both saw something we&apos;ve never seen before."

We were directly in the path of the beam and looked up into it as it illuminated us.During 4th of July family fireworks, a large, low-flying object (could have been an airplane) with bright red lights on it, beamed a large, very bright blue light down on the ground directly under the object.  Our family was directly in the path and as we were all illuminated blue, we looked up into the light.  It moved off towards the woods north of the house and the light was turned off.  Two of us saw it go off just before it would have gotten to the woods.  We all discussed this strange happening at length.  The object came from the direction of Columbia, IL and moved off north towards Cahokia, IL.  Our sighting was two miles east of Dupo, IL on Imbs Station Road, about 3/4 mile west of the intersection of Imbs Station Road and Triple Lakes Road.  Observers were:  my retired parents, two sisters-in-law (one is the wife of a US Air Force Colonel--the Colonel was lighting fireworks and did not see the light), my sister, myself, and several nieces and nephews."
19970711,19970714,"Allison Park (Hampton Twp.), PA",cylinder,6 min.,"Summary : As I was driving near the site of a radio tower under construction, I noticed a black, barrel shaped object hovering near it. I stopped my vehicle and tried to understand what it was. As I watched, it began to change shapes, and flash as if the entire unit was a strobe light. I am a former member of the Civil Air Patrol (1Lt.) and I am very familiar with small aircraft, and this was unlike anything I have ever seen. The craft seemed to be observing the construction of the communications tower. Traffic began to build behind me and I had to move to another location 20 seconds away, however, after I moved it was gone. No aircraft I have ever seen from this elevated view point can move out of the field of view so quickly.I live in Allison Park in Hampton Twp., about 12 miles North of the city of Pittsburgh PA. On Friday July 11 1997, I was on my way home at 3:25 PM. I entered the northern end of Topnic Dr.(in Hampton Twp) and from its high elevation I looked to see how much progress was made on the new communications tower being built near the township Municipal building and as I made the turn onto Topnic I couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing. Looking due south, I saw the tower first. It was not far from being topped off. I could barely see the men working on the top section, but just off to the right, or to the west, there was a black object hovering, as if observing the tower. It was about 1500 above the ground and about 1/2 mile away from me and was so black it was if I was looking at a hole in the sky. It was sort of barrel shaped, and as I watched it hovering completly silent and motionless, it began to change shapes. It changed so many times that I could no longer tell what shape it wa! s. It then began to flash as if the entire craft was a strobe light, pulsing about every 2 seconds. I could see no detail in the craft, no lights or windows, just a black object in the sky hovering silently motionless at first, and then suddenly changing shapes, and flashing like a giant strobe light. I am a mature adult man, with years of experience in the USAF Civil Air Patrol. I live within the TCA of Pittsburgh International Airport, and I&apos;m used to seeing aircraft of military, commercial, and private origin flying in the area. I have never in my life, however, seen anything that I can even say comes close to looking like the craft that I saw on 11 July 1997. My vehicle was stopped in the middle of the road as I observed this craft, and a few cars started to build up behind me. I moved on down the road where I lost sight of it for 20 seconds. When I got to another vantage point, it was gone. From the elevation that I was at, no aircraft, balloon, or helicopter could have moved out of my field of view so quickly. I never heard of any other witnesses, but would like to know, if anybody out there can tell me, if there were any other reports of this sighting. I didn&apos;t report this to anyone, because I didn&apos;t know who to report it to."

Shortly after they hovered in place, pulsating and began moving at odd trajectories.  They did this for several minutes, blinking in and out.  Moments later, they had vanished from view.Driving Northbound on West I-10, from the Chandler Blvd exit, Miles looked out the car windshield and noticed the objects positioned at one o&apos;clock. As they were falling, I noticed five objects, three with sparks coming off of them.  Then I got Demian&apos;s attention and we both witnessed them stop above the horizon of the city lights, hover, and began pulsating.  Two, started moving independantly of the others at various right angles and spiral motions, while the others maintained a steady pattern.By this point we had passed the Elliot Rd. offramp and were proceeding toward the Superstition Freeway.  By the time we had crossed beneath the Guadalupe Rd. overpass, they had vanished from sight.

19971114,19971117,"Dallas/Ft Worth (Approaching), TX",formation,35-45 mins,"Summary : Saw strange lights above high clouds from an American Airlines flight into Dallas Ft WorthI am writing you because of something I saw (along with a friend) while flying into Dallas Friday evening. The more I have thought about this the more I knew I should write down what I saw. &nbsp; I was flying from Seattle to Dallas on Flight 18 Friday Nov. 14th. At about 6:35-6:45 P.M. Dallas time, about a half hour out of Dallas/Ft Worth we were high above thick cloud cover. There was a full moon out and the clarity above the clouds was good. As we looked out ahead and to the east (port side of the aircraft), I noticed few lights out ahead of us. I presumed they were other aircraft coming right at us since the lights did not blink like wing lights but as the head lights do at times. There were two such lights and they looked far off but being at night it was hard to tell just how far. I watched for a long time watching other aircraft with blinking strobe lights passing in various directions. these lights (the identifiable aircraft with blinkers) were much smaller in size to the constant lights. What started to seem strange was the fact that the original two lights which were constant began to appear to be closer the nearer we flew, not farther apart as it should be is! we were approaching them. Also what seemed strange was the fact that at no point did there appear any other lights such as a green (starboard) or red (port) lights with these two constant lights. I watched intently as I saw a normally lit and identifiable aircraft fly perpendicular to the main light on my left that I had been watching. The identifiable aircraft approached extremely close and behind this light. The light was not a distant star or light on a hill or a beacon as my mind raced to start to explain what I was seeing. &nbsp; The time span now is maybe 15 full minutes of watching these lights. We were approaching these lights which was apparent since the lights were now directly to the port side of the aircraft and no longer in front of us. As we continued on, and our approach to Dallas caused as to slightly alter our approach, these lights became directly to port from us and even closer and seemed to rise higher above the cloud layer than before. I had mentioned the lights to my companion several times since I first spotted them when I had described them first as two aircraft with their&nbsp; headlights on. At this point I saw a third light low in the cloud cover below these two lights. This third light was hazy as if slightly in the clouds and also seemed larger and closer to us. It had shape to it, almost like it was like a soft cube shape (a cube with rounded corners and puffed up sides. It was not just light). I was seriously questioning that these lights were anything I had seen before. I had made! several comments to my friend trying to explain what I was seeing since I knew they were not aircraft like &quot;these have to be beacon lights&quot; or &quot;maybe they are power lines&quot; always to be followed by, &quot;but we are too high for that&quot;. &nbsp; I said to my companion that she should look at the lights. Right about then, I leaned back as we passed the lights. My companion leaned over me and looked now back slightly aft and to port through the windows and said to me &quot;You mean those lights that look like a triangle?&quot;. I looked out the window again and now saw that indeed there was three distinct lights, not blinking above the cloud cover in a triangle formation. The third light had indeed come out and was well above the clouds. &nbsp; As we continued to move towards Dallas and begin our decent, the lights remained in a triangle formation eventhough we continued make a left turn towards the Dallas/Ft Worth airport. In other words, even thought they were in a triangular formation while we looked at them to port, they remained in a triangular formation as we viewed them to aft. &nbsp; Within a few minutes we were descending into the clouds and I lost sight of the lights. &nbsp; I have thought a lot about what I saw and discussed it with my companion who also saw them. These were stationary lights at our altitude during normal flight approach about 35-45 mins out of Dallas or slightly higher (with the exception to the third light) which would put them at&nbsp; least 25-35K feet. The lights were stationary since while we approached they were in front, as we continued they were to the port and then aft of us as we passed. There were initially two constant lights very far apart when first viewed and only slightly brighter and very much closer to each other 30 minutes later when joined by the third light from the clouds. the lights did not seem to move but were stationary though they must have moved since they were closer to each other after viewing them for 30 minutes than at first. &nbsp; I am a 42 yr old businessman in Seattle (your town). I work as a real estate broker. I was a concert promoter for many many years and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles. I have a good grasp of astronomy and can identify the moons of Jupiter with my binoculars and Venus along with my favorite constellations. I grew up with a pilot as y best friend and have logged hundreds of right seat flying in small aircraft so I have an appreciation for what aircraft look like at night and during the day. &nbsp; Though I do listen to Art Bell and have read many books on Roswell and a few about other UFO&apos;s, I am not a &quot;believer&quot;. I am a curious observer. With thousand s of hours of staring at the skies, of flying all over this country many times over during night and day, I have never seen anything that wasn&apos;t identifiable, at least after 5-10 minutes of viewing. These objects were viewed by me for nearly 45 minutes non-stop and I have no explanation that meets any test I put to it. I have replayed the tape in my head over and over. I keep seeing the aircraft passing behind the main left light. I keep seeing the two lights far apart and them seeing the triangle shape after the appearance of the third. I see the third boxy light shrouded ion the clouds then see it clearly in view above the clouds. These objects had to be moving, but in such a way that they seemed stationary. There were no additional lights associated with these white lights. there were no strobes with these lights. Whil! e other aircraft came and went from Dallas and appeared across the sky, these lights seemed to sit still. &nbsp; I had to finally admit I saw something strange and unexplainable with my resources. I guess in a way, I wanted to live in denial that I saw anything weird at all, but in the end, had to write this down and send it off as a statement of my very best recollection of what I saw. &nbsp; My companion is a person who works for the airline, does not wish to be involved but has flown extensively for the last 5 years in her porfession"

The light came from over the trees to the east and moved  to the southwest diaginally to the west.  At first we thought it was a shooting star, but later we learned there were reports of similar objects seen in the area.  The object was about the size of a soccer ball and was electric blue around the core. It looked to be about 100&apos; above the gound and was visible for about 600 or 700 ft. and then suddenly disappeared.. The total time visable to us was 5 to 7 seconds.

19970620,19970621,"Carefree, AZ",circle,5 seconds,"Summary : Large round object glowing a bright green, with also some yellow &amp; white light dropping to the NE from SW, to near ground level at about a 45 degree angle &amp; dissapeared behind the north side of Black Mountain.This was NOT a meteorite.  I&apos;m an amateur astonomer. Every meteorite I have ever seen was always white never any color, a small point of light, and faster and higher elevation than this object.  The color was a failrly brilliant (almost neon) light green, it had lesser shades of yellow and white.  It seemed like I could actually see a round object rather than the normal point of light.  It was geading toward earth at a 45% angle.  There is no way it could have burned-up as it was near ground level when it dissapeared to the NE behind Black Mountain.  It was the same size and light intensity when first viewed high up in the sky.  There was an alomost full moon at the time and the sky was still somewhat light from the sunset so it&apos;s even more amazing how bright and visible this object was, as the sky was far from dark at the time.By the way, I also witnessed the UFO&apos;s near Phoenix on 3-13-97 which I never reported until now.They were due south of here, I would estimate directly over Phoenix.  It&apos;s dark sky here as there is no city lights in this rural area 30-miles north of downtown Phoenix, but bright city lights in Phoenix may explain explain why my view was so good. Plus, I am elevated here at 2,600 foot level, on the slope of Black Mountain.  My wife and I observed the 3-13-97 objects for about 20 to 30-minutes.  They were in a quarter-circle formation with 5 objects to the right and 1 object to the left of center and seperated somewhat from the other five. They were much larger than a star or airplane lights.  The were round and glowing a steady white light.  They were heading very slowly from west to east, almost hovering in the sky and just barely moving.  They did not lose any altitude at all.  This eliminates them being flares or baloons like I heard the military said they may have been.  Plus they were flying in a well defined and steady geometrical formation. After about 15-minutes som!e of the objects simply starteddisappearing, almost light they turned their lights off.  After 10 to 30-minutes they all seemed to have disappeared from view.  It&apos;s not like they moved out of sight, butb they seemed to have simply &quot;blinked-off&quot;.  There is no way they could be airplanes, far too slow and almost stationary.  They could not be flares as they lost no altitude at all during the entire time.  Plus, I believe they were close enough to make out the object, rather than just a point of light.  They were all equal size round white objects, except the on to the left of center was seperated from th others and may have been a little larger than the other five to the right of center.  All six were flying in a quarter circle formation and curved in a perfect geometrical arch.There is no other explanation for this than UFO&apos;s.  Being an amateur astonomet I view the night sky all the time and have never seen anything like my sightings of March 13 and June 20, 1997.My wife also witnessed the 3-13 sighting and her version is exactly the same as mine."
0000,19971106,"Brentwood (Long Island), NY",NA,unknown,"Summary : My neighbor said I disapeared of the front stoop of my house,There was a day during the summer in the mid 60&apos;s when my dad called me over while he was talking to our neighbor across the street. My father said that my neighbor, ((Name deleted)), was telling him that he was upset over the fact that I literally disappeared from off my front stoop. I stood there and looked at him.  How could I have disappeared off of my stoop??  I told him that things like that do not happen. He said it did. He said he was working in his yard, he saw me sitting on the stoop,  he turned his head for a second, and when he looked back I was gone.  I said he must have been mistaken. I said I must have gone into the house.  He said that there was not enough time..he said he just looked away for a second. He was really upset about it. I dismissed the entire thing as something he THOUGHT he saw,  and forgot about it.  Who ever heard of abductions during the &apos;60&apos;s. We had sightings, but that was about it. Many years have passed and now the UFO information we have has grown and opened up many new avenues of thought.  One of these is abductions. As I was first learning about this during the early &apos;90&apos;s, I suddenly had a flashback to that conversation in the street with my dad and our neighbor. But I had no memory of any abduction..I still don&apos;t.  But what I do have is a very strange memory puzzle that fits together..and it has to do with me being on my front stoop. When I put put these three pieces together, I came up with this strange story.  Piece one had to do with me sitting on my front stoop. I saw a light coming from out of the north headed in my general direction. I thought it was a jet. To think about it now why didn&apos;t I see the body of the jet..it was broad daylight on a summer afternoon. I watched the light seem to slow down and suddenly shoot off to the east. I remember saying..wow,  a ufo. That was the first piece of memory I have had floating in my head. The second was a memory of me being on the stoop,  and suddenly I felt like absolute garbage.  I was nausious and felt a little dizzy.  I had no clue what was wrong. I tried to get up.  I figured I would go lie down on the patio lounge.  As I got up I felt worse..I was completely disoriented. I staggered towards the gate to go into my back yard and wound up in the garage standing by my bike wondering what was the matter with me.  I finally made it to the lounge, and I remember my mother telling me later that I slept for about two hours or so. IF..these pieces belong together, the picture looks like this.  I was on the stoop.  I saw the UFO coming. It slowed down.  I was grabbed and my neighbor witnessed it even though he looked away for a second.  I was returned, saw the UFO leave..and then the sick disorientation set in. From there I walked in a disoriented state, from my stoop..to the garage..to the lounge chair and slept for hours. I now know that this has been going on in my life since the mid &apos;50&apos;s.  As a child I had little people in my room that would advance toward my bed...and that was all I remember. I have had visitors in my teens and adult life. I have managed to pull all of these memories that have been floating in my head for years as undefined strange events,  together to make sense of it all.  The only one I did not understand until fairly recently, was the inner nagging drive to study a particular topic. I had no idea why,  since I was 5 or so, that I had to study this topic. The information did not appear in my life until my early 20&apos;s. It continued in dribs and drabs straight to today. All of this info is on my 20 page web site. http://www.((address deleted)).HTM That&apos;s my story."
19920402,19970707,"Pebble Beach, CA",light,15-20 seconds,"Summary : A green light was iluminating the ocean as we drove past-suddenly, a white light came out of the water and straight for our car. The light came up to my window and I screamed, my mom (the driver) hit the gas and the light stayed with us for about 10 seconds then retreated back into the water.My mother is a nurse, I am a college student. Our family very upstanding in the community, PTA parents, my dad coaches Little League, I have 3 brothers, we are all conservative and skeptical, typical Republicans. My mother is especially rigid due to her profession, but what we saw was undeniable. My mom and I were driving along 17 Mile Drive about 22:05 one evening and we were perplexed by this glowing green light off the coast near Spanish Bay beach. We thought it might be shrimp boats(shrimpers fish usually in the middle of the night &amp; use irridescent green lights to attract the shrimp to the surface) but there were no boats on the surface of the water and the green area was far larger than shrimper lights. Plus, shrimpers as well as other fishermen do not usually fish off the coast of Pebble Beach,it is exclusive &amp; private. We kept driving, away from Spanish Bay, until we reached the Lodge. The green light was out of our sight as we entered the forest area. We were turnin! g to go home when I said, &quot;That light was just too weird, lets go see if it&apos;s still there.&quot; My mom was scared but we turned around and headed back towards Spanish Bay. About 22:18 the green light came back into view, underwater illumination that from a distance appeared to be a dome shaped structure laying on the floor of the ocean. We speculated that it was the lost city of Atlantis, it was really creepy, we were the only car on the road and we were both overwhelmed with a desire to turn around and head away from the scene. We continud a bit further, then we flipped a U-turn and began in the opposite direction again(I was  the passenger, with my side of the car facing the ocean at this point) Just as we accelerated to go, I looked out my window at the green dome, and this bright light beam shot out of the water and came directly to my window. I screamed and my mom hit the gas. We were going 81-85 miles per hour for about 10 seconds and the beam continued to shine in my window! , it&apos;s origin still the green dome under the water. I kept screaming and tried to climb into my mothers seat to escape the light, and suddenly the beam retreated back the way it came until it was back in the dome and disappeared. There was noise of some sort, like ringing at an almost inaudibly high pitch when the light was present, then it was gone when the beam retreated. We were both in shock, my mom drove home and I don&apos;t remember very much except talking to Pebble Beach Secirity with my parents later that night. I was severely disturbed by the incident, I couldn&apos;t sleep for about a week, and even then I slept in the same room as my parents. At the time of  this incident I was a senior in high school. I have since recovered, but I still have flashbacks. Needless to say I am now a firm believer in UFO&apos;s, as is my mother."

He gasped in disbelief when he (we) saw an approaching string of large white lights coming at us from the west heading to the east directly over the city of Jacksonville FL.  The row of lights (7 or 8) were evenly spaced and at the same hieght.  As they approached us they went straight up into the sky and while going up formed the shape of a large &quot;V&quot;.  The &quot;V&quot; continued to go straight up into the sky until it was almost completed out of sight when a flash of light from either the horizon or ground shot up at the formation in an waverly line followed by a second streak of light.  We all sat there dumbfounded by the sighting.  My cousin who is a pilot stated that the light formation was not that of any plane over the US. and the entire time the formation made no heard sound. We all three never really pushed the issue until I had seen film footage of the sighting over Phoenix this year and what was filmed was almost exactly what we had seen.  Now I believe."

19881015,19970707,"Missouri (rural; location unspecified), MO",NA,NA,"It was Oct. of 1988 (unsure of the dates) about eight o&apos;clock or a little later, that I was going to visit a friend. I pulled up into the driveway. (This is a very rural area in Missouri.) I went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friends house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were either three or five of them I don&apos;t really recall) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing towards the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned towards the blimp. It seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so.  I&apos;m just guessing. There was dead silence. I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the windalone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or seem to veer from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o&apos;clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience. The first line of the news cast said  &quot; If you saw it, you weren&apos;t the only one.&quot; They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night.  An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientiststhinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the day following the official report came back. It was a Russian Rocket that was reentering  the earths atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations.  For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way.  It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp. I would have believed this before any of the other explanations, At least, before It had been reported seen in seven different states that night. But after hearing this. I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skiesthat night."

It was traveling in a very slight south east to north west direction..I own a compass. I first saw the object at the far southeast horizon through the trees. It was flying extremely low and seemed to pass over the subdivision I live in. I heard no noise what so ever. The best way to describe the size is if you hold a regluar size pencil at arms length, then it would be about that size looking at it from a distance. Called the local police to see if any strange thing had been reported. They said no. Called the airport control tower at Nashville, Tn (Brentwood is next to Nashville and I live about three miles from the Davidson (Nashville) county line.

The top was unlit and dark so it was hard to tell what the top looked like.  The bottom part of the craft was bowl shaped with many lights like flood lamps.  They were evenly spaced and looked&apos; like there were hundreds of them.  The craft was not a blimp because it was hovering motionless for a few minutes then rose about 100 feet very quickly within seconds.  It also dropped very rapidly in a straight vertical plane.  It was not affected by wind and stayed motionless in the same location for several minutes there were two such craft and a number of other craft circling in the area.I am a scientist and work for ((Name deleted))r Corporation as a Project Manager.

Upon sighting the object, my dad asked &quot;Wonder what that guy is doing?&quot;, since at first it appeared to be just an ordinary light from a private plane. Then, as it began to circle and change colors, I asked ,&quot;How is he changing colors?&quot;. Dad said &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; and as the object left at great speed my dad said, &quot;I don&apos;t think we have anything that goes that fast.&quot;. I am now 30 years old, a former army officer (medical) and former army intelligence SGT. My dad is currently military intelligence, and has, shall we say, some difficulty publicly confirming my recollection of this event.This is of course very troubling to me since he does acknowledge it in private (with me), so to share the story without his verification (since I was a kid at the time), makes me look like a liar, or at best possessing a false recollection of an ordinary event."

Look like commercial aircraft but no movement.  Watch objects for a couple of minutes slight movement.  Decide to stop and look thru binochulars but objects disappear as car stops.My brother and I where driving to Las Vegas, NV for a family get together.  It was late afternoon around 3:00pm.  We were driving west on I-15 approx. 15 miles west of Mesquite, NV when I noticed what I thought was a commercial airliner off to the South and approx. 50-60 degrees up.  The sky was clear not a cloud anywhere.  The object was &quot;metallic&quot; or &quot;white/silver&quot;.  Like a jet when the sun is gleaming off it.  I continued to glance up at the object and I relized it was not moving and had no contrail.  I said to my brother jokingly there is a UFO up there.  He pushed back the sunroof so he could look.  As I remember it took him a little while to pick the object out.  Then another object though not as bright appeared. At one time I could see 3-4 at one time.  They would fade out then come back either were the where or close.  We remembered we had binochulars so my brother got them out.  The car was vibrating too much to tell what they where.  We decided to stop.  As we did ! come to a stop the objects disappeared.  We waited awhile since they had been coming and going out of view.  But, they never came back.  We proceded on our way did not see them again.  We thought they may have been jet fighters at a very high altitude so as to appear as no movement.  Or possibly military aircraft dropping flares.  The first object was the brightest and lasted the longest.  It was moving VERY slowly to the south as it faded away.  Did anyone else see these objects or simular objects in this area?  Since it has been 4 years ago my memory of it is&apos;nt as sharp as it was.  One strange thing I did&apos;nt think of at the time was there was very little traffic on the highway.

19790701,19970622,"Maxwelton Beach (South Whidbey Isl.), WA",circle,2-5 minutes,"Hello.  I do not think that this &apos;sighting&apos;, if that is what it can be called, will be of any use to you because it happened so long ago.  But I came across your website and thought, what the heck, why not record it here anyway.  It happened when I was a child (I have estimated Summer of &apos;79) and sleeping out on the beach in front of our summer beach house with a friend of the same age.  (This was in an era when it was considered safe to let children do that).  I was woken up by something, probably in the early hours of the morning when it was still dark.  I got up and stood on the beach and saw a round object with multiple, multi-colored flashing lights either on the water or hovering just slightly above it.  The object was approximately 20-40 ft. from the shore, and there was a sound associated with it; like a white noise, but at a low, soft pitch.  At the time I thought the object was a submarine.  Now that I know what submarines look like, and that they cannot come that clo!se to shore, I know that it definitely was not.  Also at the time I was certain that it was not a boat - having grown up around boats and spending every summer on that beach, I was familiar with the shapes and appearances of boats.  Well....that is all I remember!  Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I am not making this up; the object that I saw could have been a perfectly legitimate &apos;vehicle&apos; of some kind, or I could have a faulty memory.  Anyway, good luck with your research.  FYI:  I am 27, female, married w/ one small child.  I work part-time for a Seattle non-profit.  I&apos;m not particularly into UFO&apos;s or other unexplained phenomena, in fact I could be called a skeptic.  But I am interested, and I am convinced that I saw this object back in the summer of &apos;79 when I was 9 years old."

Heard it on the radio today (KMOX) and thought I would pass this along. I&apos;ll start by saying I am not a UFO fanatic, I don&apos;t believe in aliens or beings from other planets.  But I certainly saw something unusual the other night. It was between 9:15-9:45, we were waiting for fireworks (the show started at 9:45). My 6 year old noticed it first, and caught my attention. It was green, bullet shaped (like half a capsule.  A rounded edge, flat back.  No stream or tail). Streaked across the sky, and vanished about half way across.  It moved quite quickly, maybe I saw it for 2-3 seconds before it was gone. At first I thought it was some unusualy fireworks (but thinking it is very large).  Then it disappeared as a firework would, but with no explosion or fanfare.  Just gone. It was quite large, perhaps as large in sight as a full moon.

19970527,19970303,",",rectangle,NA,"[Diary of my Encounters This is the story I have known since 1979. In 1979 I was holiday ing at a place called Berowra waters on the South coast near Sussex Inlet with five friends&apos; one of whose father owned the caravan park where we stayed.This caravan park is on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean and we would go to the beach everyday and spend most of the day their swimming, surfing and sunbaking.On this particular day I was standing on the shore with my friends father and mother who owned the caravan park when we looked towards the water facing south-east on a clear hot day( no clouds) and observed a black metallic mass that looked similar to an aircraft carrier on its side (approx length 1500ft long-200-400ft across) and slowly moving towards a cliff face which eventually hid most of the object but not before we discussed what it was and how something that big could stay airbo rne when it was apparently moving so slowly and not making a sound.The object was approx: less than three miles away travelling at two to five miles an hour and started to slowly move in a westerly direction over land, it seemed to take so long to move out of view that other people on the beach had by this time noticed what we were looking at and started to point in the air and their was approx ten to twenty people who saw the same thing up and down the beach.As owner of the caravan park numerous people asked them what it was and they responded that they didn&rsquo;t know, only that their was a Navy facility further down the coast, and Airforce Base at Nowra (ALBATROSS)The object (and it was a metal object)stayed in view for over half an hour from the time we first noticed it until it was lost behind the cliff face. We then proceed to climb the cliff to see if it could still be seen and their it was hovering for a considerable amount of time until a helicopter &amp; jet could be heard in the vicinity, and it slowly moved away, but not taking any notice of either helicopter or jet.In the meantime the southcoast radio station had been inundated with phone calls about strange bright white craft (and they did say craft, I was listening to the broadcast to see if anyone had reported what we had seen earlier) people described the objects, and up to ten were seen, as flying up and down the coast in pairs and one at a time, out to sea, and close to land, as being as bright as the sun, and reflecting the sun, and travelling very fast and occasionally turning back towards the way they had come. When I heard this I remember thinking that this was not what we had seen as the objects were to small, (the size of a houses I seem to remember) not the size of an aircraft carrier as we had seen a few hours earlier. The reports on the radio were the same day, only hours apart from our encounter.My impression was that this was a controlled event as this was winter holidays and the weather was so beautiful that thousands of people were at the beaches up and down the coast, the two people who were with me, and, owned the caravan park were well known in the area ,he was on the local council and had lived in the area all of there lives, and even had a street named after them, and were very honest and humble people who had never seen anything like it in their life, they were also aware of the military bases locally and had seen experimental aircraft before fly over the region, including Jets. I was seventeen at the time I am now thirty five and this was a very close sighting of a very immense object that moved extremely slow and showed no signs of external movement, but it had what appeared to be rivets or welding on the bottom on the side which faced us.At the time I really thought that this was not anything which had been manufactured in Australia and never once thought this was from outer space, now I&rsquo;m not so sure.Conclusion : Large black mass the size of an aircraft carrier: Moved slowly without sound: Stayed in view for a considerable amount of time: Was seen by numerous people: Weather was hot and cloudless: Other objects were also seen: Radio station reported strange craft seen up and down the coast: Object and smaller objects made of solid material: Reported to authorities: Was highly unusualThe Next time (also 1979)In the same year a few friends of mine decided to go to a lookout near Baulkham Hills  in the west of Sydney which was about to become a new suburb, the time was approximately 7.00 - 8.30 PM in summer, (daylight saving ) late November and was a clear night with no clouds, we had been their for a short time when I noticed three circular bright red lights moving south (coming from a northerly direction) in a controlled movement, they were approximately less than five miles away and at that distance appeared to be quite large, about the size of a average house and were moving in a orderly fashion and in no hurry, they were moving in a triangular motion, travelling about 3-10 miles an hour.They did no abrupt moves and stayed in the same formation for a long time (20-30min) before they seemed to reach a point near Prospect Reservoir, and one dived towards the ground at a tremendous speed, one left skyward at high speed, and the other one just seemed to dissolve into the night. We turned the radio on and 2WS, which is a local radio station reported that they had received phone calls from people asking what the lights could be.I asked one of my friends who was there, recently, did he remember that particular night and he described the exact things I have just explained, and he said that they seemed to be under some kind of control and maybe connected to each other as they did a peculiar pattern as they moved across the sky, but the same pattern right across the sky.Conclusion : Three Bright Red Lights with some kind of shape (circular): In a fixed formation (triangular): Seen by five people for a period of at least 20 min: Was reported on the radio by others, independent people: Disappeared  within seconds of each other: Cloudless viewing.Eleven Years Later (1990)I had just returned from Florida, in the States, earlier in the year and had recently lost my job and found myself with time on my hands so I decided to be involved in this new craze which was sweeping the globe 3D images.I managed to find a job in the city (Sydney, Australia) and was working selling 3D posters at Central Railway Station, literally. This was around Christmas 1990 and they were very popular, on this particular day which was a Monday I was just about to go to lunch when a rather tall gentleman of about 6ft 10in, tall, and with large features, long White hair and looking very much like an American Indian, remarked to me that his friend thought  that the brain was similar to a 3D image and the universal acceptance of these images had some kind of lost meaning which we were about to grasp again after a very long time.He then brought up the subject of his friend who had worked for NASA as a photographer and had a very high clearance in the military and had been asked to photograph the inside and outside of a Circular craft which had somehow come into the possession of NASA. He told me in no uncertain terms that his friend took photos of the objects door and as he moved inside and looked  back towards the outside that the door was now twenty to thirty feet higher and the inside was of immense size, yet from the outside the door and craft were rather small, he also me about the underground  nuclear test explosion which was apparently detonated to contain alien forces who had Killed up to 25 scientists and 44 military elite who had complained of human abductions, we had talked so long that I missed my lunch break, and I was working 12 hour days so what he had been telling me had taken nearly one hour, a friend of mine who had come into to see me stood their for the whole time and told me after!wards that what he had just said was really over the top but very interesting.The next day a Tuesday I was sitting in the top floor of a double decker train at 6.30 in the morning on my way to work, the train had just left Strathfield station when I noticed in the distance, a shape like a plane that seemed to be banking towards the train, I was looking for markings and wings as I thought it was a plane making a turn towards the airport when it suddenly approached parallel to the train and proceeded to pace the train.Most people who were on the train were asleep and I had an urge to wake them and say look out the window at this silvery disk shaped object which had by now slowed considerably and was now only one mile away and slowing down as we slowed down as we approached the next stop, the train had just slowed down for track maintenance when I noticed a tower between the object and the train, by the time we passed the tower which was about thirty feet across, the object had disappeared from view, as if someone had turned a switch and the object had just disappearedConclusion   : Strange encounter with person with Indian like appearance: Told me about something which I had heard years earlier underground: Observed a craft of no known origin the next day: Had seen it disappear before my eyes on a clear day: Was definitely metallic and polished silver - reflected the early morning sunlight: Had no markings whatsoever: No exhaust or smoke at all: Was seen for 10-15 minIn early (1993)Near the middle of April I was at a friends place in Blacktown ( 25 miles West of Sydney) we had just been outside and had seen a bright red object shining in a westerly direction at a very high altitude and not doing the normal flight you would expect from any aircraft, this lasted about five minutes before we lost it behind a tree, there were three of us, at about one hour after this I decided to go home, the time was about 10-11 PM.I lived about three miles away and on the way home had a Incredible encounter with multiple craft over Blacktown (where I live) it started when I reached the top of a hill on Locke St and was stopped at a set of traffic lights and noticed directly ahead less than a mile away a Huge Object, and smaller craft above the main one, the lights changed and I proceeded down the hill past the local hospital, and as I rounded the corner I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing, their above the road less than five -hundred feet away I saw two objects- One, the bigger of the two had lights of different shades and colours which moved around the base and middle in a fast movement so that the lights seemed to catch up with each other and I could see what seemed to be railings inside the craft, the lights which were luminous colours-Green-washed in purples and yellows with a touch of Blue. There seemed to be a bright light coming from inside the large object.The object above the larger one had to be large also but wasn&rsquo;t doing anything other than sitting above the other one, I slowed down at another set of lights and saw a elderly gentleman who was walking along the footpath and I was going to wind down my window and ask him to look up at the Objects but thought  he might have a heart attack so I didn&rsquo;t say anything, while I was waiting for the lights to change they started to slowly move away over the hospital and I thought to myself that I was going to chase them ( the objects) at that very second as if they had heard what I had thought they accelerated to a brisk pace and I turned around and started to chase them, as I drove up the hill and turned east down Bungarribee Rd I stopped my car which overlooked a disused quarry and got out I notice two more objects hovering above my head at no more than 200ft above me, I then looked East and about half a mile away noticed another two cigar shaped objects the same as the ones above my!head, I then looked to the south and saw another object similar to the one above the large object that I was chasing and saw the two craft I was chasing moving at a slow speed in a south-easterly direction, in the direction of Bankstown Airport about fifteen miles away.While I was watching them both move away the two above me were still there not moving at all, I was out of the car and could almost touch them, they made no sound and seemed to just hover without any wobbling or movement, I continued to watch all seven objects for the next hour or so until the first two disappeared in the vicinity of Sydney and seemed to be moving in a large arc around the panoramic view I had (that is moving from south to east to nth east before I lost sight of them) I then noticed that the two smaller cigar shaped objects to the east had come down a bit lower and were near a radio tower 2WS and soon they too had mysteriously vanished, the objects above my head had begun to move away slowly and I saw that they were staying close together and moved slowly towards the horizon until they too had disappeared.I decided to go home and ring up the airport where I had seen the original two craft head towards, when I arrived home I had to move my mothers car under the carport, but, when I tried to start the car it wouldn&rsquo;t start, I finally gave up and got out of the car and looked up at the sky and the first craft I had seen with the revolving lights was directly above our house and was moving very slowly south back towards the location that I had first seen it, It was the same craft except I now had a better look at the whole Object, It was Large about 200ft in diameter and when I looked up was moving quite slowly almost as if it was waiting for something to catch it up. It then moved out of site and I went inside and rang up the airport who rang me three days later and asked me what I had seen and told me to ring the Airforce base at Richmond which I did and the person I talked to said that they had heard nothing about what I had just described.I left a message for my mother that her car wouldn&rsquo;t start and she rang the NRMA which is road service in New South Wales and when he turned up the car wouldn&rsquo;t start straight away and he said that it was a flat battery even though it was a new battery and the car had been driven less than four hours earlier that night.Conclusion   : Seven Objects seen in the space of a few hundred feet from each other: Coloured Lights seen emitting from around the Largest Object: Objects seen to Hover from a close distance: Seemed to hear what I was thinking: Some kind of railing seen inside large object: Bright White Light seen emitting from inside: Travelled right around the Metropolitan area: Somehow drained the power from the battery of car: Seen directly over my house so object had to of flown in a 360 deg arc around Sydney and surrounding areas: I had chased the first two objects which had been hovering over road near the HospitalBedroom Visitors 1994I had just arrived home from a friends place and was lying on the bed looking at the ceiling and looking out the window at the stars when I felt a sharp pain like a pin being stuck in my toes, the first thing I thought was that a white tailed spider had bitten me as there was an increase in these type of spiders around the house at the time.I felt like I was frozen and wanted to yell out but didn&rsquo;t want to disturb my mother who was asleep in the other room, I was wide awake and had only just put my head on the pillow seconds earlier thinking about tomorrow and things I had to do, when I felt the presence in my room and sounds from the foot of my bed, I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, and I still couldn&rsquo;t move at all and it was then that I felt hands around my feet where the pin prick had been and I could only lift my head slightly and I saw five small figures looking at me at the foot of the bed (they had came out of my wardrobe) and I could see that the wall where the wardrobe was now different and looked like the inside of a giant hanger which went back into the wall a considerable distance.There were two small entities standing at the end of my bed and one had stuck me with a needle in the toe and one was holding my ankle and examining my ankle area, while this was happening I thought that I hope my mother in the next room doesn&rsquo;t wake up and disturbs these entities as they might panic and hurt her, or she might panic and something bad might happen to her, then what seemed like a few seconds I noticed three more figures coming out of the wardrobe and stand at the foot of the bed and proceeded to stick something in my leg, I started to feel able to move again, only slightly and lifted my head off the pillow and saw right into their faces and they looked back with curious looks on their faces but never stopped doing whatever they were doing but they knew I was looking straight at them and I was wide awake.They were not trying to intentionally hurt me and I felt no fear and I could remember everything that they were doing and I was aware of  being awake and this was not a dream, I tried to communicate with them, I couldn&rsquo;t talk, as no sounds came from my mouth, but I could hear my voice from deep down from within.They were quite solid, long arms but not abnormal, smallish heads not extremely large, more like small children feeling around, playing, around 3-4ft tall, dark greyish in appearance with lizard like scales, and the skin seemed the same colour throughout the body as far as I could see, and I could see just below their knees, they had a almost sad look about them and there was definitely some kind of rank as one or two ordered the others around, not with words or telepathy but they just seemed to obey without answering, and these other two stayed in the background moving around the room and observing, occasionally looking over to see what was happening.They still had hold of my ankle and reminded me of well trained doctors with nurses helping them, this was a real event, on one occasion one stepped back into the wardrobe to retrieve something and came back with it in its hand and I noticed that it had three large type fingers that seemed to be too large to do anything intricate yet here they were doing things to me with the skill of a surgeon, I felt no pain except for the initial discomfort of a pinprick in my toe, I heard no voices only muffled sounds and yet I could tell that this wasn&rsquo;t going to be a adverse experience.They wanted to look at my legs and feet and didn&rsquo;t come near my face or touch any part of me except my toes and ankles, although they had direct contact with my eyes. They seemed to me to be quite aware of my feelings and as they continued  they would look my way to see if I was in any discomfort and all looked when I thought of my mother, before they left I noticed they looked back at me as they went back into the wardrobe, one at a time, in a very orderly fashion, and the last thing before they vanished the wall came back to its original distance and the hanger like area which reminded me of inside a large ship gradually disappeared in a cloud like vapour.It was then that I felt the sensation of my foot and toe and I immediately jumped up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and could see that I was wide awake and when I checked the time it was less than three minutes since I had arrived home, which was impossible as I had made something to eat when I first arrived home.It was then when I heard my mother talk that I realised it was all over and I have since sold the wardrobe and painted the room and had a inbuilt wardrobe installed.Later in the week I went to a friend who has a paranormal interest and he took out of my toe a small black object that wasas hard as a needle and was giving me quite a bit of pain.Conclusion : Five Entities in my bedroom: A small metal as hard as a needle was found in my toe: I was wide awake the whole time: There was eye contact and concern on their part: I saw a kind of entrance to another dimension: Some type of medical procedure had happened: Two entities in charge of procedures: Grey in appearance with skin that was like a mold: They knew what to do and had me paralysed from the neck down.: They also had a sad look- the kind of look when you say goodbye to someone you have feelings forEarly (1996)I had just came home and was going inside to  get my telescope to look at Jupiter and the Moon when I looked west and saw a fast moving object which I thought was a white aeroplane that looked like a wireframe, until I saw a smaller object either come out of the original object or came up alongside and seemed to refuel while all the time the other object was moving at a incredible speed. They stayed together for approximately 15 seconds which was a long time considering it travelled across the horizon and out of sight in that time.I rang Bankstown Airport and they told me to ring Richmond Airforce Base which I immediately did and was put through to the officer in charge of aircraft dispatches who told me that no planes would refuel over residential areas Ever and especially not at night. I know what I saw and that was a low, very high speed object with a smaller object that was seen to pace and be refuelled in mid air at about 11PM at night earlier this year 1996.Conclusion : High speed Object wireframe in appearance: Smaller Object seen to pace and be refuelled by larger object: In view for a short amount of time: Incredible speeds for both craft: Large Craft was white in appearance: Smaller Craft seemed to be see through.JUNE LONG WEEKEND (9/6/96)Sun: Time: 9.25-9.55This happened on Sun long weekend of June this year I had just dropped Lloyd who is a friend of mine at his place and he was taking his things inside when I noticed three orange/red/yellow lights pulsating and slowly moving high in the sky above Blacktown. They were in a large Triangular shape from three to five files apart, the top light of the triangle stayed in a constant spot as did the bottom left light, the light on the bottom right though moved away and pulsated in and out and disappeared on occasions and then reappeared slowly moving away from the other two until it completely disappeared from view. The other two started to slowly move away with the bottom left light going higher and the top light moving across and over the bottom light, moving east and moving very slowly, the other light moved away at the same speed going north-east and very slowly. We decided to ring a few friends who have cameras and videos and after a good half hour with the objects still in sight !I decided to go home as it was getting quite cold. We were looking through high powered binoculars and their appeared to be a solid object behind the light. As I drove home which is about two miles away I could see the remaining lights from the car quite clearly and thought that when I arrive home I would have a look through the telescope. When I arrived at my house both objects could still be seen very easily by the naked eye and through the telescope I could see that their was a light in the centre of the mass which was causing the brightness, I watched both for a considerable time until the light that was moving slowly to the north-east had stopped and had taken on the appearance of a star and was now acting as though it was stationary so I turned my attention to the other light which was now over the Windsor area travelling north-west but was still in sight for a considerable time before it was just a blur and by which time it was  icy cold, I turned the telescope again to!wards the first light and it was just sitting there stationary as a star would look, I then went to bed and when I went to work the next day I asked Lloyd if they took any pictures and he proceeded to tell me what happened later that night in front of at least seven people.After I left his friends turned up but the objects had been gone for a while before they turned up, so they went to another friends place just around the corner and this is three different accounts of what happened next starting with:"

The object appears in 7 frames of a standard 30 frame per second VHS tape. I am not experienced in these matters. I have had the tape digitally analyzed and the object appears to have a definite form and reflects sun light as if it were metallic. It was pure accident that we caught it on video and did not discover it until we were back home viewing the vacation tape.This is an interseting video. I would appreciate some assistance in presnting this to media. please call."

19970704,19970707,"Millstadt, IL",light,3 SEC,"Summary : blue light traveling due west ended in red flash appeared to be close overhead. I think it was space junk or meteor due to similar sightings over a broad area.Due to the fact that the object was on a precise east to west trajectory, in line with the earth&apos;s rotation, I would guess that it was probably space junk burning up in the atmosphere."

19971129,19971202,"Gorman (60 miles north of Los Angeles), CA",light,10-min.,"Summary : I was coyote calling on top of a mountain at night, and the sky was dark with clouds. A red flickering light came down through the cloud cover, at first I thought it was a red beacon for a tower that was on the hill but then realize they were behind me and this was out over the Interstate 5 freeway. It moved around in a lazy manor the faded away... gone. Others on the freeway must have seen it also, there was alot of traffic at that time.The object was a red light that was flickering vary fast, it was on the bright side but not like a fire, but a light. It was not going on a set course, but wandering about the sky. The cloud cover was not to high, may be 1000 feet over my location on the hill. I heard no sound and after it faded away, I packed up and drove with my lights off until I reached the old ridge rout road. I was shacken alittle. May have been a military craft? I don&apos;t know."
19971114,19971117,"Portland, OR",formation,5 hours,"Summary : Two bright lights appeared over the neighbors house and seem to go back and forth, stand still and pulsated at the same time.  They looked like fireworks in the sky.My name is ((Name deleted)) and I saw a light rising from somewhere behind my neighbors house in the sky.  It did not act like an airplane but before I called my children to come and witness it I stepped out the door and watched it rise rapidly straight up into the air.  I called my four children out to watch with me. At first we only saw one and then another one appeared over another neighbors house--what really amazed us was how they seemed to be pulsating in a pattern together.  They actually looked like fireworks in the sky when they were doing this.  Everyone I saw who was walking down the street I pointed it out to them--(they thought we were nuts).  I was talking to my Office Manager at work about it off and on while she was at work.  We tried to call the news stations but nobody would listen we didn&apos;t have a video camera so we couldn&apos;t take pictures.  One of the objects stayed pretty low and started heading off behind some trees, we decided to follow after a minute to see if w! e could still see it.  It was in a holding pattern over a main street, it stayed there for at least 20 minutes then  it took off it made other planes in the sky look as if they were standing still. One of my children wrote about it in her journal right away but I held off until Sunday.  It was a wonderful and exciting sight.  I was really upset that nobody would listen to us in the news media and when the news came on later we heard it was &quot;space junk&quot;, Who are they trying to kid?"
19970225,19970304,"Crystal Lake, IL",sphere,3-4 seconds,"Summary : I was laying on the sofa looking out the window at 2:00am with the Moon and Mars in the sky and all of the sudden I saw an orange-red ball whiz between the Moon and Mars. I am an amatuer astronomer and know for certain it was not a meteor or satelite and it was moving too fast to be a plane or other form of aircraft which I am familiar with.It darted across the entire sky from my viewpoint.  I am not saying it was a ufo but I cannot identify what it was.  I have been looking at the sky all my life and have never seen anything that looked like that.It was orange-red and round.  I cannot judge how far it was awaybut it was really fast. Whenever I get the chance to view the stars I am and have never seen anything like it with my naked-eye or through my telescopes.I have always believed in life other than on our own planet because we are just a grain of sand in the desert compared to the universe, so it would be concieted to say we are the only life in the universe.This is my first real sighting of something I can&apos;t explain."

Looked up and noticed a single, very white, round objectmoving from east to northwest (this is a coastal area of VA).  At first thought itwas baloon, but quickly realized moving much too fast and straight.  No vapor,exhaustor noise whatsoever.  When first observed, appeared to be about the size of a shirtbutton held at arm&apos;s length.  Disappeared within 8-10 seconds.This area is close to Naval air stations; very familiar with various conventionalcraft.  Nothing like this seen before.  Was very round and bright white.I am a 46 year-old health care executive.  Am MUFON member (recently joined); have beeninterested in the phenomenon for decades, and well read on subject, but maintain a sceptical yet open mind.Inclined to favor a more scientific, empirical approach.This was definitely NO conventional craft!"

Small rotating object seemed to join large object which decended blow treetops, resembled a formation. a week prior during daylight another object witnessed by 2 people in two different places seen suspended in north sky, very bright, and quiet and floating, not like a plane.The small object with the rotating lights seemed to linger in a general area of the sky and spin around, soon after we saw it, a large object came from the northwest and the small object seemed to disappear, whether it joined the large objectwe don&apos;t know for sure. the large object was very brilliant in the shape of a cross with 4 bright lights accross the back and 3 bright lights up the center (a bottom view), we were traveling north and the large object rapidly disappeared below the treetops to ourSoutheast. The week before I and my daughter who was going home from work 10 miles away, saw a shiny cigar or flattened oval shape, very brilliant in the north sky in broad daylight. I watched it and so did she, it didn&apos;t seem to be going anywhere and didn&apos;t make any noise.It just sort of drifted in the sky,and appeared quite large.My daughter was in Baraboo heading northeast and I was standing outside my home just looking at it for at least 3 to 5 minutes."

Very fast. Thought, &quot;Is this that comet?&quot; But I don&apos;t think the comet is that huge or fast. Doubt that this was a shooting star.  Trees obscured the progression path from my vision."

19960501,19971203,"Burns (100 miles south of, no city), OR",triangle,15 minutes,"Summary : Bright lights at night in the desert that hovered over the road, then sped away.We were visiting at a ranch in Catlow Valley, OR approx. 45 north of the Nevada border.  I woke up and found that my fiance was sitting at the table in our travel trailer. I called out to him and he told me to come here, quickly. When I got to where he was, I saw bright lights out by the road, coming towards the meadow.  They were approx. 1/4 mile away.  We watched as they hovered about 20&apos; above the road and moved back and forth across the road.  This is desert area and the nearest house is about 4 miles to the north. This object was coming from the north east direction, moving somewhat south west.  When it reached the bottom of the meadow, it turned, raised in the air slightly and headed due west straight across the desert.  It was very bright and moving quickly.  In a matter of minutes, it covered at least 10 miles and then just disappeared.  The object appeared to be very large in size -- maybe 30&apos; tall or more and about 20&apos; across.  It was almost triangle shaped, with lights along the bottom, on the sides and on the top.  Where the object was spotted, there is nothing but sagebrush and there is no chance that it was any type of vehicle known to us.  There is no road out that way, no people, no houses, etc.  After the object was gone, my finace confessed to me that he saw something similar to that the previous year when he was at this same ranch helping with the haying, but he didn&apos;t tell me because he was the only one to see it and didn&apos;t think I would believe him. straight across the desert.  I watched until it was about a mile out in the desert and I could still see it clearly, then, all of a sudden, it tilted upward slightly and was gone."

I looked up in the sky and saw a ball of fire moving up the Columbia River Gorge. I ran in the house to tell others, they too came out to see fire ball. My friend was also with me. I called the radio station and they said that it was a weather ballon. (Yah right!) We didn&apos;t have a camera which I wished I did have one. All I have is memories of the fire ball that movied horizonally up the River and out of sight, never burning out. It made NO noise what so ever."

It appeared from behind the large pine tree.  We were looking East, it moved from North to South.  It was sort of shaped like a slanted T.  It had little orange cicles along it.  It was very dark.  It was an outline, really, with circles on it.  It changed shape, which frightened us.  It glided very smoothly.  It was too low to be any kind of aircraft, too quite too.  It made a slight pulsing humming sound.  It eventually disappeared out of view.  We stayed outside.  A few minutes later another one flew by.  It was sort of H-shaped.  The circles blinked lighter and darker, and some blinked on and off.  It came from the same place and moved the same.  It gave a high-pitched beeping sound.  It followed the other&apos;s path and was out of view in a few minutes.  We were spooked enough, s!o we went inside."

19970507,19970522,"Santa Monica, CA",disk,2 minutes,"Summary : On May 7, 1997 I was looking north to the Santa Monica mountains and saw what I believed to be a helicopter shining its lights down on the ocean or the mountains. I live in a penthouse where I have a wonderful view of the Santa Monica Mountains, the ocean and the city.  On a clear night, as this was, I can see very far.  I often sit out side to relax and look at my surroundings.  It is not uncommon to regularly see helicopters and planes from my view, especially with LAX so near.  This particular evening I saw what I thought to be a helicopter and it  really caught my attention.  I noticed that this helicopter was silent and usually they make quite a bit of noise.  I was looking at the object that I believed to be a helicopter and there was a direct light that it was shining  on the mountains, like a spotlight,  and moving low towards the ocean.  It was in a two to three mile distance of me, which is common for most of the helicopters in the area.  The light that I was watch!ing closely, without suspicion, disappeared, leaving puffs of smoke.  This was a trail of smoke that I had never seen a plane or a helicopter leave before.  The smoke was thick as if the object that it was coming from had been idled there for a long peroid of time and it had not been.  A few seconds later the object took off with enormous speed, heading north to the sky.  this is when I realized that the object could not be a helicopter at all.  Within seconds it was &quot;parked&quot; next to a star, very far away..  It probably reached its location next to the star in under five seconds. It was a clear path that it took and  it was as if it was trying to camaflauge itself  next to that star.  Then I saw a flashing red light that was actually  revolving.  From the distance where I was I could see the object and  I could tell that it was revolving with a red light..  A few seconds later it took off so fast that I could see it going north for about two seconds but it was going so fast th!at it just disappeared.  That is when I realized that I had seen a UFO.  I immediately called a friend and left a detailed message on her voice mail, as to not leave out any details and record it while it was fresh in my mind.  The next day I had to go out of town and did not know of your service until now.  I feel very relieved to have reported this and hope that someone may have seen something also.I have lived in California for a little over a year.  I moved to California from South Carolina for a job.  I am twenty four years old and am fairly concervative in my beliefs.  I was raised an &quot;Army Brat&quot;, therefore traveling is nothing new to me.   I run four miles every morning before work and consider myself to be very social.  I have never looked up the UFO website before.See above listed information."

These two objects seemed to stop and go, zipping around as if they were playing.Mothers Day weekend I visited my mother who lives in Alabama. That Saturday evening I was going outside to see if there were any remains of the Halle Bopp comet.While star gazing, I saw two objects.  They were round in shape and bright white with blue haze encircling them in color.  At first I only saw one, it was darting forward in an unimaginable rate of speed.After watching about 30 seconds the second object zoomed up behind the first and they were going the same speed for about 10 seconds.  Then the second object stopped still, while the first jetted around at different angles in front and behind the second.I then saw both objects start and stop several times.  Then the first one stopped then went straight up in an instant.  The second object then went forward until it disappeared.Im not sure what these two objects were, but I do know that there are no aircraft or weather ballons that I know of that could have moved at those angles and speeds.I dont want to sound like a kook, but I am curious if anyone else had witnessed this event.

A mass sighting of UFOs over Costa Rica, C.A. was reported on CNNs web site this morning.. you might want to check it out.I&apos;m sending the article: Unidentified Flying Objects Spotted Over Costa Rica. Itar-Tass 26-DEC-97 MEXICO CITY, December 26 (Itar-Tass) - The Costa Rican mass media reported on Thursday that unidentified flying objects were spotted the day before in the country&apos;s air space over Golfito district, which is 330 kilometres to the south of San Jose. However, TV cameramen were unable to film them as they did on Monday. On December 22 cameramen from two local television channels filmed at least a dozen &quot;flying saucers&quot; in the sky south of the Costa Rican capital. Before the eyes of hundreds of people, they made zigzag maneuvers for several minutes. Flight controllers of the International Juan Santamaria Airport counted &quot;approximately fifty thousand traces&quot; of their movements. Some car drivers stopped to watch the phenomenon. According to Ufologist Carlos Vilchez, most remarkable is the fact that these UFOs appeared in daytime, that they were seen by hundreds of people and were filmed by TV cameramen. He also expressed the view that an influx of UFOs into the air space of this Central American country could be expected within the next two months. About ten &quot;saucers&quot; were watched by hundreds of people over San Jose exactly one month ago. They flew over the city for several minutes. They were also filmed by TV cameramen. Scientists have not found any explanations for this phenomenon."

19970817,19970818,"Philadelphia, PA",sphere,7 hours,"Summary : I sighted in daylight between 1 and 8 small, bright, round objects high in the sky over a period of 7 hours that flew from north to east in usually in three&apos;s in various patterns(triangular, stacked, linear).I first spotted these bright, white round or oblong objects (they resembled a bright star)at 9:30 am on Sunday August, 17, 1997  in the morning. I noticed one such oject  flying from west to east  above and behind a blimp which was traveling slowly in the opposite direction. I viewed this through a a glass door overlooking downtown Philadelphia, PA from my fifth floor apartment building. The sky was clear blue. I opened the door onto an outside porch to view the flying bright object unobstructed. There were two other objects on the right flying east. They were not flying terribly fast, but they appeared to be flying in a triangular formation. I sighted such objects from 9:30 am until 4 pm. They would continue for the most part to appear from the north and fly east. There would be anywhere from one object to eight objects in the sky at once, moving in and out of various flight patterns (triangular, stacked, linear). They usually flew in three&apos;s in a triangular formation. Somethimes two would fly very close together, and then move apart. Sometimes two would fly as a double on top of one another or next to one another. At 1:30 pm I saw as many an eight objects in the sky at once. I was walking to the market a few blocks from my apartment building. When I reached the store I could see above the store  moving from north to east approx. seven or eight bright round objects. They resembled a bright star, like venus. There was, however, at this time one object that appreared brighter than the rest and its upper portion flashed or blinked. Next to it appeared an object that was smaller and appeared a dull red. That object moved east and disappeared. Three of the other objects moved north and four others moved east. By the time I returned home, I could see two objects stacked on top of one another flying east. These objects were small. It is hard to guess at what altitude they were flying. I would say at least 30,000 feet. Objects would appear out of the north and fly east until about 4:00 pm. At least one or two was always present in the sky. Then they tapered off and by 4-4:30 pm, there were no objects sighted.  My roommate saw the objects as well and was baffled. It was very strange since it lasted such a long period of time. I called one of the local news stations around 2 pm, but nothing was reported on the evening news. The objects were not very large, the size of a star, like venus. They were very bright, white in color. They moved with a strange fluidity. That is what caught my attention initially. They would move together and apart quite rapidly and in and out of various formations.There is an airport that is nearby and many planes could be seen while the objects were visible. But the objects and a plane cou! ld not be confused because of the objects movement. They moved with an agility that I have never seen a plan demonstrate. I am a native of the Philadelphia area for the past 30 years and am very used to seeing planes. These objects were different. They were not random lights because they seemed to moved in very purposeful, logical  formations and repeated these patterns often. Their speed was much  faster than your average commercial plane, but they did not streak across the sky or anything like that.  Sometimes the formations(triangles, lines, stacked) spanned many miles, sometimes they were closed in. Usually they would expand and contract the formation or move out of the formation into another one. There is an Air Force Base in New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base, perhaps 50 miles away. But these objects did not resemble any miliary aircraft that I every saw."

19971114,19971115,"Bellingham, WA",formation,90 seconds,"Summary : consistent with behavior of object burning on re-entryI had a 90 second view of the 14 November phenomena from Bellingham Washington.  From my perspective, it was consistent with the theory of space junk burning on re-entry.  I say this because about 100 initial lights gradualy faded out until only the few brightest remained, and they too faded. Some other observations: * I saw point-lights only, without 2 dimensional shape * Multiple colors, blues, reds, golds, and whites * Two major clusters, the larger one above the smaller * Parallel, straight line path, of all lights, no relative lateral motion between the lights, but some traveled faster than others. My advice to folks who want to label this an object of extraterrestrial origin:  Better make sure your theory holds that the object burned up."

This was two or three minutes after having sighted a satellite passing from south to north. After an interval of perhaps 15-20 seconds we both observed a second flash and were able to make out object with naked eye.  Appeared very similar to satellite that had just passed.

At first, the object was headed due north, then, at about 80 degrees (almost directly overhead) it veered about ten degrees west, then continued in a straight line n/nw.  During its traverse trained his telescope on object.  He has done this many time with aircraft and can make out the navigation lights of such.  This had no visible navigation lights.  The glow, or i!ntensity of light at dim stage, and the comparison to satellites we have observed would put this object at satellite height. No tail observed.  Both of us have seen many aircraft at night and are familiar with what a strobe looks like at great altitude.  This was far more intense and the intermittent nature was not like A/C strobes.  It appeared to accelerate at burst and slow down with dimming? Weird. As the object was about 10 degrees or less from dropping out of our view in the N/NW, a second object appeared to the west of the first at approximately the same distance and displayed the same white burst behavior.  Alternated bursts with first object."
19970313,19970320,"Buckeye, AZ",sphere,5 MINUTES,"Summary : Observed a number (3 - 5) of white/yellow lights hovering (suspended) approximately 7 - 10 miles away.  Observed streaking object leaving one orb and traveling at a high rate of speed in a horizontal manner and leaving a &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;trail&quot; behind (much like a meteor, but in a straight path).  The lights extinguished quickly with no fading of &quot;fizzling-out&quot;.I have been observing these &quot;lights&quot; since approximately August/September, 1996.  I live approximately 4 miles north of Buckeye and in an area that is in a diaganol line approximately 15 - 20 miles south/southwest from Luke Air Force Base.  The first night we observed the lights back in the fall, they appeared due South of my home.  There were three large orbs and were yellow/white in color.  I called to my roomate to come and see and she observed them at that time.  We concluded they were flares of some sort.  However, they disappeared very quickly, as if a switch had been turned off.  A few moments later, they appeared, all at once, in a location several miles to the west of the original sighting.  We were not at all convinced that these lights were unexplainable, and we were mildly curious.The second sighting was perhaps a week later, with the same type of behavior.  This time, however, I retrieved my binoculars and both my roomate and myself wathced the lights for several minutes.  It appeared that there was heat emanating from the orb...we thought it might be smoke, but it appeared more to be like radiant heat.  We assumed that if it was a flare of some time, it would gradually burn out, but once again it exstinguised itself very rapidly and we did not observe it again that night.In visiting with my new neighbors, I asked whether they had seen these lights and they had not.  However, a week or so later, once again they appeared (in the same location), and I called them and had them come outside to observe with myself and my roomate.  They confirmed the sighting, and also thought that perhaps it was some type of flare.  The also observed the heat radiating from the orbs.  They disappeared as before.I am not a very good judge of distance or size, but if I were to estimate the size of these object in relation to the night sky, I would say they appeared to be the size of 1/2 dollar piece.  They have appeared in numbers of 3, 4 and in a configuration of 3 with 2 to west side.I remember two other occasions in which I observed these lights and began to feel that it was some sort of Air Force exercise or some other explainable phenomena.The night of March 13, 1997, I was driving from Phoenix, west on I-10.  I had left town at approximately 7:45 p.m., and am guessing it was around 7:20 to 7:25 that I began to notice the lights.  I remember thinking that the lights were in a different position that I had observed them before.  They were more closely situated near the Estrella Mtns (west side) and seemed to be moving.  Before, I had only observed them being stationery.  It did not really dawn on me that they were moving until I turned South off of the interstate and began traveling south.  I realized that the lights had moved to the location I was used to seeing them...approximately 20 miles west of the Estrella Mts.By the time I was within one mile of my home, I began to sense that these lights were moving much more erratically than I had previously observed.  They had moved even further west (it was approximately 7:25 - 7:30 by this time) and suddenly I saw the streaking object seemingly coming from one of the larger orbs (there were 3 at this time) and move VERY rapidly horizontally across the sky (to the northwest I believe).  It seemed there was a tail of sparks or matter coming from this smaller object and I can only compare it to a meteor, although I am certain it was NOT a meteor (it moved in a straight line and then went out very quickly some distance from the orb). I ran into the houseand summoned my roomate, but by the time we went outside, all signs of the objects were gone.I began asking people at work back in Aug/Sept if they had seen any of these lights.  I suppose they thought I was a bit touched, but now that this major sighting has occured, they are remembering the days I came in with details of what I had seen the night before.  I wish I would have known how to contact someone back then.I am a Data Processing Assistant (15 years) with a large school district in Phoenix.

No surrounding light.  I Awoke out of a sound sleep, went to the window and was looking out when I observed a round, large object with visible bluish-green lights around the bottom of the object.  It was charging back and forth and up and down at a very fast speed.  At that time I woke my husband to view this, and we then both witnessed a second, idenically shaped object approaching the first one.  Together they would go up and down and after a minute or so they both took off at a very high speed.  I called the local police station and asked if they had received and reports on strange events in the shy, and the officer stammered and him- hawed around and finally said &quot;no Ma&apos;M&quot;  I could tell he was obviously not telling the truth.  Also the friends we were staying with had had a more spectacular experience about 10 months prior to this one.  They had a greenhouse, and one night as they were potting plants a large round object hovered over them, above the greenhouse.  At that time they became immobilized.  After a couple of minutes, this object soundlessly lifted off and flew away.  At this point our friends were once again able to move.  Out friends at this time were mature, 50+ people.  They were honest and never would have made anything like this up.  The wife had told me the story, only after making me promise never to let her husband know she had told me.

19951015,19971006,"Woodstock, CT",NA,5 seconds,"Summary : Young couple witness large glowing craft streak across the night sky, as if it were &quot;exiting&quot; the Earth. Craft was followed by a trail of pearlescent light, objected started in NE hor.streaked to about 1/2 way across hor. Then apparently flew straight out of the earth! Without a trace.  It took a total of three quick &quot;oh my gods!&quot; and it was over. Definitely not a comet!On October 15, 1995 my boyfriend and myself were on our way to meet some of our friends. It was roughly around 10:00-10:15p.m. We realized that we were a bit early to meet them so we decided to just drive around for a while.  The radio in the car was on but very quietly.  We drove around for about 10 minutes or so and then decided to start heading to meet our friends.  We were traveling north on Senexet Road in Woodstock, CT.  I was the passenger, my boyfriend was the driver. My eyes were suddenly drawn to a small glowing light, seemingly the size of a street lamp, but much brighter.  Almost as quickly as I noticed it, it started heading in a southern direction (towards us). It&apos;s speed was phenomenal, never in all my years (26 to be exact) have I ever seen anything in the sky (day or night) travel at such an incredible speed. The closest that this ball of light came to our location was within about 1/2 mile.  Upon reaching that point the object appeared much larger than I had originally thought, it was then that I realized that this was not a plane, helicopter, meteor or comet.  All of which I have witnessed before in the night sky.  If one were to get close enough to be able to measure the size of the object my guess would be that they find it to be probably close to a 1/4 of a mile long and about half as wide.  Once it reached the closest point that it had come to us,it came to an abrupt stop. Then, in less than a second, it turned, as if effortlessly, 90 degrees toward the west and continued at the previous rate of speed until about half way across the horizon.  It then again stopped abruptly and turned another 90 degrees, this time to the north and as quiclky as if it had never stopped it took off, again this time it appeared as if it left the earth completely!  Once the object made its first turn towards the west we noticed that it had an incredibly long, pearlescent colored trail of light traveling behind it.  This was perhaps the most striking thing that I remember about the object.  It was the most beautiful yet strangest light we have ever witnessed. The trail of light, judging by the distance and size from our location appeared to be atleast 15 to 20 miles long!  And as bright as the daylight!  We didn&apos;t tell that many people what we had seen for obvious reasons.  When I finally contacted a U.F.O. investigative firm, They said there was a bright meteor in that area around that time of the month.  I told the guy he was nuts, that I know a meteor when I see one.  I said to him,&quot;besides, meteors fall down, not up! And they don&apos;t travel at speed in excess of thousands of miles per hour!&quot;  He asked how I knew how fast it was going? I told him that in order for that object to travel from one end of the horizon to the middle of the horizon and then out of the atmosphere in less than 3 &quot;oh, my gods!&quot; it had to be traveling faster than anything humans have thus far invented. For a plane to travel the distance that this object traveled in less than 5 seconds, it would take about 20 to 25 minutes!  When the object made its first turn and we saw the trail of light for the first time, I had the most incredible tingling sensation come over my body and my eyes started to water and my muscles all felt tense, my boyfriend experienced similar sensations. We are both in our mid-twenties have two children, good jobs and absolutely no reason to make anything like this up.  Feel free to post this event, I am no longer worried that people will think I&apos;m crazy.  After all, maybe I am crazy, but I&apos;m definitely not STUPID!  I know what I saw was without a doubt a U.F.O."

We were standing in front of my friends place of employment when one of my friends looked up and said &quot;what the hell is that?&quot; The three of us looked up and saw what appeared to be an orange ball slowly moving across the sky. At this time, a customer came up and saw what we were looking at and said the same thing. &quot;what the hell is that.&quot; My first impression was that it was a plane that caught on fire. But by observing it more. It appeared to be moving too slowly to be an airplane. Right about this time, we all observed what appeared to be projectiles coming out from underneath the ball traveling down toward the earth. The object then started to dim in brightness and get brighter again. It did this several times. I then assumed it might be a flare but it was traveling in a straight line. the object stayed visible for about 2 or 3 minutes before it slowly faded from sight.

19730724,19970319,"Blackfoot, ID",triangle,Approx. 4 minutes,"Summary : Smooth, rounded triangular object, stone grey, no lights or markings, dome on bottom, silent.I was &apos;camping&apos; in the backyard of my friend of the time in the Blackfoot Idaho of 1973.My friend told me there was a UFO in the sky, come look. I figured he was lying. He became deathly serious, and told me that if I did not look, I would regret it forever. His tone scared me, so I looked.Up in the 3 am sky was a smoothly moving object. It was the size of my right thumbnail on my outstretched hand.The object was perfectly silent, a rounded, smoothly contoured equal edged triangle. It appeared to have either a dome shaped hollow or protrusion in the middle bottom. There were no lights, seams, markings, or details whatsoever.It appeared as though cast of one solid piece of material. It was the grey of stone, and was visible by virtue of the reflected glow of city streetlights upon it. It moved in a perfectly straight line, with no &apos;point&apos; of the triangle facing the direction of travel exactly. Near the zenith of our view, it suddenly altered direction without curving or slowing down.One second it was going one way, the next instant it was moving about 35 degrees or so another way. It contined on this slow, smoothand straight new path, until it was lost to sight behind trucks parked near us. I saw the object go past telephon and power lines, it was above and behind them.My friend and I decided not to speak about it, but instead to immediately go inside the house, and seperately draw and describe the event on paper, then exchange the papers.We though this would let us know that what we saw was &apos;real&apos;. Our reports to each other, when finished, were identical, except for one difference.I had thought the dome on the bottom was a &apos;hollow&apos;, not unlike the &apos;dimple&apos; in red blood cells, while he thought the dome protruded outwards from the rounded shape. I ascribe this to the difficulty of percieving an unfamiliar contoured shape in reflected light from distance.The event lasted approximately 4 minutes in total, from the time I started looking, to the time the object glided silently beyond our vision.During the event I measured the object with my thumb, and closed my eyes briefely to see if it would still be there when I opened them, it was.The sky was perfectly clear, and the stars shone brightly. Our shared yard was surrounded on all sides by large trucks, houses, a fence, and trees, making for a perfect viewing environment,with no directly visible light sources to spoil our view. I was 13 years old at the time, my friend was 14.I have never forgotten this sight. It was utterly unique. I have no feeling or impression whatsoever about what the object actually was. It could have been anything from ship to lifeform to paradimentionalprotrusion to shared, perfect hallucination. Any of these explanations are equally fantastic. It simply...was. Featureless, solid, grey, and oblivious tothe way objects are supposed to move.I have not seen anything else, since. I have certainly seen nothing else like it.It taught me a few things: one, that during a genuine sighting it is utterly impossible to hope to realistically describe thesize of a UFO, as there is no yardstick by which to measure it, save one&apos;s own arm, or a nearby object. Against the starry sky,such a thing could have been any size (within reason) and almost any distance away. There is litterally no way to tell.Therefore I discount the tales of folks who claim to know the distance and size of an utterly unfamiliar object.Lastly, I feel a little cheated. In the years that followed this event, I have heard many tales of UFO sightings, all with fancy lights,weird sounds, strange feelings, and so forth. My sighting was not so spectacular, just a blank, seamless impossibility,moving silently. It did at least move in an impossible manner, which is at least something!I cannot remember my friends name after all these years, alas. I hope that this report may cause him to contact me,so that I can reminisce about this event."
19971114,19971124,"Burnaby (Canada), BC",delta,60 sec.,"I live on Burnaby Mountain and noticed a large, well lit flying wedged shaped object flying very low over my house without any noise. It was flying at a fast and consistant pace, heading towards the North East. It startled me as I caught a glimpse of it from my bedroom window, as it&apos;s unsual to have jets fly that low over my house and usually there is the accompanying sound. There were many lights outlining the wedge shape. They seemed to be about the same brightness although some appeared to be reddish while others blue. It is hard to describe something that is so unusual, as I don&apos;t have any frame of reference for it. It definitely appeared to be travelling similar to aircraft, as it travelled in a consistent and fluid manner towards the northeast and out of sight within a minute or so. I was listening to the radio at the time and heard the announcement that some space debris had been reported flying over the lower mainland. While listening to the Art Bell show on Sat. Nov! 22, it was requested that anyone who had a close view of the object send in a report. I hope that this report will be helpful. I am curious as to why the media reports stated that the debris fell into the pacific ocean, as the object was heading away from the ocean?"

19950606,19970417,"Golden, CO",other,15 minutes,"Summary : Witnessed a Barbell like object that rotated irratically, changed directions several times, and finally dissapeared.I just found this web page, and when I saw the report logs, I excitedly went to June 1995. There is a report of an object seen on the 7th in another state that is remarkably similar to what I observed on June  1995. The other witnesses, who were my co-workers did not report this event, as we did not know how to go about doing so. The following is an account of what we saw. The details are not hazy in my memory, as they are burned into my mind- they could never be forgotten.I work at a Bungee jump tower in Golden CO. I am the supervisor of five employees that run the jump tower each day. At 6pm, one of my employees remarked how the clouds in the sky, when observed from the ground with the backdrop of the tower, made the tower appear to move.(the wind was blowing the clouds) I looked up, along with another employee, and noticed that this was true. Gazing at the sky behind the tower, something caught my eye. At first I thought it was an airplane, as it appeared to be at the same altitude as a plane taking off from DIA would. But then it abruptly changed directions. I pointed this out to the other employees. We then observed the object for about ten or fifteen minutes. The object was reflecting the sunlight, and therefore was flashing in the daytime sun. After five minutes or so, it appeared that the object was getting closer. We could then tell that the object appeared to be a metallic shaft with two round ends, like a barbell. The flashing was cau!sed by the object rotating irratically, and wobbling back and forth. I suggested that it was simply two mylar balloons caught in the wind, but then we noticed the same clouds previously mentioned, and the object was moving opposite these wind blown clouds, ruling out the balloon idea. Then, after approximately seven minutes of observation the object changed directions and headed back the opposite direction. The object did not seem to be getting closer at this point, but we then noticed a faint greyish foggy halo surrounding the object. At this point two customers came to the jump, and inquired as to what we were gaping at. They observed the object as well. After a maximum of fifteen tense minutes of observing this anomoly, the object changed course abruptly, went behind a small, thin, transparent cloud, and dissapeared. I would appreciate any information regarding this sitghting, i.e. whether the similar sighting in your log is of similar circumstances. Since 1995 I have been w!rithing to get this reported, and am very grateful for this service."

No sound, no animal reaction.1997 040X 1400 D Fairhope, AL, US FINAL REPORT The following was obtained by telephone interview with the witness on April 21, 1997. The sighting took place on or about April 5, 1997 in Fairhope, Alabama (Baldwin County) at 2:00 pm (central time). The witness reported this sighting to the Fairhope Courier and to Clompton Jones of MUFON. The details reported to those sources varies from those reported to this writer. This investigator cannot account for those variances. The witness stated he was walking his dog on the streets of Fairhope on a Saturday afternoon, although the witness, when pressed, could not remember the exact date. He believes April 5 to be the approximate date. The witness reported the weather as &quot;sunny and clear,&quot; with a breeze. The witness stated he was walking west toward Mobile Bay. As he was about to cross the street, the witness observed the object west of his position (in front of the witness), at an elevation of approximately 30 . The object was reported to be &quot;the length of the Fairhope pier&quot; from the witness, and was drifting very slowly to the north. After viewing the object for 30 seconds to one minute, the object continued to move north and disappeared behind foliage. No sound was reported. There was no reaction from his dog. The object was described as &quot;generally tire-shaped,&quot; round, light greyish-beige in color, with a row of 8 to 10 square black windows with a blue frame around them. The apparent size of the object was reported to be the same as an object one inch long held at arm&apos;s length. No other external details, appendages, etc. were reported. This case was initially investigated by Ross VonVolkenburg (MUFON). Duncan Crow obtained a telephone interview with the witness and submitted this report."

It appeared to be at least 400 feet wide and 700 feet long. Its size and speed were difficult to judge because it was totally silent and it traveled from the Northern to Southern horizon so quickly. It had a faint purple glow along its leading and trailing edges, and had a series of luminous red-pink box like sections along the belly at the front.

She noticed some lights in the sky, which she said were in the shape of a kite.  When she told me to look, I  saw what looked to be a large triangle in the western sky.  As the lights moved toward us and toward Houston, I realized there were around 10 to 13 individual amber colored lights flying in a perfect &quot;V&quot; formation.  They were going extremely fast, and seemed to be at a very high altitude.   They passed to the south of us, and as they neared Houston,  started shifting positions.  Once over the downtown area, we started losing sight because of the lights of the city, but the lights appeared to stop.  As soon as this happened, we bolted for the video camera. On our return, we could no longer see them.  The  time from sighting in the west until they were over downtown was around 30 seconds or so.

19970704,19970707,"Historic St. Charles Riverfront, MO",oval,Fire Works Display,"Summary : Oval-shaped ball of bright light (bluish-green) dashed through the sky at a high speed then disappeared within seconds.My father, stepmother, friend, and I were on the riverfront at Historic St. Charles.  We were all seated on the same blanket and looking into the sky.  A little off center from directly above us a bright flash of light, somewhat bluish-green, streamed through the sky.  It took the shape of a small oval.  It was moving at a fairly high rate of speed.  Then within about two seconds the light disappeared.  Everyone in my party and including a friend of my father&apos;s who was also at the same event saw it.  I thought it could be a firework malfunction but no sound can from it and it was located far from the barge where the fireworks were being launched.  The fireworks that were shot off didn&apos;t even come close to the place in the sky where the ball of light was minutes before located.  The light also moved horizontally through the sky."

19971112,19971113,"Seattle, WA",light,8 seconds,Summary : Looked up in the sky in a S-SW direction.  Noticed 2 &quot;stars&quot; that were moving together at the same speed.  They traveled for about 3 seconds and then they both dimmed away.Upon looking into the sky in a S-SW direction I first noticed 2 objects that looked like stars or satellites moving together at the same speed.  They were high up in the sky at about the 10-11 o&apos; clock position.  They were moving about the same speed a satellite would appear to be moving.  They were bright white and moved in a downward westerly direction and then somewhat rapidly dimmed out completely.  Then I noticed a brighter star about a full moons distance away from the last position of the other two.  This was was much brighter and slowly moved in a downward westerly direction and it also slowly dimmed out and dissappeared.  I made a few calls to 911 and the FAA and no one had hear anything about this sighting.  I then called the King 5 TV news tip line and talked to a lady who said that they were just starting to recieve calls about some weird lights in the sky. She contacted me later in the evening -9:30pm- and told me that qiute a few people called in to report this.  They were unable to come to any conclusions as to what this may have been.

19760815,19970623,"McDermitt (NE of;  Lat 42 05&apos;N  Lon 117 00&apos;W, NV",cylinder,3-5 min,"Summary : 5 witness long tubular shaped object moving S to N low to the ground with 6-7 oval lights.  The first and last lights were colored red, others were white.  No vertical stabilizer or wings.The object was moving south to north at about 200&apos; AGL.  It was a long (B-52 length) tubular shaped gray object with 6 or 7 oval shaped lights about 3 times the size of a commercial plane window.  The first and last lights were red in color, the others (middle) were white.  There was no vertical stabilizer (tailfin) and no visible wings.  The sighting was planform (from the side) so it is possible there may have been wings of some kind washed out in the bloom from the lights.  It was low to the ground at about 3/4 - 1 mile moving with no visible propulsion (exhaust) and made no noise.  We noticed it as it was abeam (closest point of movement) us and watched it as it moved North over a ridge.  It was moving relatively slow (about 80 - 100 kts reflecting back with my current experience) and was in view for about 3 minutes.  The aspect of it never changed; meaning the lights were visible pointing at us.The sighting took place near a remote cow-camp near the Idaho, Oregon, Nevada border back in Aug of 1976.  It was about 4:30 pm, 3 hrs before sunset with a high (about 25000 agl) scattered layer of clouds.  The observers were myself and my brother, age 7 &amp; 5 respectively, my father, age 50 at the time, and two Piahute Indians, one about 35yrs old and the other was 8.  The sighting was in the vicinity of IR-300 (Instrument Route) which is frequented by AF B-52&apos;s which is what we thought it was at first.  My father was a high school counselor with a masters degree and the older indian was a high school english teacher with a BA.  With the recent uprise of UFO ism in America, my father prompted me to submit this and helped me fill in the gaps of my young memory, which is still quite vivid.  I myself am now a carrier pilot in the Navy and have exhausted any skepticism that I had growing up of what I actually saw.  Much of which came from the two Piahute Indians I was with who ar!e extremely superstitious and would not talk about the sighting, nor acknowledge what it was at the time.  My younger brother, now 25 has a slight memory of the sighting as well.Sorry this is so long coming.  Just got internet.  Can draw picture if interested."
19971007,19971215,"MM82/MM83 (between, on I-80), PA",circle,5 minutes,"Summary : Driving west on i-80 ufo was hovering about 100 ft off ground less than 50 ft from interstate.It was about 200yds in diameter and the underside was very visible.It was very dark grey or black nonreflective material.There were two geometric sections of square windows? that were each 5 x 3 in a concave portion of the body.One section of six of the same size on a convex portion separating the two above sections.Also there was a larger (8x8)square section of very intense white light in the center section.In a 40mph side wind it was motionless and silent at about 100 ft off the ground.Also the CB in my truck would not even key up for the next 5 miles and the fm radio would not work.Also the military may already be aware of this since I saw a helicopter at 5-10 mi west of the ufo.the ufo was still there when I left.The outside shape of the ufo although basically a round shape the edge curved in and out about every 50ft and was perfectly contoured so there was not a flat spot on the entire underside of the ship.To a casual observer the whole ufo could be easily missed as the color blends well with the night sky along with its motionless and silent hovering.There was no activity that I could see on ,around or coming from the lighted apertures.(windows or engines?)The ufo was close to an overpass that did not connect to the interstate.There was only one and I was a little apprehensive about walking up closer and we were on a tight delivery schedule."
19970313,19970319,"Phoenix, AZ",chevron,10 minutes,"Summary : &quot;V&quot; shaped black object with 5 lights, passed directlyover our house in Phoenix and didn&apos;t make a sound. It&apos;s shape was that of a carpenter&apos;s square set at about 60 degrees, each arm about 300 feet long.My 10 year old son and I had just arrived hope about 8pm and as he waited in the car for me to come around and open the door, he was looking towards the Northwest to see if the comet might still be visible, when he saw a grouping of lights. I looked and what I saw was what looked like at first a pattern of 5 lights in a half oval on its up side. I thought it was a blimp with lights on it. It seemed to be floating but I noticed it was coming directly in our direction. My son went in the house and got my wife, my 13 year old grandson and my 18 year old daughter, to come outside. We all watched these lights approach. Whatever it was it was moving rather slowly. As it came close it no longer had an up-oval shape, but began to look more lie a &quot;V&quot; of 5 lights, with one light in the center lead point and two lights on each side. The angle of the &quot;V&quot; was not very sharp, maybe 60 degrees.As we stood there watching we were completely flabergasted because it was going to pass directly over our house.  And it did. It passed directly over head maybe a thousand or so feet overhead. Our house is up on the side of a mountain in the Northeast part of Phoenix and we can see pretty far to the northwest and southwest. When it passed overhead we all were looking at it and talking. For one thing, it seemed to float over us and it made absolutely no detectable sound at all.  We were trying to imagine what it was. It certainly couldn&apos;t be a group of aircraft flying in formation, because the lights remained absolutely fixed in relationship with each other. As we looked up we could see through the middle of the &quot;V&quot; but each arm seemed to be flat shaped like a ruler, and rather long from the first lead light to the tip lights, maybe a couple of hundred feet or more. It was huge.The kids got a little frightened, I suppose because we had no explanation for what we were seeing. We watched it continue to fly towards the southeast until we no longer could see any lights.My background: I am 54 years old, in perfect health. I have a Masters Degree from Columbia University Teacher&apos;s College. Formerly worked for IBM as a systems engineer. More recently worked in the electronics repair industry in management. Presently executive in a manufacturing firm. My wife is a secretary at St Mary&apos;s Catholic High School. My one daughter is an honor student at the High School. We live up on the side of this mountain and are always looking at the sky, so if we&apos;re outside not much is going to go by without us seeing it. And we all have never seen anything like this."

19680225,19970305,"Ironwood, MI",sphere,20 minutes,"Summary : A small UFO we chased in a Piper Cherokee plane.  Object led us in a circle then passed below us.Four of us (3 pilots) just had landed at the Gogebic County Airport, and while taxing back toward the hanger noticed a flashing yellow light about 2 miles southwest of the airport.  We took off again on runway 27 and headed straight at the object.  It continued to flash a yellowish white light in no particular sequence.  As we approached it, it headed east (our left).  We turned to follow it, but it kept staying off our left wingtip.  It led us in a complete 360 degree turn.  It then headed east along a range of hills.  It entered the landing pattern for the airport at 800 ft above ground level.  We followed it.  It completed the downwind pattern, but after turning onto the dogleg, instead of entering final approach, it veered at a 45 degree angle and passed underneath us.  We were at 800 feet above the ground at the time, in the downwind leg of the landing pattern.  When we finally got turned around, the object had disappeared.  Witnesses on the ground with whom we were in !radio contact with claimed the object passed above us, then just zoomed upward at a steep angle and disappeared.  We knew the object passed beneath us.  The object appeared to be a yellowish-white light about 5 feet in diameter.  When it passed below us, it did not appear any larger and there was no sign that it may have possibly been larger.  Three of us in the plane were licensed pilots, one a commercial airline pilot.  Witnesses on the ground included the airport manager, a local government official and two other pilots.  This encounter was reported to the University of Colorado UFO study which was the offical reporting place at the time.  I received a letter from the project coordinator, Mr. Robert J. Low on March 8, 1968.  He stated that the report would be included in the their active file.  I was informed a few days later by the airport manager, that he had received a telephone call from the University of Colorado asking for more details about the sighting, which he pro!vided.  He was also asked about us, were we creditable witnesses, etc.  He stated that he told them that we all were good honest witnesses.  I never heard anything more about this other than a small article in the local newspaper.  I was wondering if you have ever had any reports similar to this one.  If you have, please advise me of them and where I can read them.  If you need any more information, please contact me.  I have the letter from the University of Colorado and several other items concerning the sighting."
19970812,19970813,"Grand Rapids, MI",light,1 hr 20 mins,"Summary : Small distant white light floating about the east side of Grand Rapids during the night.  Flashing green and red lights, not much movement, but aparently a UFO because it was gone less than an hour later.  Had small movements, but kept generally steady and remained in the same location for over a half hour.The object was a white light with green and red flashing lights.  The white light appered to blink on and off, or just different brightness.  Well I was sitting at a local school at about midnight when I looked up and noticed the flashing lights.  When I began to study it more, I noticed that it was not a plane because it wasn&apos;t moving.  I thought that I saw it moving up and down swiflty but not more than just a little, so maybe my eyes were just shifting.  Then I thought that it was just a star blinking.  So I called the police department, and they told me serveral other people had reported the same incident.  Well, I wasn&apos;t sure then.  I got a friend and showed him, he didn&apos;t believe that it was a UFO, he said it was just a star.  So I gave it up, I mean who would believe that I saw a UFO anyways.  So I went on AOL for a while, and I went back out to check it at 2:30 am, and it was gone.  No trace of the object anywhere.  How many stars can disappear like that.  So I came ! here to report it as soon as I was convinced. As far as I know, there was only one object.  I only saw one that is.  And it really didn&apos;t have any shape.  I mean it did look like it was very far away.  A coulpe of things, there was another star on the west horizon, which the police thought I was seeing, and it wasn&apos;t it.  And there was a meteior shower tonight, but It wasn&apos;t that either.  So people might try to say I&apos;m seeing things, but I know what I saw. I&apos;m an 18 year old male, fresh out of high school.  I&apos;ll be attending college in the fall.  I&apos;ve always belived in UFO&apos;s, in fact I think that they aren&apos;t friendly.  They might be nice, but why would they be so secret in learning about us.  I&apos;m not mentally retarded, in fact I graduated the third highest GPA in my class.  I was not drunk nor high on anything.  My friends will prove that to you that I&apos;m not into that junk.  Well, I&apos;ve said enough, believe if you want to.  But be prepared whent he truth comes out, I think you&apos;ll be shocked."
19970709,19970710,"Olathe, KS",light,5 min.,"Summary : As I was travelling west on 135th. St. between Antioch and Pflumm, I Noticed to my left a trio of lights which were strobing.  The lights were in a diamond shape, two ruby red lights at the upper two corners, and a brilliant white at the lower point.  The white light would pulse twice, then dim, and then the red lights would pulse and then dim.  The object was travelling from the southeast to the northwest.  My vehicle was travelling about 45 m.p.h. and after watching the object for about two minutes it passed over the road just in front of me continueing its course.  This was not a plane.  I observed no green marker lights."
19971114,19971115,"Edmonds, WA",formation,1.5 minutes,"Summary : Mass of lights moving simultaneously from west to east.I was driving west on 196th St SW,in Edmonds, when I noticed a mass of bright lights in the sky to my north.  I could not identify what they were.  At first I thought they were a squadron of helicoptors flying in formation with their lights on.  I immediately pulled over and got out of my truck.  I looked up and saw the mass, moving very slowly to the east.  It looked to be about 3,000 feet off of the ground.  There was no engine noise. It moved at a steady pace until it got to the tree tops to my right(east) and then dissappeared.  I have seen many meteor showers and this was not like anything I have seen in 15 years of living in the desert southwest.  The lights did not arc.  They all moved in unison and steady.  They did not change course.  Today, the official explanation from the Pentagon, is that it was a &quot;Russian rocket&quot; which crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington.  Why was it heading towards eastern Washington?  If it was space junk, it would have had to be enormous.  It covered about 25% of the visible sky. Which makes me think it was lower."

19971029,19971109,"Childress (North of), TX",sphere,10 seconds,"I submitted this report last week, but haven&apos;t seen it posted, so I thought it may have been lost in the shuffle.  Incidentally, as a commercial pilot, I have flown this route from Oklahoma City to Roswell, NM about 50 times.   Nothing like this has ever happened before. On the afternoon of Oct. 29, 1997, I flew my three teenagers from Shawnee, Ok. to Roswell, N.M., to attend their Grandmothers funeral. (My ex-wife&apos;s mother)  I dropped them off at the airport, had my aircraft refueled, and departed Roswell at approx. 1600 Mountain daylight time.   (ROW tower should have the exact departure time in their logs.  My aircraft registration number is N9229A) I climbed to a cruising altitude of 9,500 feet, and settled in for the three and a half  hour, non-stop flight back to Shawnee, Ok.  The sun set about an hour later, and left me with a beautiful, star lit night, tail winds, and no turbulence.  Two hours into the flight, at approx. 1900 CDT, and about 10-20 miles north of Childress, Tx.,  (I was at 70 DME southwest of the Hobart VOR, on the 240 radial) I saw what at first I thought to be a &quot;falling star&quot;.   I was amazed that it didn&apos;t burn up in the first second or two after becoming visible, while traveling from an extremely high altitude, nearly vertical towards the ground.  I remember thinking to myself that I could have made a wish on this one!   The object descended vertically until reaching my altitude, when it suddenly leveled off, and while traveling from east to west, still at what I would have to call &apos;meteorite speed&apos;, veered slightly to the north, before arcing back to the south, on a direct collision course with my! aircraft.  I remember at this point, saying to myself in awe two or three times, that nothing goes this fast!!!    As the object approached my airplane at very high speed, it appeared to grow from &apos;shooting star size&apos;,  until it was about the size of a beach ball held at arms length, when I in a panic, banked hard to the right, (taking the object out of my field of view) to avoid a &quot;collision&quot;.   I never saw the object again after that.   I wanted to call Fort Worth Center (ATC) to see if they had &quot;painted any targets&quot; in my area, but was so shaken up by the event, that when I tried to find the frequency on my charts, it was simply too overwhelming to look at the charts, and control the airplane at the same time.  I was about 60 miles west of Altus AFB, so it is possible the control tower saw this same object.  I&apos;m certain it at least streaked from east to west that far."

It was covered with rows of lights, mostly white lights and a few red lights.The two bright white lights appeared at night outside my house.  Then they turned across the backyard. It was very quiet.  Then when I went outside and looked up into the sky I saw rows of much smaller white lights mixed with a few red lights near the middle.  These lights were all moving slowly together as though they were on the bottom of a very large moving object. The shape was elongated but it appeared to have wings on each side in the middle. The lights covered this base and wing surface area. I felt that I was looking up underneath the object.  It slowly and quietly moved in a straight line right above the trees across my backyard and my neighbors backyard.  It moved at the same speed until it disappeared.  I listenend for a helipcopter or plane noise but only noticed a low level hum as it disappeared in the distance. Then I heard a swhoosh noise.  The object was massive and it seemed as though it was deliberately scanning the area. Later I saw the two lights again bu!t this time they darted away."

I had my neighbor come out and she saw it as it was much higher in the sky and about 6 other people down the street were watching it also, but it was high in the sky to them also.

First thought: shooting star but much too large for placement in sky.Saw very bright flare-shaped light in sky.  Very like flare from a firework.  Then, realized it was way too large for how far up in the sky it was to be any flare.  Then, thought it was like a shooting star.  Again, too intense, too colorful (yellow/orange) and did not have trajectory I have seen with real shooting stars.  It also stayed in the sky longer than shooting stars.  The flare shape elongated to almost a line, still quite colorful and bright, and it was covered by cloud formation.  When it emerged (15 seconds approx) later, it seemed to be a single light! Small! No sound (although I have no idea if sound could be heard because I don&apos;t know how to really estimate how far away it was).  Then, it rather slowly continued east and went behind another very thin formation of cloud coverage.  I never saw it again!  The sky was clear except for this very thin cloud formation.  I fully expected to be able to see it &quot;on the other side.&quot;"
19970408,19970721,"Las Vegas, NV",rectangle,15 sec,"Summary : large, erratic, black object, movement reminiscent of paper falling, almost invisible edge on.Hmmmm- perhaps you can help clear up an incident that has been nagging at me.  I was attending the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas starting 4/5/97- I believe it was Tuesday the 8th, about 8pm, I looked out the window of the Flamingo Hilton and saw what looked to like a dark piece of paper caught in an updraft. It shifted erratically in a descending pattern and at times almost disappeared from view when it was &quot;on edge&quot;. As the object moved lower and it became framed by the backdrop of mountains I came to the conclusion that it was much farther away than I had initially thought and well outside of the city.  I tried to reassess the scale of the object, but found it difficult. At a guess I would say the object was 15 or more miles from the city and looked like a windblown piece of construction paper at 100 feet. The scale of horizontal and vertical shifts in trajectory also took on the appearance of a much greater distance and considerable implied ! speed. The object dissappeared from view perhaps 10-15 seconds after initial siting. Perhaps 2 or 3 minutes later 2 sets of dual vapor trails emmerged along the horizon and as they reached the point where the object appeared to have descended the planes (these were obviously planes and what looked to be military planes) forked out in opposite directions. I mentioned it to a couple of colleagues in the airport the next day on the return to Seattle, a woman in line overheard me and suggested that it could have been a Stealth aircraft. Could be- my impression was that if it was &quot;a plane &quot; it was only a piece of it- perhaps a wing. I am not convinced that I saw a &quot;flying saucer&quot;. But by any definition it was an unidentified flying/airborn object that evoked a military response. Do you have any other reports of objects seen or military maneuvers in that locality at that time?"

Out there at the lake you can see a lot more than in the city. While looking up into the Eastern sky, I saw a flash of light about the size of the moon, but about as bright as a 1/4 moon. Instantly after the flash, what looked to be a shooting star came streaking out of the flash. It shot across the sky for about 1.5 seconds and stopped instantly. When it stopped, it was about as bright as an average star. After it stopped, it waited for about 1 second and began traveling back the way it came from, at about the speed of a satelite. Me and my famiily saw this, and we can not explain it. It wasn&apos;t a shooting star, because they don&apos;t stop and go back slowly. It wasn&apos;t a satelite because of the way it acted. And as for the flash, I have no idea. We were all sobor when we saw this."

There were two parallel primary bright objects with multiple bright objects following, much like one would expect of a comet or a shooting fireworks display. The tails were reddish in color extending quite far behind and again moving parallel. Low on the horizon the tails were perhaps the width of my palm (4&quot;) at arms length. The tails seemed to get shorter as the objects moved toward us. The objects were moving very slow, about the speed of a plane about to land, from a West-Southwest to a East Northeast direction. It seemed to come over Tiger or Cougar Mountain and disappear just to the north of Mt. Si.  They started very low on the horizon and moved up and over my shoulder. I had the distinct impression that I was watching something burning up.  My comment was it looks like a sattelight breaking apart and burning up, but again it was very low on the horizon. The tail was reddish but gave the feel of a headlight piercing fog.  However the sky was exceptionally clear. Observer(s): Male 48, Female 45, two children 13 and 11.

They were travelling down Lyman St. in Westboro.  They had passed a hospital on the left that leads into a large cornfield.  Mary looked over first and noticed the strange object.  It looked just like a light tower with a vertical galvinized metal pole in the center and bright strobe-type lights on either side.  Mary was more curious than scared and she asked ((Name deleted)) what she thought it was.  ((Deleted)) dismissed it as a light tower but ((Name2 deleted)) insisted that it moved.  She slowed the car down and it was indeed moving.  ((Deleted)) started to get nervous and told ((Deleted)) to keep going.  It started to get closer to the car so they sped off.  When they got to the next intersection they looked ahead of them and the object was now across the street infront of them.  ((deleted)) was suppose to make a right to go home but decided to take a left and head towards the police station.  Once inside ((Deleted)) ex!plained to the dispatcher what they had just witnessed.  The dispatcher called out to a couple of cars in the area.  They hadn&apos;t reported seeing anything.  The police thought they had seen a cellular phone tower that had just gone up recently.  Mary tried to explain that &apos;towers don&apos;t move.&apos;  While they were at the police station, there was a man waiting to fill out a police report.  He overheard what my friends had to say and he thought it was strange.  He had been working late around the Lyman St. area and when he walked out to his car it was completely engulfed in flames.  He was the last one in his office and he said this happened around the same time of the sighting.  Could the two events be related?

I wouldn&apos;t report it other than the fact that I heard Peter&apos;s report on the Art Bell show, and was wondering if the sighting in Chicago occurred at this time. I didn&apos;t catch the day or time of the sighting. If this seems to fit the description of a regular falling star, then I apologize for having taken your time. It&apos;s just that I&apos;d never seen a shooting star this orange. Thanks. BTW, I work as a copy editor at a daily newspaper here in the Twin Cities and am skeptical-to-open about UFOs, etc."

This is what I heard.  More info. is coming to me everyday.  A V shaped object was seen hovering over the local hospital. Several of the hospital employee when out to see what it was.  I heard that it had 4 lights on each side and was very large.  They called the local police and they came to see what it was.  When they got there they made everyone go inside and reported on the scanner that they had no idea what it was.I also heard from another friend that his mother was driving home from work several days ago .  She was traveling from Grove City to Slippery Rock (PA).  As she was leaving the city she saw this thing in the sky that was black and huge. A blue beam came from the object and it followed her all the way to Slippery Rock (5miles).  I am trying to get names and info. from the local police. When I do I will email you.

Moments later, I looked up and there was a silvery object flying through the sky!I am a 14 year old male who is employed with the BC Baseball Umpiring Association of Canada. After I finished umpiring my two back-to-back games, I decided when I got home, that I would swim in my pool. So I changed in my bathing suit and headed toward my pool at 12:00 in the morning. The first thing I did was look up at the stars, basically because I am very interested in ufology, astronomy, chemistry and physics. I floated on my back in the water just staring up, looking for constallations that I could spot. All of a sudden, I hear a crackle by the fence, (which ran parallel to our neighbour&apos;s backyard). I found out pretty quickly that it was the rustling of leaves on the tree beside my house, over-hanging our pool. Then I turned around, and there was this object approaching me. It was moving in a south-easterly direction toward me. It couldn&apos;t have been a &quot;shooting star&quot; because shooting stars only travel about 3 to 4 feet when you look at it form Earth. And it couldn&apos;t have been a medeorite or a comet, because this bright glowing object didn&apos;t appear to have a tail. And it was moving too fast to be an aircraft manufactured by the likes of your current technology. It came out of the trees form nowhere, passed over my house and pool, and was gone in 5 sec! onds. I stood there dumbfounded. I can&apos;t explain any other detailed appearance, as I never caught a glimpse of the shape it was moving so fast. I was the only witness to this incredible phenomena."

OBJECT FLEW THROUGH THE TREE TO TOP OF THE HOUSE, HOVERED, CIRCLED ONCE AND FLEW AWAY.I was outside on the patio with the dog, talking to a friend on the phone.  From the corner of my eye, I spotted movement through the branches of the tree beside the garage, about twenty feet from me.  I turned to get a closer look.  There were no outside lights on, nor was there any light from the house spilling onto the paito or garage as none were on at the time.  As I turned, the object floated through the tree limbs to the top of the house visible from the patio.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then circled somewhat drunkenly as if determinig the direction to go.  It then flew over the house towards my neighbors house in a southwesterly direction. I was unable to track it futher as it was gone in an instant.  I described it to my friend as I watched it.The object was about the size of a tennis ball, perfectly round.  It had an orangey-gold glow, reminding me of the light a firefly gives off, but more yellow.  It was to large to be an insect.  I normally wear glasses for distance viewing, but did not have them on at that time, so the object was large enough for me to see without my glasses.  It was perfectly round.I am 47 years old, female and married.  At the time, I was home alone as my husband was in the hospital.  I have seen some things in the past that I could not explain, but never bothered to tell anyone for fear I&apos;d not be believed.  However, this was REALLY strange.  I have not been able to come up with any explaination.  The evening was clear, as I&apos;d seen the comet earlier and there were stars out.  There are not lights anywhere near where I saw this objcet.I do have a question that is not related to this:  Are there planes that fly low, rather large with bright lights that DO NOT MAKE A NOISE?  I have seen several over the past five months.  As we live near a large airport, I wondered if what I&apos;ve been seeing is a plane or planes?  It&apos;s usually late at night, after midnight when I see these.  They are not the planet Venus, unless the plantet likes to fly very low over our neighborhood.  I repeat, there is absolutely NO sound before or after this plane or whatever, flies overhead.  It&apos;s the bright lights that get your attention.I would prefer your not contacting me as it would upset my husband who is not in good health.  Thank you."

As it moved closer from the north, I began to see what appeared to be red and orange revolving lights.  The object appeared to be no more than 1000 ft. from the ground hovering absolutely silent.  Though I cannot give an exact shape of the object, it did not appear to be saucer shaped.  It seemed to be more boxy or triangular shaped.  I watched the object for about 1 to 2 minutes until, well frankly, I became scared shitless.  I ran into the house to wake my mother so she could see the object, but by the time we got outside it had gone.  I said nothing about this to anyone outside of my family until Thursday night at work.

That decision led to the most thought provoking and unexplainable incident ive ever encountered in the night sky.  I-10 just west of Tonapah AZI noticed an unusually bright, white light directly ahead.  I wondered what it was. It was brighter than the stars, and too high for a tower light, no skyscrapers in this area, mentally I eliminated what it wasn&apos;t.  Ithought I was moving towards the object, but in fact it was moving towards me.  Maybe it was the Hale-Boppcomet, but no traveling light.  I thought I would soon discover the origin of the slowly growing white light.I had been watching the object for a good 10 minutes.  Im not sure whether I blinked and missed something orthe object just moved up very fast.  I could see that the bright white light was a cluster of 3 lights.  Itmoved to the far left as if circling and moved out in front but below the cluster object.  I assumed thiswas something examining the larger object, possibly an USAF jet.  My mind curiously questioned,if the smallerobject is a jet what in the world could the big thing be?  The smaller craft (size of a tack)  stayed out frontfor a while.  Then it moved around to the right.  I assumed it was making a full circle check of the light clusterwhich appeared to be the size of three lined up golf balls, intensly bright lights.  The smaller craft was a fewinches in the night sky, to the right and due south of the cluster when the lights turned off.  I watched the smallcraft make a wide ark turn to the right.  It headed south towards Mexico,towards Barry Goldwater USAF base. I checkedmy watch 8:25pm I watched for a good 20 minutes.  Not until the lights abruptly shut off had I allowed myself to thinkof this as a UFO mystery. Where was the noise?  Then the reality hit me, I had seen the stealth bomber a dozen timesand its baby bird next to this"

19970312,19970401,"Glendale (SSW of), AZ",light,over 3 weeks,"Summary : Stationary object SW of the Phoenix AZ area seen over several nights. Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix.Over about a two week period I noticed a single light in the sky at about the area of the estrella mountains south west of Phoenix. I thought it odd because I am not aware of any roads or power lines in the Estrella mountains. The light was a yellow light similar in appearance to a low power sodium vapor street light. Observed at about the same angle that the peak of the highest peak of the Estrella mountains would be from my observation point. (I had concluded that because it did not move that somehow someone had installed a street light on top of the Estrella Mtns). I did notice that it would occaisionaly fade out and later reappear in the same spot. This light was last observed on Mar 12 the day before the mutiple lights observed across Arizona. The yellow light description of the multiple lights reminded me of what I had been observing, so I double checked the angles from various reference points where I had observed the light and consistently found that that the locatio!n where I had rembered the light being was further west than where the mountains are located. This would place the light in open sky rather than on one of the peaks.I did observe this light on several different nights at various locations several miles apart. The object&apos;s aparent location was consistantly in the same area which would place it approximatly 20 miles south of Luke Air Force Base or about 20 miles ssw of downtown Glendale at an altitude of about 1000 ft (comparable to the nearby mountain peaks).Despite looking for it, this light has not re-appeared since the major event of lights here in AZ"

Lights didn&apos;t seem &quot;twinkling&quot; or shooting-star like.  Didn&apos;t look like searchlights-too far up.  During the Perseid Meteor Showers.  Seemed like they didn&apos;t fit in up there!I went out that very early morning to specifically watch the star showers.  Living  in an apartment complex, there was a mostly dark area away from the lights where I laid out on the grass with my blanket around me; my head towards the south and my feet towards the north.  In this position on my back, it was dark enough to provide a spectacular view.  I had gone outside about 12:15-ish a.m. 8-12-97, so this is how I guess-timated the time of this event at about 12:30a.m.  Before the event happened, I watched the usual stuff, and the meteors were coming at about 2 or 3 a minute.  Then, suddenly an unusual configuration of four spots of light, with three on one side and one on the other side, (like it was pointing) start in the east (it just appeared out of nowhere) and moved somewhat smoothly and quickly to the west; straight across without fading!  It (the configuration) didn&apos;t look like it belonged up there; it seemed so out of place!  1.)  They certainly didn&apos;t look like a! group of searchlights.  They were too high up.  2.)  They didn&apos;t have the appearance of &quot;twinkling&quot; or comet-like (no tails).  3.)  The light spots were white and slightly blurred on the edges, but anyone watching wouldn&apos;t be able to miss what I saw.  These spots were in a definite arrangement or pattern, and I didn&apos;t see nor hear any plane or other recognizable shape that would tell me otherwise what this thing was.  It was an event of some sort that made me sit up, take notice and start thinking, as never in my life did I ever see anything like I saw that night.  I had actually sat up to say aloud to myself, &quot;What in the world was that?&quot;  The configuration was definitely moving (purposefully so) east to west."

I got out of the car which was stopped in the middle of the road and looked over the roof at the ufo in astonishment. It was completely silent. It had a light at each corner underneath and the beam came from the bottom center of the craft. Apparently, we were spotted too, and the ufo turned the beam off.

The whole affair lasted about 15 minutes. Everyone in the car saw it. We all had gotten out to see it before we jumped back in to pursue it. I got the impression that the occupants of the craft could care less if we saw it that night, as it seemed to be in no hurry for the most part."

The object was traveling in a East to West direction.12 people noticed the object, as we were watching a fifeworks display ( about 2-3 miles away.)  The object simple appeared in the sky, and was traveling from the Illinois bluffs towards St. Louis, Roughly E to W. All people noticed the object, half saying it was a meterorite, the others saying it was part of a fire work that had strayed. Niether of these two theories would work because 1) the object was very low as compared to other meterorites we had seen, and 1) we set up about 2-3 miles from the fireworks display therefore no stray objects could have traveled that distance."

I was listening to the music and watching the sky looking for shooting stars (we didn&apos;t have great seats, but the music was great) when I noticed the lights.  I pointed them out to my girlfriend who was also looking for shooting stars.  At first I thought it was light reflecting off of low flying birds since they were moving so fast.  But they stayed in such perfect formation I quickly discounted that.  I came to the conclusion that it was a high flying military plane (no sound, so I assumed military) that was reflecting in the lights of the concert.  Then tonight I heard on the news of a similar report in Pasco, WA (near George) and thought maybe I should report it."

It was approximately 10:09 p.m.  Suddenly all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking and my husband went outside to see what all the commotion was about.  He ran back in the house yelling for me to come and look.  I went out on our front porch and looked up into the sky to where my husband was pointing.  There was an object in the sky to the north, it was heading south.  At first I thought, so what, there&apos;s an airplane in the sky.  Then the object stopped and hovered in one place, it then slowly began to move back and forth, from north to south, then south to north, north to south, south to north, for about 8 or 9 minutes.  Suddenly the object shot straight up into sky then stopped and hovered. At this point I began to get the chills.  Suddenly three rays of white light shot out from this object in a downward direction.  The object continued to hover for another minute or so, then the !beams disappeared and the object began to move back and forth again (north, south, north, south).  The object then came directly toward us, heading south, and flew over us.  Until it was directly over us  there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  When it was directly over us, you could hear an engine-type noise.  When it was directly over us, it appeared to be an airplane, but I have never seen an airplane move the way this object moved.  Nor have the dogs in my neighborhood ever barked at an airplane.  It was bizarre.  What the heck was it?  I don&apos;t know how far away it was.  I would say it definitely was not as far away as the stars or anything, guessing I would say maybe about 1500-2000 feet in the air.We live in a semi-rural desert area.  My husband and I are in our early 40&apos;s.  I have been a paralegal for 15 years, he trains horses.If you wish to contact me please use my Email address.  I would very much like to know what I saw.  I don&apos;t know much about  the latest in military airplanes and all that, and if the military is capable of making airplanes that can move like this, I sure would like to know.  On the other hand, if this was a UFO I would like to know that too.  Thanks!"

At a distance of about 1 mile away and at least about 300-400 feet above the treetop line, just true north of our house this object was slowly moving on an westerly direction. It resembled an upside down funnel, rounded on the edges and the top of the funnel was rounded also.

The lights dropped another WAY brighter light that was white to the ground.  Then the most awesome part was that they just disappeared.  My husband, self and six year old daughter witnessed this.While driving East on Lake Blvd. in Redding, my husband pointed out a set of two lights that were not normal in formation nor in appearance for an airplane.  They were, from where we stood, approximately a quarter of an inch big each, amber in color, moving slowly north by north east?  When we pulled over to the side of the road after the first minute or so we realized they were not airplanes nor were they any other conventional type of air vehicle.  These were two lights going next to each other, approximately two inches apart, in unison as if hooked at the middle.  We could not differentiate if they were indeed hooked or not, but if hooked together by something this object would have to have been huge.  While sitting there freaking out at these lights, seeing them not blinking, or anything else, moving slowly, they headed north.  After a period of approximately 3-5 minutes, the further away of the two lights moved upward and dropped a giant white light from its bottom an!d this light was five times the size of each of the orange lights and dropped to the ground completely.  It was a huge white light that was so bright that it hurt our eyes.  The two other amber lights, still virtually in unison went out at that point and one popped sort of red for a second as they went out then disappeared completely.We are awestricken!  It seems that even though we stood near our car atop a big city hill gaping and screaming it&apos;s a ufo that nobody else stopped, however, someone had to have seen these...they were too obvious."

We were arguing and she was sitting in the front passenger seat yelling at me.  I looked out my front windshield and approx. 100&apos; ahead of me and 100&apos; high I saw what appeared to be &apos;3&apos; rows of stadium type lighting.  The lights were all white, but not bright enough that you couldn&apos;t look at it.  At first glance I thought nothing of it.  I blew it off as stadium lighting or some kind of neighborhood lighting.  I then turned back to listen to what my girlfriend was saying.  Suddenly, it hit me...There is no lighting in that area.  The only thing in that area is a vacant field. (approx. 1 square acre). So I quickly turned my head back toward the lights and said, &quot;What is that!?&quot;.  Before my girlfriend could turn her head to observe it, the lights disappeared.  It was as if someone turned off the light switch.  I was frozen with disbelief.  I didn&apos;t say anything or take my eyes off of! the spot.  I didn&apos;t even say another word.  My girlfriend kept asking me &quot;what?&quot;, &quot;What was it?&quot;, &quot;Talk to me you&apos;re scaring me.&quot;. I didn&apos;t talk. I just slowly got out of my car, walked directly to the spot where I had seen the lights and looked up.  NOTHING was there I MEAN NOTHING! I was standing directly below where I had seen the lights and nothing was around me...no poles...no lights...nothing. I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I had seen and she blew it off as some sort of stress related hallucination....However, a couple of nights later we were in her driveway and I was giving her a hug.  I had my back to the &quot;SITE AREA&quot; and she was facing it.  Suddenly she says, &quot;Did it look like that!?&quot;.  I turned quickly, but just as the last time it was gone.  Before I could turn my head.  She reacted the same way I did.  She was frozen and couldn&apos;t speak.  She walked over to the same spot as I did and looked up in awe. She said, &quot;I saw it.&quot; &quot;I saw what you told me about the o! ther day and just when I asked you about it, it disappeared as if someone had flipped the light switch.&quot;........What did we see??  Was it listening to us??  Was it trying to monitor our behavior?? For years I have been telling people about what I had seen.  To this day, noone has been able to explain it.  This is the first time I have gone public with this.  I am extremely credible and didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s until that night. I was a Tampa Police Officer for 2 years and  Tampa Police Dispatcher for 4 years.  In fact I was a Police Dispatcher at the time of my sighting.  My girlfriend and I are no longer together,  but she was a Deputy Sheriff and is currently a detective for a local security company.  Has anyone else ever heard of this type of UFO?

Darted horizontally, vertically, and diagonally across the sky.I was out looking at the beautiful Montana sky one clear night, when my eyes caught an unusually bright star.  I thought nothing of it, but when I turned to look at the same spot again, the &quot;star&quot; had moved.  Then I looked at it from the corner of my eye.  It started to move again, but as soon as my eyes focused on it straight on, it stopped, like it had never moved. I stared directly at it, and less than five minutes later, it started to shake.  Then it darted across the sky, where it stayed for a few seconds more, then took of in another direction.  All together I watched this &quot;star&quot; for over an hour and half.  It had no regular flight path, and stopped, accelerated, and turned much too quickly and precise for any conventional aircraft. The longer I watched this, the more I began to notice.  It would change from a bright yellowish-white light to red, white, and blue lights.  It would also dart across the sky, change direction, and emit a faint white beam horizontally, in a 360 degree sweep of the night sky. Sometimes the light would get brighter, then slowly fade out and disappear, only to reappear in the same spot a few minutes later, like it had never moved.  Just last week, on May 12, I was standing on the top of Big Mountain, a ski resort here in Whitefish, and witnessed the same thing again."

It did a triangle flight pattern and proceeded to the north west  of sky area, did three sort of circular small patterns and went into atmoshpere,    It was a clear sky, was admiring stars for about 10 minutes prior.  Today is Feb 24, 1998 and I can still remember it clearly.  I was quite taken aback!!!  did some calling around to planetarium and observatories and they did not take me seriously, some said could be ball lighning.  What surpised me most was how quickly it would change direction.  Zooming from one end and quickly shifting flight direction.  I screamed for my friends to come out of the house but time did not permitt.  Their is a small single engine plane  airport in area somewhere but I could not understand what flight pattern I was seeing especially as it flew up into atmosphere. It did not disappear into distance ( i.e.east or west) but in altitude. Seem to originally come overhead of Kitchner to south east over to Cambridge then to Waterloo direction back to cambridge over toward Kitchner direction   then in Kitchener area its 3 spins  small circles like spirals and then shoots strainght out into atmoshpere (space)..

As I followed it for a few minutes I looked away few 1 second max. .And when I looked back where the object was it was no longer visible. At first I thought I lost it behind a tree that was obstructing my view. But Iwaited and the object never came back into view even when I moved to different viewpoints . It was very clear that night and I looked all around and there wasnt a    plane in sight. The object had dissappeared without a trace.I went outside to walk my dog when I spotted the light. It was about the size of half a penny held at arms length. It was yellowish-orangish in color. It made no sound or smell. It was moving at about the same speed a commercial airplane does. I spotted it in the southeastern sky and it was moving in a southwesternly direction. It was visible for about 2-5 minutes before it vanished. It was a very clear sky that night about as clear as it gets around here. I think its altitude was about 100ft to 200ft. It was oval or almond shaped. I thought it was a airplane until it dissappeared. This is my third sighting all in Southgate comunity in Glen Burnie MD.. My mother witnessed the second sighting (two craft). This sighting was only seen by myself.

I was so excited I got my mother and next door neighbors to come out and view it. While they were looking at it I decided to go through the apartment to see if anything else was coming and sure enough it was another star like light from the north. The second light approached the moon and stopped beside it on the west side. The two lights stayed by the moon for at least five minutes and then de- parted in their north, south routes.

I had also seen a strange looking airplane about twenty to thirty minutes prior to seeing the green sphere. The craft resembled a plane in nature but had strange x like wing pattern. I saw this x wing like plane first and dissmissed it as blurred vision from being on the road too long. The x wing type plane was seen through my front window while exiting I-95 at exit 3 to go the truck stop. I saw the green sphere getting back on the same exit, and thats when I began to question the first x wing like plane. I am not sure about the first plane like craft because it caught me off guard and happened quickly. The x wing craft appeared low to the ground and looked as though it could have been making a landing approach, again another reason why I had brushed this incident off at first. I did not have the cb on when I saw the first object, so I am not sure if it was seen by anybody else, or if my eyes were playing tricks on me. The green glowing sphere however I am sure about and had confirmed by speaking with other drivers who had also seen it."

We observed this for about ten minutes before it finally disappeared below the horizon. I later spoke to a friend of mine about it, describing what we saw. He said it could have been a Chinook helicopter flying under simulated combat conditions. Since the sighting took place at night, there is very little possibility that it could have been a blimp. Also, there are no vertical takeoff&#x5C;landing airplanes in the area. The only local airports are Hobby (civilian), Bush-Intercontinental (civilian) and Ellington Field(joint-use).

It searched the ground with beams of light.My husband and I were traveling at night from Quartzsite to Prescott Valley.  We saw a large lighted object approach the hiway from our left.  It traveled extremely slowly, to slow for something that size to stay in the air.  It appeared to be about the size of of an army tank and was absolutely silent.  As it approached, we stopped in the middle of the road to watch it.  It glided so slowly over the road right in front of us.  It was very low, only about 3 stories above us.  It was a triangular craft composed of 3 round globes of white light.  It was very bright, but it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  It was like looking at a soft-white light bulb.  It crossed the road, and when it got to the other side, it suddenly shot 3 wide beams of pale blue light down to the ground.  One from each globe.  It actually lit up the ground.  You cound see the cactus, rocks and all details.  It then started to sort of mosey back and forth as if it were searching the ground with the lights and looking at things.  Once or twice it slowed to a hover, and then almost as if disinterested, it sped up to a slow glide again. As it moved away from us, it just seemed to turn off all lights and disappeared.  We were amazed.  It was as if we just witnessed a miracle.  We finally continued on toward home.  As we started to climb into the mountains outside of Prescott, we pulled over to make a roadside rest stop.  We got out of the truck, and looked back down toward a little batch of houses down below us.  Suddenly a huge white globe of light just sort of &quot;turned on&quot; and just hovered over the town.  It was fairly high above the houses.  Then a small red &quot;dot&quot; just came out of the top 1/3 of it, and then flew around the big globe in a random pattern.  We watched it for about 8 minutes.  Then the red dot flew back to the same place it came out of.  Then the big globe just turned out like a light bulb and was gone.  My reality changed immediately from a UFO believer to a UFO knower."

I was standing in a parking lot with one other person. As time passed the object changed shape as if it were an amorphous blob floating across the sky. I noticed this because I looked up to see what was making a loud noise and saw two military helicopters fly by travelling southeast. I noticed the blob at the same time. The blob was a group of small white lights. Then I saw what looked like a shooting star starting slightly east of the object. It went over the object and dissappeared and then the object itself faded away. I am a 24 year old married female and the other witness is an 18 year old male. We both work for a delivery service.  I think the shooting star was the object as it was leaving because immediately after i saw the shooting star the object faded away.

At first they were just there, it a semi circle and I thought we were going to get attacked.  Sounds crazy, I know, but that&apos;s why I went back to the building I came from.  I was somewhat frightened but I really wanted another opinion on this.  It didn&apos;t help that a police car was up the block with its lights on.  One other person from the building saw what I saw.  Others tried to look but couldn&apos;t see anything.  As far as my memory will recall, it seems they would appear and then not appear, because they weren&apos;t easily seen after I went back for other opinions.  I must also add that after that event, throughout Long Island skies, I noticed these yellow color &quot;planes&quot; or things that would distract people while they were driving.  This thing would catch your eye in the sky as you&apos;re driving and you couldn&apos;t help watching it.  This may have caused some accidents.  Lasted about 2 weeks.

It was blue in color and aparently stationary.  I thought it was a star. It then slowly disappeared as if it had &quot;winked&quot;.  My friend was evidently looking at the same object.  It then &quot;winked&quot; back, and we could see the light again.  It &quot;winked&quot; off, and then on again. Then it seemed to shoot off in a southwesterly direction.  I have no idea what it was.My summary description basically states all of what I had observed.  Being that I perceived the object to be simply a blue light high in the sky may seem a bit obscure as far as descriptions are concerned, but that is simply what it appeared to be.  Because I was in the middle of town where street lights abound, I do not beleive that either my friend or I could have resolved the object any more so due to the interference of the extraneous lights.  Pertaining to the observers, I would consider both of us to be at least highly open-minded individuals.

It pulsed intermittently, looking very much like a strobe but a bit slower.  It was out of site in only a few seconds, but the speed it moved at was not explainable by normal aircraft, nor was the strength of the light.  There was no plane attached to the light - just the light.  I saw a plane not a few minutes before that.  I told my girlfriend to look, but it was already out of site and she discounted it.

19980418,19980418,"Tampa (near), FL",changing,40 seconds,"We  (my wife and I and our 4 children) were headed south on Interstate 75 when to the west we saw (my wife and I) what appeared to be two craft, or other flying objects (I thought they may be too small for occupants), flying in a pattern much like two buterfly might but much faster.  They went up and down and covered a good distance in moments.  Then the larger of the two objects seperated into three and kept flying the same errratic flight in the same tight pattern that the two had made initially.  I stopped the car to see them better and did not see them again.  I am a school teacher in Ft Myers FL who has more than a passing interest in UFOs but cannot say for certain that I have ever spotted one before this.  My wife is a housemom.  What was odd about this was the length of time we were able to watch this. Because they were in constant motion and never kept one side facing us for any length of time it was hard to get a good look at the shape.  The closest description I could give would be spade shaped.  There were no lights or trails and the color appeared to be be between gray and black.  I heard about your site on Art Bell&apos;s show and hope to hear something about this there.  Hopefully someone was closer or able to see it standing still and was not going 80mph."

19980220,19980226,"Columbus, OH",triangle,8 min.,"I first noticed a long, thin, sort of cigar shaped bright white light slowly moving W to E behind my house. Upon looking out the window that was gone but, after several seconds 3 lights just came on, about 150 or 200 ft. up. They were in a triangular formation, the front being yellow, one red and one green. These lights made several odd manuvers and never flashed or blinked; we are realatively close to Port Columbus so, I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters yet, I have never seen anything like this.The long, bright white light was odd because it seemed to be close and flying very low,( 20-40 ft.), and even though this was a very intense bright white light it cast no light on surrounding objects. I could see the trees in my neighbor&apos;s yard silohetted against the light as it moved across the neighbor&apos;s yard. This object was about as long as the first joint of your finger,( from the tip of your finger to the first knuckle), held at arms length - as I sat about 22 ft. from the window that I saw it through. The triangular shaped object that I saw after I got up and went to the window appeared over the intersection of Morse &amp; Westerville Roads at an altitiude of about 100-150 ft. and headed due North, in my general direction. Once it got slightly North of Morse Rd.,( which runs E &amp; W), it banked slightly and headed west, the whole time going about 25-35 mph. The object traveled West until it was 200 ft. or so past Westerville Rd. then, came to a stop rotated 180 degrees and began flying back East at about the same speed as before. When the object got back to where it origanally began moving to the West it suddenly got a burst of speed like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen and made a U-turn that seemed to take it slightly higher and its own width to the South. This U-turn was one of the main things that made me stop and think &quot; Hey this is not a helicopter or airplane&quot; because, just last year I went to the Dayton Airshow and saw how fast these modern millitary planes can accelerate. Let me tell you nothing I have ever seen could do this- not to mention the g-forces this manuver would have exerted on a pilot would have been more than any human could ever stand. After this abrupt U-turn the object immediately returned to its previous snail like speed and continued on to the West. As it got about 300 ft. or so from Westerville Rd. it slowly turned to the South South West and as it made this turn all the lights instantly turned red but, there was no blink or flash as though I was seeing a different side of the object, the lights just simply switched colors!!!! After the object had changed course and color it just flew at the same slow speed out of my field of view to the Southwest. This triangular object seemed to emmit a wide, highly despirsed light at about a 45 degree angle, from the front yellow light- this light is totally different than a normal search light on a helicopter. It also seemed like there was a triangular shadow inbetween the lights so that since the sky was overcast the clouds were slightly brighter than the object itself- so, it was possible to make out the shape but, there was only a slight hint of it. The object appeared to be an equilateral triangle of about 50-75 ft. per side. I also stuck my head out the door during the sighting and heard no sound, other than the usual traffic sounds, and there was no change in the object&apos;s appearance."

19980215,19980513,"Toledo/Maumee, OH",other,2.5 minutes,"Large almost silent craftLarge Dark colored UFO. Chased by two Ohio Air National Guard F-16&apos;s.On or about 02/15/98 at approximately 23:35 Hrs. I observed a large Charcoal gray to Black UFO. This craft was slowly traversing the sky from North East to South West at between 1000 to 1500 feet in altitude. There was a very low more felt then heard rumbling coming from the craft as it moved. It was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and 100 feet wide at it&apos;s widest point. There were three strobing lights shifting from dull green to bright blue on this craft. One at each of its three tips. I would estimate the crafts origanal speed at between 150 and 200 MPH. This sighting took place within hearing distance of the local Airport extimated range to the airport is from 3 to 5 miles maybe more. As I spent 21 years in the military I know the sound of Combat Aircraft as they take off under full military power with after burners. I heard two Ohio Air National Gaurd F-16&apos;s take off from the Toledo Express Airport and head in the direction of the Unknown. Both F-16&apos;s passed directly over head I could clearly see they were both armed with two each AIM-9 Sidewinder Air to Air Heat Seeking Missles. As the two F-16&apos;s approched the craft it looked to me as if they were attempting to get a weapons lock. The large Unknow suddely increased it&apos;s speed to well over supersonic but without the resultent sonic boom. It then tilted upward at I would say an almost 90 degree angle and continued to excelerate. Both F-16&apos;s attemped to stay with and chase the craft but they were quickly out distanced. I continued to watch as they both broke off persute and circled back returning to their base at Toledo Express Airport. Again I state that the craft made a very low possibly subsonic rumbling sound that I felt more then heard. I would discribe it&apos;s shape as the same as the expiremental XF-16XL the Cranked Arrow (An expierimental Delta wing configuration of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. I should also note that my 21 years in the military was spent in and around the intelligence community. For 20 of thoes years I held a Top Secret Security clearance with several special compartmented acsesses granted. For the last 6 years I have worked as a private security officer and investigator. I do not know if there have been any other reports of this craft nor do I know if anyone else saw what I saw. I watched the newspapers and the television for any reports of this incident and I have yet to see any it is almost as if it never happend.

They were all tiny pinpricks of light, like a satellite, but moving together in a V-shape, like birds. They all followed their own individual paths, but didn&apos;t break the V formation.

Then I realised that I was in the middle of Texas and the lights of the nearest town were not even in view so it was unlikely that anyone was sitting in that field setting off a single bottle rocket. Also, it was too big and travelling downwards from left to right trailing sparks behind. It was a baseball sized ball of green light trailing yellow and reddish sparks. So then I assumed I saw a meteorite, although I&apos;ve never seen one before, but I thought it was weird that I did&apos;nt see it hit the ground.  I was listening to Art Bell a few hours later and heard all sorts of reports about similar sounding sights, except I had felt that this was smaller and closer to me.  Of course, in the dark it&apos;s impossible to tell, but now I suppose that if it was actually very far away, that would explain why it disappeared, if it was falling behind a distant hill.  The land was pretty flat but there were a few hills. I&apos;ve seen shooting stars, but they are obviosly as distant as stars and in the upper sky, this was definitely within the atmosphere.

It was late in the night and the sky was clear and moonless. We where parked in a jeep cherokee near the edge of a high power line clearing. The area is far away from any cities and is very forested. My brother and I were talking and listining to the radio. We both noticed two low, slow moving lights about two miles away. The lights where visible in the distance because we were looking down (parallel) the high power line. After obseving the lights for a couple of minites we both ask each other if the other had noticed the lights. They were moving parallel with the power line and would soon be very near to us. At one time a beam of light shinning towards the ground came from one craft.We both became very frightend and I cranked up the jeep and drove hastily out of the treeless area and parked about 50 feet in the woods. We both grabbed our guns. I had never been so scared. I was shaking. I turned off the engine and rolled the window down. Looking straight up I saw one of the craft had moved straight above us. It was about 60 feet above the tree tops. The bottom of the craft looked very different. I recall a triangular pattern of amber lights with some long neon tube type lights also. The craft hovered above us for a few minutes. It made a continuos shhhhh sound. I thought we were about to be ether dead. But the craft moved slowly away keeping the same altitude. Fear left us as we figured, if the craft wanted to harm us it would have when it was above us. Our mood changed from complete fear to courisity. We put down our guns and ran into the opening under the high power lines for a better view. We noticed one craft had stayed back in stationary flight position while the other craft made a circular horizontal flight pattern which had taken it over the jeep and near the club house where the only other people where for a 10 to 15 mile radius. The roving craft returned near the stationary one and both hovered for a few minites. They both looked like to very bright spherical lights aganst a very star filled night sky.No blinking lights where seen. Then as we looked on hoping they would take us for a ride, they both shot silently into the upper atmoshere like a shooting star in reverse. This event blew our minds. We did not tell anybody for a couple of years. I was 16 years old at the time and my brother was in his mid 20&apos;s. He was a private pilot at the time. He knew the craft where way below stall speed for a conventional non helicopter type of flying craft. I think they used some type of EMF propulsion system."

I am undertain of the exact date but I think it was on a warm fall Friday or Saturday night.  The lights were almost in the shape of a triangle, like a fat arrowhead.  They were not perfectly outlining the object but instead appeared somewhat at random.  The object would be stationary, then rise, and then move forward slowly again.

They all seem to suddenly end and they are gone. I am a police officer and I have worked the graveyard shift in this area for the past 18 months. I have yet seen anything this frequent or this brillant in activity. I do not beleive they are &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; per say, but there is definately going on over Colorado that was not happening before. Thank you for your time."

At first I didnt know what to think and I started to get nervous,..... as I waited my heart began to race in anticipation to what this could be. As it drew closer I knew that this was something not of this earth ,because of the strange glow it had and how perfectly its color matched the stars, triangular in shape bigger than a C-5 military cargo plane and no sound.. It was very inconspicuous and frightening to say the least because of the way it so effortlessly moved, ever so slowy through the sky..as if to say to the observer here i am and there is nothing you can do to stop me! thats when I dropped the binoculars and looked at it as it passed over head ...Immediately i focused on the door knob to see if this thing was coming to get me as i could no longer see it overhead.....I immediatly woke my wife and called my brother who was at home but works at NORAD as a sergent in the airforce..further more I am an aircraft mechanic, FAA certified...and I know it was not ours ...Nor was it a STEALTH aircraft but i must say now i know where we got part of this technology.....more sightings to be continued ......."

No craft visible.Returning home from work on March 7, 1998, I turned east on Bullard Parkway off 56th street in Temple Terrace, Florida.  My attention was drawn to two bright white lights aboput 30 degrees above the horizon and visible in my windshield.  They were strangely out of focus or hazy.  They moved independently from one another, i.e. they tilted.  Each was more or less formless, but also strangely each seemed to have a shaft of light pointing down as though each light was fastened to the bottom of an aircraft and pointed straight down.  But the shafts of light were not vertical cylindars, but truncated cones of white light.  Neither pointed down very far.  I estimated that they were less than one mile away and perhaps 2000 feet high, given their brightness.  I became concerned tgaht I would drive under them and lose sight of them, but it did not occur to me to stop off the highway and get out to look up. As I drew closer they were higher in my windshield, so I moved forward against the steering wheel to keep them in sight.  Before I reach my turn off the right hand light faded and disappeared, then the second light faded and disappeared.  They were rather peculiar, so I was at first reluctant to tell my wife, but I finally did before we went out for the evening.  I checked the sky as we left home about 7:30 but they were not to be seen.  I was relieved to see a haze in the sky then, as that would explain their foggy or out of focus appearance.  On the other hand the cloud layer was much to high to have had an effect.  I do not wish my name to be used!(NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))"

19980111,19980201,"Rachel, NV",disk,8 minutes,"Summary : At approximately 8:10 PM MST, my girlfriend and I were driving north towards Rachel on Highway 375 in Nevada.  As we descended from Hancock&apos;s Summit, I noticed a light skirting the ridgeline that surrounds Area 51 to our left several miles in the distance.  We took app. 8 minutes of videotape of this object.The object is reddish-orange, and appears to be a typical disc-shaped UFO turned on its face.  At first I thought the camcorder was out of focus, but later in the footage, half of the object is clearly obscured by the mountains.  The object was a minimum of 13 miles away (I need to get a detailed map of the area with correct scale to figure out an exact minimum distance).  The object blinks, changes in luminosity, disappears and reappears, gets enormous, moves a great distance to the right and back again in an instant (although this may be camera motion), moves quickly to the right and disappears.  The object&apos;s structure is readily apparent in the video:  a disc with a ring around the outer edge, and a darker &quot;hub&quot; in the middle. I was shown another video clip of the same object in Rachel the next day--much better quality, but without the mountains as a frame of reference.  There are four groups doing analysis on my tape, and the footage will be posted on my website and several others when analysis is completed."
19831201,19980217,"Madison, WI",unknown,2.5 minutes,"Object moving slowly down a row of homes. Crossed boulevard and disappeared over warehouse. drove under it thinking it a police helicopter dowing surveilance.  Very disturbing and panicked when eyes met driver of on coming traffic who witnessed same.Ok, so it bothers you&apos;re web site doesn&apos;t make any mention of this because it was in the local paper the following day as having been witnessed by a cop patroling Milwaukee Street.  Anyway as for my experience I was coming home from the Univ of Wisc Madison&apos;s library and it was late and very cold out.  I pull up to the light going northbound on Johnson Street (just past Tenney park near the police repair shop and old paint warehouses) and about 15 feet above the roof of this house down Johnson Street on my right is this thing.  It was black, but appeared illuminated - kinda dim like - underneath.  I didn&apos;t think much about it. Thought it was probably a police helicopter searching the neighborhood for some East High School punks.  But it kept my attention cause it wasn&apos;t really a spot light eminanting shining down into backyards.  Also it didn&apos;t have any blinking helicopter like lights on top.  What ever it was doing it was moving slow, steady and smooth and kept following over the row of roofs.  From what I could see it look like a rounded off van with a fat base.  My light changed and I started on my way about the same time the &quot;helicopter&quot; finished with the roofs and was headed across the street.  Alot of observations started coming real fast as I approached to go under it.  It was about 15 feet off the ground.  It was uniform in its black color but had definite seams. No windows. The one distinct feature I remember the most was a cross like seam (real pronounced like) on its belly.  This is about when all the contradictions started pooring in.  First off, there was loose snow - if it was a helicopter how come it wasn&apos;t kicking up snow?  And the bushes in the boulevard - they didn&apos;t twitch like they were caught in any chopper wash either.  I remember shutting the heater off and coasting without the gas peddle down so I could hear the helicopter.  Helicopters are noisy but none of the houses had woken up, and I wasn&apos;t hearing anything and I was right underneath it. And I felt kinda funny passing underne! ath it.  The car reacted like it was mildly buffeted by helicopter wash and I can recall kinda of a slow down.  And something was wrong about the illumination it was casting down. The light was dim but clear and the shrub branches kind of reflected like hotdogs under a heat lamp at the gas station.  So I realize now somethings fundamentally wrong.  I take my foot of the gas and this thing rises slowly to pass over the warehouse just beyond the oncoming lane&apos;s traffic.  I&apos;m borderline freaking out and so this guy in this big vanilla colored older model chevy (the kind that seats about twenty) is coming at me in the oncoming traffic lane and he&apos;s got his face like smashed up against the windshield over his steering wheel looking real hard at what ever the thing was.  And he gives me this blank big eyed look.  After that I this wasn&apos;t right and went  right into an adreniline pump that kept me pacing when I got home for at least a half an hour.  The next day it was the newspaper being reported as mussing around on the far east side.  I really try not to talk about this.  And if I&apos;m not sure I think I entered this same experience into this web site before - it feels good to say something."

He led another friend of ours along with myself through a small thicket of trees to a clearing just beyond a small baseball field. what we saw was the strangest thing, an almost perfect circle measuring approximately 60 or 70 feet across burnt into the ground. The ground looked like it had been boiled(for lack of a better descrip tion). the trees that had been there just disappeared, no charred hulks you would normally would find after a brush fire,just gone. the wildest though is the soil that exsist today is almost looks like lava but very brittle wich is completely out of character of the surronding soil. in fact the ground dirt is only a couple of inches thick due the fact that this location is on top of a large granite ledge.

Completely blackened and traveling at about 35 miles per hour, no lights and no reflection other than off the upper edge of the fuselage.I was anchored in tarpon basin which is just off the howard johnston restaurant and adjacet to the tower which placed the tower north by east of out boat.  This was in jan 1996 just prior to crossing to the Bahamas.  I got up to check out the anchor and went on deck as it was a clear warm night,looking up I noticed a line of white being reflected in a diagaonal formation to it`s line of travel looking and traveling somewhat like a flight of birds. A split second later I realized that it was a hard edge reflecting light back towards me ,but not down.  We sailors always have binocullars available so I was able to get a better view immediately.  Being 50mm lens and having good light gathering ability I was able to see the bottom somewhat,; it appeard featurless. At this point I called Connie on deck and gave her the binocs and she was able to see it also. At this time it was impossible to see with the naked eye.  I again watched it go slowely to the northwest  until it completely  blended into the night sky. It was easy to judge the hight and size due to it`s close proximity to the tower.  My background as a private pilot and having built and flown my  own planes and ultrlights allowed me to judge the speed.  As low as it was we both were able to trade off the glasses and abserve the progress.

There were other spectators around, but none with binoculars. I didn&apos;t mention it to anyone, because the demonstration had everyone&apos;s attention. After a few minutes, I became very concerned that there was going to be a violent accident with the ultra light aircraft, because the pilot was trying aerobatics in the flimsy craft.

19980130,19980131,"Dallas, TX",light,3.5 minutes,"Time: 1850 CST; location: 40nm SSW Dallas; altitude: 6000feet I am a pilot. I was flying into the DFW metroplex on the evening of January 30, 1998. It was a clear night. At approximately 6:50 local time, I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star above and slightly to the right of my course. This object was very high and accelerating, albeit slowly. I thought that it was a meteor, at first. I noticed its acceleration and gave extreme notice. It was then that I noticed the second object ahead of the first and traveling in the same direction (north). The second object was much smaller and less bright. Both objects moved to within a few degrees of directly north. The first object began a slight, curving turn to the left and began to fade away ( as if to move into the earths shadow ). A few seconds later, the second object faded from view and with no turning noticed, as with the preceding object. They disappeared in the reference vicinity of two stars to the distant left and &apos;below&apos; teh orion constellation. I notified a friend who was behind me by some miles in his aircraft (40 - 50 nm). He remarked that it was probably an aircraft, given the large number of them in the area. This was not possible. I have seen aircraft all of my life. These objects had none of the characteristics of aircraft and were either in the extreme upper atmoshere or in space. They looked very similar to satellites moving overhead. This is unlikely, in my opinion, due to the fact that the first object began a slight, parabolic turn to my left. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial sighting, the objects reappeared in the same fasion as before. They moved in the same fashion and direction as previously noticed. The smaller object was in the lead, as before. I noticed them this second time directly above. They moved in the same direction as before in almost an identical path. The fact that I saw them a second time is why I am writing this. If these objects were satellites, they would not have been seen twice, moving in identical fashion along the same route. During this second sighting, the! re was no turning motion seen. They were directly in tandem and some distance apart. My friend behind me observed the same phenomenon and stated that he saw the objects turn slowly to the right. I did not observe this. I did observe that they &apos;faded&apos; from view in virtually the same position as before. They were not seen again. Approximately 2 minutes after the second sighting, I queried ATC to the effect of &apos; did they see two objects very high directly above Dallas aand at extreme altitude&apos;. The response was &apos;negative&apos;. I have a question for my reader-Does the space shuttle move south-north? Is it capable of retracing its path in a very short time, in what must have been a large distance? Can it turn in orbit to appear to be curving to one side? This is the only possible solution I can give. Given the fact that there were two objects, I am at a loss for an explanation."

I know the time was right about 9:10pm, because I had just left a store in the University District, and the travel time to the point of observation was about ten minutes."

It had been raining hard.  It had stopped raining.  As we were coming up on a plateau where a silo, cow barn and cow field are located, we saw a light hovering above the cow pasture.  We saw this light at 1/4 miles from plateau.  My brother and I watched the light as we approached the plateau, not saying anything. Almost like we were in shock, I mentioned &quot;What was this?&quot; He acknowledged the same.  We sped up and started approaching the hill to the plateau. As we came to approximately 100 yards, the object started to move. It had been hovering approx. 75-100 yards above the cow pasture. The object was round and orange-yellow in color. It was maybe 5-6 feet around. There was no sound.  It took off and sped toward the ridge.  I sped the auto to app. 85 mph to catch up.  I was flashing the lights of the auto and blowing the horn.  Personally, I felt as if our metallic presence of the auto was making the object move.  It moved as we made our closest point of approach.  Unusually, the object stopped at the ridge.  It could have been our perception, but it appeared to stop before going out of sight.  I had stopped the car and got out and yelled at it.  I told my brother that if it were extra-terrestial, then I wanted to meet them. My brother and I travel down into the valley to cross another ridge. I had presumed that if it did land, then it was on top of the hill. We went down into the valley and lost sight of the object. My brother became terrified to go up on the hill to look for it.  As we looked for something, I had felt that something was there and maybe it had landed. My brother did not want me to get out of the car.  I did and I felt a strange sensation believing that there was something outside, possibly that this object had landed. This was many years ago in the 70&apos;s in approx. 1977 or 78.  I would have cast off this sighting as something not worth mentioning but my brother had another sighting of the round object recently.  He delivers newspapers in the early morning before dawn.  I will get more info from him if you want. I did not see it recently but I always remember the sighting.  I just got out of the Navy and I never knew where to report objects.  Thanks and you can write back if you want more info.  Thanks. ((Name deleted))"

We had just finished looking at this home and were outside looking up at a lot of gnats just twenty feet in the air, when my brother-in-law said look! I said yeah I see the gnats, but he said no, farther up in the sky. Then I focused my eyes much farther up and saw a small silver sphere which hovered in one spot.

Base Disclosure&quot; planned an all-night long research event on the nights of Jan. 30th and 31st of 1998. In an area known for unusual UFO activity, the researchers set up their equipment on an isolated hilltop near the Bradshaw Ranch (which has been featured on the TV show &quot;Sightings&quot;). One man driving a Jeep Laredo, and a married couple in a Suzuki sport-utility eventually joined our party, and we built a camp fire as we gazed the night skies. The first sighting came at dusk, with a few stars beginning to show up. An object, descending from the east, was spotted. The object was bright white in color, approximately 10,000ft. in altitude, and about three times the size of Venus. It seemed to be a solid object. Adjacent to the object, at an est. distance of 1,000 ft. was a smaller object traveling synchronously with the larger object. We all witnessed these objects travel for about 1 minute, until they disappeared behind 6,500ft. Bear Mountain (3 miles to the east of where we were). The objects were very unusual, and did not look like any conventional aircraft. The second &quot;sighting&quot; was witnessed throughout the night: a bright light flashing numerous colors was seen low on the horizon near Camp Verde, a town about 15 to 20 miles south of our location. The light was quite clear, thus suggesting that it could not have been very far away (maybe 20 miles in distance from us). The light, when first seen, was moving up, and left and right slowly. Then it ABRUPTLY vanished. The light would then reappear in the same location...then it would eventually vanish. This activity went on throughout the night. The light simply was not an airplane due to the bright blinking colors it emitted, what&apos;s more, the light was not located near any known flight path for airplanes or near any known airport.

About 5 - 10 minutes before landing, I was watching attentively out my window when in front of the aircraft, at about the 2:00 position in the sky, I saw a metalic silver and navy blue disc like object.  It was about 2 feet high and 2 feet wide.  It may seem odd that it was disc shaped with these specifications, however, it was almost as if it were segmented.  Imagine a disk about 8 inches with squared off sides sitting on top of another disc about 16 inches wide, sitting on top of another disc about 24 inches wide.  Under the 24 inch wide disk sits another 16 inch disc and under it another 8 inch wide disk.  The top and bottom and each side were symetrical.

No more than 30-40 feet above us we clearly saw that the object had 3 lights, one at each point. One was red, one was green and the third was either blue or white. There was some conflict to the color of the third light. it made no noise other than of the air moving past it. The object was about 10 feet thick. seeing this we all mutually agreed to keep this incident a secret to all except to a close friend of all of us who wasn&apos;t with us. We decided not to go back into the school immeadiatly; but to discuss it on the playground and clear up who would know, what we would tell and also to clear up details of what had happened before I joined them.

(Thickness of fingers).9:46 pm, Mar 20, 1998. I went out side to get something out of my truck and heard Geese flying over.  I was looking up, blocking the house lights so I could see better. Some times when geese fly over at nite in the dark you can spot them in the city lights glare. As I looked somewhat to the west I thought I saw some comming over me going east. But as the lights from town hit IT,  I could make out a perfect triangle. For a few seconds I thought my eyes were playing a trick on me and it was really a flock of geese flying back to roost for the nite. But the harder I Iooked, the more I realized it was a solid shape,  not a &quot;V&quot;.  It looked dark gray or black with only reflected light illuminating it. It continued east untill it was out of the glare of the city.  I continued to watch that direction to see if it blocked out any stars momentairly,  but it didn&apos;t, (that I could tell).  When it was directly overhead, it didn&apos;t pass over any brite stars, to block them out.  I couldn&apos;t tell how high it was but it was 2  1/2 fingers long.  That is, the thickness of my fingers at arms length. There were comercial jets in the area at their crusing alt. but I suspect this UFO was way lower then them because one finger could easily block them out.   Not 2 to 3 like the UFO. This is about all I saw.  Just here a few second...then gone."
19980502,19980514,"Portland, OR",triangle,3 seconds,"It was triangular in shape, but hard to describe, because of so many different angles.Well, it was not my plan to report this, because I have never in my life seen something like this, and figured no one would believe me.  After listining to the Art Bell show last night I figured &quot;why not&quot; so here I am.  I work for a hospital in the Portland area.  I start work at 2300 hrs and usually arrive around 2245 hrs.  On this night I pulled into the parking lot, and began my short walk to the engineering shop where I work.  I am not sure why, but I just happend to glance in the sky, and I saw this object traveling across the sky at an increadiable speed.  It was not real high.  I would say about 500 meters up.  It was solid black with a strange triangular shape with a lot of sharp angeles.  It had no lights on it at all, and made no noise what so ever.  It traveled from the south to the north, and went from my field of view within 3 seconds or so.  It gave me the chills because I know I did not imagine what I just saw.  I was able to see it because there was a heave cloud cover this night, and the city lights put a white glow on the clouds.  When this solid black object came across the sky, it was not hard to miss against the city lit clouds.  This object was fairly big.  I would say about 75 to 150 feet long, so it appeared to me.  If you do happen to call, please call after 1700 hrs.  I wake up at 1630 hrs each day."
19780301,19980423,"Los Gatos, CA",oval,1 min / approx.,"Large elipsoid object (greenish hugh) hovering and slowly moving forward just above the treeline (approx. 150 feet) in Los Gatos foothills.I was eleven years old.  Standing on my driveway in the rustic Los Gatos Foothills with my younger brother (9 at the time) and neighbor (16 at the time).  We were talking... then both of their mouths fell open.  I turned to see what was going on.  A large elipsoidal object (about the size of a 1/4 mile running track oval was hovering toward us (very slowly) just above the sycamore trees (approx. 150 feet).  We all stood in silence and awe for a minute as the object moved almost directly over head. I ran into my house to get a camera.  Here&apos;s where it gets weird... .  I asked my mother for a camera (we had two olk kodak&apos;s in a drawer) and she forgot where they were (my mother knows exactly where everything is in her house, she&apos;s meticulous like that)  I went to the drawer where the cameras were and pulled one out.  My mother stopped me saying she didn&apos;t know if it had film in it.  I thought it did and took it and ran through the house to go outside.  (It gets weirder now)  I ran through the television room where my father was watching a rerun of Gilligan&apos;s Island (he never watches the show, doesn&apos;t like it much, BUT it was MY FAVORITE SHOW)  I had the thought that the object/UFO was now gone and sat down to watch the show (which I had seen many times before).  When the show ended... I saw that I had a camera in my hand and couldn&apos;t figure out why.  I thought hard and knew that there was something &quot;really important&quot; that I was forgetting.  I remembered the UFO and a wave of terror came over me.  I ran outside to see if it was still there. I found my younger brother and neighbor exactly where I had left them.  Only now they had been joined by two other neighborhood kids (I believe 18 and 19 years old at that time).  The UFO was no longer there.  I asked where it went.  They asked &quot;where did what go?&quot;  I said, &quot;The UFO, where did it go?&quot;.  They said &quot;oh, that, it took off real fast, but that was a while ago&quot; (all four of them saw it leave). I find it odd that they shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. A few years later I was with my mother in a local shopping mall.  I went into a bookstore to find her.  The book &quot;Communion&quot; had just come out and wsa displayed in the store.  I literally was scared for my life when I saw the cover... I was terrified that the alien on the cover was going to kill me.  Now, I&apos;d never seen a picture of a Grey up to that point in my life.  And I had no idea that it was an alien.  Non-the-less, I ran out of the bookstore and sat outside for 1/2 an hour scared to go back in and see the image of the alien. Was I abducted?  I don&apos;t know. All I know is I saw that UFO (or at least something without wings or propellers)  when I was a kid.  And I was terrified of the picture on a book cover."
19970327,19980610,"Carlisle, PA",formation,NA,"This is an investigative report of this sighting report from your webpage. Carlisle PA sighting of a formation of lights - 3/27/97 I have investigated several similar reports from the Carlisle area.  There  is a club of ultra-light plane pilots operating from a small airport nearby. They like to play UFO games, and also fly formations.  The fact that the lights reponded when the witnesses flashed a flashlight is a sure giveaway.  Also, this sighting was near twilight.  Ultralights pilots are not licensed.  They are not supposed to fly after dark, but have lights for twilight.  They use Visual Flight Rules and almost never fly flight plans because they return to the same field from which they took off.  They are too small and fly too slowly to appear on radar screens, if at a distance are noiseless (or if the wind blows the wrong way) and may seem to hover, particularly if flying into a headwind.  I have been told by a member of this club that &quot;If you want to see a real UFO, you should see us turn our spots on and fly IN A CIRCLE,&quot;  and he roared with laughter. How to identify possible ultralight formations: 1) the &quot;leader&quot; effect, wherein the lead plane (as with birds) moves around, but the others seem to be steady because they have someone to guide on. 2) unequal number of lights on each wing of a VEE (even number of lights or planes) 3) seen in twilight (although illegal after dark flights are sometimes made) 4) motor noises (but only if very close) 5) usually no motor noses, particularly if at a distance 5) slow or hovering 6) respond to lights or signals from the ground. Investigators should seek out local flying fields on a nice Saturday and make friends with pilots.  They are good sources of info, but be careful you don&apos;t give them any ideas. Conclusions: These sightingswere most likely ultralights. PS: I once spoke to an ultralight pilot who told me that in the ealry 1980s he belonged to a flying club which operated out of the airport at Stormville NY.  They even called themselves &quot;the Martians&quot;.  He said a pix of their formation once made the New York Times.  A 1984 investigative article in Discovery magazine concluded that they were small planes.  He said that the small plane pilots also also tried UFO hijinks, with spots and Christmas lights, etc., but he said the &quot;real Martains&quot; were the ultralights.  They stopped doing it after literally thousands of commuters were stopping on roads and they were afraid they would be heldl responsible for traffic accidents.  These were the stimuli for the &quot;&quot;Hudson Valley UFOs&quot;.  Of course, once people started looking up, they saw UFOs everywhere. There is an incredible amount of air traffic in the NY metro area. Delgado and Hynek&apos;s book &quot;Night Seige&quot; dismissed the Discovery explanation with only a couple paragraphs, yet included sightings with &quot;UFO motor noises&quot;, no radar contacts, &quot;hovering&quot; etc. This book can&apos;t be taken seriously because of its dismissal, withouht much discussion, of the Discovery investigation. My acquaintance related this story to me and then roared with laughter, &quot;Now everybody&apos;s doing it&quot;, he told me."

Not Fireworks...4 intense glowing green &quot;Stop-light&quot; type orbs holding tight diamond formation.  I just left home on my way to driving 35 miles to SLC to a radio station(I was a late night DJ and needed to be there by 12:30 am).  When driving eastbound on south end of town, I spotted the 4 described orbs hovering maybe 1000 feet over the Oquirrh mountains (approximately directly over Kennecott Open Mine Copper Pit).  I pulled the car over and assured myself I wasn&apos;t seeing a reflection on the inside of my window.  (I moved to various areas of the window, and also rolled down my window and looked outside, the orbs remained stationary).  Even though this was 4th of July, these were definitely not fireworks, as the tight formation hovering continued for somewhat over a minute.  Then the orbs flew in tight formation in a very horizontal direction to the north, following the mountain range.  Apparently the orbs were either in the mountains or in the Salt Lake Valley, because as they flew northward at an extreme speed, they dissapeared behind the mountain range.  I am unaware of any reports on this, but I was on my way to a radio station and broadcasted my sighting on-air and requested further reports to be called in.  I didn&apos;t receive any comments, so I may have been the only one who saw this."

19970513,19980217,"Edinboro, PA",oval,3-4:00 min,"A friend and I had just dropped off another friend in a suburban neighborhood.  My friend was driving, and I was in the passenger seat.  It was a very stary night, and the sky was completely clear.  We were coming upon an intersection where I saw a red, glowing object hovering over a corn field in back of a house across the street, in the left corner of the intersection.  I alerted my friend to its presense, where upon he accelerated in order to get a closer look.  As we neared the intersection the object began to move parallel to the road that we were traveling on.  I had my head out of the window.  The object seemed to be silent.  It maintaned a steady altitude of maybe 300-500 feet.  It then crossed the road in front of us, while gaining altitude, and then traveled off in what appeared to be a southwesterly direction.It was difficult for my friend and I do accurately estimate the distance between the object and the ground when we first observed it hovering.  It was oval or egg-shaped and glowed red. It seemed to emit an aura of sorts.  When I think back to this experience, due to the behavior of the object and the apparent absence human activity, I do feel as if we had surprised the object when we came upon it.  When it did cross in front of my friend&apos;s vehicle and continued to ascend into the atmosphere I believe that it did so to a certain point at which it stopped and once again hovered.  Because I followed its path with my eyes, I could see its ascension, but eventually the light ceased to move.  At this point I observed that the object did not appear to change in size, as it would if it were continually moving away from my point of observation.  In addition, the intensity of the red light it emitted did not change as it would if it had been moving away in a continuous manner.  At that time it appeared to me as a red light &quot;camoflouged&quot; amongst the spectrum of lights present in the sky.   Although we try to remain skeptical, my friend and I had never before experienced a ufo encounter of this nature.  We are both highly interested in the pursuit of the truth underlying this type of phenomena."
19980424,19980425,"Bedford Park, IL",fireball,3-5 seconds,"A glowing green sphere, with a white rectangular light behind it, emerged and then streaked westwardly.  As it streaked it slightly grew in length.  The next day in Cicero Il., I witnessed the same sphere.  It also streaked westwardly.  Both instances were somewhat like a shooting star.  But was much closer and the streak was wider than one would see with a shooting star.I had just got out of work and was waiting for my brother to pick me up.  I glanced up at the sign on our store front when I noticed a green sphere begining to streak up above.  As it was streaking, it left a white trail behind it that elongated as the green sphere advanced.  Then suddenly the sphere gained velocity and vanished.  Upon gaining speed, the white tail shrank and dissapeared along with it.  I have seen shooting stars before but never like this. I was curious as to what it was.  It appeared not to be in the immediate atmosphere but instead just outside of it.  This occured thursday morning at 12:25.  On friday as, I was walking with a freind, we were talking as I glanced straight ahead and saw the same sphere streak by ahead of us not above us.  Like the first instance, it also headed west and lasted only 3-5 seconds.  This second instance occured at 9:30 p.m. .  I could not believe that I was seeing the same thing I had witnnesed a day earlier.  My reaction was that of amazement and reduced my ability to react.  I only pointed the object out to my freind as it vanished.  Unfortunately he did not see it in time.  I am not suggesting anything grand or spectacular.  I am only reporting what I have witnessed.  I hope to somehow find the answer to this curiosity that has crossed my path twice."

It shot across the sky like a shooting star or metor, but it did not fade out like one. My whole siting was about three seconds. I stopped and stood on the running board of my S-10 Blazer, but the object was just gone! It traveled in a north to south-west direction. The next day I told my neighbor about this stating &quot;that was the biggest shooting star I have ever seen&quot; As I said in the brief above. I clearly saw at least three colors white, green and a very brite orange. I am 34 years old, a retail manager. I have lived most of my life in and around the Snohomish area."

Because of the time of the observation altitude is only a rough estimate, however at the time I was an Air Traffic Controller in the U.S. Air Force, so it was my job to be able to determine such information by sight, this also means I had radar equipment at my disposal to track airborne aircraft under my control, and at the time of the observation neither myself nor the other two witnesses were able to observe a radar signature of the craft. It appeared to be about 1 mile south of our position in the control tower at Scott A.F.B.. The object made no noise whatsoever."
19710415,19980408,"Burlington, NC",circle,30 seconds,"I was thirteen years old, was in the back seat of a Volkswagon Beetle being driven home from school, while gazing out the rear window I saw a silvery perfect circle approximating the size of the full moon steadily rising upward in the East against an overcast smooth gray sky.  I had a strong feeling not to discuss this sight with anyone, as interesting and astounding to me as it was.While riding home from middle school in the backseat of a Volkswagon Beetle I was gazing out the rear window of the car when I saw a silvery perfectly round object that resembled a full moon rising steadily against a gray overcast sky.  There was no rain occuring, just a dry overcast gray day.  At that time, I was thirteen years old.  I knew that what I saw was not a weather balloon, due to the fact that my father, a small aircraft pilot, had taken me numerous times to the local airport to view weather balloon launches, and I was very familiar with all that weather balloons involve, both visually and mechanically. While watching this object for about thirty seconds, I felt that I was not intended to see it, and I made what I felt was a conscious decision to never discuss what I had seen.  I noticed the object ascending from the East, and I watched it with apprehension until the vehicle in which I was riding turned a corner and went down a hill towards my home, and my view was blocked by landscape and trees..  When I first noticed the silver circle it was about 20 degrees about the visible horizon, when I lost sight of it thirty seconds later it was in what I would consider the 11:00 AM position, but not overhead, still east of me. To the east of my sighting location there was no developments, airports, cities, etc.-- just rural area. The object seemed to be very close in proximity and relatively the size of a full moon, and metallic-- silver in color.  Twenty-seven years later, I can still visualize and feel exactly what I witnessed in 1971, and I still have an eerie feeling when I think about it, whic is mostly all the time."

A few seconds latr it came back and lit up the entire area.My cousin Chris and I are each 14 years of age.  Lastnight we dissided to sleep outside.  The clouds were out so we really couldnt see the stars .  We were talking about something and I saw a large and bright haze in the corner of my eye.  I looked up and saw a bright greenish object in the sky. I immediatly yelled to my cousin to look up in the sky.  He then saw it and freeked out.  He got up and started to run towards the house.  I was amazed and still was looking at it.  It then shot away and left a green-yellow glow behind.  After i saw it leave i got up and saw it reapper.  Their is a barn close to us and the house and it lit up.  Their were no cars around and this is in a pretty secluded area.  My Cous then screamed.  He said the light was directly on top of him but i was too busy getting my shoes on.  As I was running towards the house all of a sudden it became pitch black and nothing was in the sky.  We remember it being pretty light ouside we could see each other fi! ne and didnt think anything of it.  About 25 minutes before it happened we were setting up a tarp to set our sleeping bags on.  I brought a super high powered flashlight that is used for my fathers boat.  My cousin was flashing it in the sky pointing out different stars that we could see through the clouds.  This might have attracted them who knows.  Throught the whole thing I was amazed at it and perfectly calm.  Next week we are going to sleep out again w/ cameras and if any thing happens i will write back.

Like the color of natural gas burning on your stove. I looked like a shooting star, but was too close to the earth and too big. I live in the northwest part of Houston. I was sitting in my garage, looking south- southwest when I saw it. I didn&apos;t see where it came from, it appeared and fell to the earth very fast.

19980426,19980427,"Eagan, MN",light,5 secs,"I glanced skyward and saw an object moving extremely quickly across the night sky. It appeared as two points of light, seperated but traveling uniformly. The object materialized, traveled very quickly on a straight path, then disappeared. I confess that the object was quite faint.The object was two points of light, seperated by just a degree or so. The lights appeared white in color and kept a constant level of brightness.  The two points of light were obviously traveling as one unit as they moved across the night sky. I just happened to look upward to admire the night sky when I left a restuaraunt and noticed the object moving on a southeast to northwest path. Within 5 seconds, the object vanished as quickly as it appeared.  The object never came near the horizon. I recently graduated from college with a degree in Sociology.  I took an Astronomy class in college and consider it somewhat of a hobby of mine.  I have seen countless shooting stars and this object was very different from anything I had seen in the night sky before. It traveled way too quickly to be a jet and there was no actual &quot;streak&quot; as is commonly observed with meteors. The intensity of the lights remained constant until it disappeared."
19980124,19980125,"Kaneohe, HI",triangle,5 hours,"Summary : Saw a very large (size of a school bus) bright light wide triangular shape in the sky hovering above a nearby mountain. Then second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that came to a dead stop unlike any aircraft.It was Saturday morning 1/24/98. The time was 5:45am. It was unusual I was up so early (for some unknown reason) after having a long 15 hour work day. I was wide awake so I turned on my television and sat on my couch when I noticed a peculiar bright light in the corner of my eye coming from my kitchen window. I got up from the couch to get a closer look and it did&apos;nt seem to be moving. It was a very large (size of a school bus?) bright light in the sky just hovering above a nearby mountain (apprx.4 miles away). From my distant view the light was clearly shaped like a very wide letter &quot;A&quot;. I immediately told my wife who first thought I was teasing then responding with a jump out of bed after my unsettled behavior. She quickly acknowledged this was definetly no plane, no helicopter and  no weather balloon. We both ran outside to get a closer look. I then called my brother who lives next door, who joined us with his 3 children aged 12,13 &amp; 15. All eyes were totally glued to the sky for a good 2 hours as the craft very slowly ascended. It&apos;s movement was so slow it took the 2 hours for the craft to become just a speck in the sky, at which time it came to a dead stop. It was about 10 minutes later after the craft had stopped that we then were alarmed by a second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that I have never seen before from any aircraft. I had been to air shows before watching such events like Thunderbirds &amp; Blue Angels and is somewhat familiar with jet speed. To better describe the speed at which the second craft was moving is to take your hand and put it on top of your head and fling it forward as fast as you can. By doing this you can experience the same feeling we all had from the second craft. It was the speed from the second craft that  confirmed that the first very slow craft was a genuine UFO. To continue with the second craft maneuvers - after streaking through the sky it came to a dead stop and then also hovered over the same mountain as the first craft di! d. Now we could see both craft within our sight of view. The first in the very very far distant and now the second craft which we could&apos;nt determine it&apos;s simular shape until it had come to a stop atop the mountain. The second craft hovered for about 5 minutes and just disappeared. We did&apos;nt see it streak off or anything; we just could&apos;nt see it anymore. We all just said &quot;where did it go&quot;? The first craft was still just a speck in the sky and just stayed in the now bright sky (getting hard to maintain a constant view in the daylight) by which time our eyes were irritated and we just got tired of looking at it so long. But before I went inside I remebered it&apos;s location in the sky by using some telephone wires to refer to as a guide to where it&apos;s location was. 3 to 4 hours later I went outside and it was still there. Went to work told some fellow co-workers, made some more phone calls in addition to earlier conversations with the police station and a military base (felt foolishly uncomfortable) to see if anyone had reported any sightings to no avail - bought a telescope came home that night 9 hours later and it was still there. Frantically I set up the Celestron scope with a 4 1/2&quot; (114mm) x 910mm accommodated by a 10 &amp; 25mm lense and 1/2 hour later went outside with it where we had a clear view but not a satisfied magnification of it. My wife and I was sure and precise to it&apos;s location but we lost interest after a couple of hours when it would no longer perform for us. As I sit and type this report 42 hours later from that first moment I saw that bright light outside my kitchen window......(pause) I stopped to look at my now frequent favorite spot in the sky between the telephone wires and see what looks like a distant star in our exact location......will it move again? Who knows? You can bet we will keep looking. But, it has been nice to tell our experience to someone after those foolish sounding phone calls. However foolish, to see what we saw was fun and exciting and a  previlege to have had a little disc! overy channel stuff right in our backyard. Thanks for your time - we are your newest fans of your great web site and the job that your doing.....maybe you can reccommend a quality telescope with photographic capabilities. Thanks again!"

This was a large amount of lights and at first I thought that they was moving around but after stopping my truck and watched for awhile I summed up that the lights wasn&apos;t moving and that they didn&apos;t remind me of car lights for as I watched and moved about looking at this that it was just as bright from any spot that I looked at them where as car lights would be going in one stright direction and if you moved to a different angle and looked at them they would look different( not as bright) but no matter where I moved to and looked at them , other than the trees blocking the view, they was just as bright.

In the same spot from what I could tell. I found a spot to pull over and from here with the binoculars I could tell , whatever it was that it was about tree top level and from my viewing spot it was behind some trees , so I tried to move to a different area and couldn&apos;t find a spot to pull over , so here I am in the middle of the road ( in a good spot now , with a break in the trees where it was at) I couldn&apos;t make out what I was seeing other than it was bright and lighting up the top of the mt. and I didn&apos;t see anything under the lights , but I didn&apos;t get long in this new viewing spot due to another car came up and I had to move and at the same time I noticed that I was a hair away from being out of gas and fearing that if it moved that I would follow and run out of gas and taking a chance of going for gas and coming back. Gas was about 2-3 miles away and you guessed it, When I got back it was gone. Went driving around but didn&apos;t see anything else. Came home and called the sheirff&apos;s office to see if they had any calls on this and was told no. And tried to sum up what I had seen. The best that I can sum up is that it looked liked something I had seen from a movie (as in &quot;Fire In The Sky&quot;) where that object was lighting up the woods. It was light lots of bright flood lights in a large circle and lighting up the whole area. No noise, to me this ruled out a plane or hellicopter, while I was looking at this , it wasn&apos;t like looking at headlights, with binoculars you would be able to tell that it was headlights.It wasn&apos;t moving from what I could tell , the lights wasn&apos;t flickering it was just like it was just hanging there. It was a clear night, you could see stars but then a couple of hours later we had bad fog roll in. I was looking north, but I&apos;m sure I wasn&apos;t looking at a star or airplane for this light was on that mountain.

19980307,19980313,"Orlando, FL",sphere,2 minutes,"We observed two sperical objects which were bright white surrounded by a haze which hovered in the eastern sky and then suddenly disappeared.We were driving south on Semoran Blvd. near the airport in Orlando when we turned east toward a restaurant. In the eastern sky, at approx. 40 degrees above the horizon, there were two spherical objects emitting a bright white light.  The objects were clearly defined with a haze surrounding them.  The closest analogy I can think of is the appearance of a flashlight in fog.  The sky was generally clear and the airplanes preparing for landing were clearly distinguishable. The airplane lights did not exhibit this same haze so I don&apos;t think the haze surrounding the spheres was the result of any cloud cover.  The two objects were hovering near each other but at slightly different elevations.  The sphere to the left was slightly elevated over the right sphere.  We slowed down to watch the objects, initially assuming that it was some unannounced launch from KSC.  However, the objects didn&apos;t move. They appeared to hover in the same position.  This period was long enough for us to observe them and conjecture as to what we were seeing.  The two objects disappeared suddenly.  When we got to the restaurant parking lot, several other people were standing around discussing what we had just seen. Orlando news covered the reports and showed video taken in Ft. Myers.  This video is an accurate representation of what we saw in Orlando.  Local news also reported that Patrick Air Force Base released a statement that the objects were the result of &quot;naval operations&quot;.

I was looking at the sky because it was so clear out on the road. Then I saw a light moving very high in the sky and I observed it for a few moments then it splitt into 5 lights about the same size or so they started going in circles following each other and speeding very fast away from the formation then returing back and doing it over and over again,by this time my brothers were trying fo find them I was pionting my finger at the objects and they could not find them untill one by one of my brothers found them and we were all going did you see what it did what are they is it a military thing but no it cant be because these things were playing I am lucky to have experienced this fenomena if indeed thats what it was. but I will not forget the exicitement it caused us all the objects only looked like blue in color and some times redish after 10 min of this going on the objects went in different locations. If I continued looking one or two objects played and left I just got tierd of looking it was great."

As I walked into the backyard, I noticed an odd looking light in the Western sky. The light was amber/white in color, and was not blinking. It was located approximately 35-40 degrees above the horizon, and moving in a Southerly direction. I watched the object traverse the sky from due West to approximately W/SW. I was watching the light pretty intensely, and all of a sudden, it vanished. The color of the light reminded me of the color and quality of a vapor street lamp. You know, the kind that is supposed to reduce shadows. It appeared to be moving fairly fast. I have seen many airliners flying in the skies around here, and the object appeared to be moving faster than they normally do. It appeared to be out over the Everglades."

An afterburner &quot;puff&quot; of smoke was seen that remained in the clear sky for sometime afterwards. The unknown object was fairly sharply defined and appeared to be reflecting the (setted) sunlight, and I saw no condensation trail.  I saw the object by naked eye and through 7x35 binoculars.

19880701,19980201,"Arcadia, CA",rectangle,about 5 minutes,"Summary : Our dog was barking at something.  His bark was the bark as if he didn&apos;t want to leave the porch but wanted to summon someone in the family.  I went to investigate. Initially I saw nothing.  Then a rectangular craft flew by very slowly. The craft was divided into thirds.  Each third lit up sequentially with a red light.  The object made  no noise whatsover.In addition to the above information there is more to add that is very interesting.  One week later a friend of mine from high school, telephoned me in a panicked state.  Apparently he had seen the same object in the city of Sierra Madre, while on a night hike into Bailey Canyon.  He had stopped to tie his shoe lace while the others continued on the hike.  He stated that the object appeared to lose control and looked as though it were going to crash into the property of Mater Dolorosa Retreat Center.  This is a Catholic retreat center run by the Passionist Fathers. The thing that through us for a loop about this is this.... My friend who had witnessed this event, a week after I had, had gone to the whole life expo in Pasadena,Ca. of that year.  He left the convention being &quot;paranoid&quot; of ufo&apos;s and aliens.  I was a &quot;doubting Thomas&quot;.  I suggested that he go and see a psychiatrist.  Nothing more was said about the ufo subject untill the sightings that we  had It was that we had conversed, and realized that we had seen the same craft at two different places and times that there must be connection.  It was almost like as if some intelligence did something to get my dog to bark that night, to get me out of bed to investigate so that I would see this craft. Like I said...I never went to the whole life expo....but It was like as if some intellegent being heard me tell my friend Tony that I thought he was a quack.  And to make it even more believable to us it revealed itself to us...that well we never had many people believe our story except one of the priests at the retreat center with whom we were friends with.I didn&apos;t think it necessary to record the dates of the sightings, I didn&apos;t anyone  would believe us. So there you are.  I am a firm believer after having this experience with the object and I feel  ....almost on a psychic level that we are on the verge of something....a revealing of some sort...I cant  really describe it, but we are on the verge of something."

This object appeared to be shaped more like an oil barrel, with a flashing red light on the top. An airliner was heading south, away from it. The object appeared to be hovering, but was moving southernly. It was hard to determine the distance from the object to the ground, and to the other objects (i.e. myself and the plane). Note also that at Central and Webb (the next major intersectiion going east)lies Raytheon Aircraft. This object did not appear to be a plane or a helicopter. I was also parked at this light for about three minutes along with about twenty others. I must have looked pretty strange sticking my head out of my car window looking at this thing. The road going east (Central) goes up a hill at this point. There is also a crosswalk midway between Central and Rock, and Central and Webb. This object was not a crosswalk light.

Similar witnessing by 4 Nat&apos;l Guard members of 184th Air Assault while on patrol within 80 miles of this location apx 8-9 weeks early.  Saw 4 similar lights that departed in opposing directions after travelling for some distance in a high speed straight line formation.  Radical high speed 90 degree turn.I was setting up my telescope ( huge 12.5 Meade light bucket ) with 20 year old son-in-law.  Night was especially clear and we were using my wide angle lense for moon viewing.  While I was focused on moon, SIL said, &quot;Hey whats that!&quot;  I turned, followed his pointing and coming overhead was a fast moving object.  It appeared slightly slower than a falling comet, but faster than any jet.  It was a single dot of white light that went in a straight line, but stopped, started and repeated this several times while I wheeled my telescope around to catch a glimps of it.  My SIL kept it in constant view by his naked eye and I aligned the Dobson mount and pointed the scope skyward at the object. It was nearly at the end of the horizon when I believe I caught a glimps of it.  It was only a fraction of a second, but I believe it was longer than it was wide and bright metalic.  No other detail could be determined.  While explaining this to a friend the next day I was advised he was 1 of 4 on patrol at apx 0400 hrs. in foothills about 90 miles away.  All 4 guardsmen observed 4 star-like objects flying high overhead until they shot away in different directions.  The were stunned.  In both cases we believe the object/s was extraordinarely high and there was no noise.  Sorry no other detail, just  the pin point appearance of a distant start moving fast!  Very fast.   FYI:  Beale AFB close by both sightings.  Also I am former pilot.  This was not a comet, strongly doubt it was a satellite, NOT a balloon or aircraft.  Served aboard navy missile tracker.  I know what rockets and sats look like.  Have no idea what this was.  I am not at all interested in having my name linked to some UFO sighting... no thanks, but I will at least share this story for what its worth.  Its 100% true, unembellished fact.  In closing I would not have believed the Guard story if I had not seen this first, even though the witness its extremely credible.  He seemed as astonished as I was.  He was in Nevada county at the time, just above Yuba County! where Beale AFB is located.  Beale is a U-2 base and former SR-71 base."

At very close to 9:50pm as we were walking around the hotel complex (to get some exercise) we spotted something very strange just north and west and maybe 45 degrees up in the sky from our location. It appeared to be a tight cluster of very dimly lit white spheres that were rising out in the distance (south and maybe west of downtown Seattle near SeaTac Airport). The cluster was slowly rising straight up in the air over a period of about 4 minutes. The entire cluster also pulsed a total of three times within about a minute and a half of first spotting them while they were rising.  Even though the objects were a dimily lit white, they pulsed in very bright colors (mostly red) and at exactly the same time. They were also moving around in their tight cluster in such a way that made the whole of the objects seem to change shape and sort of wave around in the sky. Although it appeared to be just to the east of SeaTac Airport we had been watching most of the airplane activity in the area and this was nothing even comparable to any air activity that I had ever seen in my life! The cluster continued to rise until it climbed up into some higher cloud cover and we couldn&apos;t see it anymore. I&apos;m really curious if any one has ever seen such a site especially in the Seattle area?"

Light changed to a large cicular object.During the summer of 1962, my friend and I were at the beach fishing for striped bass.  We had decided to make it an all night fishing trip.  It was a warm summer night and to the best of my knowledge no one else was on the beach.  I was sitting on a beach chair when my friend saw some- thing and yelled, &quot;what&apos;s that&quot;.  I looked up and saw a round rather dull orange light approaching us directly off the ocean. My initial thought was a lost fishing boat using a rather large spotlight to find its way.  It was an odd sight but at the time seemed to be a plasible explanation.  There was a river inlet close by which fishing boats used regularly and I was used to seeing boats in the general location, al- though not that close to shore. I would say the light was 50 yards off- shore and maybe 15 feet above the water.  The width was about the same as a large floodlight, the kind you see at movie premiers, maybe a little smaller.  The light was slowly approaching directly at us and I started to become nervous as it appeared the fishing boat was going to run ashore right at our feet.  When the light reached about 25 yards to our front it suddenly commenced to rapidly accelerate.  It was still heading directly at us and I jumped from my chair, ran back a few feet, and turned back around.  I expected to see a fishing boat run up over our position and ground itself.  To my surprise the light was gone but now there was a large circular object to our front at an altitude of maybe 150 feet. The object was lit but I don&apos;t remember any details or the exact size.  It departed to the NW at a steady slow rate of speed. At the time it seemed to be an exciting adventure.  I was 17 years old and my friend 16 and wow we say something spectacular.  As I think back there is something very disturbing about the event. What happened to rapidly approaching orange light?  Why didn&apos;t we see the large circular object until after the orange light disappeared?"

What I saw lasted approximately 2 minutes and in no way could it have been an aircraft or meteor.I was at a friend&apos;s house in his driveway talking.  I was looking at the sky, toward the north, at around 11:30 pm.  The sky was very clear and I was looking at a group of stars that seemed to be in the shape of the little dipper, but it was neither the big or little dipper.  This grouping of stars was much smaller.  Aproximately 1/10 th the size.  As I was looking at the stars one seemed to just disappear as if sucked into the darkness.  I thought this was funny and Iblinked and kind of shook my head to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things and when I looked up again the place were the star or so I thought was a star was just darkness.  I looked at my friend and said did you see that.  He had not seen this so we started to watch the sky in this area.  Within a minute of seeing the star or whatever it was disappear we both saw a light flash.  The light was kind of an off white color almost like the color of light produce by a house lamp.  This light was in the sky next to where the star/UFO was but the light I noticed when it flashed was quick and concentrated, not like glare you may see coming from a light source.  About a minute later we saw another flash in the same general area and of the same nature as before. This went on for about 3 minutes.  All three flashes were in the same general area according to our location.  Then the flashes stopped. My mind at this point didn&apos;t know what to really make of it at the time but I kept watching to hopefully see something else to make some sense of it.  With in a minute or two  we saw a streek in the sky of the same color light as the flashes but the streek was moving in an S-shaped pattern.  I drove home that night scared out of my whits and a little excited.  There was no aircraft in the area and nothing unusual about the night except for the light.  The light was farther away as in out of the atmoshere of the earth or right at the edge of the atmoshere.  Up until a few months ago I never really thought much of it other than I couldn&apos;t explain it.  I was watch a ! documentory on U.F.O.&apos;s and they showed one that took on this S-shaped pattern and one that seemed to become longer and then shorted as it moved.  Which if something moved in an S-shaped pattern, if seen from the right angle it would appear get shorter and longer as it moved.  I would appreciate a response and if possible some more information on how to get reports of recent sightings around the nation."

At first I thought it was a black kite, but as I continued to look at it I could see two or three revolving objects that revolved above it and realized that it was some kind of machine. I was driving south and the object was to my right (west) about 150 feet in the air, hovering silently.  I hurried home and told my family, my wife and 2 of our children witnessed it, by this time the object had moved further away(south west), we took turns looking through binoculars. My wife thought it looked like colored balloons revolving around the top of the object. We called the police department and no one else had seen it at that time.  It was a triangular shape at the bottom, maybe about 20 to 25 feet in diameter, but it&apos;s shape almost seemed to fluxuate, with rotating objects above it. It was not floating in the air current, it was definately intelligently controlled. After about 10 minutes it darted off north west into a cloud and with in 2 minutes a jet came out of the cloud close to where it had been."
19681210,19980322,"Abbeville (Lake Secession), SC",disk,5 min,"I had a close incounter with a UFO/(saucer/disc).  Craft hoovered about ten feet over my head, backed off, lowered to eye level, then raised and hoovered over head again.It was about 12:30am, Lake Secession, in Abbeville, SC.  This event occurred aprox. a quarter of a mile from a hydro-electric dam.  I was alone when I noticed a whirring/whining dynamo type of sound outside.  I saw an amber colored flashing light reflecting on the trees outside.  When I walked out the door, overhead I saw a flying saucer (saucer/disc about 35 feet across and about 10 feet in height) hoovering above me no more than ten feet.  There were four sets of lights (each set had three rotating amber lights) which bathed the area in amber.  The outter skin of the ship was what appeared to be a silvery/shiney metalic color.  I recall being terrorfied beyond description to the point where I could not move.  (the house I was in was one of those lake houses that was on &quot;stilts&quot; where the outside deck was about 8 feet off the ground.  Also the lake house had twelve sides and would look circular from the air)  After hoovering overhead, the craft backed away some twenty (20) feet and lowered to where it would be almost eye level with me.  This craft was a saucer shape with a smaller dome on top.  The top dome had a round porthole (window) that was opaque/translucent and I could see that there was a white, low intensity light inside.  Due to the type of opaque/translucent characteristic of the porthole...I could not see if there was anything inside; however, I &quot;knew&quot; that something was in there and it was looking at me.  The craft then raised up, came forward directly over head and hoovered.  This event lasted approximately 5 minutes; although, there are gaps in my memory as to what exactly happened.  The craft then sped off effortlessly about 200 yards and hoovered momentarily over the Lake.  Then it sped off at a 45 degree angle towards the southwest at such a speed that I could not even begin to estimate, until it vanished from my sight into space.  That evening it was a crisp, winter night and the sky was clear giving me an excellent unobstructed view of the craft and the sky as it was departing. As far as my background.  At the time, I was 17.  I&apos;m a white male.  I currently am college educated with a degree in General Business.  I am also a Vietnam Veteran and spent about 3 years on a US Naval Destroyer and have put in many hours as lookout while at sea.  I have been trained to spot and identify various types of aircraft and missiles.  This craft was not identifiable to any aircraft in existense in the United States or any other country&apos;s millitary or civilian air force. I&apos;ve always had the feeling that there was something else that happened that night.  I have a gap in my memory as to all of the events that occurred that night.  I wish that there was someone that I could talk with about this.((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT))Change discription of noise....I need to make a change to my earlier report that I sent in.I just entered a report last night....please change the sound that the UFO made.  I had originally typed in it made a Whirring/whining sound.  It was a whirring/whooshing noise. Also...several years later...I had bumped into a fried that I had known for a very long time and after years of not seeing him.  He asked me &quot;whatever happened with that UFO that you saw?&quot;  I didn&apos;t recall telling him about that and asked him what he meant by that.  He told me that I had called him while the UFO was there...while it was over the house.  The reason that I said that I have gaps in my memory abouth this encounter was that I never recalled being on the phone with him and telling him about the UFO being there.  This more or less collaborates in a way, that this was happening.  Also....an addition to my background I have had many years experience as a radio announcer and radio news reporter.  At the time of this encounter...I had already had about 2 years experience in broadcast news gathering...so some of the details that I give are as specific as possible. I hope that you will make the changes in my original report that I sent in earlier.  Thank you.....again.  ((Name deleted))"

19961020,19980215,"Wichita/Rose Hill, KS",light,15 Minutes,"While driving observed 3 parallel bright red lights lighting in turn from left to right. These covered sizable area of night sky. Smaller red lights came out of one end of lights then disappeared. Soon after I witnessed white, clustered, oscillating lights and a separate set of multi-colored lights that formed a line parallel to the horizon. This line sank out of view, but the white, oscillating lights continued to sparkle and dissipate once every 5-10 seconds for approximately 30 seconds.  I continued monitoring sky but saw nothing else.  There were numerous reports of strange lights in the sky that night, from Winfield to Wichita.At approximately 6:20 P.M. on October 30th, 1996 , I was driving east on 47th St. South out of Wichita Kansas.  When I got to about 2 miles west of Rose Hill Rd. I noticed 3 bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They were lighting up, one at a time from right to left.  They formed a parallel line to the horizon and covered a sizable section of the night sky.  They lit up from right to left 5 to 6 times which took about 25 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling red lights just to the right of the furthest southern light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued monitoring that section of sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 5 miles straight east of Rose Hill.  I got out of my car and then noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a multi-colored line of lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approxiamelty 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About 2 seconds later I observed more bright white, clusterered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then die down.  After another 5-10 seconds the white lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done the first time.  I waited 15-20 seconds then ran into my house to find another witness.  When we returned, we monitored the sky for 10-15 minutes but saw no more lights.  We did, however. see approximately 5-10 airplane lights flying in the area that I had seen the lights.  I did not see these lights during the occurance. I called the Rose Hill police but they said they had no other reports of lights in the sky.  The local nightly news ran a story about strange lights being reported by residents of Winfield Kansas that night, so I called the Winfield police.  They said that there had been numerous reports of lights but that they had no explanation.  There was also a small article about the incident in the Wichita Eagle newspaper the following day."

Object appeared to have a direct trajectory of 20 degrees downward as it traveled.  Initially appeared to be a meteorite, but blossomed into fireball within a half second of being spotted.  Fireball developed, appeared to be white/greenish white.  Looked reminiscent of re-entry of manned space capsules seen in pictures.  Appeared to be eminating from center of object and fanning out to the rear.  Object moved relatively slow compared to the quick meteorites seen in shower months.  Object appeared to burn out, dimming in intensity and just before extinguishment appeared to have several apparent red embers floating behind it. From south of Bothell, elevated at approximately 75 ASL, it appeared as one looks directly south, the bearing was from 160 degrees on the compass going to approximately 250 degrees. There was an aircraft on final for SeaTac who would have had an excellent view of the object, appearing to be about even with the 520 bridge on their approach.  The light as it extinguished appeared to be at an altitude well above the airliner on approach.  No other aircraft were noted to be in the area at the time. The object, for reference, seemed at it&apos;s biggest, to be about 33% the size of a full moon as it is typically seen overhead. The observer is a former military electronics technician, with some aviation experience, and on track to earn his private pilot wings in second quarter &apos;99.

19980525,19980525,"Madison, WI",cylinder,5 minutes,"2 events separated by about 3-5 minutesWhile smoking a cigarette on the porch and watching my girlfriend drive off, what I initially thought to be a shooting star caught my eye. I thought it was a shooting star because of its speed, but realized once I was actually watching it that it wasn&apos;t. The object very faintly glowed a dull brown that would have been hard to see if the motion hadn&apos;t caught my eye. The length of the object was approximately the same as the apparent width of the full moon. It was wider than it was tall: probably a 3 or 4 to 1 ratio. I only caught a second of its east to west motion before my line of sight was blocked by the garage. I hurried down the porch and fell in the process. I was unable to see the object when I stood up -- it was moving pretty quick. I estimate that it covered approximately 20-30 degrees in about 1 second as I watched it. I looked in the direction that it had been traveling for about three or four minutes. A single flashing white light emanated from near Arcturus. It blinked 3 or 4 times, progressively getting brighter with each blink. After the final bright blink, which I estimated to be the same luminosity as a medium-bright Venus, it was no longer visible. There were no clouds in the sky, and I could ses faint stars in the location where it had been blinking. There was only a slight haze and the blinking was much brighter than the dim stars that I could see. Thios event lasted approximately 3-4 seconds. I watched for a few more minutes, but all I saw was a satellite traversing the sky in the east -- quite distant from the location of the other two objects. I have worked at this location for nearly two years and I spend considerable time outside at night smoking cigarettes and watching the skies. I have never seen a bird reflecting the street lamps at night -- that is the only the possible explanation for the first object that I can think of. If it was a bird, I probably would have seen the reflection changing as the bird flapped its wings, but the shape of the object and the glow remained consta! nt. The second object may have been an airplane, although it was quite high for the blinks to have been that bright. Usually when a plane turns you can make out different colored landing lights or something, and they usually don&apos;t just disappear as the second object did. I usually only see airplanes while watching the skies at work, but I have sighted a group of 2 UFOs on another occasion. Other than these two instances, the skies over my work are pretty boring. I am going to contact the Dane County Regional Airport to see if they received other calls or tracked anything unusual last night. Other than that, it&apos;s just another frustrating sighting."

Lights went off but glowed hazy green for several seconds before immense lights began to flash over the foggy sky - central location of flashes from us was WNW.  The first flash was a general bright blue followed by several defined rays that spread out from the circumference of the blue lights this was followed by more flashing - yellow and red lines that horizontally crossed the original set of rays.  The flasing continued a few more seconds, was as bright as lightening: air temp. 39f; pressure 29.90.  We later learned that a powerline had been severed at the junction of Highway 61 and the Ryan Road - 15 miles up the shore of Lake Superior from central downtown Duluth.  It seem to us that a rather large craft may have come a bit too close to ground and that some form of its propellent energy caused the power line to snap.  We walked over to the site of the break later and saw several power company vehicles a couple of squad cars were present but left before we actually reached the scene."

19970310,19980310,"New York City, NY",light,15 minutes,"Strange lights above New York CityI was waiting for a taxi on Park Ave. It was a very cold and fiercly windy night. I looked up at the full moon behind the thickening layer of clouds. It glowed beatifully in a halo of mist. As I was admiring the view I suddenly noticed a strange point of light &quot;wandering&quot; around the sky at extremely high speed. It crossed my field of view in under 2 seconds. Because I could see a slight halo effect around the light I decided that it must be either inside or above the cloud layer. This would mean that its altitude was above 20,000 feet. The light was extremely small yet intensely bright. It was yellow or gold in color. The point had some dimensionality---it appeared to be a tiny sphere or oval---it definitely had some ball-like shape to it. After zig-zaging around the sky, making sudden turns and traveling in wild arcs, it vanished. The whole process took only about 2 seconds. I watched the sky for about 10 more minutes. During that time I witnessed 4 more lights appear, zig-zag at extremely high speed, and then dissappear. I could hardly believe my eyes. I was so entranced, I didn&apos;t think to ask any passers by to look at it and confirm what I was seeing. At one point two of the lights were in the sky at the same time, flying in very different erratic paths, almost as if they were dogfighting. All the other lights appeared in sequence, only 1 at a time. In each case, they seemed to appear from about the same point in the sky and then follow roughly the same erratic flight path and then vanish at approximately the same area in the sky. I could not tell if they were simply turning off or going behind thick clouds. After about 10 minutes the activity stopped. These lights were so small and fast that they were hard to catch even if one was looking up, so I wonder if anyone else saw them. A number of commercial jets were coming in or taking off from area runways during this event and they were quite clearly different in both appearance, sound, and behavior from the lights I witnessed. For one thing, the lights were single points of light and seemed to be far above the clouds, and moved much much faster than any of the jets (or any jet I&apos;ve ever seen for that matter). The lights did not flash or change color, although there was a slight flicker to them as they moved. It almost appeared as if something was literally skipping along the upper atmosphere. I considered the possibility that it might be some sort of debris burning up, but no debris can change direction or travel in series of loops, arcs and sudden right-angle turns, as these lights did."

HOWEVER.....if one looks at a map, one can easily see that the distance from the Northern edge of the Avon Park Range to the town of Narcoossee is in EXCESS of 50 miles!

I ALSO asked the TV station in my Email if having HOT Flares, buring brightly enough to have one resident blame them for the deaths of 11 chickens, drop on unsuspecting, populated areas such as Narcoossee, did not constitute a risk (duly warranted?) of fire/damage/injury/death from fires that WOULD occur if said flare(s) were to easily land on a residential/commercial/occupied structure.......I have not had a reply to that as yet."

Through binoculars, could see marquise-shaped lights, largest in center, and tapering to smaller in size towards edges. As approached, went up in altitude.  Directly overhead, shot up quickly to a pin-prick size, then disappeared completely.At 5:45 A.M. Pacific time, I looked out my kitchen window and saw a bright, intensely red light. The sky was clear, no clouds. We had just switched to Daylight Savings Time last Saturday.  The red light pulsed bright-dim approximately every second.  I looked at it for approximately thirty seconds, noting that it was not moving.  I went upstairs to get our binoculars.  I raised the blinds in the bedroom, waking up my wife.  I told her, &quot;Come here, there&apos;s something in the sky.&quot;  She observed the same red light.  We both determined it was not an airplane.  In fact, we are near the approach flight path for Lindbergh Field in San Diego, and during the event, we saw the lights of a jet on final approcah, and the plane&apos;s lights were below the height of the red object.  We also determined it could not be a helicopter.  I would also like to note that it was extremely early in the morning and there was no traffic noise, and we heard absolutely nothing from this object.  If it had been a helicopter, we would have heard the blades. My wife went downstairs to get our 35 millimeter camera (autofocus-type) to take a picture of the object.  I retreived the binoculars and went downstairs also.  My wife took two pictures of the object, hopefully one at its bright pulse and one at its dim pulse. To my observation, it moved slowly from the southwest toward the northeast, but not in a straight line.  It moved in what I would call a Lazy S configuration.  During all of this time, the pulsing of the lights did not change.  When it got directly over my head, it stopped and it seemed like it disappeared.  I looked for it through the binoculars again, and I found it, but it seemed much smaller and dimmer than when we first observed it, and then it completely disappeared.  It seemed to me as if it went straight up very quickly.  My wife did not see this movement because she had gone inside to try and find someone to call. My wife observed the object through the binoculars, and she reported that it appeared to her that the object had seven marquise-shaped lights that were glowing brighter than the surrounding part of the &quot;structure&quot;.  The largest one in the middle seemed to her to be the one that was pulsing.  Each of the marquise-shaped sections were yellowish at the centers, graduating out to orange, and then red, with the spaces in between red also. I am 44 years old, retired USN Chief.

She&apos;s never seen anything like this before.  We have been married ten years this September and have two cats.  I have three children from a previous marriage and two grandchildren.  We&apos;ve lived in this home since 1989. One other thing we would like to report is that we are close to a mountain in Spring Valley, CA called San Miguel.  Atop this mountain are a multitude of communications installations for probably every radio and TV station in our county, as well as Tijuana, Mexico.  We don&apos;t know if that has any bearing, but we did want to mention this. When we get the film developed, we will send the two pictures via regular mail."
19971208,19980401,"E. Wenatchee, WA",light,3-5 minutes,"It was a ball of light that was orange in the center with a red haze around it. When it passed overhead it broke in two and continued on, and broke into other pieces.The object which was a ball of light that had an orange center and a red haze around it, was approx. 4,000 ft. up because it just barely cleared the mountains (Cascades? Leavenworth area), as it was traveling from west to east, at a constant speed, little faster than a cessna.  As the object was overhead, it broke into 2 pieces.  The second piece broke away at a 90 degree angle and remained at a distance approx. 500 ft. from the first object and continued parallel through the sky.  Both objects sent smaller objects toward one another and continued east when we lost the object over badger mountain. The sky was clear, no clouds, it was night.  There was another aircraft in the vicinity but it was not chasing the object.  The object produced no noise, no tail and no sparks. The other witness, contacted the local airport and was informed that nothing was seen. I contacted McChord Airforce base in Tacoma, WA and was told to contact the local police.  I have also contacted MUFON and no answer has ever been given.  I can tell the difference between an object re-entering the earth, like a rocket or falling satelite, this object maintained this altitude, and there was no tail at all. I have an AAS degree, with a major in engineering and computer science. I would like an explanation of what we saw."

19671110,19980129,"Highway 71 between Clearmont, Missouri and Maryville, Missou, MO",unknown,2-3 minutes,"Summary : Noticed a semi-circular array of white lights with a pulsing middle light.  Observed object in southern sky.  Actually heard propulsion system activate before ship moved at a terrific speed to the north and west of sighting position.  Too dark and no moonlight to visualize true shape of craft.  The night was very clear and cold. On way to county seat viewed an array of white lights in southern sky.Traveling south on Highway 71 toward county seat, Maryville.  I was 19 at the time.  The other two individuals, men, were slightly older.  We noted a group of lights, in the sky to our right, paralleling our movement to the south and east on the highway.  The driver of the car pulled off onto a side road and the three of us stood outside of the car and observed the lights.  Upon first viewing the object it appeared to have 4-5 white lights on the bottom side it.  In the middle of this array was a pulsating light that would gradually change colors from red to orange to yellow to a bluish cast never actually going completely out.  The object was approximately 1/2 mile to our right and was moving to the east slowly.  Elevation was approximately 1/4 mile.  The object kept moving closer, in the air, and then came to a complete stop.  After stopping, in the sky, there was still no sound.  There were no other competing lights or phenomena so there was no distraction.  The highway was exceptionally quiet, no traffic.  As I gazed at the object and was observing the pulsating of the central light I heard an almost imperceptible sound.  Rather like a low pitched moan which seemed to be emitted from the object in the sky.  The object then moved from the point just to the east of us at a terrific speed and was out of sight in a matter of 2-3 seconds.  There was the almost inaudible hum and then the thing moved from a dead stop to the north and west and was gone.  I went into the Air Force the next year and served a year and one day in Vietnam, 70-71.  I have seen many types of jet aircraft and observed them in flight and have never seen such an array of lights, so closely together and the pulsating ability of the one cente one.  I have a college degree in business/technology and a separate technical school degree in electronics and am well read.  I have never anyone else who has seen or observed anything similar to this craft.  There was no sonic boom, when it took off or anything.  I did have corroborating discussio! ns from two other college aged people from two different places that night, though.  One to the south and east noted the same actual light array but, from a farther distance.  The other was from the north and west and noted a similar object hovering in a pasture area near the town of Elmo.  This event has haunted me since.  No one believes me, trully but, I know what I saw.  One of the two other men is now dead.  He drowned and the other guy still lives in the area but, I never see him.  I work for the State of Missouri and have a job of importance and responsibility.  I just thought that I would pass on my story.  I hope that this may dovetail with some other accounts.  Thank you."

I looked up in time to see the object moving north to south across my veiw out my front window.  The object was just above the horizon, and appeared to be traveling at a slight angle towards the ground and seemed to be only a couple hundred feet above the earth. The sighting lasted approximately 2-3 seconds.  The size of the object was not quite as large as a full moon.  The shape was essentially round and appeared to be moving through a either low clouds or a haze.  The object glowed much like a street light illuminating the fog near it on a foggy night.  The color seemed to be a pale orange.  I was in my car with the engine running, but could not hear any sound associated with the event(My first inclination was that it was an aircraft going down; the sighting occured very close to Sanders Field, but the object was much too large).

It appeared to be a low flying airplane and I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later I noticed the same thing and I went outside to my backyard.  A large, slow moving, black, triangular craft with lights was moving across the sky.  Ahead of it, was the object I had previously seen that I thought was a plane, it was the same triangle craft.  There was also a third triangle craft.  They were moving in single file from east to west.  I stood beneath them as they passed and I could hear a very faint hum, it was barely audible.  Other than that, they were silent.  I would estimate that they were 100-300 yards in width. This happened a couple of years ago, so I apoligize for the lack of description.  I submitted this because I saw a report on this website (NTL UFO Reporting Center) from Rochester that also dealt with triangular craft."

Followed about two minutes later by similar light, traveling in same direction.At approximately 9:58 pm I went outside to investigate what at first sounded like thunder. There were approximately four loud booms.  I looked up to see that the sky was cloudless.  I told my roommate &quot;thunder doesn&apos;t go boom, boom.&quot; While looking up I saw the first light, about the brightness of Venus, traveling from WNW to ESE.  I thought it strange that there appeared to be only one light and no other blinking lights.  There was no sound of a jet either. I ran in to get my binoculars but could only make out a vague, black silhouette whose shape was not readily apparent.  I told my friend to come outside but by the time he made it out the object was out of sight below the tree line. As I was walking back to the house I looked and and saw another similar light. I said &quot;Look another one.&quot;  It traveled in the same direction, at the same speed. I got a good look at this one with the binoculars and saw no flashing lights, the vague, black silhoutte against the moonlit sky.  I saw both lights for approximately 15 to 20 seconds each.  They traveled in a straight line, again no sound that I could detect.  At about 10:02 pm I hear two more explosions about twenty seconds apart.  I have no idea what the loud booms were. Fireworks maybe, from nearby casinos.  There was nothing on the local news to explain the loud booms.  And, I have no reason to believe that they were associated with the flying objects.  Just a strange coincidence."

It made a triangular pattern over the Ohio River and then went out of view.I described the object as egg shaped but in reality it was more like a large, blunt-tipped diamond shape.  We both agree on the events as they occurered, but my co-worker refuses to discuss the incident.  I remember us talking that day in amazement that no one was pulled off the road gaping at the object as it was quite large and mesmerizing. The object was matte silver, almost like pewter.  There was a glint from the sun but we could not see any features on the object.  It moved away so quickly that I did not notice it was moving, only &quot;getting harder to see&quot;.  We both agree that we had never seen anything like this before and that there was no easy explanation for it.  Another thing we thought strange was the time of day - around 1:00 pm, on a beautiful sunny day.  We are both social workers who work with troubled youth.  One last detail, I experienced no fear when viewing the object but weeks afterward became very fearful and &quot;paranoid&quot; about ufo&apos;s, aliens, etc.  (This is definitely NOT a typical baseline ideation for me!)Partially, this effect is still present which is why I don&apos;t think I can provide any contact information."

Object would change shape and size and brightness/intensity. Also would change colors - white, red, orange, yellowish - no specific pattern/no consistency. Light got smaller and smaller and faded away.While flying from Portland Or. to Burbank, Ca. I noticed a white light outside the aircraft.  It did not resemble another aircraft - no strobes or consistant light patterns. This was just one light - which would change shape (from large ball to a much smaller defined point of light). Object seemed to fly alongside our plane for about 45 minutes.  It was really fascinating and as it changed shape it would also fade in and out of different colors. It went through shades of red, orange, yellow, and very bright white.  This whole time I could see other aircraft along other routes and this object did not resemble or act like any of them and it was not a planet or star (too low on horizon).  It always seemed to stay a consistant distance (hard to judge because it was so dark) yet it would morph into these different shape/color phases. The patterns of color and shape were not consistent and differed throughout the whole time.  I asked the person ahead of me on the plane if they could see it - they acknowledged they could and I told them to watch it for a while.  I noticed that person looking out at it occasionally yet they never said anything about it. Eventually the light seemed to start getting smaller and smaller (like a pinpoint of light) and it eventually disappeared - as if turned off!  It was really quite interesting and I am happy to have witnessed something like that. I have flown many times at night and have NEVER seen anything like that.

The fireball was on a slightly downward course for the duration of time in which the object was visible (5 seconds). It disappeared in what seemed to be mid-air. There were no viewing obstructions as the particular area was flat farm land. There was a long white tail following the object.

19901216,19980308,"Blocker, OK",cigar,10 min,"6 Deputys at roadblock see object in level flight with large exhaust trail,explosion near nose of craft sends multiple smaller objects streaking to ground.On the above date and time, myself and 5 other deputys were working a drivers&apos; license check at the main intersection of a small rural community in our county.I had just released a motorist to go on his way when I heard one of the deputys exclaim,&quot;What the hell is that!&quot; I turned to face him and looked in the direction he was looking, which was to our northwest. It was not hard to see what he was looking at. I observed an object whose shape was hard to determine at first, as it appeared to be coming almost straight at us. I did easily notice the long trail of exhaust and flame that trailed the object. The object progressed rather slowly, about normal aircraft speed, from our northwest(right), to eventuaslly end up to our southeast(left). As the objectbecame closer and crossed our field of vision, a shape could be better made out. At first, a couple of us thought it might be an airliner that was on fire, but we could not make out any wings or tail structure. The glow from the trail of fire was illuminating the rear of the object somewhat. It should be noted that this sighting occured on a cloudless night with a 3/4 moon in the western sky, many stars visible, and a very clear view as we were far away from any city lights. When the object crossed between our position and the moon in the west, we could discern a cigar-like shape, reminiscent to me of a large missile(icbm type). The others present were in agreement as to the shape of the craft. At a point where the object was moving away to the southeast, but still mostly in front of us, we observed a very bright and instantaneous explosion near the &quot;nose&quot; of the object, immediately followed by approx. ten small objects which streaked toward the ground in a fan pattern, disapperaing in the proverbial&quot;twinkling of an eye&quot;. In fact, if we had blinked, I&apos;m sure we would have missed them, they moved so fast. At that point, a couple of us were saying our prayers and waiting for the blinding flash and mushroom cloud. The closest thing I could think of to describe what I was seeing was an icbm that had just MIRV&apos;ed. There was fortunately no explosion, much to our surprise and relief. We continued to watch the main object progress in controlled flight, to the southeast fo our position, until it finally became nothing but an orange circle of light, as if we were now looking straight at the rear end of the thing. We continued to watch the object until we could no longer see any sign of it. It flew out of our sight. It did not explode, blink out, disappear, or streak off at an unbelievable rate of speed. Once we rgained our composure, I radioed the sheriffs&apos; office and asked the dispatcher to call the FAA Flight Control Center in McAlester. He asked me what was going on because he was already getting calls from citizens around the county who had also seen the object. He called the FAA and they had no report of any scheduled aircraft or any aircraft at all for our area. Within a few minutes, the dispatcher advised me he had received a teletype over the state law enforcement net of the report of an object that landed in a farmers field near Anadarko,Ok.(approx. 130 miles west of McAlester.), and that personnel from Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City were enroute to see what it was. That was the last we heard about this until the next day. I channel surfed the news all day long, checking for any mention of this incident, to no avail. Of the seven separate news stations we had available, not one mentioned anything until 1730 that evening when KOCO channel 5 in OKC made a statement that if you saw a bright light in the sky the night before and wondered what it was, you were not alone. They claimed officials at Tinker had no idea what it was either. At a second newscast on this same channel 30 minutes later, in fact, during the weather portion of the broadcast, the weatherman stated that officials at Tinker had determined that what we saw was a Russian &quot;booster rocket&quot; re-entering the earthe&apos;s atmosphere and burning up due to friction. Well, I&apos;m no &quot;rocket scientist&quot;(pun intended), but what I saw was on a perfectly level trajectory(horizontal) with no angle. There was definitely a large streak of flame behind the object, but it was emanating from the rear of the craft, not the nose as you would expect if the flame was caused by friction. The craft was not on fire, it was under propulsion. No other mention of this incident was ever heard by me. Those of us who saw it don&apos;t talk about it anymore. I still have video of the few seconds KOCO devoted to it though."

When he did catch up he got into the cab of my truck and we talked a bit trying to decide where we would camp for the night.  We decided on Union Landing, about 2 miles above Westport on Hwy 1.  While setting there alongside the road I noticed a blue light like electric arc welding flashes in the trees ahead.  I thought another fisherman was up late working on his boat.  Upon finishing my smoke we pulled out onto the road and started down towards the beach and union landing.  When I came to a point abreast of where the lights were I looked over to see what kind of a boat etc. the supposed fisherman was working on.  There was no boat, no house, garage or anything else.  The terrain dropped off steeply and I had a view of the ocean.  I was up about 800 feet above the ocean and looking out at one hell of a sight:  3 large ufo&apos;s, each big enough to put the Kibby Dome in (the Kibby Dome is a Football Stadium at The University of Idaho at Moscow, Idaho) as I said there were 3 of them they were the shape of a childs top or a beet.  They were staggered one in front of me another further out and to the right and the third to the left of the first two and further out still.  From my position on the Highway the first was a mile from me the second aboutthree miles out and the fourth about five miles out from me.  I saw two or three white light saucers to the left of the first big ship.  The second ship had none or maybe one about it but the third big ship had about thirty saucers around it.  The big ships were outlined with pink lights and the saucers were solid white light colored.  What was happening as far as I could determine was that the saucers were taking turns going into the bigger craft, one would come out and another from outside would go in.  I watc! hed this for about 15 minutes, all the time trying to describe to myself what they looked like and what it was they were doing.  Finally I got into my truck and went the 5 or so miles to the ocean(the road wound down to the place where it followed the contour of the ocean).  Upon arriving at the ocean I could not see the UFO&apos;S at all.  They had left.  I then continued on down Hwy. 1 to Union Landing where I made camp and stayed for 30 days.  The next morrning we saw 1 or2 F-4 Phantoms flying at about 100 feet elevation and going up the coast.  They were very close to the coast, 1/4 to 1/2 mile."

Disappears, reappears different location.On 9/9/97 at about 9:30 p.m., a friend and myself were watching the most severe thunderstorm to hit our area that summer. Shortly into our weather session, my friend says, &quot;hey, do you see that?&quot;.  I looked where he was pointing.  The object was zipping into this valley about 5 miles away to our wnw.  We were located about 10 miles nw of Roseburg OR., USA. The object would be real dim, then brighten intensly, brighter than Venus, but pulsing also, sometimes every color of the rainbow, it seemed.  At one point, the light went down out of sight, then a pause, then it came shooting up out of the valley like a squiggly glowing red sperm, then disappear. Then it would reappear from somewhere else, moving a different direction. Keep in mind, a pretty violent thunderstorm is blasting lightning down, rather close to us at times.  This object was below the cloud deck. At one point it appeared to come very close to us, I swear, I could makeout some sort of lighted window panes, with a darker one in between. I assumed the object was close at that point, possibly within a few hundred yards.  In any case it must have been rather small, perhaps less than 15 meters in size. Well, this went on for about 1.5 hours and we simply weren&apos;t watching the lightning anymore, we didn&apos;t even care that it was getting within 10 miles of us. Ok your thinking, ball lightning right. No.  I would have settled for that, but then something remarkable happened. my friend was looking around for the onject to reappear somewhere else, like it was doing, then I saw it, a perfect white cone of light beaming accross the bottom of the thunderclouds.  There was very little thunder, and no rain at our location, and we could hear no aircraft of any kind. This &quot;spotlight&quot; came from the object, which had reappeared again. I yelled to my friend, but it disappeared just then.  It happened again, and we both saw it. This time, the object was near us and it beamed that perfect white light right above our heads about 100 feet and &quot;scanned&quot; the hillside right behind us. I have been an amateur astronomer and weather observer for well over 15 years, and I have never witnessed an event like this, in fact I have to say, it has been the most troubling event in my life. I also want to point out, at one time it appeared that the one object went into the valley, then came out with another one attached by, &quot;energy&quot; Something strange out there, and I think these strong storms have an adverse affect on them."

The object never makes a noise and is higher in the sky than any airplanes that pass under it.  The movements are sometimes quick and sometimes slow, but there is definite movement.  The eeriest thing is that when looking through binoculars, you could see bright red, green and white lights that appear to be whirling around the object.  No star does that.

However, the direction which the light followed was not consistent with approach or departure paths for IAH. I looked at the light through the window and trees, and it seemed to be moving a little erratically as seen through the branches of the pine and hardwoods in the back yard.

I cannot estamte the speed of the object, except to say that it moved from Zenith to Horizon in about 3-4 minutes. The visual size of the central (bright) part of the object was like observing Venus. The color of the object was a golden orange, similar to a dimmed incandescant lamp, and similar to the orange sodium vapor lamps now in commom use for public lighting. The central part was not flashing, but there were some variations in the brightness. Although &quot;bright&quot; I would not characterize the light as &quot;intense&quot;. Around the center bright orange light, was a diffuse halo, or fog, of the same color as the central light, which would expand and contract, sometimes appearing to swirl around the central light. As the object was moving away from me, the intensity of the central light did not seem to diminish, as it would were it a lamp with reflector. There was no other light, nor shadow, nor detail observable with the object. It did seem difficult for me to keep a good focus on the object with either my eyes or the binoculars. The light approached from the East, till nearly overhead, then moved off toward the North, visible for perhaps five minutes before going behind trees to the north, and still visible through those trees until obscured by more dense growth and the northern horizon. This could give some indication of the altitude of the object; were it very high, it should become very small (due to distance) as it nearded the horizon, however, the size did not go very small. Consider a low-flying plane versus one crusing at 35,000 feet as it departs your area. This object appeared more like the low altitude craft as it reached my horizon, even though I could not estimate its height or distance while higher in the sky. The light moved slightly erattically in speed and direction. It did not make any dramatic changes in direction or speed, but did seem to wander around a bit. After I lost view of the object, I stood there contemplating what it was I maight have seen. I observed other aircraft approcahing and departing IAH. These craft were easily identifiable with the naked eye, red, green navigation lights, white beacons and landing lights, even lights on in the passenter cabin.  It was trivial to make out the outline (shadow) of the shape of overflying aircraft against the backdrop of stars and moonlit atmosphere. The orange object seen a minute before shared none of these traits. Every other questionable object I have ever seen in the sky finally resolved into something obviously of local origin... except this one. (end)"

It seemed to be moving at a pace equal to a typical jetliner, but when I got past the trees to get a real good look at it, it was completely gone.  The lights seemed to pulse rather than flash.  Mostly white but some were blue, green, and red.  The area past the trees would&apos;ve given me a perfect view if it was a jet...thusly my curiosity."

Myself and my wife observed a large shatf of light out over lake Michigan.  It looked like a very thick bolt of lightning but continued to pulse about once a second.  It stayed in a genreral area moving back and forth.  It extended down from the sky to the lake and was very bright kind of like a strobe light.  It appeared to be thick in diameter and long given the distance out over the water.  As stated it would flash about once a second and move back and forth in the same general area.  It continued for about 30 minutes when it just stopped.  It did not look like a lighthouse due to the length of it and the way it moved from south to north and back again. I have a brief portion on video that is being sent via mail. I did not film the entire duration unfortunately.

First observed at approx. overhead position and took two minutes to travel north then dimmed or burned out with no color change or breakup at approx. 10 degrees from northern horizon. Observation made by my wife and myself. I have 17 years affiliation with the Air Force and am a C-5A Galaxy Flight Engineer. We have both observed many falling stars and both agree this was unusual in its bright intensity and blue color and direction of travel from south to north. I am 100% certain about the charactoristics. Also I used an aircraft transitioning along the eastern horizon for speed comparison. This was not an aircraft we observed. Again either a Meteorite transitioning the atmosphere or a flare traveling from south to north.
19980313,19980320,"San Jose, CA",sphere,15 sec.,"At approximately 1:30pm on 3/13/98, a group of seagulls caught my eye. As I looked up at the gulls,I noticed above them at about 4-5 white spheres traveling east to west at about 30 to 40 thousand feet.At approximately 1:30pm on 3/13/98, I was in my backyard when I looked up and noticed a group of seagulls flying over head. Directly above traveling in a east to west direction over San Jose and heading twards the coast I noticed four to five bright spheres. I focused on the birds again to make sure my eyes were not deceiving me, then back on the spheres. These objects were white and completely round in shape. No other characteristics were observed.It was hard to tell how fast they were moving. They were traveling in a box formation. One trailing object moved from left to right over another and then moved back to its original position. It was at this time I decided to go in the house a get my binoculars, when I returned they were gone. For the next couple of days I told myself that what I saw could not have been a UFO, but there were no wings, perfectly round and very bright in color. I have not told my family because they would think I was nuts. I had to make this report because I think its important. I know what I saw and they were not planes nor were they baloons. If you are able to find out what these were, I would appreciate it if you would let me know. Thanks, salarussas@msn.com"
19890101,19980129,"Wagoner, OK",light,1-2 mins,Summary : My friend and I who were both 16 at the time were driving to her house on state highway 51 westbound. We were going to be late for curfew so we were in a hurry. there were no cars coming in either direction. We were driving along and something caught my peripheral vision to the north. We saw about 5 or 6 bright lights coming up from the ground behind the tree line they were so bright they looked like spotlights shining straight up into the air. I was freaking out telling her to stop so we could see what that was so we slowed down considerebly then these lights started to turn in a complete circle all at the same time. We were both going Oh my God what the hell is that?!!! Then the lights just started crisscrossing over one another very fast. I was still begging her to stop so we could watch them but she was afraid of getting in trouble for being late for curfew already so we just drove off. I believe this was a ufo on the ground there are no buildings or houses around where this happened only fields and trees a fairly rural area. This is one of the strangest things I have ever seen.I don&apos;t remember the exact date I only remember it was late spring or early summer in 1989 My friend Kristie VanBrunt and myself were driving westbound on highway 51 to her house we were going to be late for curfew and she didnt want to get in trouble. We were just driving along talking and all of a sudden out of the corner of my right eye I see these incredibly bright white lights shining straight up into the sky there were about 5 or 6 of them and they were arranged in a circle the lights were behind the tree line coming up from the ground. I was like WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!! and told my friend to stop the truck so we could see she wouldn&apos;t stop partly out of fear of her parents and the fact she did not know what we were seeing but we did slow down to about 10 miles per hour there were no cars in either direction as far as we could see which was unusual. The lights started to turn around in a big circle  they stayed in their posistion but the whole thing was turning slowly at first then very fast. Then the lights just started going crazy criss crossing each other and we were both just staring with our jaws wide open in disbelief at what we were seeing I started screaming  to stop but she wouldn&apos;t. I am now 24 years old I have 2 children I am a supervisor in a telecommunications center and consider my self very normal. My friend is a homemaker mother of 1. We have not told very many people about this because people look at us like were nuts. Every since then I have had a firm belief in ufos.

Did not stay long.This all happened when I was in Job Corps at the Gainesville Job Corps Center. It was dark, and me and one of my good friends had to retrieve something from the woods surrounding the Center (of course, we weren&apos;t allowed in the woods, but we went anyway). We were walking towards where we had our campsite and my friend stopped me suddenly. &quot;Check it out! Two werewolf (?) type beings just floated across!&quot; He shouted. I was looking down at the time, so I cannot acknowledge if he indeed saw this. We continued on when we spotted a UFO on the ground, barely discernable. The shape of it was roughly that of a saucer. It was doing nothing, just sitting there, silent. Strangely, no lights or anything else that could provide illumination was present on, around, or near it. It was more like we could see it since our eyes were adjusted to the dark (Since we didn&apos;t really want to get caught, we had no flashlights). We advanced slowly, hoping to get a closer look at it. No such luck. We stopped in our tracks when we realized it had disappeared! We glanced at each other, and moved on. We got close to where our material was when something compelled me to get out of there and FAST. I took off running and my friend was not too close behind. As I was running, I looked over my shoulder and spotted a tall, dark, large-headed being with a dark robe on and it&apos;s hands folded in front of it. I did not stop to talk to it or get any closer. I just wanted out of there. That&apos;s about it with this one."

It was extremely fast for what would pass for an extremely bright satellite. The path was not predictable as a satellite is. The whole time I watched it, it never left &quot;Its area&quot;.  The light had a range or area it was flying, very small in the sky.  If you held your hand  outstretched, you could easilly cover the whole area.  The color went from silver- white to pale yellow and occasionally blue. I cotinued to watch for 20 minutes as it darted around . I spend a large amount of time around all types of aircraft,and there is nothing on the books that could do the speeds this object did. It was crysatl clear, no other lights to interfere, as Meadow Creek has a population of about 300. The light was in the western sky quite high off the horizon of mountains.

Since we were heading toward the causeway we had an unobstructed view of these objects.  They appeared to me to be silvery and I asked my girlfriend if they looked to be in a haze and she thought perhaps they were.  I looked up through the sunroof of the car and saw the moon as clear as could be....there was no haze in the sky.  We continued to watch the objects, which appeared to be side by side.  They then separated for a bit, moving very rapidly.  Then after about 3 minutes or so they darted towards the north and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  These objects seemed to be very large.  At first I wondered if they were military aircraft, as we were heading towards McDill AFB in Tampa.  I asked my girlfriend and she agreed with me that neither one of us had seen any aircraft like those and that they seemed to move too fast. I am a 39 year old male with a 20 year sales background.

The first contact sighting was at 9:28pm. et.  It was a matter of minutes to get to my house and to get the camera.  We jumped back into the truck, and drove to a clearing where I could park and get a picture.  I took several pictures from there, turned back for my house, and while driving down the street that my house is on, the object rose higher in the air, so I stopped to take a few more pictures.  I was coming back to my house this time, to grab my cam-corder, but when I tried to use it, the battery was dead.  We observed the craft for a few minutes longer, and it travled out of site in a steady, &quot;floating&quot; manor.  We decide to take the tapes back, and as we were driving, we noticed red lights where the craft once was.  We parked to take pictures of this as well, but there was no sign of the craft.

The light on the left was slightly lower than the one on the right. There was no sound from the objects and they appeared stationary 45 degrees above the horizon. We had seen dozens of small aircraft and large jets before and after this sighting and could hear their engines as well as see the red and green wing lights, the strobes, and the landing headlights. The two objects I am writing about had no colored lights, no flashing strobes, and made no sound. I definitly felt they were nothing I&apos;d ever seen in my 38 years on this earth. A small fast moving cloud ( moving from south to north ) passed in between the objects and us ( no more than 5 seconds ) and when it passed the 2 objects had completely disappeared with no trace.

Object turns on end, then turns to show triangle shape with bright light on one end then disappears instantly to the west.I was driving down Hiway 6 heading to Holstein with my son.  We noticed a very bright light ahead in the west.  It was about 6:05pm and the sun had gone down, but the sky was orange and clear with no clouds. We noticed that the object was not moving, there were two jets farther west behind the object, which I used to judge size. The object was very large and was stationary for 6 to 7 minutes.  As we turned south off of Hiway 6 on to the junction road that leads to Holstein we kept our eye on the object, which seem to be turning in place on end, to give it a long shape that look like a long glowing cylinder. Then the object turned again and we could see that it was a triangle shaped object, with a very bright light on one of the points.  We were head for the next gravel intersection road to turn west to watch the object.  We turned right and while we were watching the object, it seemed to dim a bit, then it was gone instantly.  We proceeded down the road further, but there was no sign of anything.  This object seemed to be very large and was definitley triangle shaped from our last view of it.  It was very impressive.  It was not dark out yet, and the sky was clear, so there is no doubt that we saw something very unusual."
19830405,19980217,"Waikiki, HI",disk,30 seconds,"The object was very clear, no haze, no distortions, and silent. It was lighted with multiple colors on its bottom, remeniscent but not identical to the movie close enounters of the third kind. There was no energy phenomenon surrounding it as in that movie. I saw no occupants, and it was gone after a brief time. As it went behind the tower closer to the ocean, I walked down Ohua Avenue crossing this street wishing to see if it were still there behind the building. Going across Kuhio Avenue, I looked but saw nothing. If I had a camera that could have photographed what I saw, I believe it would be the most convincing UFO photograph on record.Since early April 1983 I have been aware by direct experience that we are not alone. On an early evening walk in Waikiki, Honolulu Hawaii, I witnessed a brief encounter with a UFO that appeared quite jeweled. Its multi colored lights and freedom from any sound whatsoever is entered into my own life of perceptions. It appeared right between the twin Banyan Towers on Ohua Avenue, on my left hand side while I walked towards the ocean. Hundreds of people must have had an opportunity to witness this sighting, if anyone looked out their windows. I am hopeful someone will reconfirm my sighting.. I walked ahead after it flew past that tower, and I crossed the street to go around and look for it. It was gone. It was the most vivid impression I have ever had, and the only time in my life I have witnessed the wonder of this apparently extraterrestrial technology. Once you have actually witnessed the phenomenon, you simply cannot believe every debunking of it by the conventional media. If anyone was staying at the Banyan Twin Towers on Ohua Avenue at Kuhio Avenue in April of 1983 please let me know if you also had a sighting. P.S. This is only one experience. It is a wide universe, and the possibilities are open. I also have a notion that some civilizations have progressed socially and even morally along with their gadgets to be emminently proto human. At the same time I note that a great deal of anti-social conduct demonstrates the gravity of science at times outweighing the relationship of any and all sentient beings to one another. Philosophically this is the greatest weakness of social strucutures that may tend to abandon notions of consanguinity inherent to a vital existence. I feel deeply sorry for UFO occupants who exist with such a poverty of social understanding, and even moreso that with all their technology that they are worse than primates in our worst apparent understandings of the term. At the same time I have an intuition that those occupants in my sighting may have been socially adept, even a moral set of civilization."

I have watched blimps land or accelerate and it takes a little more time to accomplish than the 30 seconds I was in the house.I listened to the radio and checked the newspapers and never heard anyone else report this event.I am at a loss to know what we observed!My background is:Machinist for the U.S.AIRFORCE for 28 years and 53 years old.My wife is a clerk for the OKLAHOMA ((deleted)) and 2 years younger than me.My granddaighter is 8 years old.I dont use any type of alcohol or drugs, nor anyone else in my family.I can report that we all were very sober for this occurrence.I regret not having the date of this event nor any photos of the craft.Also I wished I could have reported the event sooner.I hope that by telling of this occurrence to someone who knows something of UFO`s that it will help me to purge my mind of the frequent question I ask myself:&quot;What did we see?&quot; and I hope that maybe someone may have seen something similar to this somewhere.If you are able to help,I would be very grateful!"

Both of these sides had a horizontal string of very bright lights straight through the middle, of strobe brightness.I think I was born with my eyes on the sky.  I have always been fasinated with the stars and planets.  I take my children and grandchildren out to the  yard during summer nights and point out the constellations.  Show them satalights going overhead, explain how regular their orbits are.  We stay up half the night in July/August to observe the meteor shower every year.  My father flew small planes and I grew up at the airport.  We have numerous fly overs from the military with large helicopters and transports, we see lots of police helicopters at night and we&apos;re also in the flight holding pattern for Sea-Tac Airport.  I know what&apos;s up there and I know what it sounds like and I know what it  looks like day or night. The morning of the sighting I got up to use the bathroom and saw the Orion constellation was incredibly bright and beautiful that morning so I stepped out onto our rear deck to view it, as soon as I stepped out onto the deck this object, impossible to miss was hovering directly in front of me at the tree line.  It wasn&apos;t moving and it wasn&apos;t making any sound.   It was about 30 feet in width in direct proportion with the side of a hockey puck.   It was split in precise halves, one side red the other blue, with a string of very bright, strobe bright, lights horizontilly through the center of the object.  It just hung there for some minutes.  It started to slowly move sideways to the west, traversed the width of our little valley and then started gaining altitude, now moving northwest, gaining not more than another30 feet or so in altitude, just enough for me to see it&apos;s underside which was triangular shaped with 6 large lights. One at the front, then two,  then three.  It then changed direction, the point of the triangle headed northwest. I could again see the blue side. It then went out of sight behind a stand of trees.  Before it disappeared I took a picture with my camera but of course it didn&apos;t come out.  I don&apos;t like sounding like a cliche.  This is not my first sighting here from my home.  The last one here was in the winter of 91.  It was about 60 feet across hovering over my neighbors home.  Looked like an inverted gas stove burner.  You could clearly see a metalic ring above the flame but nothing else.   This was at 3:00 A.M. Thought I&apos;d lost my mind or was dreaming and then the next night KOMO TV evening news showed a video of the object taken the night before in Puyallup around 8:30 P.M. Please, I would really like to talk to someone about these things.  By the way I have an I.Q. of 132, I&apos;m not hysterical, easily influenced, or excitable and I&apos;m analitical by nature.

It was during the middle of the day.  I saw this object as well as my father.I was travelling in a pick-up truck west bound towards Escondido, California with my father in the spring of 1991.  We were going to install a motion light for my step-grandmother.  We were stopped at an intersection stop light.  An oblong bright blue (cigar shaped) object had appeared in the sky from what seemed out of nowhere.  It was stationary in the sky for perhaps less than a second and then accelerated and disappeared again it what seemed a split second.  When I saw the object appear in the sky, my first reaction was to point at it and comment on it to my father (he is a law enforcement officer)  But before I could even say a word the object had disappeared.  Both of us remained speechless.  After a minute or two I asked him if he had seen the object and what he thought it was.  We were both astonished and speechless which perhaps explains the initial silence.  We had both commented on the bizaar sight and suggested that it had been an UFO. I was quite suprised by my father&apos;s suggestion and acknowlegdement that it may have been an UFO.  We have never spoken a word to one another about it since that day. It just seems too awkward.  What we experienced was very unique. I am now 22 years old.  Born in 1975.  I am a college student considered intelligent ( to most).  I am neither a believer or a disbeliever of UFO&apos;s,  but I am open-minded to the possibility."

It appeared stationary but was getting brighter.As time went by the light we realized was moving toward us going east. By this time my Mother also saw it and thought it was a plane  that was going to land on the freeway because of trouble. My Mother pulled the car over to the side of the road stopped the car and turned off the engine. As it got closer instead of one bright light there were 4 and it was almost above us. We got out of the car and there was no noise at all no crash nothing it just disappeared.We also realized that the nearest landing strip was approp.90 miles away. Then the light just shot off in a northerly direction. that was the first of many unexplainable lights I saw in the sky.

It was not known untill the film was developed a few days later.Myself and a group of friends were shooting off model rockets in the parking lot of West Lake High School here in Waldorf Maryland around 17:00 Easter Sunday 1998.  I snapped this photo of my nextdoor neighbor prepairing another rocket for launch, and when the photo came back from CVS, the object in the upper right hand courner was present.  It appears to be roughly oval in shape with what might be a triangular construction on top.  The triangular region seems to be highly reflective, while the lower oval portion of the overall object is dark and featureless. I have ruled out the possibility of lens contamination, it only appears on the one frame, and there were no rockets in the air at the time, and no other persons in the area.  Noone from the group remembers seeing anything, and we were all suprised by the photo."
19720815,19980518,"Toronto (Canada), ON",sphere,240 minutes,"Witnessed glowing sphere land in middle of urban area, had confirmation from authorities.This took place in the summer of 1972, possibly mid-august, in Toronto Canada.  On summer visit to grandmother&apos;s house there, I and my best friend (teenagers at the time) noted that the dark kitchen was lit up like daylight at 1 a.m... but it was strange orange light... running to window, we saw enormous orange sphere more than six storeys tall landing in an open ravine area beyond local business district, which was visible from the window there. We watched for some time as the craft settled slowly into the clearing beyond apartment buildings 2 blocks away... no sound, but so bright it lit up the whole neighborhood. When it landed, one could still see the top of it over top of the apt blocks (hence estimation of more than 6 storeys tall when landed)... We had NO fear, wanted to go down there and see up close, but grandmother and aunt woke up in our commotion and forbid us to go. Grandmother (a retired school teacher) and Aunt (a CBC television costume designer) saw craft as well as us. Called my parents in California to get my Dad to aid in keeping us girls in the house, he remembers this call. Aunt suggested I call police. Police operator answered and I suddenly lost my voice, didn&apos;t know what to say... stammmered umm umm... she said &quot;you calling from Forest Hill?&quot;  I said I was.  &quot;You calling about the flying saucer&quot; I said I was.  (her words)   &quot;Can you see it now?&quot; I said I could. &quot;Can you see the hi rises from where you are?&quot; I said I could. She then said &quot;Everyone in those hi-rises has already called us.&quot;  She went on to tell me that they were telling people to stay in their houses, and that patrol cars were in the area to investigate. We watched for more than another hour, the craft still visible on the ground beyond the hi rises.  Eventually my aunt made us go to bed. We lay on the floor and listened to Toronto all night talk radio, and all the calls were about the sighting. Eventually we fell asleep on the floor in front of the radio, waking at daybreak, at which point we ran down to the area, and found NO signs of anything. No flattened grass, singed ground, nothing.  We tried to call talk radio and got told that  &quot;they were taking no more calls about flying saucers. Toronto is a busy city and there is lots more important stuff going on.&quot; There was nothing in either newspaper (telegram or star) and we called both newsrooms to be told that reputable papers didn&apos;t bother with silly nonsense like flying saucers. We called the police and were told that the night before there were some reports of some sort of prank in our area (Forest Hill Village - an upper class neighborhood in the middle of the city) but that investigating officers had found no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The Sphere was perfectly round, noiseless, and glowed with an amazing shade of pure clear orange light that entirely lit up the neighborhood bright as day.  It took about 20 minutes to land gently in the field beyond the aprtments. The field is still there 20 years later, between Spadina and Bathhurst, this took place just beyond the intersection of Lonsdale and Spadina in the middle of Forest Hill there... After it landed we could still see the top of it over the buildings between it and us, but with no movement and no sound, after a couple of hours we were almost bored, and frustrated that we were not being allowed out of the house for a closer look. The police operator told me that everyone in these hirises (also visible to us) had called them, she seemed to be caught up in it at the moment, I consider the police operator to have verified this sighting to me. I have filed reports of this sighting with a few other researchers and groups over the years, because I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m the only witness still around, it had to have been seen by many people, the police operator told me their lines were ringing off the hook... (remember in &apos;72 they didn&apos;t have caller ID even at the police station, she ASKED me if I was in Forest Hill) Today I am 41, mother of a teenager, work as the station manager of a local cable company community access television channel here in B.C.&apos;s gulf islands... am college educated, don&apos;t drink or smoke... I know what I saw, remember the entire incident vividly.

19961030,19980408,"Rose Hill / Wichita, KS",light,20 Minutes,"I saw 3 bright, parallel red lightst 30 degrees above the horizon, lighting up one at a time from right to left. They covered a large portion of the sky.This is the second entry I have made to your sight.  I have been unable to find my previous entry listed and, being concerned that it somehow got lost, am transmitting a second.  This event occured October 30th, 1996.  I sighted the phenomenon alone ( I don&apos;t count my 2 year old son as a witness) but talked with 3 other people in the area who saw similar occurences.  The event was also broadcast on the local TV news and Wichita Eagle newspaper so you should be able to corroborate it.  According to the news, the majority of the sightings occured in Winfield Kansas which is about 20 miles south. At approximately 6:20 P.M. I was driving east on 47th street south, out of Wichita Kansas, about 3 miles west of Rose Hill road with my son.  I noticed three parallel bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They covered a sizable portion of the night sky and if they were attached to the same craft, it would have been huge.  They lit up, one at a time, from right to left five to six times which took about 30 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling, red lights just to the right of the furthest southern (right) light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued to monitor that section of the sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 4 1/2 miles east of Rose Hill on 180th street.  I got out of my car and started to go to the other side to get my son out.  As I did so I noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a line of multi-colored lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approximately 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About two seconds later I observed more birght white, clustered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then dim down.  After another 5-10 seconds the wihite lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done previously.  I waited 15-20 seconds and then ran in the house to find another witness.  By the time we came back outside, the lights were gone and did not return.  I did however, see several airplane lights circling the area for atleast 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes I went back inside the house.  I called the Rose Hill police who said they had no other reports.  Shortly afterwards I heard about Winfield residents reporting strange lights on the nightly news. I called the Winfield police to report my sighting.  The dispatcher said that she had indeed received several similar reports that evening but did not take my report and did not seem concerned.  I attempted to call McConnell Air Force base, which is only 3-4 miles from my original sighting, but was unable to contact anyone. At the time of the sighting I was 35 years old.  I am divorced with a 3 year old son.  I have a college degree and am employed as a financial analyst with a large aircraft manufacturing company."
19930701,19980329,"Oklahoma City, OK",triangle,4-5 minutes,"2 triangle craft over OKC. 1 travled N to S. 2 traveled W to E. The craft were very high, could only see their shape with binoculars. Each had six lights down the side of the craft.I was out sky watching with binocular when I saw two lights very high and relativly close together in the sky.  It was a clear night and the visability was excellent.  I got my binoculars on the object traveling north to south first and as I was facing east the object was traveling from left to right in my field of view.  I quickly noticed approximatly 12 white or yellow lights, 6 running down each side of the craft in a V or triangular shape.  I almost could not believe what I was seeing.  There was this V shaped craft that had to be huge considering how high it was.  Without the binoculars I could have easily just passed the lights off as airline traffic.  But the craft were were large enough to easily make out the triangle shape with binoculars. Especially when I began to look at the other craft, which actually still closer to me than the one heading south. The second craft was heading east and was moving directly away from me, giving me a perfect view of the V shape.  And I would have to say that a V is a better discription of the craft than triangular because the craft seemed longer rather than wider.  Each craft proceeded in a slow steady manner and I remembered thinking how can these two ships be flying over OKC and there seemed to be no other planes up and interested in them.  I also thought that two identical craft passing each other the way they were was odd, almost like they were mapping something. I watched the two craft for 4-5 minutes before both were completly gone from view.  I wanted to call someone about the incident but never did.  I did report the sighting some months later to the local MUFON chapter but they never made a report either."

Abduct, exam, unsettling.I was sole percipient, had insomnia one night, sat inside bedroom gazing at night sky approximately 0100 on 041584.  Saw a blazing white light enter field of vision from east, moving to west.  A dead pine tree served as a reference point.  Object halted behind the tree.  The motion of falling leaf was observed briefly.  Object stayed in sky throughout sighting.  Feeling some compulsion to go outside, I watched it from the back yard for what I thought was only a few minutes.  The weather was cool and I was not fully clothed, so felt cold.  I noticed the object seeming to drift slightly westward, still looking like bright blazing star.  Suddenly it moved about 90 degrees to the west, without transiting.  Tired, cold, I went in, sleepy finally, and went to bed.  Told someone the next day at work about it, got laughed at and forgot it for three years.  The book Communion was published, the cover startling me and triggering a memory of that night.  For two more years I thought about it often, reading Communion and some other things on UFOs.  In 1989 I had a hypnotic regression to the night in question, remembering in detail being taken up through the air to the object, taken aboard, examined, having communication with the occupants, including some joking and prophecy.  The object appeared to have a considerable amount of detail on both the outside and inside.  The occupants were short, gray-brown in color, and wearing red suits with black trim and some sort of smooth, tight-fitting head gear that seemed to cover a part ot their faces. They stood away from the table I was placed on, behind a half-wall.  A scanning device examined me.  I got a very good look at it such that I can see it as I write this.  There were several instances of the occupants joking with me to relax me and quell my fear.  There was an instance of forced physical paralysis with total loss of muscle control.  I kept my eyes closed during much of the experience.  At the end, two of them floated me back to the yard between them.  I was unable to look closely at them out of fear, and had a screen memory of their appearance.  The content was bizarre, odd, and frightening.  I left the hypnotherapy session very upset.  For several years subsequently I had a hard time with the memory.  The session was taped.  I transcribed the tape and studied it carefully.  There was an internal coherency but the content was very unusual.  Later, I read that the things that the occupants discussed (telepathically) were not so unusual in abductions.  I saw another clinician, a published author and psychiatrist who studies paranormal events.  Two more abductions were uncovered, going back to childhood.  Another emerged spontaneously.  One of them explained a mysterious short term leg paralysis that I had as a child.  Many pieces fell into place about bad memories from childhood, fear of windows at night, always looking into the night sky, and three previous sightings I had had.  Of those, one was multiple witnessed by parents and their friends.  No subsequent UFO activit! y occurred to me.  My sense of the occupants was that they were insincere, though trying to appear to be genuine and helpful.  I did not like what happened, feeling violated.  I was 36 years old at the time of the last event.  The others occured at 12, 8 and 4 years of age.  I am a trained, State licensed psychotherapist and a trained, State certified hypnotherapist, practicing now for thirty years.  I do not, nor have I ever, talked about the UFO encounters or my interest in them, nor is there any visual cue in my office that would tip off a patient that I would be amenable to a discussion of same.  Since the event and the hypnotic regression, a patient came to me who subsequently requested hypnotherapy and was surprised to reveal a tremendous amount of encounters going back to her age of four years.  Multiple family members were also involved, three of whom (two sisters and mother)I was able to interview and study hypnotically.  The mother had a conscious waking memory of her experience, which happened also when the daughter was four.  A sister only could remember the screen memory of a wolf&apos;s face at the window.  Another sister remembered from childhood a screen memory of white horses with large, black, glassy eyes staring at her inside her bedroom, then chasing her across the house.  These sessions went on with this patient for over one year, often meeting three times a week for two to three hour hypnotherapy sessions.  Finally, I had to steer it to a close, as I had become drained and emotionally upset by it.  The woman&apos;s children were also being abducted, all of whom I saw in the office and who talked about their experiences.  This experience, of treating this patient who was such an active percipient, was exhausting personally, although did serve to relieve the patient of significant disabling symptoms.  My sense of the occupants of her objects was that they were not benevolent.  Such was also the impression held by the patient.  I will be happy to send the transcript of my experience with any other material requested by mail.  No phone calls or email, please."

It was too high to be a plane over the Portland Airport yet quit low and too parallel to the horizon to be a shooting star.  Within 10 seconds another (more faint) object was seen traveling at a high rate of speed (yet much slower) in a northerly direction over (what I would call) the coastline of Oregon.  This was too fast to be a plane but much slower than the east-west object.  Yet both objects had a similar destination west of the coastline of the Northwest U.S. and disappeared."

It had vien-like structures on the sides of it and spotlights all the way around the base. The dome part was flashing like an electrical ark,it appeared to me to be in distress. There was alot of activity around the base ,like spot lights moving around frantically.The car in front of me slowed down to observe so i passed and got away . Isaw enough of the object to know i didnt want to get any closer to it."
19980227,19980309,"Hesperia, CA",fireball,10 sec.,"A bright blue object that streaked across the southern sky from east to west.I was indoors and happened to catch it pass to the south of my location through a large picture wiindow. It was traveling from east to west at a high speed. The color of the object was blue and it had a tail behind it. My guess is that it was a large meteor that I witnessed. No sound since I was indoors at the time. And I couldn&apos;t see if it looked like it impacted on the ground either. Kind of unusual to see a large meteor like that this time of the year. Haven&apos;t heard of any scheduled showers to be seen. Could be like what was reported over Colorado recently. If you are interested in hearing about a sighting that occurred on 08/17/69 over the San Fernando Valley of California then pleaase let me know and I will post it here. That sighting of seven large orange colored objects in formation was definitely much closer and had some very strange aspects to it. I witnessed it along with about six other persons. At the time, we did report it to the Air Force and all they said was, &quot;We don&apos;t know what they are.&quot;"
19780714,19980308,"Spokane, WA",disk,15-20 mins,"A friend and I were driving and saw something odd in the sky coming towards us. We pulled over along with some other people to watch.A friend and I had left work in the valley to run up to the northside to pick something up and bring it back to our work. It was getting close to closing time so it was probably around 10:30pm when we were headed south on the old Argonne highway. I was driving and I happened to look out my window. I spotted what looked like headlights  shining thru the trees on top of a mountain. I said to my friend, &quot;look at that car on the mountain&quot;. I then realized that it couldn&apos;t be a car because if a car was up there we wouldn&apos;t have been able to see it&apos;s headlights.Then we quickly noticed that it was moving in the sky heading our way. We saw a couple of cars pulled off the road ahead and people were standing outside watching so we pulled over too. We were shivering by then, excited and scared at the same time cause we couldn&apos;t figure out what it was. The only thing I really remember is the lights. It had a center light big and round and two smaller lights one on each side of the middle light. They were bright white lights. It came right towards us moving very very slow and I heard a very very faint hum. It seemed so close, like if I craweled to the top of a tree I could have reached out and touched the bottom. I don&apos;t really remember seeing the actual craft, but in my mind I know it was like a round disk not flat but maybe with a slighly rounded belly to it, but the lights were so bright you couldn&apos;t see it anyway. It passed over us and continued on and we all stood there dumbfounded our hearts racing until we couldn&apos;t see it over the treetops anymore. All of us that were standing there just looked at each other and said wow, what was that. My friend and I got into the car and headed back to work, we had the creeps the rest of the night. I had no knowledge of any aircraft that could fly so low, quiet and slow. Before this incident I saw the same type craft when I slept over at a different friends house one summer. It must have been the summer of 77, I was fifteen at the time. We were in our sleeping bags in the backyard. It was late maybe 11:00 pm. We were laying there talking and staring at the stars. There were alot of trees in her neighborhood and in her yard. Anyway we were just laying there looking up at the beautiful stars and then we saw this craft pass over us so slow, virtually no sound and the same lights as I described before. We were so scared, we waited for it to pass over before we lept up and raced into the house screaming and freaking out. We jumped into her bed and pulled the covers over our heads. This one was also flying very low, seemed like treetop level. Too close for comfort! Of course we told everyone but no one believed us. I am now 36 years old and have not seen anything like this since, although I would like to. My grandmother lives in Newman Lake , Wa and she has watched crafts play what she calls war games over her house. I wish I could have been there to see that! Don&apos;t know how often it has happened but I know she&apos;s observed them several times. I think she said these were colorful lights and they would zoom through the sky doing quick turns and racing back in the opposite direction. This wasn&apos;t just a brief display, these war games lasted maybe 45 minutes or so."
19980402,19980403,"Greenville, OH",other,4 seconds,"Was walking dog, noticed in eastern sky 2 crescent shaped objects. flying side by side , with the right one slightly ahead.I was walking my dog at 10:50 p.m. The sky was clear and I was watching out for shooting stars when I notice coming from the east ( if I were to point at them,  my arm would be at a 45 degree angle...NOTE; the angles are given as if straight up is 0 degrees) two objects. These objects were crescent shaped with the horns toward the back. Both had a soft whitish glow to them, and both wavered or wrippled like reflections off of a pond .They crossed over me so that my head was at a 10 - 15 degree angle. The objects where silent and left no trails behind them, the top object was slightly ahead of the other. They would drift toward each other with the two inner crescent horns over lapping .They did this 3 to 4 times. The objects disappeared heading west. They faded from view at the same 45 degree angle as when they came into view. There was a jet ( I believe passenger) flying close by. To me the jet and objects appeared no more than 1 to 2 inches apart. The objects gave me the impression of being lower than the jet..though they did not pass between me and the jet. It was at this time that they faded from view. I am a 27 year old honor roll graduate of Greenville High School.  My hobbies include art, astronomy, biology, geology and many of the other sciences as well."
19980307,19980309,"Vero Beach (Northern), FL",formation,2.5 minutes,"2 bright lights moving toward us one lower the other. One turns and disappears leaving an illuminated doughnut shaped fog.  Then the other light did the exact same thing.Two bright white lights were obeserved by my wife, niece, and myself.  It was March 7, 1998 at 6:45 P.M. The lights were moving in a westerly direction at the same speed, but different heights. The light on the right was slightly lower than the one on the left. No sounds were coming from the lights.  They looked as if they were shining a light in a downward glow.  Suddenly the lower light on the right pivoted  approx 180 degrees and disappeared, leaving an illuminated doughnut shaped glow, that lasted approximately 10-15 seconds and then dissapated. The other light never stopped moving. It continued going in  the same direction at the same speed. for at least 15 seconds after  the doughnut glow disappeared.  Then just like the other light, it turned away from us and disappeared, leaving the same doughnut glow, which as the first, lasted around 15 seconds and dissapated as well. No object observed just 2 distinct lights.  After the lights turned away from us they simply disappeared, they didn&apos;t seem to fly away, or go in any direction, they just disappeared, leaving the dought shaped signature, and our thoughts running wild.  Like nothing we have ever seen before. This was also witnessed by our neighbors who were having a party. 10 of their guests also witnessed the lights.((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.))"
19781025,19980506,"Virginia City, MT",other,10 minutes,"While elk hunting South of town I sighted a huge object which was shiny like mylar or a mirror but seemed metalic. It was shaped like a (vitamin capsule) not really cigar shape more full. The object rose over a hill where I was looking for elk and sat just above the horizon for about 10 mins then kind of faded away. The object was huge maybe 300 feet long and 100 feet high. I was looking from the north but the object was a shiny as if it was in full sun. It rose very slowly almost as if a cloud. I&apos;m curious if objects like this have been seen before all I seem to hear about are discs and lights. This was real!As I said above I was elk hunting in the late fall of 1978 about 4 miles south of Virginia City, Montana. It must have been about 1600 or 1630. I was sitting on a south facing slope looking across a small valley perhaps 500 yards across. I was scanning the sparce timber just below the horizon when a huge (vitamin capsule shaped) object perhaps 300 feet long and 100 feet high, it may have been larger but those proportions are pretty close, and I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t smaller. The object was more shiny than metal it looked like mylar, or a mirror, in reflectance but seemed hard surfaced. The side I was looking at was facing north with the sun behind and to the right of it, but not visible, yet the object was as shiny as if it were in full sunlight. It was the brightest thing in the sky, much more intense than the sky. It seemed to rise very slowly and as it was doing so didn&apos;t alarm me, it was as if I were a child watching a cloud rise over a hill. As it rose up from behind the hill slowly it rose to a point maybe 100 feet above the horizon then gradually decended until part of it was below the horizon meaning it was on the north side of the ridge I was looking at giving me a sense of the scale against the hillside. I had no emotional reaction just ho hum which when looking back seems really strange. Anyway I sat there and watched the object for what must have been 10 minutes and honestly I don&apos;t remember how it disappeared. I just remember thinking that I had better leave to get back to the car before dark because I still had a ways to drive on an unimproved road before getting home.  That is another strange thing I then remember being about 200 yards from the sighting place causually walking down the trail totally unconcerned, not looking over my shoulder to see if it re-appeared or anything. When I got home I don&apos;t even think I told my wife which really puzzles me in retrospect. Normally we talked about everything. I am very curious as to whether any other people have seen an object such as this as it seems ! like all I hear about is saucer shaped objects or lights."

19960415,19980208,"Long Beach, CA",fireball,1.5 seconds,"A Large Brilliant green fireball was seen &quot;fall to earth&quot; in the direction of the Long beach airport.There was no fire or evidence of a crash, so I assume the &quot;craft/fireball&quot; went into one of the many hangars present directly in the line of path of descent.It was at approximately 05:11 in the morning that i was on the way to work, I had been driving north for about 45 minutes on the 405 FWY. The morning was dark and it was foggy, the general area was illuminated by the city lights and was not very bright. As i was passing the Sign indicating that the Lakewood blvd off ramp was coming up, I observed  a brilliant green/white fireball with tail about the size of a silver dollar in my windshield. the angle of descent was approximately 40 degrees from left to right from the corner of my windsheild to approximately 6 inches above the base of my windsheild to about 3/4 of the windsheild along the base. It then totally disappeared. I estimate the distance approximately at 1-1.5 miles in front of me from where i was on the freeway The fog gave the fireball a fuzzy appearance around its perimeter. I tried to see if other drivers on the freeway had seen it, but at 70mph and in the darkness it was impossible to make eye contact with other drivers. &gt;From the angle of descent and approximate distance, i judged that the Fireball must have gone in the direction of the many hangars that occupy that airport and also face the freeway. Note: the speed of descent was rapid as if it were falling at great speed. I was expecting a fire or crash in the area of  the projected collision, but as i passed by , there were NO fires or explosions.  I found out that there was no one in the tower at that time, so i could not verify my sighting with anyone. I checked radio news and newspapers at the time ,but no mention of a crash. MY guess is that it was no meteorite( it was too big and there would have been fire), is that it may have been one of  our craft which may have been in trouble and had to &quot;land&quot; in the city under extraordinary conditions. I have since heard of fireballs in seattle and i figured i  would finally report it to someone, I figured the police would not accept a report."
19980307,19980308,"Sarasota, FL",cone,30 seconds,"Object observed coming from SE at twilight, sky very clear and not yet dark. Object was white with small white core moving towards us (direction NW) and a cone shaped haze behind it.  It moved steadily towards NW then suddenly seemed to disolve.There were about 10 people around me at the time - in Island Park in Sarasota on the bayfront, a popular place for taking walks.  The sky was perfectly clear and calm, the sun had set in the west and it was dusk but not dark in the east.  We all saw the object coming towards us -- others saw 2 objects, I just saw the one.  I realized it was not a plane.  The only other possiblity was a launch from Cape Canaveral which we can see from our coast when it is clear.  Except, CC is further north and object launched from it leave a clear vertical vapor trail.  This object was very white with a cone-shaped white haze behind it - could have been moving quickly, it was hard to say.  I observed it for about 20-30 seconds then it suddenly seemed to disolve and disappear.  The front (core) part of the object was very solid, very real, it was not a trick of light or anything else we could figure out.  Afterwards I discussed it with a few others who had seen it -- no one had any idea what it could be.((NUFORC:  Consistent with missile launch.))"
19980220,19980221,"Fairfield, CA",disk,10mins,While at lunch and sitting in my car I noticed an object moving across the Southern Sky.

19980426,19980427,"Comer, GA",disk,30min,"on 4/25-26/98, a strange object was seen in the southern sky b/w 23:50 &amp; 0:20.  it hovered high in sky, moved quickly to southeast, hovered, then moved back to the south, hovered for 20min, then disappeared.Between 23:50 &amp; 0:20 on 04/25-26/98, my brother and I observed a peculiar object moving around in the southern sky, approx. 40 degrees above the horizon.  The object was seen with the naked eye and 7x35 binoculars.  It was a dull red, more of a glow than an actual color.  it had an apparent length of maybe .25-.5 inches.  The shape was like that of a disk seen almost edge on.  The object was symetrical, appearing fuzzy at the edges, and the center was more focused and somewhat brighter.  These details were seen only through the binoculars, not the naked eye.  It maintained the same color and shape and orientation in the sky (meaning the object&apos;s flat shape stayed flat relative to the earth&apos;s surface, horizontal, never vertical or whatever).  It moved towards the north slightly, maybe only a few degrees.  As seen through the binoculars, the object hovered at times and jiggled or moved only slightly.  Then around midnight the object abruptly moved to the southeast, almost 45 degrees, where it stayed for about a minute, then quickly moved back to where it was before in the south.  I had a difficult time following the object due to it moving so fast.  It stayed around 35-45 degrees above the horizon.  The stars in the background (in the binoculars) were very out of focus, meaning the object was close to us, how close, it&apos;s difficult to say, a few hundred feet or thousands of feet, I don&apos;t know.  The object moved out of focus twice, causing me to adjust the focus of the binoculars.  It appeared to move closer, slightly growing in size, then back, all within a minutes time.  Then around 0:20, it dissapeared. I was a physics major in college, and I do a little amateur astronomy as a hobby, so I know the difference b/w a star or an airplane or a meteor or whatever and what it was that I saw.  I really have no clue as to what it was, but by it&apos;s motion and shape, it was NOT man made or some natural phenomenon.  The weather conditions were good, a little haze around the horizon, but clear otherwise.  So we had no trouble seeing the thing.  I am nearsighted, that&apos;s why I could not see it without the binoculars, but my brother has better vision than I, and he could see it quite well w/o aid.  My brother is 15 and I am 21.  We live in a rural area, so there are no extranious lights or other sundry things around that could ever be mistaken for a ufo.  Airplanes do come over our area quite frequently, but at high altitudes.   Because we see planes as often as we do, we definately know the difference b/w one and what we saw.  Plus, the object didn&apos;t blink like the lights on a plane do.  Or move in a specific pattern, either.  Simply moved around and glowed the same shade of dull red the whole time, staying in the same general area, except when it moved over to the southeast."

It was on a Sunday 5:30 p.m. on 101 hwy south.  We saw this shiny greyish object about 30 to 40 feet in diameter next to the edge of SanFrancisco Bay.  The reason why we noticed it was the field had caught a fire.  Then the object took off almost in a 45 degree angle straight toward us which was west and it was moving at such a great speed that after a few moments it just got smaller and smaller until it dissapeared.  The saucer was totaly quiet.  It had no lights that we could see and it left the grass field totaly burning.  My Father was an opperating engineer all his life.  He always wanted me not to talk about it because people would think that we were crazy or something.  And for myself I am 56 years old and don&apos;t care what they say.  My Dad is passed away so there is no one else that could back me up except if anybody like fire departments, the farmers, or anyone else that had seen the fire, or the saucer itselt.

One such morning I looked to the north and saw a light sweeping across the sky with a very slight undulating path. I pointed it out and we all speculated what it might be. (this was a bunch of pretty smart guys due to our mission) We discounted inversion reflections, F-86D with afterburners (no satellites yet!) meteors. While speculating, here comes another one! Well for three nights in a row, we saw 4 to ten in one night. Although they were comeing from different parts of the norther horizon, they seemed to vanish pretty nearly the same place on the southern. (as determined by a fiducial point, an antenna)The path, when check on a map, was straight across the libyan desert crossing the Tbilsi Mountains.I did talk to an airman at the A C &amp; W squadron (radar) after hearing the F-86D&apos;s scramble obviously in response to these odd lights. He said, &quot;Oh, Yeah.

I looked out the window of the bus and saw the 2 fairly bright white lights, that looked to be about 30 feet in diameter in the sky to the left of the bus. I told my wife to look, and she asked what are those lights. The other people sitting on the left side of the bus also saw them. I thought as did other people on the bus, that they were rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral, although I made the comment that these are the first rockets I ever saw that have no propellant or con trail. It looked exactly like looking directly into the tail end of a rocket booster. We didn&apos;t give it any more thought until we returned to Los Angeles and saw a news report of the event on the Monday evening news and found out that there were no missiles fired from the cape. We saw both objects for about 2 minutes. The seemed to be about 300 yards apart, and one was next to a cloud, the other in the open sky.The light away from the cloud just went out about 5 seconds before the other light moved behind the cloud and disappeared. There was very little lateral movement, if any, on either object.((NUFORC:  Consistent with missile launch.))"

I had been across the street from my house playing with a friend, and my mother came to take me home for bed.  I always went to bed around 8:00. As we were walking across the street, I saw almost directly over me, and flying over my house (about 10 ft above house), a line of crafts that were copper, and shaped like missiles.  They were going pretty slowly, and there were no windows or anything like that.  It made no noise. I had the distinct feeling that there was somebody(s) up there watching us--the street was full of children in costumes. I asked my mother what they were, and pointed to them, but she could not see anything.  I pointed again, and still she couldn&apos;t see anything, and we went in my house.  I wasn&apos;t thinking at that time about &quot;aliens&quot;--I just knew it was something I had never seen before, was very unusual, and that nobody else seemed to notice.

19890810,19980314,"Martinsburg, WV",triangle,45 seconds,"Seen an object very high in the sky, moving at a high rate of speed to the south and jumping side to side while continuing to move forward lateral. Had three flashing bluish/white lights that flashed in a counter-clockwise triangle.I, who was 13 at the time, and a friend who was 14 were camping out under the stars in my back yard. It was a mostly clear night with a full moon and some scattered high cirrus clouds. My friend saw the object first and immediately pointed it out to me. It was three strobe-like lights flashing in a counter-clockwise triangle. It was moving very fast across the sky from north to south. It passed over the scattered cirrus clouds, so I estimate it must have been above 50,000 feet in altitude. It would move irratically from side to side and diagonal while maintaining it&apos;s forward (southerly) course. It was as if it was actually jumping like a water bug. Since it was at least 50,000 feet in altitude, I estimate when it jumped it was jumping at least a couple of miles at a time. We observed the object until it cleared our horizon (until we could no longer see it). It was moving too fast for me to even run and get my telescope out of the house. It cleared our horizon in about 45 seconds time. A passenger jet at altitude takes nearly five minutes to clear our horizon. Taking that into consideration, this thing must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. It didn&apos;t leave a contrail of any kind and it made no sound. I never actually seen the body of the object; all I could see was the lights, so I&apos;m assuming it was shaped like a triangle because of the pattern of the lights. The lights were not very bright -- they were like a strobe in the sense that they flashed similarly to a strobe but they were much softer then strobes. They were bright enough to see through the cirrus clouds when passing above them. I called the local Air National Guard and they refered me to a UFO reporting line, which I called and reported to. They seemed quite interested in my observation. I have never seen this object or anything similar since. It was a very exciting night for a couple of young teenagers. As for backgrounds, we were just normal kids. I am thankful that we were able to see such an awesome sight. I will never forge! t it."

I remember that it was close to my birthday.  The weather was mild and cloudless.  I think it was a Saturday night because my parents were out.  I was almost 12, a well read and responsible kid, with no more than a passing interest in the unknown. For some reason, I went out to my front yard (the house was in the 2500 block of Southgate Blvd, Houston,TX,77025)and looked straight up.  At that moment a large disk (red lights on one side, green lights on the other, not shiny, totally silent)passed directly overhead, blotting out the stars as it passed.  It moved in a straight line over my house towards the north and I watched it until it was out of sight:  total only about 30 seconds.  As it moved away it appeared to be completely flat, and not very thick: a true disk, like a discus or a coin.  Oddly, I wasn&apos;t alarmed.  I didn&apos;t tell my parents or anyone at school.  And I pretty much forgot about it until around 1981. I know this was not the Goodyear blimp; I had seen the blimp at night in our part of the city before.  The shape was wrong, and the blimp was far from silent at that altitude. The disk was well above tree height, in that neighborhood of tall pine trees.  My closest guess on the size and altitude would be 100&apos; across and 1000&apos; off the ground. I am hoping that others may have seen this."

It was quite low over our car and approximately the size of a large airplane.My two daughters (ages 17 and 10) and I were driving from West Virginia to Florida for vacation and at approximately 7:00p.m. March 10 we were east of Columbia, South Carolina, heading east toward I95.  In the distance, somewhat to the right of the highway we could see a very bright light in the sky.  At first we thought it was from a radio tower as its altitude seemed to be only about that high and it was stationary.  As we got closer we could see no tower, just this incredibly bright light hanging motionless. We kept driving toward it and the road somewhat curved to the right and the light was then right over the highway in front of us.  It looked at first like an airplane but when we were almost under it we could see the shape.  It had four distinct sides with the brightest lights on the points but with lights all along each side.  It was slightly elongated, like a diamond shape, with the ends pointing east/west.  There were lights similarly placed on the top of the craft which were shining straight up. We pulled off the road when we were directly under the craft so my daughter could get our binoculars and camera from the trunk.  When we stopped, the craft slowly started to move away, to the east, and before we could get the binoculars out, it picked up speed and moved away. We had a very good look at the craft when it was above us.  It was a clear night with no rain or fog and there was a nearly full moon.  The altitude of the craft was quite low...maybe 500 feet above us.  None of us had a clear look at the substance of the craft due to the intensity of the lights from it.

They were moving at a steady rate of speed, but not especially fast. There were no signs of any sort of contrail or vapor coming from them.  My daughter, who was seven years old at the time, was outside and I hurriedly called her to come. I helped her hold the glasses and moved them around until she located the objects and her immediate comment confirmed my initial observation: &quot;They&apos;re tops, dad!&quot; she exlaimed. I watched these objects for three or four minutes until they faded from view. I would also note that shortly after I observed these objects, our pet dog--and every dog within earshot--began to howl and bark. I heard no sound whatsoever associated with the passages of these objects, although they were quite a distance away. I had the impression that they were perhaps two or three miles away at a minimum, which would have made them quite large.

Then, to my surprise, another &quot;point of light&quot; moved across the path of the first object.  Altogether, my family and I watched 12-15 of these objects move around in the sky for approximately 2 hours.  We called my Aunt, who lived a couple of miles away, and told her to go outside and watch them.  She went outside, but was unable to see anything other than the normal night sky.  We called the police non-emergency number, and they said it was probably fireworks or airplanes. Please note: These objects were extremely high  in altitude and made no noise.  There were too many of them for them to be satellites. Later that summer, my mother was describing the incident to an old family friend ( a lutheran minister)  who lived in WIsconsin.

I was on the front porch eating a Kool-Aid pack with my fingers when I looked up and saw a circular object with orange lights blinking.  The lights were around the middle.  It was stationary and never moved from the position it was in.  But thinking this was something I never saw before wanted to show my mother.  I called her and she came out. She looked up but couldn&apos;t see it and as I pointed up to show her where it was it just disapeared.  She went back in to finish lunch.  I was surprised that it was gone and then started to feel sick to my stomach.  Thinking it was the Kool-Aid I threw it down and then started to feel dizzy so went to bed.  That night my parents had to take me to the emergency room because I had hemoraged all over my pillow.  The emergency room doctors said my tonsils had ruptured.  I was spitting up chunks of blood.  I remember thinking that the doctor was dumb because at the time I thought it was really the kool-aid.  It wasn&apos;t until marriage and kids later that I recalled that event and wondered more about it.

19730801,19980128,"Kittery, ME",formation,10 Seconds,"Summary : A VERY fast light point object that was viewed for about 10 Seconds.I was standing topside watch aboard the USS Will Rogers (SSBN 659) with another petty officer named Duncan (can&apos;t remember last name). We witnessed a VERY fast brilliant object moving across the sky behind the lights of Portsmouth, NH and head out to sea (the Atlantic). Within two or three minutes after the sighting, we witnessed a flight of four F-15&apos;s take off from Pease AFB on full AB. They proceeded in the same direction of the object. Thinking this was significant, we made a note in the topside log and notified Pease AFB operations that we could confirm the sighting. The next morning the ship&apos;s XO called us in and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to play games with the Air Force and were then ordered to ammend our logbook entry. We were used to seeing F-15&apos;s take off from Pease during day and night. The object was many times faster than an F-15. It also did not in any way fit the profile of an F-15&apos;s afterburners. All we saw was a point of light moving very fast out to sea. This incident has remained a question in my mind because of the reverberations it caused in the Navy and Air Force chains of command."

Sometime in the early morning hours, I had awakened and looked out the window and saw this blue-gray light that had the apperance of drifting. (No unusual noise at all.) The diamater of this light looked to be the same as a pencil. I could not see a beam of anykind, but when  I started to get up to investigate, the light turned towards me (Clockwise looking down.) and shined in my right eye. The light was not like any I have seen before. It wasn&apos;t like a doctor&apos;s pen light, the light did not cause me to squint. The light didn&apos;t have to search for my eye, it went right to in a fraction of a second. Looking into the light, I could not see around the edges and in some way it reminded of chalk. The best I can remember, I only looked at the light about 1 second. Next thing I remembered, I didn&apos;t want to get up and go to the window anymore to investigate what was out there. That isn&apos;t like me, I am the type that would be the first one there, but after the light, I kept on  thinking to myself &quot;I can get up and look, but I don&apos;t want to.&quot; I didn&apos;t at that time felt that I was held back in any way. BTW, I didn&apos;t see any kind of craft."
19661001,19980924,"Edmonton (30 mi. east of, Hwy 16 East) (Canada), AB",diamond,5 min,"Unusual ights in distance. Approached until object overhead as wide as road and ditch. Bright lights, Turned head to find object in horizon. in horizon.On Labor Day, 1966 we were travelling to Saskatchewan for the holiday on Hwy 16 E about 30 miles out of town. My husband, myself, son almost two and I was pregnant.  Ahead we saw bright lights.  Since the road was straight, it was unusual.  We thought maybe a helecopter.  We slowed down and approached the lights.  As we got closer, we realized this object was very large and could not be anything we recognized.  We were going very slow as we approached this object.  It was very large.  It was as wide as a two lane highway with a curb and the ditch as well.  There were three rows of lights, the red being the most prominant.  We were calm and not frightned by this.  I was sitting up and looking up through the wind shield right under it and it was huge.  I told my husband to stop the car which he did.  I jumped out of the car, looked up and it was gone, and I could barely see it in the horizon.  The colors of the lights are vague, perhaps yellow or white, and green or blue.  The only sure color was red, for it seemed to be pulsing.  There were maybe 6 to 8 ports with lights in each color and 3 rows.  Less Rows on top to make the shape.  The lights were the only thing that gave it shape.  Like an upside down bowl. We continued on to Saskatchewan and mentioned it to my father and he had just read a book on UFO&apos;s and said it sounded like one.  I had never heard of such a thing.  Upon returning home to Alberta we ceased to talk about it, not to anyone, until one night a few months later, we had company, and we both realized that we had not told a sole.  So, we did.  Not long after this, both my husband and I were awoke in the middle of the night by a white light.  The house was light up like a flourescent light.  We lived by Half Moon Lake, and looked out to see what it could be.  There was a full moon that night, and the moon was reflecting on the lake.  The reflection of the moon was clear because it was a bit yellow, but there was another reflection, coming from where???  We phoned the Planitorium the next day to see if there had been a meterorite that night and they said no.  It was a frightning night!  After that, we basically left the experience alone.  I was due to have my baby in January, and while I was having her, I had a dream where I went some where.  It was so clear. There was someone talking to me and telling me why I had to go back. The doctors thought I may have had a near death experience, but I some- times wonder if it may have been from that experience.  I did go to a doctor and went under Hypnosis but nothing.  I always had the feeling that there had been more to this sighting that just seeing it. Myself and my two children all have Auto Immune diseases, myself, Multiple Sclerosis, My son, Chrones Disease and my Daughter a very serious Ulcerative Colitis. My daughter is a teacher, my son an Instrumentation Engineer and have done well academically.  I am unable to work.  This experience has never left my mind, and I am now living in the country and am always scared.  Jokingly I will say to my husband that I am sure in a good place for them to come at any time and check me out.  From my childhood, I have a good memory of an incident where I thought a &quot;Piece fell out of the Sky&quot; I wrote it down on a piece of paper and said I would retrieve it when I was a big girl and then people would believe me.  This is the first time I have told the Story and thought that it should be recorded some where.  I have since been divorced from the person driving the car, and have checked with him on different occasions to verify that it really did happen.  Another interesting thought was that at the time of the siting, we were not afraid at all. Also, when we were under it, I had my window opened, and there was not a sound."
19980311,19980311,"Colorado Springs, CO",other,10-15 sec.,"Seven narrow cylinders with tapered ends, flew in silent formation, from the south,due north. They appeared to have no single light. They glowed.On 3/11/98 at 10:03pm cst, my wife and myself were standing in our back(south-facing)yard, in the southwest side of Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was clear, moon nearly full, calm wind, 20 degrees. I looked to the west at about 30 degrees above the horizon at a group of stars to the north of Orion. As I turned back to face my wife something caught my attention inn the corner of my eye. I thought that it was a star cluster I had at first overlooked yet, there seemed to be movement. I turned to the west to squarely look at the object and discovered it to be moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude, from south to north. A path which came directly over Cheyenne Mountain and continued along the front range mountains until I could not see it any longer due to houses, etc.. When I first noticed that it was a moving object, I brought it to my wife&apos;s attention. She too percieved the same U.F.O.. At first sight it appeared to be a single chevron or delta winged configuration. However,the object consisted of seven cylindrical sections. Each cylinder tapered to nearly a point on each end. One in the lead with three others on each side. They were of a consistant grayish tone with perhaps a slight aura around each one. It was impossible to estimate the size or speed. First impressions were of a craft the size of a B-52 at about 5,000 feet, cruising at a speed consistant with approaching an airport for landing. Although, it easily could have been much larger and at considerably higher altitude. It was completely silent. There were no external lights. Preconceptions of aircraft flying with their wings perpendicular to the ground, at first, gave the impression that this was also true for this group of objects. Although it may have been a formation stacked vertically. I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m suggesting this because of the moon light at the time. The color of the objects were consistent with moon glow reflection. A reflection which seems unlikely if the craft were side by side with one another. The overall shape of the seven objects appeared to have little or no foreshortening, which I would expect from the angle,if they were flying horizontal, side by side. I don&apos;t know. The entire event was 10-15 seconds long. At about 6 seconds into the event, the upper or eastern three objects broke formation for about 1 to 2 seconds before regrouping as they origonally were. The break in formation was rather wave-like in it&apos;s movement. The first object from the middle, moved first, away from the center object and slightly forward. With the next two objects moving outward slightly. And the outer- most object moving slightly further apart still. Then they all reversed the sequence to resume the original formation. At this moment, the objects involved in the laterral motion, appeared to have their aura&apos;s glow intensify for less than a second, then return to the same overall color. Then they went out of sight, due to houses, trees, etc.."

We have spent many hours out there in the evenings observing the high altitude jets on their way to Seattle; and counting satellites as they orbit and the occasional metorite.  I mention this only to indicate that we are very familar with the normal nighttime sky activity. At approximately 9:10PM, I interrupted our conversation, pointed at the sky and said WHOA!.....WHOA!......WHOA!......WHOA! as I tracked the light across the sky.  It is my exclamations that now help me estimate the time duration of the event.  In this time it traveled from the east to the west in about a 60 degree arc until it passed behind a tree.  I also estimate the angle from the horizon was about 60 degrees to the south of our location in Cascade Park, Vancouver, WA. Some things I noticed most unusual:  The speed slowed and became brighter toward the end of my vision, glowing a bright greenish blue.  The size of the fireball seemed larger at the end, about the size of  a baseball in the air at 30 feet.  Also, even from the beginning of the arc the speed of this object was much slower than and metorite I have ever  observed and we did enjoy the recent summer meteor showers."

Clearly saw underneath writing or something all under.  Airplane came and ufo streaked off .  Estimated to be 150ftx150ft. , this may be vast underestimation.  No reports.  No radar.  It was huge.

My mother on the other hand is a devout disbeliever.  My sanity is intact because she was with me.

There was a distinct writing or something underneath in circles that covered the bottom.  When we first saw it it was traveling east to west seemingly down a busy street.  It got off the street and turned north and just stopped as if to let us look at it.  It just hovered over a populated neighborhood not doing anything.  It seemed to be about 50 ft. above the houses, very low.  It was huge.  We discussed wondering how such a thing could fly.  From the direction of the airport (east) we saw a very fast flying airplane coming our way.  The thing took off at a high rate of speed north and we gave chase along with the airplane.  We kept it in sight for another 6 miles and then lost it.  I called the airport to ask if anything had been reported and they said no.  I have searched everywhere and cannot find a picture of this thing and wonder if anyone else has seen this particular one.

I looked at the sky to the southwest and saw a row of about 8 large/amber color lights. I pointed it out to my friend and she saw them for about a second and asked where they went. About a second or two later the lights came on one at a time from right to left over the same spot we had originally saw the first set.  When the last light was lit it was gone again.  We continued to look and listen but nothing else happened. I would estimate the object was about 5 miles away and about 1000&apos; to 1500 feet above the ground.

19620601,19980121,"Aurora, CO",light,5 sec.,Summary : object seen moving from one star to anotherJust a 12 year old fascinated with the stars. Forgive the lack of information on this as it was over thirty years ago. I was lying on my front lawn looking easterly at the stars and as I was focused on two stars no more than 1- 2 inches apart I saw a star like light go from the southern star to the northern one. The light appeared to be as large as the two stars and did not diminish the star departed nor in- crease the star arrived upon. There were no flareups and no noises. I continued to watch but witnessed nothing further. They were medium in brightness and viewed by the naked eye.

It moved rapidly a short distance and then stopped in the sky.  It did this approx. 3-4 times.  Movement too rapid for any known aircraft (to my knowledge).I was driving northbound on I-95 through Prince William Co. and almost in Fairfax Co., VA, at approx 2230 (no later than 2245).  Three blue lights in the sky ahead of me caught my attention.  I first thought it was a helicopter.  However, the blue was medium in shade (the most beautiful I&apos;ve ever seen).  The color was captivating.  They were too large for any aircraft of which I am familiar.  They were grapefruit-sized.  The three lights formed a perfect triangle.  This formation moved rapidly, a short distance and then came to an abrupt and complete stop.  It repeated this action 3 - 4 times within my field of vision.  During movement, the  lights never changed size (as if the line of sight distance made no effect) nor did the distance of the lights from each other vary.  It maintained the perfect triangular formation during all movement.  I could see no lights or craft between the blue lights; only an intense blackness filled the triangle.  It left my field of vision rapidly...it flew rapidly to the right, and was gone.  During the time I saw this I was driving, northbound, on interstate 95.  So I began at 75 mph and then when I saw it I slowed to approx. 60mph.  It was visable to me for approx. 45 secs.  I dismissed it as nothing.  It is highly unusual for me however, that i cannot forget it or dismiss it.  I remember it more clearly than anything I have ever seen.  I find it unusual that I frequently think of it and look now in the night skies as if I might see something.  I am not a UFO seeker/searcher.  Whatever it was, it had an effect on me that nothing else ever has."

On second thought, no plane would produce this much light and this sustained intensity. I am an amateur astronomer and this *was not* a meteor breaking up mainly due to the sweeping up of light prior to the second and lesser burst of very bright light. Most interesting, last night Tue (21), Art Bell opened his show reporting a similiar light display from a San Antonio listener, precisely 24 hours after my sighting.

A streak of light appeared directly in front of my view facing East. The width of the tail seemed larger than an average meteor tail, and had a greenish blue tinge to it.

There appeared to be a beam of light between 2 of the white lights.I was sitting outside Fair Oaks Hospital and saw the following in the sky.  There were 2 very distinct white lights and one other less distinct white light that formed a triangle shape.  Counting the lights clockwise, with number one being the top:  !: bright white; 2: dim white light (barely visable); 3: bright white.  Between number 2 and 3, there was a small flashing red light.  At first I thought it was an airplane because there are many aircraft in the area.  However there was a stream of light between lights number 1 and 2 and a stream of light between lights number 1 and 3.  In other words, there was no line for the bottom of the triangle.  These streams of light I refer to, did not appear solid, but appeared as directed radiance between the other lights.  It moved at the average speed that one witnesses in aircraft when near an airport.  This is my second reporting of a sighting.  I am very skeptical in regards to UFOs, but I cannot explain what I saw, especially the one I reported seeing in December.  I expect this one was an earth-bound aircraft, but the one in December....well...I will never forget it nor the effect it has had on me."

19970812,19980214,"Pilot Butte (Canada), SA",chevron,1min.,"seen when observing the Perseid meteor shower august 1997this object was seen on two consecutive nights&#x5C;morning. the first sighting was observed by 5 people, the second by me alone. The object was in the shape of two wings almost boomerang shape and was beige in colour. the first night the object, soundlessly flew across the sky from N.E. to S.W. at a high altitude. The second night it flew alarmingly low over my back yard. In fact I wrote a letter to our local air force base complaining that it scared me by flying so low as I thought it was an experimental aircraft. We had a lively correspondence and denials not on radar etc. When I sent a sketch the colonel himself phoned me and we had a very interesting discussion.there was no sound and no lights nor any call signs on the object. It went extremely fast and as it was rather high at the first sighting it was difficult to estimate size althiugh it looked much larger than a 747. The second sighting scared the heck out of me as it came without so much a swish over my backyard and the road at the other side of the fence. It could have been 30-50 feet across because I do not know how high up it was. It seemed to me that it cleared the street light by about 20-30ft. I really can not say with any certainty, all I know is that it totally unnerved me to the extent that I ran into the house and locked the door. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am glad others saw it too. The object had none of the characteristics logged on your list. It was silent and looked like two backswept wings with scalloped edges,plus it had random protuberances on the under side. It scard me. It may have been an experimental aircraft althoiugh this was denied, nor had it,according to the airforce base, been recorded on radar. The base is 60 miles from and i am used to seeing aircraft flying about. They had been flying earlier that night too.I also phoned my local commercial airport about 12 miles away and they had no radar confirmaton of anything like I had seen. It was laughingly suggested that perhaps it was Alien. I did n! ot think it was funny. Incidentally about 60 miles north a crop circle was found the next day and many plants in my yard had mutations. The object I saw was travelling from east to north west. Both nights were very clear and cool."

Within the haze red green and bluish lights could be seen moving but did not seem to be spot lights, more like flood lights. It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little &quot;speed-trap&quot; town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us.

Went to turn onto road, noticed bright light and thought a car had come around my side from blind spot. Slowed the vehicle and stopped only to realize that the lights were coming from over the hill. There were two of them and judging by the shape of the hills, these objects were fairly far apart, because they both sat over two seperate hilltops. They seemed to travel in an upward motion, building speed as they went. One broke away from its&apos; original coarse only to return to its&apos; original position in a split second. Both objects ran upward only to come back down right above the hilltop. they did this a few times before they went back down behind the hills. They changed colors as they went higher into the sky only to be more defining in shape. when close to the hilltop, the objects seemed more orange and yellow and where shaped like an ice cream cone, but as they got higher the color changed to a more blue and the shape was definitely oval and pulsed as it moved. My nephew thought it might be a military exercise, because we have a air force base right out of town, but I told him I did not think so, the military doesn&apos;t ever fly over housing areas, there were houses up on the hill, then we both were also confused because of the speed the objects were moving, then just coming to a dead stop after moving so fast so quickly&gt; They seemed to be defying normal gravity.

Cntr craft left,rest followed as observer stopped car below.I am curious what is done with this type of information, especially since it is after the fact of the incident. My mother, a stable, religious, and previously non-believing (in UFOs) person, related the following story to me this evening: At approximately 7 p.m she was driving home and saw a straight line of intense white V-shaped lights in a perfectly straight line ahead, about 1000&apos; in the sky.  She described them as looking light &quot;football stadium lights&quot; only v-shaped, that close together and straight.  She ended up driving 10 blocks until she was nearly underneath.  She slowed down the car and rolled down the window to observe and try to figure out what they were, and at that point the center object left the formation proceeding straight forward, and the remaining object followed, still in tight, straight formation, and all were quickly out of sight. The one thing she thought very odd was that there was no sound at all from the objects, unlike aircraft. She is not the type to embellish or fabricate such a story, and did not even feel anything more than a curious amusement about this topic, but now is shocked, certain of what she saw, and a believer that what she saw was not any craft that she has ever heard of.  She related this to me to ask if I knew of any military aircraft that was quiet and matched that description because I served with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and knew of most military aircraft in the world.

No regular aircraft lights, not flying in a logan or greene or orham air lane.  Too high for civilian craft, and too erratic (and completely silent) for military.  Having been exposed to most types of aircraft (including missiles and experimental craft) in New Mexico (worked at White Sands and Holloman for some time), I can say that I have never seen anything like this.  The two lights apppeared like satellites, but moved too close, too erratic.  No flames, no missile contrails.

I am a student and we had no school the next day.  I left my friends house to take another friend home.  After I dropped him off I headed towards my house, when I noticed three lights in the sky to the east by northeast of my direction of travel (east) I was observing this over a farm field.  As the road curved right, I lost sight of the object over a small wood.  when I cleared the trees the object was much, much closer.  over the initial hydrenaline rush I was able to tell the three lights were a perfect equalateral triangle.  The lights continued to expand outward, as the object appeared to come closer.  I slowed to see the object as it stopped and hovered beyond a neighborhood, nearby an old rock quary.  The lights rotated clockwise, then the lead light turned towards me as the object banked, as an aircraft would turn, I thouht it to resemble the B-2 stealth bomber.  The shape of the triangle was incorrect though.  The object was equal on all sides, as the stealth has a longer base at the tail than the shorther two wings (an isosolece triangle).  As the object moved towards me, sped down the winding road, only looking back as I could, to horrifyingly see that this object was moving parallel to my direction of travel. the road curved, and i lost sight of the object over more trees.  A few seconds later I stopped to turn left on US route 6 and saw that these lights were still there.  I sped around the cornder as the object tilted, while still rotating-so that the bottom of the object was facing me.  I drove really fast without looking back for about 15 seconds, bu that time I had lost sight of it.  I returned home, took out the binocculars and searched for the object, but I could not find it.

My boyfriend at the time lived on Kildare Ave. If I remember correctly, the address was 2202 (or close to it).

Five lights across the sky and they were very low...there was absolutely no sound, moving ever so slowly...When I looked up, I was so excited, I told my Mikie to run in and get everyone to come outside to see...he was so frightened, he cried running up the stairs...well by the time anyone listened to him and they finally came out, the lights had disappeared into the sky as thou the sky opened up and the lights just slipped into the darkness one by one.

19881015,19980609,"Belle, MO",unknown,5/10 minutes,"Lights on a huge craft slowly going overhead. (Official explanations unacceptable)I had a sighting about ten years ago and I never had the resources to check out what I had seen until I got on the net. Which brings me to the point as to why I am writing you. The official comments that were made about the sighting were unacceptable and I believe, would be to anyone who actually saw this object. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t pinpoint the exact date, which is a problem. However, there are other details that may help identify this sighting. That way, someone may be able to help me find more realistic explanations as to what I saw that  night. Below is an account of the events as I remember them. It was Oct. of 1988 (unsure of these dates) about eight o&apos;clock or a little later, when I was going to visit a friend, who lives in a rural part of Missouri. I pulled into his driveway, got out of the car and went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friend&apos;s house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were at least three lights maybe more, I don&apos;t really recall.) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing toward the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object, I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned toward it. The object seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so, I&apos;m just guessing. There was dead silence, I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly, I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the wind alone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or veered from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o&apos;clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience, the first line of the news cast said  &quot;If you saw it, you weren&apos;t the only one.&quot; They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night. An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientists thinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the following day the official report stated, it was a Russian Rocket that was reentering the earth&apos;s atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations. For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way. It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp, I would have believed this before any of the other explanations. That is, before I heard it had been reported in seven different states that night.  But after hearing this, I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skies that night.  What I am looking for is any other credible explanations as to what this may have been. If you have any info on the sighting I am referring to or can lead me to others that may be able to help me. Please feel free to forward this letter or e-mail me. I would very much appreciate it."

I wonder if there were more sightings in norway that time around that area, close to the Swedish border, about two hours drive from Oslo(pretty deserted at that time, forests). I do not believe in anything before I see it, and I saw it. The crafts moved from the right to the left at the nightsky, and all held the same tempo. They also vertically went straigh up in the same formation, but this time the first one at the first, and the next one , and the next, like a neckless. It looked like they took of upwards without changing the horizontal position of the crafts, like that modern airforce jet which can lift veritcal stright up. The crafts was never landing, just flying (flowing) and then svishh....I am sure no planes ever have been built to have that speed of accellaration in just less than a second, then or now. Well, this isn&apos;t ! a big record to remember, but I thought I just mention it. I am a sceptic so I really never speak much about such things, but I know we are not alone anyway. Any intelligent non arrogant person should understand that. The color was light yellow glowing like any distant light for instance from a strong light and not changing, so was the fire tails but you could clearly see what was the firetails, since the object moved.

I lived on a corner lot at the time so I could see two blocks in either direction.  iwas looking up and around at the stars when standing east I caught something in the corner of my eye. About a block to my right five or ten feet over the tree tops which were around tweny five to thirty feet up was this thing.It floated in a absulute straight line past me vary slow 2-3 miles per hour, I was about five feet from the ally. It was lightly ulluminated in a yellowish color, with a black corner to corner stripe about 1.5-2 feet wide. The thing was about the size of a vw bug. There were no edges, seems or anything protruding from it.Ten or so feet long six or so feet wide. The closest thing I can come up with is the movie of Star Trek were they put spock into a cascate and sent him to some planet. Its shape was quit quite simular. I heard no sound from it, no trafic anyware at all, this was on a Sunday night.I watched it go past me straight down the ally and out of site. Istood the wondering what the hell was that, nothing can do that. I looked around to see if maybe someone else was around but nobody was there. I don&apos;t know what it was, I do remember I had An erie sense about it. Has anyone else seen this?

We were out playing at the edge of the field one day when we heard a strange humming noise, we looked up and saw a small saucer shaped object with few lights around it approximatley 7 or 8 feet above our heads. We stood stunned as it only hoovered above us, it seemed as though we stood there for a long time. Finally, I do not know why, but we stated running from it, at least 150, or 200 ft away from it. It chased us, swooping down close to our heads. It then left. The strange thing is we were stunned and amazed, but we forgot about it, I mean we did not fear or think about it anymore, It was something that came into our minds once every couple of years. I have had one other experience since that time. I was sleeping on the couch, and was awakened by a bright light flowing through the window, it looked as if the moon had fallen right beside me. I pulled the covers over my head, it still shone through, but it did not really bother me, I went right back to sleep. I will never forget what happened when I was nine though, the older I get, the clearer the memory is.I did not see aliens, all I saw was this saucer shaped object, and heard the intense humming noise it was making. I guess at first we were not scared, just in shock, for it seemed that we stood there for hours. Then suddenely we were filled with fear and fled. It followed us, swooping down at us, I have never ran so hard in my life. And I still cannot understand why after this happened it seemed like it was no big deal, why we didn&apos;t think about it very much, I mean that should of been enough to make you go crazy, but afterwards, it did not even bother us. We have rarley even discussed it."

I was looking out the picture window into the sky as I often do checking out the helicopters and airplane lights in the distance when all of a sudden what looked like a falling star fell about a 1/2 a mile in front of me falling from the North to the Southeast. It was green &quot;fireball&quot; emitting a gold haze with a gold tail. It fell for approx. 6 to 8 seconds and then just disappeared. I immediately yelled to my husband that I had just seen something that looked like a falling star except that it was green and big.

Object was gone at 08:00 hours. Object was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. One arm length and the width of the hand plus extended thumb. A ratio of approximately  1 to 4 (or .25).  This elevation remained unchanged even after I got to work where I easily spotted the object in what I assumed to be the same location. The line of sight distance to work is 7 miles to the southwest. This means, as the elevation was essentially unchanged, the object was at a considerable distance. At least 40 miles I&apos;d guess. The object appeared to displace about one eight inch. That is the gap between the index finger and the thumb at arms length. That would be about what you&apos;d get from a street light at about a 100 feet.

It hovered for at least 10 minutes, then it faded quickly into black.At approximately 7:15 p.m. on the evening of January 21, 1997, I was driving toward my home in Blackwell, OK, when I glanced in the sky.  In the west/southwest sky, somewhere between 9-10 oclock I would estimate, I spotted an object.  Thinking it was a star at first, I looked back at the road.  Then, thinking to myself that it looked larger than a star, I looked again.  I couldn&apos;t get a really good look at it while I was driving, so I stopped in a church parking lot to watch it.  The object was larger than a star or planet.  I watched the object for just under 5 minutes, in which time it did not move.  It was a golden colored object with a red &quot;tail&quot; hanging to the left.  The red light at the end of the tail occasionally appeared to be flickering.  I went to my parents&apos; home and they both went outside.  Both viewed the object.  We do not believe that it was a helicopter, due to the fact that the lights were large enough that if it were, we would have heard the noise.  We heard no noise at all.  My mother and I returned to the house to gather a few things and get in the car to drive away from the town and view the object.  However, when we went back outside, the object was gone.  Another witness we spoke with said she was watching as it disappeared, and it just faded into black, as if it were traveling away from her at a high rate of speed.  It did not appear to move from that position, so if it was moving, it would have had to have moved away at the same angle that we were viewing it from.  It did not just disappear all of a sudden, it was very bright (brighter and a little larger than the average star)and then began to get smaller and fade into black.  We proceeded to drive into the country and we never got sight of the object again.  We have not gone public with this story, but we would like to know what it was.

19980331,19980422,"Baraboo, WI",light,a few seconds,"a yellow-orange light that zipped or zig-zagged, apparently a mile or two away on the southeastern horizon.I am an associate editor at FATE magazine, and was investigating a report of a recurring UFO sighting in Baraboo. I met the witness, a Baraboo resident, on both March 31 and April 5, and we had sightings on both mornings, which were shared by one friend of mine on March 31 and two different friends on April 5. I will enter data on the more interesting April 5 incident in a separate posting to come. I have written about my experience in the forthcoming June issue of FATE, but wanted to place the information here since I am not getting a response from members of Wisconsin MUFON after three weeks since contacting them. This is apparently a _recurring_ incident. At 4:45 a.m. CST on March 31, I met the witness. I was training my binoculars on the southeastern horizon (an area known as the Baraboo Bluffs, in the vicinity of several radio and microwave towers) when I saw a orange-yellowish light soar a few degrees across the horizon. My friend, viewing with the naked eye, said she saw it zig-zag. I had the impression of an old-fashioned orange computer cursor that leaves a trail as it glides across a blank screen. It was bright, anomalous, very short-lived, and not easy to explain. We then runined any further opportunity to observe the light by driving off in the wrong direction, after which it was too bright and too foggy for us to see anything more. We concluded that the sighting may have been a UFO or other kind of anomalous ground-light activity. I returned to Baraboo on April 5 with two other friends. We discovered then that at least part of what our witness was describing, observing, and photographing was nothing more than good old planet Venus, in the southeastern sky. Disappointed, we waited around for a few hours and prepared to leave. But once again, while I was training my binoculars high in the southern sky on Venus (at 8:10 a.m. CDT), my friends and I had another strange sighting. This time, a bright white light seemed to emerge from behind the center of a thin cloud, a few degrees &quot;below&quot; Venus. It was tens of thousands of feet high. It &quot;swooped&quot; below the cloud (from our perspective) and seemed to leave a bright light impression or reflection before vanishing. I had the impression of the shape of a powerfully lit electric moth. Again, this was seen by myself, two friends, and the Baraboo witness. The whole thing seemed to resemble an extremely odd entrail from a plane, and I have not been able to look into this yet, but (1) we saw no physical craft, and (2) we agreed that it motion was far too anomalous, especially since it was 8 a.m. on a Sunday, and supposedly recurring. I believe there is some basis in truth for what the Baraboo witness has been reporting, but fact and fallacy have been difficult to separate. The Baraboo witness may report his extensive sightings soon by phone, but I personally can offer these two reports which were shared by a number of my friends, and seem to be consistent with most of the witness&apos;s claims. Since this is apparently a recurring event, I personally recommend that somebody with more resources investigates. I am available for more information."

At the exact moment that I heard the guest say that  it was important to try and get an exact time of sighting I saw the object in the sky through my windshield. I noted the time on my vehicles digital clock and have since compared it to other clocks. My vehicle clock is one minute slow, so the exact time of my sighting is 10:49 pm on Wednesday, 1998.

We both looked around to see what kind of vehicle would have such brilliant headlights, but there were no other cars or trucks pulling in or out at that time.  We then discussed whether it may have been someone taking a picture.  Bu it was late, very cold out and no-one was appeared to be outside. At that moment, there were no planes overhead.  The light itself was silver-blue in colour and illuminated the interior of my car for those brief seconds.

Appropriately enough, we were out at the Oceanside Municipal Airport and there were about 20 or so adults, including a couple of elected city councilmembers, standing around chatting, getting ready to leave the venue when I spotted what I thought at first was a cheap skyrocket. I thought this because of the sparks and firey trail coming out from behind. The object was moving at a high rate of speed, but maintaining a level flight in a direct westerly to east path. I had enough time to realize that this was not a meteor or a skyrocket and something unusual. I shouted to everyone, pointing up to the sky. Everyone was able to watch this object travel east into a bank of light clouds. It didn&apos;t look that high, but the next day I read in the San Diego Union that the same object had been observed by people as far away as north of Los Angeles. What makes me write this report nearly three weeks after the fact was hearing Peter on Art Bell&apos;s program tonight (09/24/98). At approximately 10:15 p.m., Peter played a tape recording of a woman reporting this exact same object that she saw as she traveled on State Highway 18 toward Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains. She claimed it flew directly over her...she said it was at 7:15 p.m. This definitely was not a meteor, as most so-called officials have explained. I am a 30-year veteran of journalism, a daily columnist for the North County Times, (circulation 96,000), which covers northern San Diego County.

I walked over to the window, opened the sheer curtains, and saw very clearly a disc-shaped UFO with 6-8 multi- colored lights hanging beneath the disk. The colored lights alternated their lighting pattern, as if spinning in a slow circle.  The sound matched the moving lights.  The ship wasn&apos;t doing anything other than hovering above the rooftops.  I tried to wake up my spouse verbally, to no avail.  I didn&apos;t dare leave the window.  After what seemed like an eternity, I finally did walk across the room to try again to rouse my spouse.  Unsuccessful, I returned to the window, only to find it was gone.

We stopped for a few moments at the Ft. Lincoln Rest Stop, south of Raton, NM to look at the stars with binoculars. While my daughter looked at the stars with the binoculars I was using a 1st generation NVD and looking at the southern horizon. I began tracking what I thought was a polar orbit satilite (from about 15 degrees above the S. horizon) I realized the object was traveling too fast for a satilite. (speed unknown but it covered from 15 degrees to 90 degrees in approx. one minute.) As the object reached the 90 degree position it was joined by 2 other objects that matched vector and speed from the SW using non-ballistic manuvering. The objects formed a triangular formation and traveled on for 10-20 seconds and then made a non-ballistic 90 degree turn to the west and accellerated until they were lost from view on the western horizon.

It reappeared a couple of times in same position, appeared couple times in different positions but close to original.  Lots of small aircraft in the area which is normal.Our house sits on a bluff and overlooks the front range of Colorado Springs. I was in bed watching TV.  Our bedroom has a big window looking out at the front range.  On this night, there was a lot of aircraft flying across the front range, probably from the USAF Academy and/or Co Springs Airport.  It was fairly clear with a few clouds.  I saw the object several times without paying too much attention to it, before it finally sunk in that there was something different about it--it didn&apos;t seem to be moving, just staying in the same spot.  At first I was trying to figure out what kind of airplane it was, but it had more lights than I&apos;ve ever seen.  It wasn&apos;t familiar. I thought it was strange---but again didn&apos;t think too much about it--doens&apos;t necessarily mean anything.  Afterall, I&apos;m not intimately familiar with all aircraft.  Then I also realized that it didn&apos;t seem to be moving.  Maybe it was a dirigible.  Don&apos;t know why one of them would be in the area, but who knows. Or maybe it&apos;s an aircraft with all lights on coming straight at me---but it didn&apos;t seem to get closer---but couldn&apos;t honestly really tell.  But then it completely disappeared (all the lights were gone). That&apos;s when it got my full attention, and I began searching for it.  A few seconds later(maybe 15?), it reappeared in the same spot.  I looked closer and it&apos;s not moving.  It disappeared again after a short time (again less than an minute).  It appeared and disappeared (I think) 2 more times within a short distance of the original spot, and then didn&apos;t reappear.  Each time it appeared, it didn&apos;t seem to move, just hovered.  It was the lack of movement that gave me the idea it might be a UFO.  It was hovering somewhere over the Academy Blvd business district.  Pikes Peak was to the right, the mountains in the background, and the object was a little more than half way between Pikes Peak and the end of the mountain range to the left.  It&apos;s impossible to say how far away from my house it was. I&apos;d guess the base of the mnts are approx. 5 miles a! way. Using that as a reference, I&apos;d say it was a mile from me and was about 6-8&quot; wide. Perhaps that can help give you some perspective of size. It was much larger than anything that normally flies in the area.  The Academy flies small Cessna type aircraft, and I&apos;ve never seen the larger aircraft from the airport fly this close--they have always much farther out next to the mountains. I just wish I&apos;d had a camera handy. I had hoped to see it on the news with an explanation or confirming that I wasn&apos;t crazy--but there wasn&apos;t anything. I have been associated with the AF for 29 years.  I was in the AF for 6 as an aircraft mechanic, my husband is AF, I&apos;ve lived on AF bases, and I currently work for the AF as a civilian.  In other words, I&apos;ve been around airplanes most of my adult life.  Also, I&apos;m not &quot;into&quot; the UFO craze.  I&apos;ve always been very skeptical--I have always thought their existance was possible, but since I hadn&apos;t had any personal experience, I reserved judgment.  My theory has always been that most sightings could be explained (including this one), the witness saw what they wanted to see or they were telling tales, or the sightings were just military test aircraft.  However, what I saw the other night, has gotten my attention.  There&apos;s probably a good explanation of what it was.  I&apos;m hoping your organization may have an explanation or reports from others.  I&apos;m reporting it to you in hopes that you may know of someone else who observed it.  Right now, I dont&apos;t feel like telling anyone (other than my husband) as they&apos;ll think I&apos;m nuts.  I wish I&apos;d had a camera that would have captured it. Have you received any other reports about it?"

Following the line was a object blacker than the night sky.  The line started to fade away until it was completly gone.  I could still see the black object moving slowly, against the stars that would disappear then reappear.  Just before it past over the trees the lights from the city reflected off of it.  It had a brown tint, and the front edge was almost white.  I saw no flashing lights or other elumination from the object, only the reflection of the city lights. The shape was triangular but closer to what the stealth bomber looks like.  I thought it might have been the stealth bomber but the speed seemed to be to slow for its altitude and size.

This did not suprise us as an airport is nearby, and similar jet sounds are heard from time to time.  However, this sound continued well into three minutes, getting louder and louder, unlike any plane that passes by.  I looked out the westeren window of my family room and saw three blue-white strobing lights about 30 degrees above the horizon,  in a pattern which I will represent with an astrix and two periods:                  (     *    .                 .       )      The lower two lights would strobe together while the upper left light was off, then the upper left would strobe while the lower two were off, doing so within one second intervals. The sky was grey overcast, tempeture about 23 degrees.  I then noticed that the lights were stationary.  At arms length, the length of the formation was  approximatel;ly eight inches.  I called my wife in to view the lights. She agreed that they did not look li! ke any plane she ever saw before,  and why was it stationary?  I opened the window and noted that the roaring noise was comming directly from the object, but there were no visable exhust jets or any obvious source for the soise.  Through 7x35 binoculars,  the lights appeared similar to aircraft strobe lights, but very intense.  No shape or outline of any kind was detected.   As I watched,  the formation  seemed to be moving extremely slowly to the west, at a speed of perhaps only a few feet per second, barely noticable.  I watched for 9 minutes before it dissapeared behind the rooftops.  Just before it did, the light on the left moved or rotated towards the center light, almost merging, then returned to its original position.

The reply was negitive.  I called Cleveland Hopkins airport and obtaind the same comment, but they recommended I contact the FAA the next day.  This I did, and the woman on the phone who took my report stated that a man had called in from Huron Ohio that same morning to report a jet that had been so low and loud, it brook several windows. Huron is due west from my home if you draw a line to it, and this was the direction the lights headed.  My mother also heard the roar, and, although hard of hearing, went from window to window looking for a truck or something, but never looked up.  She lives directly west of us on the same line.  We are self employed professionals, and I am an armchair astronomer and avaition buff, so I am fimiliar with various types of craft and celestial events.

Approximately one hour later, about 23:00, I went outside and looked toward the area where I had previously seen the object and there was a small red circular light and a small green circular light hovering in the same area. No noise could be heard and the object was not moving. I called for family members to come outside, and three other family members witnessed the red and green lights hovering in the sky. Suddenly the lights started moving forward toward the north and we then heard a noise like the engine of a plane and this object moved away to the north.

I was listening to you on Art Bell on the Sept 25 show and you mentioned no sonic boom. That brought to my mind about the above sighting... there was no sonic boom.

Both turned in formation and headed south, apparently entering ionosphere where a bright light blue aura appeared in front and broad badminton birdie shaped cone of blue appeared behind each.

My thoughts were that these objects looked like Hale Bopp and might be comets; but, they slowed down upon apparently entering ionosphere and maneuvered in loose formation. Four other people came outside and observed the objects as I videotaped them moving south in the eastern sky and then turn to the east and apparently depart the ionosphere again. I zoomed video out to get exact ground reference point so that celestial geometry could be figured. The next morning I calibrated videocamera clock with GPS time. I later talked with observers 21 miles away and 50 miles away who saw similar objects around same time. The videotape is digital and quite good. Today I read your web page accounts and agree with most descriptions of objects orientation and behavior, except that the objects I observed definitely came from northeast, turned south, and then apparently left ionosphere heading east. This does not seem to be typical ICBM behavior. It is of note that the brightest aspect of the objects was on the leading edge, and illumination was much less in rear view.

What IS it?&quot;  I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d recognize a UFO unless it landed in my yard. So, here it is.... If you look at a steel I-Beam from the end, it makes a capital I. This thing had that shape, which didn&apos;t change no matter how it turned, and it appeared to be black. The top and bottom of the I were quite thick in appearance. We thought it had to be a real quiet bi-plane style ultralight, as we see a lot of experimental aircraft flying up from the Arlington airport (some look to be little more than flying lawnmowers, to be honest, and make as much racket!). But this had No Tail and No Visible Pilot.  It was a bit larger than an ultralight, and moved faster, at about the same rate a small plane would but was pretty manuverable (sp?).  We could see it circling the water treatment holding ponds across from the Dairy Queen in Stanwood (in the Viking Village/Red Apple plaza).  It then moved a little east over some fields and checked those out, then swung down south toward the Warm Beach area.  It was still light out, but it didn&apos;t reflect any light.  I&apos;d have to say it was only 200 feet in the air.  If we had been coming down the hill from East Stanwood (which is about 200 feet higher than the downtown area), we would have been able to look down on it. (We do have biplanes in the area -- saw one today doing stunts over Pioneer Highway, but like I said earlier the whatsit had no tail and the top and bottom were very thick.  Too thick to be standard biplane wings.) My seven year old has much sharper eyes than I have, and she was going nuts trying to figure out what the devil it was, as it wasn&apos;t falling into any category of aircraft, powered or unpowered, that we had seen.  She&apos;s seen paragliders and hang gliders and she assured me it wasn&apos;t one of those.  I could make out the shape, but not the details, but she said there weren&apos;t any details for her little sharp eyes to see.  My 4 year old also saw this whatsit, but she is very speech delayed so she wasn&apos;t much help. Speaking of the four year old, coming back down from Mt. Vernon today at about 2:45 pm, she let out a squawk and pointed at the sky, saying something had burst out of a cloud.  I saw something streak back into the overcast, but didn&apos;t get a good enough look.  I figured it was just a jet.  Except within two minutes some jets from Whidbey Island shot by in the same direction as the streak.  Maybe they were just practicing.  They have been flying A LOT lately over Stanwood, fairly low too. Oh, you need a little about me.  I&apos;m a 40 year old stay at home mom who wears contacts - one is a toric lense to correct astigmatism.  You see why I rely on my daughter to pick up the details.

I was doin gjust tha twith a little girl ( to this day I can not remember who she was)  all I remember about her is that she had long dark hair.( none of my friends at the time match that description.)  I remember cli&#x5C;mbing to the top of the hill and once at the top I saw a large silver disk sitting in the pit.( yes the typical flying saucer)  It was a dull silvery color and was sitting on three &apos;legs&apos;.  I remember going closer to see it better.  I heard a kind of pop and one section of the disk began to lower to the ground.  The next thing I remember running across a field on the other side of the hill towards my house. And it was getting dark so I think several hours had elapsed.  Since then I have had several other unusual experiences.  I have seen a &apos;creature&apos; in my bedroom window and when I tried to screm no sound came out.  I have a small lump on my right shoulder that has been there for as long as I can remember.  I have seen several mysterious objects in the sky.  I have another episode of &apos;missing time&apos;.

Make me a believer in the u.f.o. phenomenon. A disk like object appeared hovering above the tree line outside my window. As it hovered above the trees there was a series of red lights circulating around the lower portion of the object.The top of the craft, I really couldn&apos;t make out that well being that there was a white hazy glow above the red lights. Below that there seemed to be 2 white lights blinking on and off. At first i thought it was a plane but after watching it descend lower and to my right, I realized it was not possible movement for an airplane. All of a sudden it instantly turned into a very bright red dot, something along the lines of a laser pen. It quickly made a figure 8-like shape before turnig back into the disk-like shape and slowly made its&apos; way below the tree line. Upon waking up the next morning, to my surprise i had found out that there was a problem with Airforce 1 not being picked up on radar approx. near the vicinity of LaGuardia Airport. This experience has definately made me a believer and will always feel close to the&quot;other&quot; side. I am a 22 year old male from Northern New Jersey."

I got out the video camera and zoomed right in on the object and to our amazement it showed a glowing sphere with symmetrical markings on it. It was like nothing we had seen before! But it&apos;s all on tape now!We live on a farm on the eastern side of Australia with a great, unobstructed view of the night sky. It was clear summer night with a full moon out. My brother and his girlfriend woke me to look at a large glowing object they had noticed looking out through their bedroom window in the lower eastern part of the night sky. It looked like a normal glowing star but much, much brighter and larger. I laughed saying it was a helicopter or something but they assured me that it had been there for a while. So I went and got my video camera and proceeded to film it. The object looked like a huge glowing ball but when I zoomed in on it you could see a huge sphere like object that was a light cream/grey color with symmetrical patterns on it. This instantly shocked us. You could not see the patterns with your naked eye or even with binoculers, as we tried, but using the zoom on the video camera (it&apos;s one of the latest model camera&apos;s with a great zoom) was totally amazing, you could see it very well. I kept filming the object and it would glow brightly (white) with green around the edges, then change to red around the edges, then the glowing would subside and the camera was able to pick up the sphere with the patterns on it again. The sphere also moved in and out on the camera screen getting larger and smaller as I stayed still on it. We don&apos;t know what it was, but were totally amazed by it! I filmed it for about 40 minutes and it was still there so we went back to bed as I acquired enough footage of it!"

The craft was low and just sort of gliding.  It came form the Northeast sky and continued moving North toward Saginaw MI.  I talked to a neighbor and was told that during a party in late October several witnesses saw the very same thing.   It hovered over the party moving in circles and then hovering.

I had been sleeping.  I woke up at 8:25 PM and went to the door to put my dog out.  When I saw the lights coming toward my house I just stood in the doorway to watch and see what it was.   I have never seen anything like that in my life.   I am 49 years old.   It was so weird.  I have been watching the skies ever since and I have seen a very bright light in the sky for months.   It looks like a very bright star.  It goes high and the light gets faint and then it comes low and the light gets very brilght again.    I have seen it just zoom off.   Sometime I don&apos;t see it for a couple of weeks and then it comes back again.   I went to Flint, MI one night and watched it all the way there (about 30 Min from my home).

It then stopped for a second and then speed at about 2 oclock. It went into a cloud and never came out. This,what used to be a small cloud the began to enlarge and move directly over us like no other clouds around. I told Jim that something else was going to happen but it didn&apos;t. Not Yet anyhow.

19971231,19980112,"Puerto Nuevo (Puerto Rico), PR",cross,3.5min,"Summary : While visiting relatives in Puerto Rico in December, we witnessed a UFO in Puerto Nuevo, PR. I have been searching all over the internet for information on &quot;cross-shaped&quot; UFOs. Sadly, my search has come up empty. I seriously hope you can help. I don&apos;t know where to report this or what resources to use. It was December 31, 1997, the time was between 9:05pm and 9:10pm. We were heading westward on  Rt22 Express De Diego and at the end of Avenida de Diego we witnessed a cross-shaped UFO (called an OVNI in PR). I noticed it initially and at first thought it a large jet at extremely low altitude. Unlike a jumbo jet, there was no engine noise and its position in the sky didn&apos;t change. It was hovering over what I could see in the dark was a large parking lot full of what appeared to be delivery vans. It was roughly cross-shaped with white lights at all 4 ends of the cross shape. These white lights were steady and did not blink. There appeared to be something in the center of the underside, however I cannot remember too much detail. My Fiancee said it was concave shaped in the middle, curving inwards. Also, off-center of the underside was a flashing red light, which at first led me to believe that it was a plane. If it was a plane, it was motionless. I considered it a helicopter, but it was twice as large as the building it was over. I&apos;ve seen Sikorsky Skycrane helos before, and this wasn&apos;t one of them. Besides, the make a terrible racket in low hover. We had stopped our van, and all five of us watched in awe...not quite believing what it could be. I am the type who is open minded but still requires proof. We returned to the salida (exit) where we saw the OVNI (UFO) the following day. We then observed that there were powerlines where we saw the OVNI hovering. The industrial park where we witnessed the OVNI, there are many high-tension wires. Not being a UFO-ologist, I have a few questions: are UFOs commonly seen near powerlines? Why? I would like very much to ask an expert if this type of UFO (cross-shaped) is common. When I usually think of UFOs, I think a saucer-shaped type craft. This was the strangest thing I&apos;ve ever seen, and the 4 other people present in the vehicle. All of the witnesses were college-educated and despite the date, New Year&apos;s eve, no one had been drinking. I would appreciate some resources to come forward and let me know where I may find (preferably on the web, otherwise in book-form) further information on this cross-shaped UFO, and if its type has ever been spotted before, whether in Puerto Rico or elsewhere. Thank youI am a database analyst for a ISP in Connecticut. While I&apos;ve no objections to the release of my story, I do NOT want my name appended to the story. I have never seen anything like this and I&apos;d rather not risk any harassment. I drew and scanned what we saw, that is everyone present in the vehicle agreed that the object I drew was what we saw. Unfortunately, this was left in a wor document in Puerto Rico with a relative. As soon as I receive the Word document I had scanned the image into, I will forward that onto you if you wish. Thank you"

We were on a houseboat on lake shasta viewing the north westerly star that flickers a lot and is one of the brighter stars when shooting up off the horizon was a star like object moving at an incredible speed. We both had binoculars and stated to each other wow what is that as we followed it. Once it became almost straight up from N/W heading S/E another object just as fast came from the east heading due west. My friend followed it and I removed my binoculars to see if the ob- ject heading S/E could be viewed with the naked eye which it could not so I captured it again with the binoculars until it went out of sight. According to the docudrama asteroids there are quite a few asteroids orbiting the earth so I wasn&apos;t to sure if I should even list this one. However I&apos;ve never seen anything like this before moving at the speed that it was so here it is. Thx for existing.

I was so engrossed I missed the offramp for the 8 West frwy, I pulled off the freeway at the next availble exit and turned into a parks parking lot, I exited my car and noticed that one of the craft was going to fly directly over me. it was aprox. 800ft. up in the air and seemed to be at least 100yards long. it was T-shaped with the cross of the T at aft. it had Nav lights, however a blue and a yellow light were part of the configuration of Nav lights.

Suddenly a bright green light appeared on the crafts left side, and shot off in front of the craft, leaving a green trail behind it. The craft contined south towards Mission Valley joined up with the others and headed S.E. towards Spring Valley and Lemon Grove. I headed back to my friends house, where I was staying, I reported the incident to him and he asked &quot;what have you been smoking?&quot;  I told him I had a couple of beers while visiting with another friend, but that I was in full control of my senses. The following morning we were reading the paper over breakfast and he told me that the San Diego Union -Tribune was reporting that people had seen lights in the sky the prior night, so I know that what I saw others saw. However, I have never seen an explanation and have never spoken to another person who saw what I saw that night. At the time I was 31 years old and I am a travel executive. I am college educated, an avid reader, and somewhat of an amatuer scientist.

My dad felt it too.  So did my best friend who is a non-believer.  She was in shock.  The object was a cross between a cigar and a cylinder.  It had a red tip and the rest of it was a periwinkle blue color.  It was omiting a vapor like exhaust and had port hole windows that had a warm whte glow illuminating from them.  I looked at it for a good eight or nine minutes.  Another plane began approaching it from the north.  the craft dropped a severe amount of altitude and took off at a tremendous rate of speed.

The first triangle emmited a beam or a streak of light from the side of the craft and aimed it toward the other craft.  This light was a blueish in color and seemed to change with the movement of the other craft.  All of a sudden the second craft emitted a beam of its own, at that moment there appeared to be another object in the sky coming in close to them.  I could identify that it was indeed an airplane of some sort because of the red,blue, and white lights in a cross configuration.  When the two triangle objects noticed the third, the two triangles shot strait up in the sky then zig-zagged until they met up with a bigger triangle object that seemed to be sitting in the ladle of the big dipper.  The bigger object shot straight up and just disappeared.  The airplane left to the south, toward the Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs.

Object on left of formation also faded similarly, but a minute or so after first. Individual objects were very similar in shape to those captured on video tape over Phoenix, AZ in 1997.

I was outside one early a.m. approximately 3:00 A.M., there were no clouds in the sky.  I was loading my car with Work Supplies.  I noticed that long streaks of light (that put me in mind of instant &quot;Icicle Like&quot; Streaks that were suddenly appearing all over the sky, they filled up the sky and then seem to be forming clouds.

After finally convincing my husband of the bizzarness of this, he agreed that we should to take a drive out and away from the city lights to obeserve.  So, the following A.M., we saw more of the same thing, HOWEVER... in between these clouds, were hovering white lights (posing as stars) that seemed to be hiding behind these clouds.  They moved back and forth, Up and Down. It seemed like whenever we would point them out to each other or notice them, they would move behind a cloud for cover.  We observed at least, 10-15 &quot;At A Time&quot;.

It moved this way until it found a cloud to hide behind.  The reason I say this, is because, when it popped out again, it wasn&apos;t moving sporadically.  Until, what seemed, it realized it was revealed, then there it went again, &quot;All Over the Place Again&quot;, then disappeared behind the clouds.  We were so freaked out, being that we were out in the middle of a secluded area,and then also realizing that these objects were not far away from us at all.

Color of aircraft silver.Driving north on I69 just before exit 67 the craft first looked like a  dot reflecting in the sun (thought to my self, boy that airplane sure could be mistaken for a flying saucer). Then, as it neared it appeared to be a triangle rapidly desending directly toward me from the front of the car a little less then 10 oclock high. I could not believe my eyes. When it was about 2-1/2 inches wide at arms length it suddenly rotated 45 degrees counter clockwise in less the a second and kind of skidded or suddered in the air and changed direction so it was moving to my left and still desending. I think it was moving about 100-150 mph. At this time I could see there was a long pole about 2/3 the length of the craft sticking out the front of the craft with a small wing near it&apos;s end. A small ball a (1 to 3 feet) was at the end of the pole. I believe the small wing was used to rapidly change the direction of the craft when it &quot;skidded&quot; in the air. I believe this craft was a man made craft, NOT a flying saucer. The way it moved it must be a new design. I have never seen anything like it before. I think it was about the size of a fighter plane. It looked like it was made of aircraft metal. As it moved off to my left I was able to see it from my side window and its view was momentarily blocked by some trees I was passing. I then saw it for a few seconds before it became to low to view. Just after it passed from view I saw a light aircraft desending along the same path to my left so I guessed they both were headed for the Anderson Airport? I saw only the bottom and the rear of the craft. I saw no engine and no exchust and no landing gear. Please let me know if you have any infomation about this craft. Thanks"

Flying objects sighted for many days anad then they stopped. what proof do I have. very little. But here goes the old story(real), Cannon AFB had just installed floodlight poles around the flightline, it greatly assisted maintenance on the F-111D&apos;s at night. It lit up the flilghtline nicely for us, the ones who had to work in the dark to fix these jets. About that time the sightings started. I did not get to personnaly see them, dumb me, I didn&apos;t put out the effort to go out and see them, because they sounded so common of an experience, at that time. This is the main meat of the story, short and to the (dull) point. Additional information to assist in verification of my statement. I haven&apos;t dug into my old papers to prove this date to within one week. But the base paper &quot;Mach Meter&quot;  if you get an old copy carried the news about the lights being installed. next (if I remember as correct as possible) that the local news paper from Clovis New Mexico (near the Texas border, near lobbuck texas) ran a story about the UFS&apos;s seen in the night time sky. The rough year 1975-1976. My guess is that the visitors were interested in this big bright spot that reciently appeared on this planet. This is my guess. The base and town newspaper could be researched to verify the exact dates. Now to add some info that may seem to push the boundry some. Susposidely (I got from talking with others (crew chief-OMS)) that Blue section had launched a few sorties after the fly day had finished. I don&apos;t remember the quanity, about 3 to 6 jets, were launched LATE in the day/evening, or night if you wish, that is strange, ok, but another item being that at that particular time frame, blue section was the only jets that were capeable/fully functional (FMC) of firing their gun. ?? that is strange also.

Red lights and yellow lights.We were travelling on our usual route home from a practice at 9:30 pm. As we approached the Shell gas station on Rt. 22 in Bedford I noticed a row of red lights above the station. Hmm, I never noticed a bunch of wires or something with lights there before, I thought to myself. Suddenly I noticed the lights were moving. (The sky was very dark, so at this point all I saw were the lights.) &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot; I blurted out to my child.  We turned the corner at the Shell station onto route 172 and I opened my window and kept driving and asked my daughter to keep watching it as it was now still on the drivers side but sort of traveling with my car.  I dont recall any other cars around us.  I opened my window to try to see it better and hear it.  The next thing I said was, &quot;The thing is HUGE!&quot; It was more of a feeling because I couldnt see it clearly. (It must have been black.) The shape was more implied than seen--triangular or possibly boomerang shaped, but very straight lines. There was absolutely no sound at all. I couldn&apos;t believe something could fly and be that quiet.  I kept thinking of some kind of &quot;glider.&quot;  Anyway, we drove along and it passed overhead and now it was on my right hand side. I finally stopped the car because it kept going to the north and I wanted to get a look at it, but it disappeared (downwards) behind the tree or brushline just before the highway (Rt.684).  When I first saw it I thought about the fact  that the Westchester Co. airport was only about ten miles away in the direction it was coming from, but I&apos;ve never seen anything like that from an airport.  My daughter and I went home and drew pictures of it (separately) to show our family. I never reported it to anyone, but I have recently heard a couple people describe the exact same thing......We were not frightened, just interested, and when the thing was going out of our sight we could see yellow lights as well as red.

I saw no lights at first.  It was behind a stand of trees that had been planted for wind block.We left our friends house off 188th/116th in Renton at 1:00 Am.  I Checked the time before we left.  As we were traveling along 148th (Lake Youngs Road) southwards  we had just gone past 224th,   It was a cold clear night, moonless, I was leaning my head against the door glass watching the stars when I saw the object.  At first I thought it was a reflection on the glass because the image was faint.  I had my husband turn off the interrior lights and it was still there.  I couldn&apos;t hear anything so I had him turn off the radio. I rolled down the window.   It wasn&apos;t making any sound at all.  It was staying with us as we drove along.  My husband never saw it because of it&apos;s angle to the roof of the car.  I wouldn&apos;t have seen it myself if I hadn&apos;t been leaning against the window looking straight up.  When we came the stop sign where 148th crosses 240th street I watched the object go on over the hill.  In 1974 there were no houses up there.  I heaved a sigh of reliefe because this really spooked me.  Then as we were coming up on the stop sign at 256th a light caught my attention.  It was the object again.  This time coming at us head on about 30 feef off the ground.  We were stopped at the stop sign at this point and I paniced because at the nose of the object was what appeared a wide wind screen, with phosphorus green light emitting with the shape of a  humanoid in the middle.  I screamed at my husband to get us out of there.  He took off with tires screaming,  I lost my memory of the trip home from this point.  The next thing I remember is coming up on the stop sign at highway 18 on Wax Road.  I am completely calm, not worried or anxious.  We arrived home about 5 minutes later.  I took our baby son into his room and put him to bed and then took myself to our room.  The clock on the side of the bed said 3:18 A.M.  This trip we took from our friends home would take 20 minutes any day of the week, day or night.  We had lost 2 hours.  But I managed to convince myself that I must have read the clock wrong before! we left Renton.  I didn&apos;t know anything about UFO&apos;s or their characteristics at the time and it was easy to write off as just a strange incident in our lives.  After I filed my previous report (9/6/97 incident) I was just browsing your sight.  I read the report of the UFO Flap of 73, the Coyne Hellicopter Incident on 10/18 73 and  just freaked when I read the discription of the object.  It sounds so much like the object I saw on that cold January night.  I asked in my last report for someone to call me.  Now I really need to talk to someone."

I asked him to come take a look. We both watched for about 10 mins. Green and red object started moving at this time. I went in and got my 7x35 binoculars. We were then joined by the neighbor&apos;s Mom and 15 yr old sister. We all watched this red and green object move. A little zig-zag, some up and down motion. It shot off several times and winked out, only to reappear in the spot it winked out from. In the binoculars it looked like a red and green ring, like a wedding band with a yellow white spot like a diamond on a wedding ring. It was turning. I sent for my wife son and daughter to come out. Now there were 7 of us watching. The red and green object shot off beams of light several times. Keep in mind these are objects are miles away so everything looks pretty small, the beams were distinguisable, but not real intensely bright. About 21:15 we started looking in other areas in the sky and spotted 6-8 other moving objects. I looked at several through the binoculars. Looked like the edge of a ring. Dull yellow to tan color, not real bright. About 21:20 the bright white object I thought was Jupiter, suddenly shot to the North and winked out while in motion. It did not reappear.

Cassiopea was still very clearly visible on a pre-dawn blue as it is a bright constellation. Between the North Star and constellation Cassiopea, 2 round objects of apparent size of about a penny at 20 feet &apos;faded-in&apos; view as if coming from a higher altitude and coming down low enough not to be masked by the blue of the sky. The fade-in effect lasted about a second. It looked like something coming out af a fog. There seemed to be no self illumination. The color of the two UFOs could have been the reflection of the dawn Sun on a dull metallic surface. Hard to tell, apparent size was small. The color did not look even, sort of brighter in the center and brownish orange outside. Again this is more of an impression, as the size was too small for objective description of surface features. The formation appeared unmoving at first, one object was higher in altitude angle by about 2 moon diameters, azimuth North East, moved as a formation about 40 moon diameters east (towards the approaching rising Sun, which at that altitude was probably already up) and faded-out in exactly the same fashion they had come in, although they faded-out while moving rapidly east and were unmoving at fade-in. About 5-7 seconds. I am an experienced observer as an amateur astronomer for 30 years, a pilot for a few years in my teens and a general observer of nature. I don&apos;t have perfect vision anymore, I have a slight astigmatism and I was wearing my glasses. I used to be a software engineer (without a finished degree) and I now study Physics at the University of Montreal (back to school, got to get that degree). I am a skeptic. Still am, but I used to feel comfortable. My field now is astronomical optics, and I know what a sun-dog looks like, a comet, Venus, flocks of birds, nebulae, a meteorite, a galaxy, an aurora, a weather baloon, Jupiter, an airplane at high, low and medium altitude in foggy or clear conditions from up there looking down or from down here looking up. In winter and in summer. I&apos;ve watched satellites go by hundreds of times, once even Soyouz in full sunlight, not penumbra as we are used to see orbiting satellites in, but if full sunlight; it glared many times brighter than Venus, quite a sight for all of 2 or 3 seconds. My point is that I am an observer, a good one, and a skeptic. This week is the beginning of spring and I saw flocks of Canada Geese, big birds, flying high enough for the birds to be the same size as the two UFO&apos;s of this report, and they flap, you see more flapping than bird actually, and even at that altitude you can hear them yak like a chikcken coop. The UFOs I saw this morning didn&apos;t yak or flap. This I am sure of: it was not two birds or weather ballons, planes or speeding bullets, helicopters, gyrocopters or Venuses. It was not any known human machine or animal. Which leaves unknown natural phenomena, ETs and SDI style research. ETs being the most unlikely of course. This is important: the movements suggested very low mass. An eerie &apos;easyness&apos; about the movements which does not match the apparent size at all is what is most bizarre. Like inertia is for others. They seemed to go about the sky as droplets of water on a very hot surface. At least that&apos;s the best comparaison I can make. If anybody is interested I can make a small movie on the computer, but after the exams, in May."

Their was a band of red lights circling the middle part of the saucer shaped object.  So I watched for a few minutes as it neared my house.  I expected that when it got nearer that I would hear a sound from the engine, believing at the time that it was a plane or helicopter. This strange object stopped just 100 feet short of my house and hovered there quietely.  At this point my sister came to see what I was yelling about.  She also saw this strange object and wondered what it was.  I quickly ran inside to get my telescope to get a clearer picture of what I was seeing.  AS I was struggling to get the tripod out the back door the object took off very fast making a beeline for the North West. I tried to follow it with my eyes running around the side of the house but it disappeared very quickly. The things that stood out: moved very fast, was very quite, and was in the shape of a round saucer with red lights.

We were traveling Route #10 through west Texas just outside of Pecos.  At mile marker #205 I sighted lights off over a field approximately 2 miles away.  The object had three lights on top, two red lights on the perimeters and one white light centered.  I told my wife to look and we watched for about two minutes when the object flew straight at our car.  The object gave the feeling that it just suddenly was there next to us.  It had banked showing us the underside, hovering over the median, then swooped over the car, righted itself and speed off behind us.  At that time we lost sight of it.  The underside displayed three small, dull, lights in a triangular form with two dull concentric circles of light.  The shape of the craft was generally batwinged with a central payload area.  The coloring seemed to be a deep slate grey, almost black, leaving a dark on dark image in the sky.  On the &quot;forward&quot; area of the payload area there was a half moon cut out with two pointed &quot;antenna&quot;.  It made no sound and no exhaust.

Date above is approx, to be best of my recollection. Began as one light coming on, then 2nd, then 3rd. Approx position half mile northeast of Keweenaw Waterway upper entrance (near F.J. McLain State Park, if it&apos;s still there).Could not tell if it was one object or three separate. We turned off the car and got out. There was absolutely no sound or movement, and it was still, clear night. I flicked on the headlights and went from low to high beam and turned them off. Within 5 seconds the object&apos;s center light went out for about 10 seconds then came back on. We&apos;d been observing it for over 5 minutes at this point. Spooked, we got back in the car, started it and watched another full minute as the object&apos;s lights extinguished individually. We could not make out any shape(s) but were convinced beyond any doubt that what we had seen was unconventional, to say the least. I&apos;d like to know if any similar sightings have been reported. Although this happened a long time ago it kind of haunts me and I know I&apos;ll never forget it. Have there been sightings involving 3 bright lights, especially near Lake Superior? To cap off the sighting, we returned to the Coast Guard station where I called an Air Force installation (radar, I believe) which to my recollection was north of Calumet going toward Copper Harbor. Don&apos;t know if it&apos;s still there. I told the officer on duty I was with the Coast Guard and asked if they&apos;d picked up anything on radar in the area I described to him but he wouldn&apos;t tell me anything, either yes or no.

They moved slightly to the left in unison and blinked out. We stopped our vehicles and the lights suddenly reappeared  about 30 degrees to the left of their original location. Now the lights were closer together, more like two very bright auto headlights. Only they were yellowish orange. The color of sodium street lights. In fact that&apos;s what they reminded me of. We observed them in this position for several minutes then they began to dim then return to their original brightness. They went and reappared about a minute later about 30 degrees to the east. Then the left light slowly descended and went out. The other light remained in the sky for several minutes and then dimmed and went out. First observed at about 2150hrs. Last observed about 2215 hrs EST. Observed almost continuously for about one half hour. I worked at TRW for 11 years in their aerospace program. I have witnessed many launches from Cape Kennedy. These were not missles. They were very bright lights that moved independently,   were as bright as flares and the same color. Most of the time they were stationary in the sky. They didn&apos;t move in unison but when they  reappeared  they would be together in the same part of the sky. Sometimes one would blink out before the other and then when they reappeared one would blink on before the other."

The total formation as discribed in the above summary followed the movement of the observer which was quiet scary because the observer was going back and forth to the car not really knowing where to go while the formation followed the observer&apos;s movement. After entering the house the observer went on the balcony to check whether the object was still around. The formation was indeed there right over the house. The distance was hard to judge but moving clouds were sometimes covering the formation. The outer cirle had at least a diameter of double armlength and the individual white spots had appr. the size of a full moon. The next circle of white spots had appr. half size of the outer one.  The centre circle comprised 4 spots close to each other. The whole formation was rotating like a rolling wheel to the right - stopped after one full circle rotation and was than rotating to the left.

19981108,19981116,"Los Angeles (Downtown), CA",fireball,3-5 seconds,"a spectacular fireball moving horizontally from south to northeast.. approx. the same height as the regular helicopters and small aircraft.. suddenly and silently whizzed by my 12th floor condo. unit as I was sitting on the balcony. In full view.. above the high rise buildings in Downtown L.A. suddenly leaving a trail as if breaking up.. and then it completely disappeared as if it vaporized.About this time last week (Sunday, November 8).. as I was sitting on my balcony enjoying my pipe &apos;n quiet time.. that a most unusual event took place. (By the way.. it&apos;s good Black Cavendish tobacco.. not pot! I work as a Counselor for one of the comprehensive LAUSD high schools. And unlike Bill.. I truly never have inhaled! My brothers smoked enough for all of us.) Anyway.. I live in the heart of the city of Los Angeles with the high rise buildings framing my living room view in an exquiste panoramic style. Having lived in Downtown for several years, now.. I have grown accostumed to the several single and twin engine airplanes as well as police, News media.. and corporate helicopters that often circle round both day and night.. the several city blocks that make up Downtown. Suddenly.. and speeding through the night sky from a southern horizontal direction.. (I would say whizzing.. but it was absolutely noiseless.. there was no sound..) came a ball of fire.. approximately 2 stories high and perfectly round.. as I compared this irregular sight with the high rise buildings. This object was heading somewhat north (northeast). It definitely was NOT not a shooting star nor comet.. heading in even the slightest downward vertical direction. It was not the Moon. It was not birds. It wasn&apos;t even Superman. My first, startled.. and only impression was: &quot;Lord God?!&quot; thinking that it could have crashed into any of these buildings just as in any of those recent blockbuster movies. This fireball appeared no further than 3/4th of a mile away.. and traveled not much more than a mile from my home. The entire event was always visable. Perfectly framed by two tall buildings.. the event ended seconds later.. perhaps, directly above the Union Station (I was a MetroLink communter to Chatsworth for an entire year.. and am aware of nearby locations).  And though my estimation of height is terribly inaccurate.. I would guess.. it was the typical and same altitude that all small aircraft fly.. here in the Downtown area.  Within split seconds.. this enormously silent ball was leaving a &quot;skid mark&quot; in its wake.. before it fully vaporized and disappeared. It was moving with the silence and speed of a missle.. but there was no explosion. Well, I sat for perhaps twenty minutes to a half hour in amazement and complete disbelief as I struggled to reconstruct and understand the all too brief and all too unusual sight. In addition, I was hoping to see if some police helicopter or airplane would be in the air.. checking out the strange anomaly. Beyond that.. I saw nothing.. and heard nothing reported in the News this entire week."

As I kept looking, I thought I saw red as well as white.  The only binoculars I have are a small folding pair, but I got them out.  I saw an irregular bright, white light.  In the center was the most beautiful red I have ever seen in my life--like deep crimson crushed velvet.  I don&apos;t know why but I couln&apos;t take my eyes off that red.  I was just totally fascinated by it.  The red was an irregular shape too.  I watched it for about 50 minutes.  After a while, I realized that it was moving at about the same rate that the stars were moving.  But it was not a star.  It was at least 10 times brighter than any star I have seen and bigger.  It was a larger than Hale-Bopp looked with the naked eye.  Also, I have checked every night since and there is nothing in that area of the sky that even resembles what I saw.  It was at about a 45 degree angle.  I stopped watching when it went behind the trees in back of my house. I understand that sometimes you can see satellites with the naked eye.  I have never seen one.  I suppose this could be one, but I have never heard anyone say they could see a satellite from inside their house with all the lights on.

My mother worked late at night ,as she was divorced, and was due to return home soon. We were up on the roof and decided to go back in the house so as not to be caught out so late at night. We packed up our equiptment and started heading down when we were startled by a very large &quot;cigar&quot; shaped metalic craft hovering about 100 yards away from us. (The craft appeared to be cigar-shaped but could have been a disc seen side-ways.) The craft looked like it was made of un-painted metal with no markings of any kind. It actually looked like a medium sized submarine hovering in the sky with no wings, fins or propellars. It had redish and blue-green lights that went on and off in rotating motion. What startled us most about it is that it was completely silent; made no noise except for a faint metalic clanging noise. My youngest brother began to cry. It moved along slowly at about 3-5 miles per hour for several minutes and then shot straight up into space and disappeared in a split second (Speed was definately more than 100 miles per hour!). I remembered looking at my watch and it was 2:30AM when we first sighted the object. The event seemed to last only 3-5 minutes, but when it was over, I looked at my watch again and it was 4:00AM. To this day I&apos;m not sure whether we experienced lost time or whether the object caused my watch to move ahead. Every night after that, we ventured back up on the roof of our house to try to see the object again. On the second night after that, (which would be the 12th), as we were climbing the house to the roof-top, we saw two V-formations of about 6 or 7 objects in each formation shoot from horizon to horizon in what can only be described as &quot;a blink of an eye&quot;. They were traveling at such a tremendous speed we could not make out their shape or exact number. We alll cried out, &quot;Woww!!

The object moved North slowly for a couple of minutes, passing in front of a small cloud for a good silhouette view, then stopped and reversed course, maintaining the same speed, and continued, as though it was looking at [or searching for] something.

(small range orbitals.). Sometimes it would move in a linear fashion when vibrating. It would then stop all movement and remain still. Then movement would start up again. The object seemed to remain at the same level off of the horizon, but moving south over the time we watched it. We reported this to the NY State Police (Name deleted) at the time we were observing it. The next day I reported it to the Cornell Astronomy Dept. (I was an Cornell employee and student at the time). The irony of this event is that a few weeks before witnessing this event, this same time of UFO sighting was broadcast on Unsolved Mysteries. The show also featured video tapes. These sightings occured that same year most of which happened down south. I think the show focused on the crafts that were sighted in one of the southern states. I could be wrong about the year, it could have been 1993 that we saw this, but you can verify the year by contacting the TV show Unsolved Mysteries or your own archives have probably cataloged those same sightings. I am sure this happened in fall, a few weeks after that particular show was run.  The following night both my parents and I observed the same object in the same area. I know this is outdated material but it may help."

It was a white light, very bright, partially illuminating the rest of the craft.  it blinked in a cadence varying from one to five beats.  There was no noticable pattern to the cadence.The cadence seemed to speed up when the craft was moving.  The craft moved from up to down then to the right, not very far, and repeated the process.  I was waliking my dogs.  They pulled me out of view of the object for a minute; when I returned to my original sight, it was gone."
19950501,19981105,"Sun Prairie, WI",cross,2 minutes,"Apparent cross shaped object seen in sky near Madison, Wisconsin.I&apos;m not exactly sure on the date of this &apos;encounter,&apos; as many years have past and my memory is not as presice as it once was.  But to the best of my knowledge, it was an early summer night, probably April-June of 1995, I was on my way to a store, on the back roads of Sun Prairie.  I was at stop sign with a road to the left, HWY C, and my road continuing straight to HWY 151.  I saw an object hovering towards me, off to my left, very slowly with no sound.  As it got closer, it almost seemed to hover above the telephone lines, how high, I&apos;m not sure.  It had a cross-like appearance, I can only say this because of the 4 directional lights I saw in a cross shape, it was too dark to see an actual outline of the object itself.  I also believe there to be a circular red light on the bottom - center of the object.  To my immediate left was a corn field.  After observing the object for a short time, perhaps a minute or two, I turned left and slowly started to leave, as I began moving, the object did as well.  It moved off in a NW direction, I believe, away from me and into the cornfield, apparently getting higher as it went.  Before I knew it, it was gone.  I didn&apos;t see any fast take off or anything of the sort it just sort of..  slowly disappeared into the night.  I had never seen nor heard of anything even remotely close to this, until stumbling upon this site.  I had this form filled out once, and backed out of submitting it, and continued browsing.. I found another sighting, in Puerto Rico, if I remember correctly, that was frighteningly similar.. so frightening in fact, I&apos;ve yet slept tonight. :P  In any case, that really pushed me to go ahead and submit this.. &apos;sighting.&apos;  I&apos;m also going to e-mail a very rough computer graphic I made of the, again, rough shape I believe I saw.

19670903,19980702,"Crestone (near Alamosa), CO",fireball,30 seconds,"Saw 3 house size balls of fire come straight down, turn to fly horizontal straight at us for 40 miles in 3-4 seconds then pass out of sight.  Large number of police saw 3 objects within an hour of our sighting but on the other side of mountain that they disappeared over.  Intercepter aircraft attempted to engage.  See below.Sometime around this time,  (1966-1969)...It may very well have been Labor Day Weekend in Sep 1967, I was camping near Crestone, Colorado with several cousins.  It is 40 miles north of Alamosa.  We had just watched the sunset and could just see the other side of the valley to the west.  We all saw the same thing.  I saw it first.  It looked like a very large meteor was about to hit the other side of the valley.  I got everyone&apos;s attention as the object got closer.  It was a ball of fire coming down from space.  At around 30,000 feet, it split into three balls of fire.  At that point our mutual reaction was that it was a mirved missile hitting the western range of mountains surrounding the valley.  We started to take cover behind a very large boulder when the three objects made a 90 degree turn and came across the valley straight at us.  Our thoughts later were that they were intelligent and had detected us watching and decided to buzz us.  They took approximately 5 seconds to cross the 40 mile wide valley flying perfectly horizontal and in a 3 abreast formation with one slightly ahead of the one on either side.  We were at about 9000 feet on the side of the 14,000 foot Crestone Mountain range.  The three objects were trailing several thousand feet of sparks (?) and looked like they would pass just overhead and hit the mountains behind us.  We rushed to the other side of the boulder and took cover, but the three objects disappeared over the mountains peaks to the east.  We stood around in silence for a few moments and then started asking each other what we saw.  We were all recent college graduates.  I  was leaving for Air Force Officer&apos;s Training School on the 13th of September and then going to Pilot school, so it very well could have been September 1967 right before I left. We decided that it could not have been UFO&apos;s or anything in the Human inventory, but we still were thinking (hoping) meteors.  We had all expected a huge impact explosion and minor earthquakes when they surely hit on the other side of the mountain range, but felt and saw nothing.  The three objects had made a roaring noise that had drowned out attempts to yell at each other until the silence after the passage. The next day we went down to the Crestone trading post to buy a newspaper, but there was nothing in the paper.  We telephoned the Alamosa Sheriff&apos;s office and asked about large meteor impacts or UFO reports...nothing.  The next morning, we bought another paper and discovered that less than an hour after our sighting the Colorado Prison on the east side of the Crestone Mountains had seen three lights hovering around the prison.  The Colorado Highway Patrol and local police had chased the lights around for over two hours while the off duty guards were recalled to duty in case of a helicopter prison break.  Nearly 300 police saw the lights that night.  Finally, the Colorado Highway Patrol called Petersen AFB to check for radar images and the base reported positively and at the request of the Colorado Highway Patrol launched two F106 intercepters.  The Air Force thought they were police helicopters patroling around the prison or looking for escapees and didn&apos;t know the lights were being chased by the police for two hours.  The pilots had the images on radar shortly after takeoff and were closing fast.  The lead pilot asked for permission to fire weapons and while waiting, the radar images and the 3 lights went straight up accelerating far faster than an air to air missile could have flown.  The weapons release was never given to the pilots who had attempted to follow them until their F106&apos;s could climb no higher and the objects went out of sight straight up into space.  We all purchased copies of the newspaper to keep forever, but none of us have ever been able to find those newspapers or any other record of the incident.  One of these days after I retire and have lots of time, I would like to find the old newspaper files. None of us have ever taken drugs or had enough alcohol to impact our judgement even though we are all over 50 now.  In fact one of the cousins does not even drink coffee because it is a stimulant.  If you have any records of the incident I would gladly pay for copies.    It would be nice to have the hard copy documentation for my own satisfaction.  I&apos;m sure my cousins that were there would also like to have copies of their own.  I have a security clearance and still work for the US Air Force, one of the cousins is now a lawyer, and the other is an emergency inhalation therapist and ex-Green Beret.  This should be well documented because of the number of people that saw the lights near the prison and the newspaper article.((Number deleted))"
19980724,19980724,"Portland, ME",other,10 SECONDS,"As I looked to the northern sky as I stepped from my car, I looked up into a constellation of stars.  Soon thereafter, it was if one of the stars picked  up and travelled southward and then pulled a &apos;J&apos; hook towards the East.  The object was as tiny and appeared reddish in color.  The object moved at a steady pace across the sky.  It did not make a sound, nor leave any trail like a shooting star.  It travelled slower than a shooting star, and faster than a plane or helicopter, without any noise.The evening began with me discussing certain unexplained philosphical phenomena with two other people.  I took the angle of the scientific observer.  I wanted proof of the &apos;religious&apos; nature of the universe as the people I was talking to exclaimed to exist.  I have always had a week spot in me for the unexplained, but yet, I have never really experienced anything that strayed me from the scientific and the provable.  Yet tonight, as I came home, parked my car in the driveway, I looked up to a remarkably clear sky.  I focused on a constellation, I&apos;m not sure which, and, all of a sudden, a star like object began to move across the sky, starting in this constellation.  I watched it travel in my direction, although it was completely at a great distance.  It was if one of the stars just picked up and decided to move.  I watched it move across the sky at a fairly rapic pace without changing course.  Then it pulled a &apos;J&apos; manoever in the sky.  It began moving to the southeast and then the east and then partially toward the north.  It did not leave a trail in the evening sky nor did it make a sound as it travelled.  It did not blink like an airplane wing light.  It did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star, of which I&apos;ve seen thousands.  It was very deliberate yet quick across the sky.  I&apos;ve seen satellites which moved slower and continued on a straight line.  This object curved in a &apos;J&apos; motion.  I was cradled in my driveway by trees towards the southern end and it eventually disappeared behind the trees.  I wish I could say that I was under the influence but I wasn&apos;t.  The thing appeared and travelled like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and I spend a lot of time looking at the sky in Maine, where you receive more than the fair share of night time entertainment.  This wasn&apos;t what is ordinarily in my sky."

They were stationary for a few seconds, then dropped down maybe 10 degrees and then straight up and disappeared into the sky.  This all happened in a time span of less than 5 seconds.

A much smaller green/red light came off this main light and flew off toward Lena Point.  The green/red light came back, flew under the bright light and flew iradically over the airport area.  I watched this from 11:00PM to 12:30AM with my two children and we finally fell asleep.  At 11:30 I called my friend and she went down to a store called Deharts and watched this with some other people that were standing there.

19980626,19980809,"Trumann/Jonesboro, AR",other,1 hour 45 mins,"There was a full moon this night, so the shapes were very easy to make out. Circular, rectangle,,and diamond were the smaller ones. The  3 smaller crafts remained in their positions,hovering.  The 4th one, shaped &amp; the size  like the Stealth flew very low, tree top level.  It moved at a very high rate of speed, stop, and hover, make a 90* turn and move again.  Very bright flashes occured when it would stop, like a camera flash.  It flew over our car 2 times, but seemed most interested in the farmland and stock.  Arriving home we saw the same occurrance taking place over the western section of Jonesboro.  The smaller craft were moving this time. They would move straight up into sky, stop, turn, and fly back toward the ground.  This lasted approx. 45 mins.  Then a large light, like a giant headlight appeared in the sky and the smaller craft flew to it and disappeared.  The large light went out and 2 rows of lights could be seen. They were blinking without a pattern.  Then the large craft shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  Several people reported seeing the &quot;light&quot; show in the sky the next day.  I have seen things in the sky before that were unexplainable, but it was by far the most interesting and by far the most conviencingI have ever witnessed.Smaller crafts:  We could see their shapes due to the full moon.  One was like a ball shaped, had steady lights on the top, bottom and around the mid section.  The rectangle one, appeared to be the size of refrigater box, 1 blinking light on one end, it was the farest away from us.  The diamond or hexagon shaped one was closet, it was hovering, would spin in place, and had steady lights on several points and had one larger blinking light on the what we called the top.  They were in an area of approx. 3 acres of land.  We laughed at first sight, thinking the National Guard from Little Rock, AR probably were out with infra red camera trying to search out the pot crops, because the objects were hovering.  Then the larger one appeared out of no where!  It &apos;s shape was like the stealth bomber, almost bird like.  Flashing lights on the nose, tip of each wing, and 3 lights on the tail.  It flew faster than anything I have ever seen, stop on a dime, hover, turn, and take off again.  A very bright flash occurred each time it stopped.  This was in a rural area just off the Hwy. 63 in Trumann, AR.  My friend thought I was kidding at first, she then stopped the car and watched.  She couldn&apos;t believe what she was seeing.  We watched for approx. 20 mins.  We then started getting spooked and drove on to Jonesboro, AR, where I live.  This is approx. 15 miles away from the first sighting.  Upon arrival I told my husband what we saw.  Of course he laughed at us.  But after seeing our faces, he stopped.  We then went outside and we saw a very large light in the western sky, looked like a headlight on a train engine, very bright. It was approx. 2 miles west of my home and it hovered above the tree line for approx. 30 mins.  Then 4 sets of blinking lights appeared in the sky and one at a time flew to the large light.  Upon the arrival of the last one the large light turned off.  Then 2 rows of blinking lights appeared.  The lights were amber, white, red, blue, and blinked in no pattern, just ramdon.  Then boom, it shot staight up in the air to the heavens and disappeared.  I check through out the night and never did see anything else.

19970714,19980701,"Salt Lake City, UT",other,10 min.,"While on the roof of our 26 floor condominium building we saw what appeared to be a cloud or haze moving across the sky at about the same level as our location and about 3 blocks to the south.  After closer observation we realized it had a definate shape, ability to change direction and altitude at will, and was indescribable in any common description.My wife and I were sitting in the hot tub on the roof of our 26 floor condominium building in downtown Salt Lake City.  From this location there is a complete view of the Salt Lake valley.  I had noticed a small fire burning several miles to the west of the city.  Shortly thereafter, as I was looking to the south from our location,  I noticed what appeared to be a small cloud of smoke floating from west to east and about 3 blocks to the south at the same level as our position.  Initially I assumed it to be from the fire I had noticed earlier, until I realize the wind direction was the opposite of the direction of travel of what I assumed was smoke and also the fire was too small and too distant for the smoke to remain together for that distance.  I immediately directed my wifes attention to what I was witnessing, and we watched in total amazement for several minutes as the object navigated within an approximate 2 mile area.  The only way to describe the object is through relating it to other known objects.  When we first started observing it, the object seemed to be just an undulating mass, but as we watched it, we realized that it did in fact have a shape that remained consistent throughout the entire episode.  This shape and movement would relate perfectly to movies we have seen of large stingrays as they move through the water with their outstretched fins waving, similar to birds wings in slow motion  The strangest part of the episode was that the object was almost entirely invisible, and the only recognition that it was even there was that it distorted everything behind it so that you could in fact make out the shape by observing these distortions.  Again, to relate it to something familiar, it resembled the creature in the movie &quot;The Predator&quot;.  As we watched the object, it navigated in a very definate path, changing directions at will and traveling first from west to east, then to the south, then back to the west, then lowering in altitude close to a baseball stadium about a mile from our location,! then hovering at that spot for several minutes, then again rising in altitude and moving back to the west at a phenomonal speed until it totally disappeared.  This was all done with total disregard to wind speed or direction, which ruled out the cloud theory or the fact that it could be caused by a pocket of hot air which could have caused a mirage affect.  After it&apos;s disappearance, my wife and I remained stunned for several minutes just watching for it&apos;s return.  We then tryed to figure out what we had seen, since neither of us had said anything while we were watching it. Our descriptions to eachother afterwards confirmed that we had both seen the exact same phenomena and that it was nothing we had ever witnessed before or probably would ever again.  One of the things that we did realize was that it was our location that had made it possible to see it in the first place.  Had someone on the ground tryed to see it they  would not have been able to do so since it was only the distortions of the background objects that even made it possible to distinguish, and looking up against a blue sky would have made that impossible.  Whatever it was, I know it was not a heat distortion, or a cloud and that it was definately under some sort of guidance or control.  This event was very special to me since I have always been a believer in the possibility of many activities beyond our comprehension, but my wife has always thought that to be a rather ludicrous idea, until this event, which she still cannot explain or justify."

North to south.I was looking at the night sky when I observed a roughly triangular shaped object whose margins were unspecific. The &quot;object&quot; was transparent in the fact that I could see the bright stars of the Milky Way behind it. The night was quite clear and the star feild exceptionally sharp. As the object passed across my feild of vision the stars behind it tended to blur somewhat in comparison to the stars outside the margins of the &quot;object&quot;. There were no other visible lights except for the stars. The trajectory was from north to south. I am a Licensed Practical Nurse. I am a trained observer by profession.

It was an eye shaped[oval shape with 2 pointed ends] light that moved quickly, in a straight line, across the sky. It appeared out of clouds and disappeared into clouds. The second one appeared a couple of minutes later. It was the same shape but moved differently. It appeared out of the clouds and moved in a straight line then made a sharp turn then another. Finally it continued in a straightline and disappeared into the clouds. That was all! I tried to catch the whole thing on tape but it didn&apos;t work. All I got was a very quick look at a dot."

What we did see however was a circular light in an orangish color pulsing.  It was like several strong and bright orange colored flashlights being directed at the ground.  I have no idea how large the circle was because I didn&apos;t go outside to see it.  As abruptly as it had started it was gone.  The total duration of the light from the time we first noticed it to the time it vanished was approximatly 1:30, to 2 minutes.  Also my friend says that the light was also blueish to her.

My wife and I were traveling west bound on I-90 where the Wyoming and Montana border meet at approximately midnight.  We decided to set a goal of getting into Montana before stopping for the night, finding a motel room in a small town.  There were loads of deer crossing signs and we nearly hit one crossing the road.  Because of the lack of cars on the road we were able to switch to high beams so I was tunnel visioned, while driving,  to watch for deer on the road.  It was then that we noticed the solar flare stuff that was lighting up the sky that has been in the news lately.  We pulled over to the side of the road to look at the brilliant illuminating effect.  We totally shut the lights off and stood looking up at it amazed.  We got back in the car and I wanted to continue looking at the shimmer of white light.  The only place I could do that was behind me over my left shoulder.  It was then that I noticed a quarter sized perfect circle cutting out one of the shimmering flare areas in the sky.  I looked at it several times.  Then I looked forward and noticed in the upper right hand corner of the wind shield a dark well defined disk shaped object.  I said to my wife &quot;You will think I am crazy if I tell you what I see&quot; and she joked that it must be a UFO.  I said I  think so and asked her if she saw the object.  She said she did and she continued to watch it.  She said it was moving and I meantime was looking at two and sometimes three directly ahead of us.  The third of those objects kept collapsing in on itself.  There were no lights on any of them.  They were not clouds, as the sky was perfectly clear.  The quarter sized circle thing had vanished but directly out my driver side window was a long very large cigar shaped object - dark but very clearly defined.  Sometimes it was rectangular and sometimes triangular.  Very clearly defined but dark.  Then that object became more abstract in shape. In the upper left hand corner of the windshield appeared a large object saucer shaped with a raised area in the middle.  It appeared to have at least one porthole type feature.  It stayed in that position for what seemd like 10-15 minutes as we drove along.  We were both scared crazy but kept driving at 65 mph.  The object stayed in what seemd a fixed position in the upper left hand corner of the windshield and the shimmering light quality of the flare effect revealed sort of a greyish color to the object.  All at once a long line of blackish linked wing like things, seemingly all linked together, moved closer and closer and seemed like they were almost at the end of the car hood and then vanished.  Then everything was gone. The next day I woke up and my eyes were burning and very, very bloodshot."

It was a black triangle craft that had a very strange yellowish haze around it that seemed to be hipmotizing.  A plane was flying overhead and the craft seemed to be approximately 3,000 feet above the plane. It moved in a very odd way. It bobbed up and down like an eagle which is what I thought it was at first. Then the craft stopped very suddenly and just hovered over a mountain. I had my other witness look at it and she could not explain it either. I watched it for the duration time possible. It hovered then I went behind a mountain and could not see it any longer."

My wife and I were watching television on Friday night.  My wife said she thought she saw lightning in the sky.  I did&apos;t think much of it until I turned the TV set off and with the room being darker, I saw a flash myself.  I didn&apos;t see it directly, because a building next door was blocking it.  I kept looking and seconds later, there were many flashes across the eastern portion of the sky, but they were colored!  I had never seen anything like it.  The display was so remarkable, that I was literally shaking with fear.  I called my wife back to the window and she observed several flashes with me.  Some were low enough that they silhouetted the I-5 bridge before us.  It had the appearance of fireworks being obscured by clouds, except for the fact that it covered a far too great portion of the sky. From our vantage point, we can see directly to the east, and a bit to the north, with limited views to the south due to buildings close by.  At least one flash appeared to have structure to it, almost like a laser beam.  But again, this display covered a VERY large portion of the sky.  After about ten minutes the flashes stopped.  I spoke with my neighbor and he and his housemate saw them as well.  I was so taken by the experience that I called the police to report it as it was happening.  They reported some transformers were exploding, but nothing that matched what I saw.  I work at NOAA, and spoke to a meteorologist about it, and he could not offer an explanation either.  I&apos;ll never forget what I saw.  It was spectacular. Thank you."

It was only in the clouds for a matter of 30 seconds maybe a little longer and then when I went to make sure I was not getting too close to the car in front of me, it vanished.

19760625,19981128,"Phoenix, AZ",disk,1 1/2 hrs.,"viewed saucer manuveurs and air force search for extended period of time from close rangeMy friend and I were attending a drive-in movie in central Phoenix, AZ around the bicentennial time. We saw a disk-shaped object come quite close to us. It was noiseless and hovered off to my left (I was on the passenger side of the car). At one point it started to descend and that is when the shape became apparent. It had a row of very bright white lights that revolved (or the ship did, this was unclear) which it turned on an off a few times. There was a (either blue or green, I believe green) stationary light on the top which stayed on at all times. After descending it went back to approximately its original position.This viewing lasted around 15-20 minutes. Then the craft moved off to the south very fast and stopped. I could only see the lights at this point. An air force jet came from west toward the craft and turned and went back. Then a jet came from the east and did the same. The two more jets came from other sides, one at a time, and turned away. Then a jet came from the west side again only it came closer to the craft than the others had. Immediately the craft moved incredibly fast to the east side of Phoenix. The jet followed, at a slower speed. Then the craft turned to the south slowly with the jet in pursuit. At this point all the white lights on the craft went out. Immediately the lights on the jet went out. They moved to the south . I could only see the blinking of the light on the top of the craft. When they got to south Phoenix the craft was no longer visible to me. I believe the jets lost it also. For the remainder of the movie (which was around 2 hours long the jets combed the south area. The sky was clear. The weather nice. I am bad with measurements but I believe the craft was about two blocks away and approximately 100 feet in diameter. The craft could hover, move incredibly fast, was noiseless, revolved (I believe), and the white lights were very bright. I am unsure of the color of the object as the lights were very bright but it also didn&apos;t seem to have a color as such. My friend saw it and was afraid it was going to land and didn&apos;t watch much of it. At one point I got out of the car to not only get a better look but hoped to attract attention to it. I mentioned to a couple in the next car but they did not seem interested. There were no reports in the paper or news. I did hear of a man (through friends) who saw it also across town but did not know him or get a name. I was 19 years old at the time and did not know the correct way to report this. Also my memory has faded to exact date and color of light on top of craft. But the rest is quite clear. I remember the movie name and hoped to check the running dates for the movie but I am sure the drive-in is closed by now. I am interested in finding more information about this sighting, if possible. I cannot be contacted collect by phone, as I do not have long distance service but would appreciate any info on this."

I looked towards the SSW direction and noticed a bright pinpoint of light in a straight line heading NNW above the Big Dipper, which was plain to see.

We were watching a metorite shower since this is one of the best times to view one all year long, (being usually the first week in August of every year).  Anyway, we live near the U.S. Army&apos;s traing base of Ft. Rucker and that night and many other nights had witnessed numerous rotary wing and fixed winged crafts.  We had seen what we though that night to even be a satellite or two ,--  but anyway back to the story we knew what we were looking at and the Northeast corner of the sky is where our attention was that particular night. My Son , 12 years old at the time was the first to see &quot;it&quot;, he said &quot;look at that - pointed to almost the same place of the meteor shower, and what we saw was a perfectly round dark/black object with maybe some sort of illumnination shing up above the craft.  It was moving basically North to South and we witnessed it for maybe five seconds.  The size of the object was approximately the size of a silver dollar or say maybe if you make the O.K. size with you your hand the circle your create is close to the size. We noticed no noise and after it left our field of view we all felt like we had witnessed something very unusual.  My 13 year old Daughter was witness to this also. What makes this very unusual, if that is the correct word, is that I was talking to a coworker - was was also out looking at the metorite showers that week and I was telling him about what we saw on Tuesday night of that week and he said his Son had said to him on Thursday Night of that week &quot;Dad you will not believe what I just saw ? It looked like a Dark Circle going East to West&quot;.  Well when my friend told me that it solidified my thougts that we had indeed seen something very unusual that could not be ex explained and would definitely fall into the catagory  of a U.F.O. . All I ask is -- I sincerely want to find out if anyone has any idea of what we witnessed .???  Please notify me ??? I have tried to contact MUFON and report this to them and all the sent me was a membership form -- get real -- no wonder people do not report these sort of things.

The sighting lasted for about a minute.A friend and I were traveling back to college from her home in Gainsville Georgia, we were talking on the carphone.  We both saw the green light come from the northeastern part of the sky and move to the southwestern part of the sky.  She hung-up on the person we were talking to and we looked at each other and asked &quot;did you see that?&quot;.  The light was traveling fast, but not as fast as a falling star.  It had a more &apos;determined&apos; movement to it.  It was green in color and just looked like a ball of light.  It had not really a tail, but the color made a streak in the sky, like when you take a bright light and wave it in front of your eyes.  It leaves kind of an imprint.  After we saw this and made sure that we both saw the same thing we hurried back to school and asked our friends if they had seen anything wierd...they said no."

All of a sudden a bright ball of white light lit up the sky in front of us. It was approximately 100 feet over tree-top level. Comparitively, the UFO was about the size of a baseball in the sky. It then travelled quickly from a west to east direction at high speed, leaving a tail of light behind it like a comet. It made no audible sound.

Having grown up in the wideopen spaces of western Nebraska, I have seen many falling stars, but never have I seen anything as large and differently colored as this.  Both my friend and myself were startled and commented to each other that we had never seen anything like that before.  We both thought it was just a meteor but both marveled at the size and color of it. I guess I never gave it a second thought until one night your director was on the Art Bell radio show the other night talking about recent sightings.  He told about the fireballs being reported and the color descriptions matched what I saw so I thought I would look up your sight and let you know what we saw.  I would appreciate it if someone would get back to me and let me know what I might have seen that night.  I have never seen any flying saucers or any other strange things except for this.

It made a lateral and diagonal move very rapidly, then spun, and shot north-northeast.On November 15, 1998 I was driving southbound on I-35 with my 14 year old son. I noticed two odd lights hovering about 30 to 40 feet above on the other side of the highway. they began to blink in an odd sequence, and I loudly woke my son and pointed at the lights. About this time, a row of lights appeared to the side of the first two ones. they lit up in rapid sequence and then went back out. When this happened, I could see a very large shape behind them, disk or saucer and dull gray, silver. If I were to hazard a guess, the lights dissected the craft in the middle. The craft then made several strange moves, very rapidly diagonally and laterally, unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. As I driving, I told my son to follow it with his eyes. As our car passed it, he reported whirling lights on the top which swirled around fast in the opposite direction they had been, and the craft shot out of sight, extremely fast, headed north- northeast. It might be of note that there was a light fog when I first saw the object. As the trip progressed, it became worse. But at the time, it wasn&apos;t so dense as to cloud our vision. We also thought a few miles down the road that we saw another, smaller craft blinking lights, but that could just have been excitement. oh, and the dash lights went out in my car and the radio station went out."

AND THEN SAW A DISC FLOAT BY SILENTLY OUT THE WINDOW.Hard to believe still, but I was 13 reading a book on UFO&apos;s and prayed to God to see one for myself.  Within 3-5 minutes I heard a sound out the open window toward the road that sounded like a cross between a semi-truck idling and a tank.  After about 15 seconds and seeing nothing go by on the dirt road the sound stopped as abruptly as it had started.  I then suddenly saw the upper half (the lower half was hidden by bushes between me and the driveway) of a disc-shaped craft silently glide by, it&apos;s surface reflecting in the light from the carport.  I saw no lights as it passed by quickly, but there were no windows at all like there would have been if it were a car, and it was made out of what looked like &quot;brushed aluminum&quot;. I watched to see if it would come back around the bend of the U-shaped driveway, but it didn&apos;t.  It didn&apos;t back up because my eyes were glued (and heart nearly pumping out of my chest) to the driveway from where I was sitting at the dining room table.  It couldn&apos;t go straight because it would&apos;ve crashed into the carport.  It couldn&apos;t have gone left because of the orange grove and the porch.  It DIDN&apos;T go right because I would&apos;ve seen it come around the driveway.  I went out after about 5-15 minutes (I lost track of time then because I was so nervous and was trying to convince myself I was hallucinating... after all, I was wondering why God had answered my prayer so quickly!).  But I just kept saying to myself, &quot;But I know that I know I saw what I saw and I heard what I heard!&quot;. I checked it all out and looked for marks on the ground in the one place that was my &quot;blind spot&quot;; the place after where I saw it pass the window, but BEFORE where it would&apos;ve hit the carport if it had continued to go straight.  Looking around and seeing only trees with their giant branches overhanging the driveway, and porches, and carports, I stood in the &quot;blind spot&quot; and discovered that the only way out from that spot was UP!  A break in the tree branches was just large enough to allow a car-sized (or disc-sized) object to go through.  There were no other options period!  Then I knew it was the real thing. (whew!)"

It was moving at a slow speed and appeared to have descended from a hight of approx 500ft to approx 50ft.  There wasn&apos;t any noise from the environment, wind, or the flying structure.  It continued to move at about 3-5 mph without any dipping, tilting, banking, or pitching of any kind.  The closest it came to us was about 150 meters as we were perpendicular to its movement.

While my kids were sleeping, I noticed a bright light in the sky to my 12:30-1:00 position as a pilot would verse.  Initially, it looked like an airplane with landing lights on that gave the appearance of being approximately five miles away and an altitude of about 1,500 feet.  So, I didn&apos;t pay it much attention. Later, maybe 5-10 minutes, I noticed the light was still in the same position, yet a little closer.  There now appeared to be two lights rather than one.  Now, it looked more like a stationary obstacle; perhaps the light to a communications or broadcasting tower.  Later still, maybe 3 minutes, I continue to drive at a speed of about 65 mph.  Humerously, the two lights now appeared to be a car&apos;s headlights.  A car was slowly flying towards us at about 200 feet.  At this point I gave the lights my wife&apos;s attention.

19951015,19980926,"Santee, CA",light,08 seconds,"A bright flourescent green light hovered between 2 houses then swiftly moved to left and then moved directly over us while we sat in car.My friend and I sat in a parked vehicle one night (after a rain storm) and as we spoke, I witnessed a bright flourescent ball of light (like the color of a glo-stick) hovering between my house and the neighbor&apos;s house to the left.  When I realized that the ball of light seemed to be suspended there for a few seconds it caught my full attention.  The &quot;ball&quot; moved quickly to the left, and for a brief moment &quot;sat&quot; in the center above the neighbor&apos;s roof.  I was trying to make sense of the unknown light and look for the source from where it could have been shining from.  When I did this, I moved my body so I could have a better view out of the windshield.  I believe I caught the attention of the &quot;ball&quot; and then it *immediately* made a bee-line for what seemed to be my face.  The &quot;ball&quot; came at me diagonally from the neighbor&apos;s roof area.  I screamed aloud.  Just then, the light came upon the top of the car.  It seemed to spread itself out atop the hood of the car.  It moved from the grill area all the way up over the windshield. The shape was almost that of something gelatinous or vaporous when it came onto the car.  In other words, it didnt move as light would move. It seemed to fill the car in a white light with a green tinge to it.  It was *extremely* bright at this period.  I recall feeling very warm and somewhat disoriented. It felt like the light consumed the space around my body; that I was no longer in a car; that I was now by myself in the light.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Now, to go back to the point where I screamed--at that time, my friend also screamed for he was reacting to my scream.  He did not see the light in the ball form, nor did he see the light on the hood, nor in the car. In fact, he was not sure why I had screamed. However, he did see the light move down the back window of the car and then vanish.  I did not see the light in the back window nor did I see the light vanish. I wanted to mention that my house is on the east side of the street.  Our vehicle was parked inbetween my house and the neighbors house to the left.  My friend was seated in the drivers seat and I was laying across the passengers seat and my head was on his lap--and yes, I was facing upwards looking at him as we spoke.  We were quite still in movement and I dont think that this &quot;ball&quot; of light knew we were there until I made movement to look closer at it out of the windshield.  I wanted to mention that the radio was turned on at a very low volume.  After the green &quot;ball&quot; of light left, it increased in volume.  This could have been because my friends knee hit the radio knob, yet I am still uncertain.  I will also mention that I did check the time when I went into the house and was quite surprised to learn that it was *much* later than I had anticipated, although the experience seemed to only last seconds. The entire event felt draining and exhaustive.  After six months or so had passed, I began to notice that I had a marked increase in my ability to learn and my ability to understand analytical issues.  I had wanted to report this experience when it had happened, yet I was too shy or perhaps still questioning what had &quot;really&quot; happened that night.  I have since witnessed another &quot;green ball light&quot; experience in the same city at a different location with a different witness.  This time, there were 3 balls of light and much further off in the distance.  The experience this time included only the sighting.  This sighting was approx. 11/10/97.  I will be happy to give you the details should you be interested in that experience.  Now it seems to me that I know what I experienced the first time was &quot;real&quot; so I have decided to finally report the incident. I will be more than happy to supply my background information to you upon request.  I am uncertain as to what you would like to know in that regard.  Thank you."

I was in my room at the time. My mom was in her bedroom, laying down at the time. The craft had 6 lights on it, grouped together in a formation that made up a filled-in circle of sorts. much like 5 lights on the edges and a 6th one in the middle. They were white. The craft moved in a northerly direction, much too slowly for any airplane to travel. I would say maybe about 15 MPH at the most, but most likely around 5 or 4. They moved in a straight path along the sky. There&apos;s an antena about 2 miles west of here on the horizon, and it appeared to move &quot;over&quot; it. The object did not rotate. It moved north for about 5-7 minutes, and then suddenly it went straight upward into the few clouds that were in the area. There was no angle to it. It just moved upward at a 100% vertical direction. It kept moving until I nor my mother could no longer see it. We live in Massillon, Ohio, just south and west of the northeast corner of the state. If it helps, we live near the tuscarawas (sp?) river. There was no sound to the craft whatsoever."

It was very hard to distinguish the border around the object, even though it was very low, and large. There were lights on each corner, or what looked to be the corners. and it was a bigger light like the color of the moon, and there was another light within the light that moved in a circle inside the big light.

19981111,19981112,"Wheatridge (5 miles or so northwest of Denver), CO",triangle,15-20 seconds,"While standing outside with my wife, I looked up and to the north and saw a triangle craft or formation at about 5000 feet. There were at least 10 white spotlight type lights on the leading edges of the craft and at least one of the lights seemed to move in a random manner inside the craft itself. This was all viewed by my wife and my self from the rear of the craft and the bottom.The whole event seemed to take place rather quickly. To be honest, my wife and I do describe the object itself in slightly different ways. My first impression of the object was that it looked impossibly large, yet somehow &quot;faked&quot; - in the sense that It reminded me of a projection or a hologram. My wife also thought it looked unreal, but her impression was that it was like an orgami shape. We both agree that it was VERY large and had at least ten bright round white lights on it. These were like spotlights except they thru down no beams, for lack of a better description. I estimate that we were no more than a mile or so away from the craft upon initially seeing it. It moved rather quickly to the north or north east and became progressively harder to see because of the cloudcover in the area at that time. 10 seconds or so after spotting it - I thought to run inside and grab my camcorder, but I had no sooner made it thru the front door, when my wife said (in a very non-plussed way) &quot;it&apos;s gone&quot;. in the interim, as I ran into the house she says that it looked like it was turning hard to the east, as if it was standing on it&apos;s edge, and then &quot;changed shape&quot; and became more spherical right before it dissapeared. When it vanished it did not speed off in any one direction - rather it simply dissapeared. As far as I&apos;m concerned, that backs up my projection theory, at least in some respects. However, that would be one heck of a powerfull projector, to put an image on cloudcover at 5000 or so feet. Now, some background. I am 29 years old and I work in Provisioning for AT&amp;T. To be honest, I have always enjoyed stargazing and have always said that I have an open mind about UFO&apos;s and would like to see one, but seeing this really blew my mind. Having said that, let me also restate the seeming &quot;unreality&quot; of the whole event in both my wifes and my own perceptions of it. By the way, my wife is 33 and she is a stay at home mom. We have a 8 month old daughter that was sleeping on the couch at the time of the sighting. Our main reason for reporting this is absolutely NOT for gain or publicity, but out of a simple curiosity... I wonder if you have recieved any similar reports from others in our area at the same time. Please call if you have any questions."

There was no noise and they were moving slowly in an easterly direction. I could barely make out the outline of a V shaped vehicle which looked like a carpenters square ruler. It was the night before the phoenix lights sighting occured.This sighting happened after I went through a most incredible series of events. I went to the Justice Department anti-trust division in San Francisco and provided a letter detailing my discovery of a non-detectable computer virus which was extremely destructive. I characterized this virus a Planned Osbolescence/Monopolization virus. I provided the Justice Department with a list of symptoms and a technique I discovered to resolve this problem.I got no assistance from them nor the FBI nor the police, as I was experiencing coersion in the harassment of my computer repair company by affluent people in the East Bay of California, Phone tapping and other manipulation, price fixing, and threats which made me fear for my life. My harassers were connected to the computer industry and large financial institutions. I was never formally interviewed by anyone and told my brother on the phone that &quot;They&apos;re only hope is to turn me into a Jesus freak or something, cause otherwise I&apos;m going to the supreme court about this.&quot; The next day I started hearing out of place voices on my TV and Radio which were of a religious nature. It was very convincing and I had started reading the bible because I was all alone as my family couldn&apos;t help and my friends didn&apos;t understand. I started having visions of things I read in the bible. These voices and visions went on for four months. I had to move as my business went from $5000 per month to about $100 per month once I announced this virus to lawyer customers who were trying to prove that I wrote it to increase my business when in actuality, I had no idea what was behind the harassment I was experiencing. I am including this information because I feel that my business problem is connected with this ufo sighting and thus shows an agenda for the phoenix lights vehicle sighting and a connection between ufo&apos;s and the system.

Two very different formations. On the second sighting saw about 5 military jets that flew extremely close to I-10 vehicles.We were taveling westbound on I-10 on September 1, 1998, approximately 8:30pm, between Desert Center and Indio, California.  The first sighting was about 10-15 miles west of Ironwood Prison on the south side of the road.  We saw four huge, round orbs of very bright, intense yellow-amber light.  One orb was higher than the other three, which were all level just below the mountin tops.  They were all very close, about 1-2 miles from the road.  We watched at length as we traveled.  The orb of light on the left, although the same size as the other three, clearly was hovering much higher above the mountain range. The others were all in one level line, seemingly intentionally just below the crest of the mountain range.  Suddenly the higher orb simply vanished.  It did not fly away.  It did not leave a trail (the moon was very bright and made it possible to see the outline of items in the area.)  It vanished so quickly and suddenly, followed almost immediately by two of the other three, and then the third, in the btween the remaing three.  Although we could see the entire surroundings, including trees, poles, and mountain outlines, we saw no evidence of the four orbs once they were gone.  About 10-15 miles further west, just past that mountain range, they suddenly appeared again.  This time much brighter, closer and larger, about 1 mile away from us.  The formation was now more like a &quot;v&quot;, with the left appearing higher, the second from left even with the fourth, which was on the right, and the third from left at the base of the &quot;V&quot;.  THe groun was illuminated completely by the light from the objects.  At that time we spotted the first two of what we believe were five military jets.  One jet came so very, very close above the traffic that it startled us.  We watched the orbs and the jets for another five minutes, and then needed to continue toward our destination. We did not see them disappear, and we could still see the glow long after our view was obscured by the mountains, but traffic obviously was slowing g! reatly behind us, perhaps to watch."

The engine sound was very smooth and almost sounded musical with just a hint of a regular pulse.  The tone could be likened to a number of square waves all tuned to different spectrums that would modulate independently of one another by just +/- 5 or 12 Hz.

My first thought was a shooting star then I noticed the bright green color. I then thought that it was an aircraft that was going to crash because of it&apos;s rapid descent but the light was not flashing like on aircraft. It was on solid. As I followed it to the horizen I expected there to be a flash or explosion as it hit the ground but there was none. I can only guess as to where the location of where it came down at. It looked like somewhere near the center of the city or East of there. I have seen metiors and planes before, this was not either of those. It was very unusual. When it came into my field of view I would say it was somewhere between a thousand to five hundred feet up in the air. And it also did not look like any kind of fireworks either. It had weight and moved to fast for that. And there were no sparks. I can&apos;t add much more except perhaps to say that it was coming down so fast that it startled me.

19980715,19980718,"San Bernardino, CA",light,Approx. 3 min.,"A flying ball of light with no structure, no sound, and no strobes or anticolision, navigational lights. Moved too fast for a STOL.At about 5:00 a.m. July 15 1998, I was walking my babbysiter home to her condo( we live in the same complex ), I noticed that there were two bright stars out, and recognised them as planets ( witch ones they were, I don&apos;t know, but am sure one was venus! ), also a half to almost three quarter moon. I showed them to my sitter, and we awed at how bright they all were even though the sun was starting to come up behind them. We were about three houses from the sitters when I looked up and saw another bright light that looked like another star, I told my sitter to look up, and immediatly she said &quot; hey look another big star! &quot; , I asked her if she noticed that it was moving in a jerking motion, and she said something silly about how ofcourse it was because everything is moving and orbiting.( ? whatever ) I told her to stop walking so we could get a closer look because even though there are two airports within a 10 mile radius, March A.B., and ofcourse Edwards not too far away that have aircraft flying over our community many times a day, and myself being an Air Force vetran who has worked on several types of aircraft, and familliar with many forigne ones to as part of that then profession, I could not recognize what I was seeing. At first I thought it was a civillian 747 type coming in for a landing with its landing gear lights on because it was so low, but it was going too fast to make a safe landing anywhere. Then I considerd it may be a jet fighter from one of the nearby bases with its lantern on, but yet the light was too bright, and other things came to mind why it couldn&apos;t be that. When it got just about over us I asked my sitter to look for any blinking lights, and to listen for the engine. As it quickly flew over us we did not detect any form of navigational, anticolision, beacon, or strobe light on it, and no noise came from it either. As it passed us  overhead we also looked for any kind of structure ( wings, tail etc. )it had none, just a big ball of light. Also when it got over us we could only se! e light, and at every position it was only light, for when a aircraft flys over you with any kind of light on, eventualy when it passes, the light is no longer that visable and you will see the back of the aircraft, this never happened. It maintained a complete light source at all angles. Well we didn&apos;t dottle around to see where it went because my sitter began to panic and wanted to go home quickly. I got her home, she went inside her house, and as I turned to leave for home it came back over, only this time it was much higher and faster. I considered that I was misstaken, that what I saw was realy just an airliner, and the second sighting was a sattelite, but it still seems way too odd. I mean the way it moved, the speed and alltitude were way off from the norm of any man made aircraft. I replay it in my mind, and talk to my sitter to confirm what had happened. I also find myself watching the ussual parade of aircraft flying over at different times of day trying to reenact what I saw, and still nothing comes close to it. I&apos;m sure there is probably an explaination for it, but I doubt I&apos;ll ever know what exactly it was. I just thought it was real weird, and it went against my years of knowledge in aircraft flight. It may just have been experimental goings on. Who knows? I&apos;ve never realy been a big believer in E.T UFOs in any case."

I have always felt that the likelyhood of other intelligence was a probability. Last night it became a reality to me. The sighting is as follows: Approximately 10:30 PM last evening [Sunday] while outside here in Corpus Christi and simply looking at the stars because the sky was clear, except for a few scattered clouds, I made what I know was a UFO sighting. Moving in a direction from south to north were three objects that CLEARLY were not conventional aircraft. [ Both my brothers are airline flight instructors and I have been around pilots all my life. I have a fairly good knowledge of aircraft and their characteristics.] The size of the objects is best explained by saying if you held a TYLENOL capsule [ the oval/cylindrical variety] at arms length to your vision, that would represent the size these objects were to my field of vision. They were a pale LUMINESCENT orange/pink in color. Flying/moving in formation. One behind another in a straight line. As they moved over me, the one in the rear of this formation, broke and passed the others, as an auto would on the highway and taking the lead position. Their speed was much faster than conventional aircraft. But as the one in the rear passed the others, and took it&apos;s place in the lead their speed all of a sudden intensified as they flashed completely out of my vision. I was most impressed with the impact this had on my consciousness. While observing them I seemed to be in an almost altered state of consciousness. As though time slowed down to allow me to make their observance in remarkable detail. There is not even a slight amount of doubt in my mind that these were not of this world.

19980725,19980725,"Tucson, AZ",light,15 minutes,"3 green/blue, non flashing lights hung in the N/W Tucson sky, the space between the objects varrying as they hovered.I was near the intersection of Columbus and 5th street in Tucson, the night of July 25th, about 10;00 pm when I noticed the three lights hanging low to the horizon in the N/W sky. It struck me as particularly unusual because their brightness and color belied the usual stars or planets that might be seen there. Their position was so low, the city&apos;s glare mkes it all but impossible that they could have been stars. And besides, their positions were drifting. &gt;From my vantage point, they appeared to be at least 10-15 miles away from me, but certainly it could have been much further than that. I was too far away to see a whole lot more than what I told you, but I certainly would be happy to confirm any other possible, more close up viewings of what was seen. These were NOT flares. From my vantage point, one of the lights was clearly moving upwards, and often times appeared to draw very close to the most upper of the three lights. Also, the lights did not blink and they&apos;re movements were not the movements of any conventional aircraft. i.e. helicoptor or plane. I wish I had been closer, and I&apos;ll be interested to see what the papers say I was looking at in the morning. I was returning home from work when I saw the lights, so I have no idea how long they may have been there before I saw them, or where they may have been. I only know I first picked them up at about 9:50, and lost sight of them at about 10:10. From where I was, they appeared to be drifting off further to the N/W, and I lost them below the tree line at that point."

I immediately looked in the direction she was looking, just in time to see three green balls of light in the distance about 50 yards away. They shot straight up at an amazing speed and disappeared.

19780801,19980723,"Clarksville (rural area), TN",circle,4 hours,"A sighting of a craft and alien abduction experienceI was taking a nap in the evening at the above date.  I was about 6 months pregnant at the time.  I woke up and saw a large craft outside the upstairs window of an A frame structure located in a wooded around.  My husband saw it too.  For some reason I fainted or went out.  I heard a voice with a thick middle eastern accent tell me to open my eyes.  I thought to myself, &quot;why would Mark, my husband, tell me to open my eyes. I said no.  The voice said you must.  I finally did after the voice spoke firmly.  What I saw I had never before seen.  It looked like an insect. It was thin and white wearing a dark suite, more like a robe.  It spoke without moving its lips.  I couldn&apos;t tell who was talking to me because there was more than one.  The others were wearing jumpsuits. He kept telling me to look at him, but I didn&apos;t want to and I kept shutting my eyes.  He said I must not fear him but I kept screaming and hyperventilating.  He kept saying he would not harm me and I must believe that.  He kept looking closely in my eyes or at my pupils.  I asked him what he was .  Was he a snake ?  He said no, I am not a reptile.  Then I asked if he were a insect.  He told me to look at his arms and said something about his joints and were they like an insect?  I asked him if he were going to kill me or eat me.  He said,  Why? do you think you would taste good?  This may sound like I am joking, but truly I am not. I kept screaming and shutting my eyes.  I was on some sort of table, I know, your classic alien experience.  The others around me starting backing away. The taller alien, the one in the robe told them That is the fear, that is the fear you smell.  It was awful.  I kept going in and out and I was afraid for my baby.  They of course, took a long needle and stuck it in my belly button.  It hurt worse than anything I had ever felt.  It told them it hurt and one of the little mean things put his hand over my eyes.  I must have fainted because the pain went away.  When I awoke or whatever again I saw the one in the robe talking to another one.  Their backs were turned to me so I figured what have I got to lose.  I made fun of the back of their heads and told them they looked like basket balls.  ONe said, You are making fun of us?  I said Yes.  I want to go. He said not yet.  There was much more but this is hard to talk about and I need to stop now.  There were helicopters around the ship when I first saw them before I was awakened.  I will detail this later."

I shared a 3rd floor apartment with ((Name deleted)), his wife ((Name deleted)), and their son ((Deleted)). On a hot summer Friday evening in July, we were sitting watching Johnny Carson having put ((Deleted)) to bed at 10 pm. It was very hot so we had all the windows open. The bedroom window had no screen and led to a fire escape. The TV started to go to a snow.  We heard ((Deleted)) crying around 11:45 and ((Deleted)) went white. I saw a glimpse of someone in the room and jumped up to see who it was. ((Deleted)) and I Got to the bedroom door in time to see someone go out the window. When we got to the window, the thing had flown away and was about 150-200 feet up and several hundred feet south of us. It was going toward an object in the sky that was ruby red in color. In seconds the thing was a silver dot and it merged with the object along with 3 or 4 other dots. The object then  rose to 1000 ft. and went southwest at high speed. The thing was about 4 feet tall with large eyes and fang-like teeth. The arms were disproportioinately long, like a chimpanzee&apos;s arms. He had a silvery colored suit and his feet didn&apos;t appear to touch the ground. He rather floated across the room and out the open window. I am not exactly sure about the date but I am definite about the time. The details of the encounter are still rather vivid in my mind as the experience we shared was very traumatic. ((Deleted)) was from Longview, TX and ((Deleted)) was from Kilgore, TX.  I haven&apos;t seen either of them (or ((Deleted))) since 1970 when he was discharged from the Navy and moved back to Texas."
19981121,19981203,"Helena (north of, on highway 49), AR",circle,30 seconds,"A large circular or oval shaped object was observed moving southward in the clear night sky over highway 49 outside of Helena, Arkansas.  The land over which it moved was flat delta, barren of trees and homes.  The object emitted bright pulsating light, flashing on and off every second or two.I (age 47, professional) was driving north on highway 49 having crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas from Missouri.  My father (age 77) sat in the right passenger seat.  My mother (age 74) sat behind him.  It was a dark, clear night.  Stars were visible.  On either side of the road were flat delta rice fields.  I don&apos;t believe there were any trees.  No homes were in sight.  The road ahead was straight and flat.  I had a clear view ahead as far as the eye could see at night.  There were no headlights ahead.  Behind me I saw the distant headlights from a car far behind.  I noticed bright white flashing lights a few hundred yards ahead, up and to my right, somewhat higher than I might expect to find the tallest treetop.  My first thought, as I recollect, was that I was seeing a light tower.  I was really rather paying scant attention to it at the time.  At about the same time I first saw the object, my mother asked, &quot;What is that?&quot;  I then noticed that the object was moving in the opposite direction in which we were headed.  I remember thinking that it must be a plane.  Again, my attention was not full; I was not particularly interested.  I watched as it flew by and out of sight.  I again directed my attention to the road ahead.  Then in the seconds that followed, for the first time I began to focus more intently on what I had just seen.  I turned back to see if I could catch sight of the object but I did not see it.  I thought then that my inability to see the object was due to the restricted view, limited to the back window and rear-view mirror.  As I gazed at the road ahead of me, the image of what I had seen sharpened.  I realized I had seen a large circular object with a panel of bright white light spaced evenly along its side.  The lights pulsated every second or two.  The object seemed to have a shell of bronze/silver metal.  This was the first time I had the thought that I had seen a &quot;UFO.&quot;  I turned toward my mother and asked, &quot;What did you just see?&quot;  She, too, described a large circular ob! ject with bright white lights around it.  My mother had a somewhat longer look at the object.  She watched the object move from the window to her right.  As she described it, she turned to her right to follow the object&apos;s flight when it suddenly disappeared.  Neither of us had heard sound.  What made this sighting especially intriguing to me is that my mother had seen this object.  Although I&apos;d never before laid claim to observing a UFO, I do maintain an interest in the phenomenon.  My mother, on the other hand, has no interest in such things and would not believe in the possibility of UFOs and visitations (of course I realize that a UFO would not necessarily imply otherwordly objects).  My mother remains convinced that she did not see an airplane or other aircraft she might identify.  She was rather stunned in fact.  At home, later that evening, my mother and I drew what we had seen.  The drawings were essentially similar, the slight difference likely accountable to the different perspective in viewing.  I might add that my father did not observe anything unusual.  I attempted to account for that.  He said that he was neither asleep nor had his eyes closed, but I&apos;m not certain of that.  I know, sadly, that my father has lost his sharpness of mind over the last several years (early stage dementia is suspected).  I also know that there was not any fuss as the event unfolded.  Other than my mother&apos;s simple question, &quot;What is that?&quot; no other words were spoken.  My father&apos;s attention was not called by these words."

Shasta MUST HAVE SEEN THIS!I was a 5 or 6 year old child at the time.  We were returning to Mccloud from Mt. Shasta via Hwy 89 at the I-5 interchange.  My mother pulled over at the entrance to the Drive-In Movie theater and I saw other cars stopped and people outside of them looking up into the sky.  I remember my mother being awed, and all the others who were watching.  This cigar shaped, metallic, windowless, soundless, unlighted object was hanging, slightly tilted, in the clear blue afternoon sky.  I know this was the time frame because I remember the sun was behind us as I looked up at it.  I was not overly impressed (at that age) but I could tell the adults were.  My dad and I always watched the space shots, I remember him telling me the news said it was some type of satelite or rocket part falling from the sky.  But it never fell, or moved at all. I remember even as a small child I knew this was not true and wondered why this explanation was given.  I do not know the duration of the event.  It was actually rather boring after you got over the shock of this strange thing in the sky.  Eventually we quit watching and drove on home.  I do not know the duration of the event but estimate it as 30 minutes +, (about that time is all we watched but it was there when we went on, still hanging.  I have always wanted to speak to others who witnessed this, especially those older than myself (I&apos;m 39 now)  I wrote this because of seeing other, similar descriptions in other locations during 1964/65 ish.  I will send a map, by mail.  I have not looked for microfished newpaper coverage.  Many, many people had to have observed this object as it was in a very visible, high traffic area being over the interchange of Hwy 89 at I-5 on a very clear, sunny day.  The sun was not in the same part of the sky, it was in the west, behind anyone looking at the object.  It was most directly over the Drive-In Movie theater/Mott Airstrip in the triangle shaped area NE of  the Hwy 89 at I-5 junction."

I was there  for about a second then vanished with a vertical flashI had let my kit of Birmingham Rollers out to fly at around 4:30 pm, a predator had begun to chase them and they headed for higher skies(a normal thing when chased) They went up high, approx. 1500 feet, I couldn&apos;t see the color of the birds too well, so I brought out my bino&apos;s to view them better. They turned clock wise to the north and I spotted a metalic shinney object out the corner of my left eye.  I turned to look at the object and it was semi circle(kind of oval) it looked like a dule chrome and not a constant color, a hazziness to it.  It looked like a circle with a portion of it flat on one side.  It was there for about 1 full second+, not very long at all, then I see this weird flash of that was silverish in color but going vertical on the side of the objects flat side, followed with a small mirror type flash.  When the flash appeared the object was instantaniously gone, I pulled up the bino&apos;s and there was nothing at all up there but blue sky. The object appeared to be up as high as you see airliners cruising by, not sure though.  If it was up that high it would&apos;ve been approximatley 3/4 the size of the airlines wing span. I was by myself but came into the house right after seeing it and told my wife about it, she said sacastically in a jokingly voice &quot;Did they abduct you too?&quot; I have never seen what I would call a UFO before and have been flying Birmingham Rollers most of my life and I&apos;m 30 years old now. I went to work the next day and told an acquaintance there about it, he thought I was kidding for a second, then knew I was sure that I&apos;d seen something.

I went outside and saw it, moving slowly.  It was flashing red and white, in a sporadic pattern. I got binoculars and saw that it had moved somewhat in the sky.  With binoculars, I saw that it was a flat object, with steady white light along the length of it.  It seemed close at that time, and then moved away as I watched it.  The flashing lights were very irregular, and seemed not to be a commercial aircraft. As I watched it, it moved from low in the sky, then lower behind some trees.  My wife, who had come outside by that time, and she noticed a similar object in the west, flashing in the same way.  That one as we watched it, also moved down so it was behind some trees. Then we looked back to where the original object had been.  Now it was higher in the sky, still flashing and moving generally downward.  It seemed much farther away now as the lights were much less distinct.  Finally, it disappeared or became obscured behind the trees that were in that direction. I don&apos;t know what this was.  My feeling is that it was not a normal aircraft, because of the overall movement-- low in the sky, then high, up, down, etc.  Also, the flashing didn&apos;t seem to be the usual wing lights of an airplane.  My hope is that this report may coincide with others who perhaps got a better look. If you have any questions, call us."

One seemed to &quot;land&quot; or fly VERY low, stop and wasn&apos;t to be seen agian.  4 other &quot;bubbly&quot; type objects followed after the object appearing to land.  I say land because it was moving slowy.  Numerous jets quickly appeared in this precise area for a long period.I got a call from my mother this morning about 7:25 asking me to come over and look at what she was seeing.  I live in Bothell, just blocks from her place so I went over right away.  She lives high on a wide open hillside overlooking all of the Cascade mountains from about the Carnation foothills going out to the east and from about the Darrington foothills further north going out and over to the east.  The view goes well over the Cascade mountain pass encompassing the Eastern Washinton areas of Whenatchee, Chelan and Brewster areas.  I got to her place about 7:40.  I did not see the objects that my mother said were so unlike anything she had ever seen (she will write out her personal discription in a message to you after she gets off work as a computer programmer today).  What I was clearly seeing though were many jet contrail lines in and out of the precise spot she saw these UFO&apos;s.  What seemed curious where the amount of these contrails.  After 15 destinctly seperate trails within 1 hour of arriving I just stoped counting.  It was as if I were at an air show watching the those plans that leave those patterns of smoke trails except these planes were fast.

The light seemed to appear suddenly over the airport, or maybe just north of it, sort of rising up.  It was a VERY bright white light, and appeared to be about half the diameter of the moon.  It then proceeded at a rapid rate, faster than conventional aircraft, taking only about 2-3 seconds to complete its northward journey. Then, it stopped and simultaneously turned red.  Then, it proceeded much more slowly back toward the airport at a slightly lower elevation.  It proceeded past the airport and that is when I stopped looking for it, as it was being lost behind trees.  Total sighting was a minute or more.I and two brothers who live nearby were on what is known as the West Mesa of Albuquerque, NM, about one to one and a half blocks west of New Coors and a little less than one block south of Sage.  The time was between (my guess) 02:30 and 03:30, Sunday morning 10/04/98.  I was facing east, the brothers west.  I saw it first, a very bright white light, similar in appearance to aircraft landing lights, but, it was a single light and much too bright to be aircraft landing lights.  It reminded me of an extremely powerful quart-halogen light.  It appeared over the airport or maybe just a little north of the airport, and then moved north, seeming, from our vantage point, to be just above the nearby Sandia Mountains.  Albuquerque is at about 5,000 feet above sea level, and the tallest peaks of the Sandias are about 10,000 feet.  Its travel time from north to south was only about 2-3 seconds.  I have watched aircraft circle and land at the airport here countless times.  The light&apos;s speed was at least 10 times that of the aircraft when they are approaching from the north before landing. From our vantage point, the light seemed to stop at about the same place as a couple of red marker lights on the nearby Sandias.  I was now facing slightly north, perhaps about 30 degrees north of east.  As soon as it stopped, the light became red.  The red was not as bright, but, it was far brighter than the aforementioned red marker lights.  Then, it reversed course and headed back toward the airport, but, now it was moving much more slowly.  It actually went past the airport when I stopped watching for it.  On its reverse course, it was at a slightly lower altitude and was disappearing and reappearing behind trees. Total sighting was a minute plus. There is a nearby trailer court that the light passed over (or seemed to pass over). The street lights in the trailer court went out when it passed over, both on its northward journey and its southward journey."

The two objects flew back and forth across the sky all night. They did not get close enough to make out a shape but sometimes they zipped away so rapidly that it was like a streak. Activity continued all night long. The deck hands reported to me that once during the night a craft without lights flew low over the boat. The next morning our boat passed by the Abraham Lincoln air craft carrier. Note that often UFO activity is reported in conjunction with military activity.

Strobe-like flash accompanied at point of near-impact.I was driving 55-60 mph on the highway south of Pleasanton, NE, when I saw a small, orange, fluorescent object ahead in the distance. I dismissed it as a powerline reflector usually seen near small, rural airports, forgetting that there is no airport (to my knowledge) in that area.  It was just dusk and darkening into night, and the object seemed to get dimmer as I drove south, eventually fading out of sight, so I assume it was travelling in a southerly direction along the highway, perhaps a little faster than I was driving. A few minutes later, as I was passing a familiar farm site with house and grain elevator in the yard, a white/silver spherical object, about 9 inches in diameter, came down out of the night sky and rushed directly at my car. Its path was over the hood and up the windshield, a few inches above the vehicle.  I felt a rush of wind and heard a loud swooshing sound as it passed over.  My reaction was to duck and swerve the car slightly to the left, but my reaction occurred after this quick event.  There was a bright, strobe-like flash as it reached the top of my windshield and flew up over my car. The flash enabled me to see several feet from the vehicle, over to a power pole in the ditch, and a power line extending over the highway from the pole, so the object had to go beneath this line.  I tried to see it in my rear view mirror, but sited nothing, and sped on south to Kearney, NE. I wondered about the incident on my way home, but was really too scared and confused to come to any conclusions, so I promptly forgot about it, until I saw my family at Christmas.  We were telling stories, and I remembered my experience.  I told my sister-in-law, but got frightened as I told her, and told her I thought it was an owl that swooped in front of my car.

The first thing I did when I picked up the camera was to look through the little window to see the type of film and number of exposures on it ( 200 ASA 24 exp ) I then looked at how many exposures were left ( all 24 ) and proceede to the back porch to take my 6 photos. What happened to the film is still a mystery, but this object was a very symetrical structured craft that was so black it looked like a hole in the sky. There were no lights or windows visable."

This was no meteor.  It looked like a giant seagull, or two chevrons joined ( ^^ ) [that&rsquo;s the closest my computer will match its shape, but more elongated side to side]  It was moving slowly and deliberately NE-to-SW and had a dozen or so lights on the underside.  Had it been standing still, it would have blended perfectly into the night sky, they looked just like stars, only they moved together.  I detected no colored lights.  The shape could have been one unit, two chevrons tip to tip, or multiple in formation, but appeared to move together.  The lights did not blink at all, and I heard no sound.  The impression I had was of a single unit, probably low altitude compared to planes in the area, which were easily differentiated by their lights.  At first I thought perhaps it was just a flock of geese, but I followed it for maybe a 30-second period or longer until it was too far away and too dim to see.  Geese in our area are common, but do not remain visible for long, nor do they fly that uniformly, and they invariably honk.  They (geese) do not look like lights.  It was not an airplane.

The larger orbit was being made more slowly and the smaller being made more quickly, as is true of all orbits I think.

19980710,19980721,"Brick, NJ",sphere,5 minutes,"On the evening of July 10, 1998, I was walking near my home in Brick, NJ when I spotted an object approaching in the sky. It moved slowly, and never changed speed or direction. It seemed to be about 1000 feet in altitude and moved over me traveling toward the South East around 8PM. I watched for more than a minute and it appeared larger than a traffic red light but smaller than a golf ball at arms length.  It had no wings or fins.  It was saucer shaped and somewhat rounded or spherical.  One side was very dark, perhaps black.  The other side was brightly lit.  The sun had set but it was still very light out.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  There was nothing hazy or fuzzy about the sighting.  The ship was very plain to see and it looked like a solid object just like a house or car or any other object. It might have been as large as a house. I am not sure of the size.  The UFO rotated so the bright side and the dark side became visible during each rotation.  Each rotation was about 2 seconds.  It did not rotate on any axis you might normally think of.  It just tumbled along.  The light it gave off was very bright but not as bright as looking at a 75 watt light bulb.  The light was white but as it rotated, sometimes I could see a bit of red. I was alone.  I called the local police and the Asbury Park Press to see if anyone else reported it and the answers were negative. This was a very unusual object.  I called the small local airports, nothing. Last summer, I and a neighbor, saw a blinking object go from horizon to horizon in 3 to 5 seconds.  Since then, he said he saw it 3 more times.  I thought the blinking might be a strobe, at that time.  The blinks were elongated into streaks.  Now I am wondering if these sightings were of the same object.  The July object if traveling fast could have appeared to streak because the light was rotating and sometimes faced me and sometimes did not, like a rotating beacon.  As I watched the July object, I became aware of many many little spots in my vision dancing around. I looked away and saw from the object into the clear sky and little spots were dancing all over my eyes.  I continued to watch the object until it was out of sight.  A short time later, I realized that the little spots were all gone.  I had never seen spots or little dots before or since. I am a 55 year old Electrical Engineer and I work for the Government.  This object just defied gravity as it floated along, slowly rotating.  I wonder who it belongs to and what it is doing.  Our Government knows a lot more than me and I know what I saw so I am wondering what the Government knows. I am wondering why they are so quite on this subject. I am inclined to think what I saw was not part of a black project.  I just want to know what the Government knows about this.  I want to know if our Government has any knowledge of these objects or if ETs are working with us.  I got a good look at this thing and it was a solid object.

It was almost midnight.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something coming diagonally over us from behind.  I alerted ((Name deleted)), and we both got a good long look.  It was approximately the shape of a minivan, and about twice as big.  It was dark grey or black in color, and we approximated that it was between 40 and 60 feet above us, and traveling away from between 30 and 60 miles per hour.  It was virtually silent, except for a slight hum, possibly displaced air. It had no markings that we could see.  The most amazing thing was how it moved, completely steady.  It never sped up, slowed down or wavered in it&apos;s course, it was as if it was on a track.  It was so unusual seeing something as large as it was traveling so smoothly, quietly, and slowly in the air without wings.  It was truly defying gravity. It passed over our heads, over the golf course, and then into the desert heading east. Shawn and I have always been bothered by the fact that the description of our sighting does not match any others that we have heard or read. Why was it moving so slow, why did it not have any lights, why was it not shaped like most &quot;UFO&apos;s&quot; we hear about. I wish I knew!!!"

After about 15-30 seconds, they vanished.While driving home, I looked up and right at a 45 degree angle and saw 2 disk-shaped craft moving through the air. They were a dull gray, and were extremely smooth moving and fast. The 2 craft were in sync; moving quickly across the sky. The air around the front of the disk seemed to be a reddish-black, as if it were at a very high temperature. There was a building to the right of them, so I could tell they were high up. After 30 seconds or so, the two craft silently dissapeared into the sky."

I had just stepped out of my truck after arriving in Bend at my girlfriend&apos;s parent&apos;s house and the brightness of these lights caught my eye because I hadn&apos;t recalled ever seeing a constellation in that area of the sky before. There had been snow showers in the vicinity and the skys were in a broken condition with cirrus clouds also in the vicinity. Objects were first observed almost stationary. Then, after a few seconds, I noticed they started moving in a straight line towards an approximate 330deg direction.  The speed they were traveling was about twice as fast as a satellite would be observed moving but much slower than a meteor entering the atmosphere. All objects remained equi-distant from one another, approximately 1 finger-width between each. They were all white in appearance, the same as the surrounding stars. No sound, fire trail, strobe lights, running lights, flaring, or fragmentation was observed.  The front 3 objects were as bright as the surrounding stars. The 4th object in line was a little brighter, and the 5th object was approximately the same brilliance as Jupiter. I had time to call my girlfriend over to my side of the truck to also observe this event. We watched the few remaining seconds as they seemed to fade out of sight at approximately 40deg of arc due possibly to the high cloud obscuration. I am 50 years old, a Vietnam Era Air Force veteran.  I was a weather observer in the Air Force and have been an amateur astronomer for appoximately 15 years. I have been staring at the heavens for as long as I can remember but I have &apos;never&apos; seen anything like these lights before.  My girlfriend is 47 years old and has a master&apos;s degree in psychology. She also has never seen anything like this before. (I might add that she says she &apos;doesn&apos;t&apos; belive in flying saucers). I reported this event to the Pine Mountain Observatory message center outside of Bend at approximately 19:15 11/6/98. They called me back saturday, 11/7/98 and took the information. At that time there had been no other reports of the sighting in any other part of the state or area. The local newspaper, The Bend Bulletin, also had received no calls or reports on the news wire."

Object appeared to be 1 to 2 miles away and travelling a little faster than normal aircraft.I was working the night shift at an area marina as night security. The night was nice with no weather to report that night or morning. The skies were clear and it was a beautiful sunrise. I was standing on the easternmost part of the marina (a large beach type of area strewn with large and small pieces of broken concrete). I looked up to the west, north west and observed what appeared to be a rather large sphere shaped object travelling from south to the north, maybe northeast about 1 to 2 miles away. It was possibly black or dark grey in color and possibly rotating. I say possibly rotating because as it flew on there was some type of either light or streak on it that appeared to rotate around the object end over end. The object was travelling somewhat faster than any aircraft in the area that morning. There was a small private plane that was approximately 5 to 10 miles away to the south travelling west, at what speed I do not know. I looked back to the object and noticed there were no smoke or vapor trails which would have been noticeable in the morning sky. I looked around the sky to see if I could see any type of military aircraft following or attempting to intercept, since Selfridge Air National Guard Base is approximately 5 to 7 miles north of the marina I was at. I saw nothing else in the sky. When I looked back to the object, it had disappeared. I contacted the CoastGaurd about 2 minutes later when I returned to the Gatehouse and asked if they had recieved any type of reports of unusual things in the air and they replied &quot;NO&quot;. After this I did not attempt any other reporting for fear of being completely criticized and also possibly losing my job which, at that time, I could not afford to do."

My friend and I told no-one at the time even though there had been articles in &quot;The Daily Record&quot;, the local paper; discribing a much larger triagular craft being seen around the county.  I&apos;ve always wondered if the several smaller craft assembled into the larger one.  Wayne county had several sightings of a large trianglar craft again in 1975.  Many saw it, myself included.  Many years later I read the book about the Hudson Valley sightings and it was identical to the craft I and another friend saw in 1975.

While I was sitting there I happened to look to the northwest where I saw what looked like four large, very bright white lights in the sky at about 30 degrees. It appeared that they were about one or two miles away from where I was, probably somewhere around 43 ave. or 51 ave. and Olive. These lights appeared to me to be in the shape of a very large diamond they were as bright as and maybe even brighter than those you would see on a commerical jet airliner. When I first saw them they were coming straight down out of the sky in a verical direction. I thought at first that they were the nose, wing, and tail lights of a large jet crashing into the ground, but what was really strange about this was that they were moving downward very slowly. As the lights came down closer to the ground they began to disappear behind the houses in the area, I was thinking to myself that very soon I would be seeing a large fireball in the sky from the crash, but it never happened. As I sat there thinking about what I had seen I decided that it was not a jet crashing because it was moving to slowly. I also decided that it was not helecopters because all of the lights moved downward at exactly the same speed, it did not look like flares because all of the lights were of the same intensity and were a bright white color more like you would see on a jet for it&apos;s landing lights, except much bigger and brighter. I could not see the body of any craft partly because the lights were so bright but also because it was so far away from me. I do remember that as I was looking at it thinking it was a jet crashing, I thought that it looked to big to be a jet, at that distance it would have been at least 10 times larger than a jet. A couple of days after this happened I was talking to my mother and told! her what I had seen, after I told her about it she told me that she had just seen on the local TV news a story about the &quot;Phoenix Lights&quot; that so many people all over the valley had seen on that same night. I was not going to post this at first until I read on here how many people had seen something like I had.

I attempted to follow its path with my eyes on the other side of the trees, only a brief distance, especially at the rate at which the object seemed to be traveling, but did not see any trace.  The light seemed to be quite far away, perhaps 2-5 miles directly south of my view, at about 45 degrees above the horizon from my vantage point.  Its size appeared to be larger than the brightest star, but not much bigger.  The narrow tail appeared briefly as it was visible before the trees, but disappeared almost instantly.  I thought about what it may have been, as I was incredulous, never having had a sighting in the Denver area. I thought about it being possibly a reflection of tail lights in my windshield, but I was traveling on a one-way street on one side of a river (the other direction is on the other side of the South Platte River, and is not visible much of the time from my side of the road) after having passed through an intersection where a traffic light halted any perpendicular traffic.  Additionally, the light had just turned green and I was one of the first cars to pass through the inter- section.

First appeared to be leaving trail of light that did not dissipate.I walked outside the front door at 10:30 PM.  It was a clear night, and I had my exterior flood lights on as well as the rest of my neighbors usually do at this time of night.  Looking to the west, just over the treetops, I noticed a white ball with a tinge of yellow and red.  This light&apos;s flight pattern was basically perpendicular to me in a north to south direction.  As it travelled, it produced a large, long illuminated trail.  The characteristic of it was incredible.  The trail did not dissipate and appeared to move along with the front being the ball of light.  I can&apos;t tell you what the trailing was . . . if it was flying on a beam of light . . . if the trail was actually part of it&apos;s structure . . . or if its hull was superheated from atmospheric braking. I&apos;m guessing that it turned from a north-south direction to an ENE direction.  The reason why I say that is that it went from an elongated shape to a round ball shape with no trail.  I called my friend out to observe this.  It seemed to have stabalized which leads me to believe that it was traveling quite a distance directly toward me.  The brightness started to fade like turning out a camping lantern.  At that time regular red, green, and white aircraft strobes appeared to turn on. I cannot be sure that the ball of light and the stobes were from the same vehicle, but the vehicle proceeded toward me and over me at a leisurely speed similar to other aircraft I would watch leave the local airport. As it passed overhead it was just out of clear visular range, but appeared to be triangular or at least flat-backed.  We listened very hard, and we heard a whisper of some sound which really did not keep pace in any way with the craft.

I publish a national, monthly trade magazine by profession and was on my way to a quarterly operations meeting in Auburn, CA, with my business partners.

I was driving about 65mph on CA Interstate 680 North on the southern outskirts of the City of Dublin. I was shocked at how close the fireball was. It&apos;s very difficult for me to judge but I would guess it was just two football fields away from me at a 45 degree angle. The center of the ball was the brightest white I&apos;ve ever seen but the most remarkable aspect was the bright flourescent apple-green color around the ball and surrounding the long tail. After about five (5) long seconds it simply disappeared. I was stunned and looked at the car to my right in the lane next to me. A woman was looking at the very spot where the fireball had disappeared. For a brief second we just stared at each other. I shook my head and she made a gesture to indicate she saw it also. Though I didn&apos;t need confirmation as to what I had just seen, I was glad to be able to tell others that there was another witness. (I have seen one other object that was unusual but that was in June of 1971 in Estees Park in the Colorado Rocky Moutains. That ball of light moved at rapid speed, changing angles quickly, once shooting straight up into the air. I will reserve my following comments only to the object I saw most recently.)"
19980912,19980912,"Lolo, MT",disk,5 min,"My son and I saw a bright, white colored object in the sky right near the moon, but lower about a half hour ago.My son came inside and said there was something by the moon. I went outside and what I saw was a white colored object moving west slowly. It seemed to be fairly high up-I don&apos;t know how high, but lower than what a commercial airliner flies at. This object was getting brighter and dimmer while moving west. There was no sound associated with it. It was going slow-not even as fast as a slow plane. There was a smoky looking circle of haze around this object, but as we have had forest fires around here maybe it was just leftover pollution, although the rest of the sky is clear today.The object moved west for about three to four minutes, then appeared to gain altitude and began going south. I watched it until it was very hard to see, then came inside. I thought, initially that maybe it was a helium balloon, but I have seen those in the sky before and this did not seem to be one. I have never seen helium balloons reflect sunlight like this object did. It definitely was NOT any aircraft that I have ever seen, and it was moving too slow to be a weather satellite. Last week, at about eleven thirty pm, my fiance and I saw a strange object in this area, and about fifteen minutes after we saw it there was a very fast moving jet that flew overhead(airforce?). If you would like more information on what we saw I would be happy to let you know. I am 29 years old, female, have nine years of law enforcement background, and am not a nut. My son is six years old. My fiance is 31 and a University Police Officer(and also not a nut case)."

19940515,19980629,"Portland, OR",sphere,10 minutes,"While in light aircraft observed object below and behind follow in a race track holding pattern. Observed changes in heading altitude and speed both normal and dramatic. no visible means of propulsion.AT ABOUT 1400 HOURS, APPROXIMATELY ON THE DATE MENTIONED, TWO POLICE OFFICERS AND A CIVILIAN PILOT WERE IN A 182 CESSNA AIRCRAFT ABOUT 10 MILES SOUTH OF A MAJOR NORTHWEST AIRPORT, OPERATING IN THE ARSA UNDER APPROACH CONTROL. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN A RACE TRACK HOLDING PATTERN ORIENTED NORTH AND SOUTH ABOUT ONE MILE BY TWO MILES, AT ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET MSL OVER A FREEWAY. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR WITH BRIGHT OVERHEAD SUN, AND NO WIND, SMOKE IN THE AREA WAS RISING ALMOST VERTICALLY. VISIBILITY AND CIELING WERE UNLIMITED. THE TEMPERATURE WAS MILD TO WARM. OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE IN THE AREA BUT NONE WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. AS THE TWO PILOTS WERE INVOLVED WITH FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, THE OBSERVER IN THE BACK SEAT WAS SPOTTING VEHICLES ON THE GROUND PRACTICING TECHNIQUES TO ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT WITH TARGETS ON THE GROUND. ON THE SOUTH BOUND LEG, ON THE EASTERN MOST TRACK, THE OBSERVER SAW A ROUND BALL LIKE OBJECT ABOUT TWO TO THREE FEET IN DIAMETER WITH A SEAMLESS, MIRROR LIKE SURFACE TUCKED INTO THE FOUR O&apos;CLOCK POSITION, RELATIVE TO , AND KEEPING PACE WITH, THE AIRCRAFT, ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET OUT AND ABOUT THREE TO FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MEANS OF PROPULSION, AND NO LIGHT SOURCES. THE ONLY REASON IT WAS VISIBLE WAS THE CONTRAST OF THE SHINY OBJECT TO THE DARK GROUND. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO FOLLOW THE AIRCRAFT THROUGH A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE WEST, THEN A NINETY DEGREE TURN TO THE NORTH. IT CONTINUED IN IT&apos;S RELATIVE POSITION, FLYING FORMATION WITH THE AIRCRAFT, ON AROUND TO THE SOUTHBOUND LEG. THIS PERIOD OF OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY THE OBSERVER ALONE WHO DID NOT NOTIFY THE PILOTS, NOT WANTING TO BE RIDICULED. TOWARDS THE END OF THE SOUTHBOUND LEG THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT OBSERVED THE OBJECT IDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT BEING ADVISED BY THE OBSERVER. UPON BEING ASKED THE OBSERVER THEN ADVISED THAT HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT COULD NOT SEE THE OBJECT AS IT WAS TUCKED IN TOO CLOSE TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE SCHEDULED TURN TO THE WEST WAS MADE THE LEFT SEAT PILOT MADE AN UNUSUALLY STEEP BANK AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME HE TOO SAW THE OBJECT. THE OBSERVER ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OBJECT WAS A MYLAR TYPE SILVER BALLON. IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS A VIRTUALLY WINDLESS DAY AND FURTHER THAT THE INDICATED AIRSPEED WAS ABOUT 75 KNOTS AND THE OBJECT WAS MAINTAINING IT&apos;S POSITION AND TURNING WITH THE AIRCRAFT. APPROACH CONTROL WAS QUIRIED AS TO THE PRESENCE OF ANY POSSIBLE RADAR CONTACTS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DIRECT QUESTION AS TO WHAT WAS BEING OBSERVED THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE APROXIMATE RANGE FROM OUR AIRCRAFT TO THE CONTACT AND WAS ADVISED WITHIN ONE QUARTER MILE. THERE WAS A STANDY ORDER THEN AN ADVISORY THAT THERE WERE NO CONTACTS IN THE AREA, AND THEN , &quot;DID WE WISH TO MAKE A REPORT&quot;. THE LEFT SEAT PILOT DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BELIEVE THE INCIDENT, AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. THE RIGHT SEAT PILOT WAS A LOW TIME PILOT AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE SANCTIONS AGAINST HIS LICENSE TO FLY. THE OBSERVER WENT ALONG WITH BOTH PILOTS WHO DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO REPORT. THE OBSERVATION CONTINUED AND AN INQUIRY WAS MADE TO THE GROUND UNITS BY THE OBSERVER IF THEY COULD SEE ANYTHING IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE REPLY WAS NEGATIVE, AND WHEN ASKED BY GROUND UNITS IF WE WERE WATCHING A UFO THE REPLY WAS, &quot;AS A MATTER OF FACT YES WE ARE&quot;. THERE WAS NO CONFIRMATION FROM THE GROUND. THEN AS THE AIRCRAFT TURNED ONTO THE NORTHBOUND LEG THE OBJECT SUDDENLY, AND VERY SMOOTHLY ACCELERATED OUT IN FRONT OF THE AIRCAFT AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE. IT COVERED THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO MILES IN ABOUT TWO TO THREE SECONDS ACCELERATING FROM ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE KNOTS. THE OBJECT THE EXECUTED A NINETY DEGREE RIGHT TURN TO THE EAST, AFTER A RADICAL DECELERATION AS THE TURN WAS MADE. THIS MANEUVER CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS THE OBJECT DISPLAYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND FIRED FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AS THE TURN TO THE EAST WAS COMPLETED THERE WAS AGAIN A DISPLAY OF ACCELERATION THAT WAS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. AGAIN THE ANALOGY OF A 50 CAL. TRACER ROUND IS CONSISTANT WITH THE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECT. THE ACCELERATION, A BALLISTIC CURVE, AND THE SPEED WERE ALL ABOUT WHAT ONE COULD EXPECT WHEN OBSERVING A PROJECTILE BEING FIRED FROM THAT TYPE OF WEAPON. THE OBJECT WAS SEEN TO ENTER THE TREES ON THE NORTHWEST SHOULDER OF A MOUNTAIN TO THE EAST, APPEARING TO HAVE CRASHED. THAT OBSERVATION WAS MADE BY ONE OF THE PILOTS. THE OBSERVER WAS INSTRUCTED TO FIX THE EXACT LOCATION OF POSSIBLE IMPACT WHILE THE PILOTS FLEW A NORTH, NORTHWESTERLY COURSE FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE PATTERN INTENDING TO OVERFLY AND POSITIVELY FIX THE LOCATION FOR GROUND INVESTIGATION. AS THE AIRCRAFT APPROACHED TO WITHIN ABOUT A MILE TO A MILE AND HALF OF THE POSSIBLE POINT OF IMPACT, THE OBJECT FLEW UPWARDS OUT OF THE TREES AT ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY DEGREE ANGLE TO AN APPROXIMATE ALTITUDE OF FIVE THOUSAND MSL. THE ACCELLERATION AGAIN WAS EXTREMELY FAST AND SMOOTH, BUT AS THE OBJECT LEVELED OUT ON A SOUTHERLY COURSE IT, AS RAPIDLY, DECELERATED TO A MORE LIESURELY PACE, ABOUT ONE OR TWO HUNDRED KNOTS. THE OBJECT CONTINUED ON THIS COURSE FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE WHEN IT EXECUTED A LEFT TURN, ABOUT FORTY FIVR DEGREES TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AND ACCELERATED AWAY AT AN ASTONISHING RATE DISSAPPEARING FROM SIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME. A SIMILAR OBJECT WAS SEEN AT A LATER TIME IN AN AREA TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE ORIGINAL INCIDENT DISPLAYING SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS ALTITUDE, SPEED, AND LAST KNOW DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THIS INFORMATION CAME ABOUT AS A TELEVISION SHOW OF VIDEO RECORDED SIGHTINGS WAS ON. THE WIFE POINTED OUT ONE OF THE OBJECTS, A SILVER BALL, AND MENTIONED HER OBSERVATIONS. SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE SIMILARITIES OF THE TWO INCIDENTS AT THE TIME OF THE CONVERSATION. THE PILOT OF THE PLANE IS AN EXPIERIENCED HIGH TIME CIVILIAN PILOT. THE COPILOT IS A LOW TIME LICENSED PILOT AND IS A POLICE OFFICER WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS EXPIERIENCE. THE OBSERVER IS A TWENTY YEAR POLICE OFFICER WITH SOME EXPIERIENCE FLYING AND IS A MILITARY VETERAN. BOTH OFFICERS ARE STILL EMPLOYED AND THE TWO PILOTS CONTINUE TO FLY."

I noticed something out of the corner of my eye,turned my head, and saw a large bright green (think glowstick) ball of &quot;fire&quot;. It looked like it was maybe 10 miles away, and from where I was, looked about the size of a small car (think yugo). It took me about a second to register what I was seeing. I watched it for about 5 seconds. It went from a green ball of fire to your run of the mill orange, and then started to dim a bit. Then it was out of sight. It was falling at a slight arch. I&apos;ve seen meteors falling before, and this was nothing like it. Also, there was a cop that had a car pulled over on the main road about 30 seconds before the fireball. After the event, I looked over toward the main road, saw his lights were no longer flashing, and then he was on the sideroad moving at a rather high rate of speed, Heading in the direction of where the ball &quot;fell&quot;.

I knew they were not stars when I saw they were moving.  They were brighter than any of the stars but did not appear larger than any of the stars. Appearance of sky:  a perfectly clear night Movement of objects:  I watched the two &quot;lights&quot; move across the sky. It looked to me as if one was chasing the other.  The leading &quot;light&quot; would manuever and the following &quot;light&quot; would make the same manuever.  Similar to playing &quot;follow the leader&quot;.  I observed them in a zig-zag pattern.  When they were almost out of my view, the two &quot;lights&quot; parted and took slightly different directions. Time sequence:  the whole observation lasted about ten seconds Distance:  they appeared at my zenith and disappeared from my vision over houses making and arc of about 45 degrees in ten seconds. I am calculating this arc by holding my arm straight up, rotating my arm, and stopping where I lost view. Unfortunately there was no clear view of any objects, just two bright lights.

I then saw a triangle come into my vision in the east centre of the sky. It was glowing gold all over. The object, while essentially triangular had a back edge that came into the craft, Concave, with the back edge actually being two sides that came into a point about one sixth of the way from the furthest back edge to the front point. The object then flew silenty and very fast right across the sky in a straight line as if it were travelling past earth and this seemed more likely as when the object went west it stopped moving across the sky but rather started to just get more distant.

I looked over to the left side of the road, and hoovering back over the filed was this weird yelowsih flashing object. It was 3 lights. I pulled off onto the left side of the road, and it headed west. I follwed it until I reached a stop sign.  It was overhead of me, floating above a MAIN Highway. It turned around and headed the other direction.I went to the store and on my way back I noticed an unusual bright object heading east on the left side of the road.  Behind it was a smaller light, following it. I noticed it because it was flying so low over top some trees and then like that it accelerated its speed.  I followed it on the main road, route 33 east.  I lost sight of it for a second, but on insticnt I turned down Angling road heading north east.  I got to a clearing on a top of a hill.  I looked over to the left side where I thought I could see the object moving, and instead I saw 3 bright yellwosih lights blinking in a very unusal non- pattern formation hoovering over a field.  I cant say how far away it was, but pretty far back.  I turned onto the left side of the road and watched it.  The it started moving west, slowly at first, then faster. I went back onto Rt 33 and follwed it.  I thought I could maybe beat it to the next road on the left, where it appeared it would fly over.  Instead, the object made a 90 degree turn, crossed over Rt 33 and headed south.Luckily it turned where I could take a road to follow it, Colby road.As I follwed it, it appeeared to be further and further.  I kept following it anyways.  Finally I saw it move to the south east.  I turned down Sharrick road and followed it some more.  When I reached the next road, the object was on the left side of me, approaching an intersection.  When I got to the intersection of Rt 20, the object turned around right over the intersection! It was triangular.  A light was at each vertex.  Each time the craft changed directions, a red and green light went on.  Of course I did an illegle u-turn and speed to keep up with the object, now heading north west.  Finally I lost it and I gave up.  I know I have seen tis particular object before.  When it was over the field, there were two lights on top, and one in between the two on the bottom.  It made no noise and for some reason, it didn&apos;t really try to get away from me.  It could&apos;ve becasue I was going about 110 miles per hour trying t! o follow it.  It knew I was folowing it. And for some other strange reason, it followed the roads, why didn&apos;t it go where I couldn&apos;t follow?  The are I saw it in was a pretty populated area."

I then went to my backyard becuase there are less trees,and looked up and saw nothing.I then went back to the front of my house,(same route),and once i arrived at my driveway,near my deck,almost ready to enter my door,i saw a very bright white light. (I did not see it when i was leaving my house,becuase it was in back of me.)I then went inside to get my binoculars and zoomed in the light was steady and did not blink,the shape did not change.  I then looked above my roof to see if there were any other objects near it,and i saw what at first i thought was a comet.(Some haze)I zoomed in and i saw 5 white circles,with steady non blinking light,the objects did not move,all the circles were the same size.(The circles were much smaller and farther away than the other object to the right.) The circles were arranged one behind another equally spaced in a arrangement that looks like a hook. I was pretty convinced this was a comet,as soon as I looked at it becuase one circle in the middle had a little haze around it.But that would not explain how the much bigger circle and much closer circle did not have haze around it also.  It was very cold out and i went inside for about 15-20 min then went back out to see if the objects moved,and they did not.I then zoomed in on both objects again and there shape did not change and they did not move.I went back inside after 5 min,then i went back outside after my dog started barking (he does this alot i doubt it had anything to do with the light).But I did find it strange and i was a bit scared becuase he stayed outside for about a hour,and i thought the weather got to him,or he got to a fight with another animal. I yelled out his name a couple times 4 or 5 and he came in. I then went back outside with my binoculars for a final look and the objects did not change. I went back inside.

Ended up slightly 30 degrees up. The departure angle was close to 45 degrees. It departed into the west and up.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a reliable judge of speed. This thing was smoking and accelerating! Speed 400 to 500 knots, with a behind-the-trees dash at Mach 1 (600 knots), easy.&quot; &quot;It was the brilliance that brought my eye to it. If I had done a slow blink, I would have missed it completely. This was truly an amazing sight.&quot; He described the UFO as &quot;oval, like if you put your thumb and index finger together to make the OK sign. No blinking lights.

It could be dismissed as a flare of some type, but it seemed to move much faster and was larger. It was at about a 70 degrees in the sky... nearly directly above me but still withing my field of vision through my windshield. I do not beleive it was a flare or firework because the fireball was much wider than a flare and seemd to move southward and downward...whereas flares and fireworks would not go down. I was driving through Camp Pendleton on the freeway. It is a very dark area along the freeway, which was relatively empty for Southern California.

I was laying on the grass looking up.  My 15 year old son saw everything I did.  It was tan and wing shaped and seemed to go in and out of vision when looked at directly.  Merely a curiosity at this point - it flew with some of the characteristics of a hawk, but was much too high and rigid.    I observed it for about fifteen minutes in this holding pattern before it disappeared completely.    I left the park and drove towards town.  At the corner of Mesquite Springs Road and Twentynine Palms Highway I saw what I believe to be the same object at a very low altitude, maybe 50 feet, flying very slow southbound parallel to Mesquite Springs Road towards me.  It was about 100 yards away at this time.  I pulled off the road to get a better look because it was very unique looking.  It looked kind of like a flying wing, with no tail and no propeller, with a slightly raised fuselage in the center.  Golden tan on the bottom and off white on the top, dull with no reflection in the clear desert sun.  No markings that I could see.  I don&apos;t remember seeing any windows, but have an impression of a darker area near the front where you would expect windows.  It was somewhat larger than a piper aircraft, and had pronounced fins on the wing tips.    When I got out of my truck it was not readily in sight.  From the slowness of it I expected to see it right above me.  My son pointed it out traveling East above Twentynine Palms and climbing, already about 3 miles away.  Very fast.  I heard no sound from this craft whatsoever when it turned and accellerated.  It passed out of sight in seconds.  Visibility-unlimited."

Looking across the street I noticed what appeared to be a very low and slow flying 747. Although I could not make out the body, what I could see were 3 bright red lights. I assumed one on each wing tip, one at the center where the leading edge of the wings would intersect (if they did),and a golden yellow light on the nose. The speed seemed so slow that I wondered how it could remain aloft. The object traveled left to right (south to north). As it came directly in front of me, it seemed to make a 90 degree bank and stop. I could only see what would be the center light and one wing tip light(now vertical). The lights also changed color from red to golden yellow. The vertical wing tip light was now strobing. It remained stationary and very stable. I could only guess as to the distance, possibly 100-150 yards. I watched the lights for roughly 30 minutes, then the objected rolled back 90 degrees to a straight and level orientation. The lights changed back to red. The object then accelerated, banked left and diappeared over the western horizon. At this point I was certian of what I saw."

Off to the west  i noticed a sphere shaped object that appeared to be glowing as a fire. I watched as it seemedto climb parralel to a radio tower (the tower is a 1/2 mile away,the object was further) for about 3-5 minutes.Then with no warning it seemed to pulse brighter,as it reached the top of a tower i was using as a guide/landmark. but it didnt disappear,it appeared to intenseify if you will....it started giving off what looked like miniature sized objects of itself,i watched as about 6-8 of these objects came off and flew off in different directions.After the objects left the Larger shape (which i believe to be a mothership of somekind) decreased its firey glow ,then moved straight about what looked to me 100&apos; then took off toward the north at great speed. This was the 1st of 2 sightings like this i saw in that week.As i stated in the earlier summary this was only the first sighting of 2 i would see in that week.I will tell about the 2nd here.As usual i had taken the dog out about 1700-1800hrs. I noticed that the object i had seen a few days earlier was back. It was sitting adjacent to the towers again in almost the same exact location as it was previous.The Object appeared to be very large but distant.It kinda reminded me of a small sun or moon glowing a yellowish glow. After watching this it again pulsed really bright,but this time it didnt dispatch the smaller objects it was recalling them. I watched as 6-8 small objects exact duplicates of the larger one but smaller return to the larger object.after they had returned which took about 5-6 minutes i realized my parents were inside i hollered for them to come see the object i saw earlire in the week as i had told them of the previous sighting. After they had come on the porch the object again took off to the north at great speed.If memory serves this was a time when several objects had been seen in our area and sevral were reported to our local Air Force Base which has now closed.I have never seen this event again since."

I turned and directly overhead was a bright white circle of light about 20 yards across. It had a faint red halo around it, outside of which the white light was dimmer. The object had a tail. The tail was a deep blue. Within it were diamond aquamarine shapes which fluctuated in color and position. There had been clouds in the sky prior to the event. The sky was completely clear. There was a noisy fountain behind us. Throughout the entire event we heard nothing. All sound stopped. The obeject slowly flew over us about 500 feet up in relation to tree tops. Both myself and the witness felt completely at peace. We both had an out of body experience. As it flew over the object stayed a perfect circle. It did not elipse. In total the event seemed to take about five minutes. Later we discovered it had been about 20 minutes. The object came to the tree line and disapeared. It never sped up. We rushed to look around the trees and saw nothing. It was gone instantaneously. It wasn&apos;t as if the light had blinked out. It was simply no longer there.We rushed inside to tell two other friends. They did not witness the light. They came outside with us and we all looked around. The four of us saw two planes flying by. There are no commercial flight paths over this area. We had all worked and lived in the area for at least two years and know the skies pretty well from being outdoors so much. The whole experience felt very peaceful during but afterward both my friend and I were terrified of seeing it alone. Myself and my friend are both 22 years old and college students."

Then, in the southern hemisphere, near the satellite path, we saw a very fast moving light, moving about 30 times faster than the satellite, although we could not judge the actual distance of the light from us.  The light was far away.  It would zig, and zag, then stop and hover, then zig and zag again at diagonal, horizontal and vertical angles at extremely fast speeds. It almost appeared to &quot;jump&quot; from place to place, it was so fast. Our elevation was over 4,000 feet and there were no lights nearby.  If it had not been such a clear and dark night, I doubt that we would have seen it.  We saw the light for about an hour until we left and went to sleep. Neither of us had ever seen a UFO before. I have good eyesight-better than 20/20 vision.  Sorry I didn&apos;t have a video camera.I realize that this doesn&apos;t provide much info-it was a sighting from far away.

19981016,19981017,"San Francisco, CA",light,ALL NIGHT,"Every night - all through the night, there have been 5 &quot;star-like&quot; crafts in the sky over the San Francisco Bay. The brightest is in the  western sky and looks like a very bright star. What distinguishes it from a star is that it bobs and moves periodically; it exhibits an purposely changeing radiance (decidedly more ray-like than eminance) and there is a blinking white light apart from the main star body. Positioned at about 11 o&apos;clock is a single blue green ray; fixed in position and length. The rest of the rays once again, seem to shift and change. To the casual observer it would appear as a bright star. The other 4 objects are also star like though not as bright (possibly due to being further away) and display an artificial  &quot;wagon wheel&quot;- like radiance. This experience is available to anyone in the bay area all night, every night. They are clearly wanting to appear as fixed stars even while waivering some. The one bluegreen ray and the periodiodically blinking light just off to the upper right and the waivering just won&apos;t allow for real star status. I am quite frankly surprised that there haven&apos;t been a rash of reports on this. It is once again quite astounding in that the entire Bay area has regular nightly access to a genuine sighting every night. One need only venture out and take a close look at the brightest &quot;star&quot; in the lower western sky to find that it is in fact an altogether wondrous non-star."

19980707,19980706,"Danville, PA",sphere,15 minutes,"I witnessed a reddish ball hover for about 10 minutes after witnessing it streak across the sky like a shooting star.  Then it appeared to have dropped a red light to the ground.  Then it simply was gone.I was frequenting one of my favorite hilltop locations as I very often did on evinings such as this one.  I must admit the thought of UFO&apos;s never really crossed my mind.  As a matter of fact I generally considered people who claimed to have seen a UFO to be some sort of weirdo starved for attention.  However on this night it became quite clear to me that I too was now one of those &quot;weirdo&apos;s&quot;.  As I gazed across the beautiful night sky I saw what appeared to be a shooting star only it stopped &quot;on a dime&quot; at what appeared to be about three feet above the mountain top from the distance I was observing.  In all actually the object which seemed to have grown from a white streak into a stationary reddish ball was probably about a half mile above the ground.  I immediately excused the strange object as my own confusion between a shooting star that apparantly had brought my attention to  a large planet mars perhaps.  However the thought that I was witnessing something very strange quickly crept into my mind.  There was no sound and absolutely no movement from the object for about 10 minutes.  Then the reddish quarter of an inch ball seemed to blink releasing a sort of red light down to the ground.  The light fell very slowly then dissappeared behind the horizon.  I again focused on the red object only to see it dissappear as if the  light was turned off leaving nothing behind.  It did not exit in the same manner as it entered and the bright moon provided ample light to see an unlight object from where I was.  I truly hope someone believes what I am saying or even has experienced something similar because I am quite disturbed by what I have witnessed.  I dont believe any of the logical explanations I myself have come up with up to this point.  I truly hope some of you can.  The speed at which it entered, the precision of its stopping, the duration of motionless hovering, the lack of any audible sound, the lack of any recognizable aircraft-llike features( blinking lights, movement, etc. ), the strange light lowere! d from it, the strange reddish glow that seemed to make up the object and the immediate absence of its presence are all a mystery to me.  I like to believe that I am rather intelligent but this is far beyond anything I can comprehind.  Thank you for allowing me to share my experience with you.  I am too afraid of computers to give you any personal information so please understand."

This object was rounded on one part, from where I was I suppose you could say the back end, and taperd to a blunt almost squared off part in the front. As far as I could tell, it was virtually silent. The illumination was somewhat the color of flourescent lighting. This is a first for me.

I was standing looking at the stars when I saw what I thought were twin shooting starts far in the eastern sky.  But the &quot;stars&quot; stopped their decent and then came heading toward us in a slow manner.  As they continued heading west...I was amazed.  I told my husband that he had to come and see this. They seem to float through the sky...oval in shape or like two flat bowls glued together...they were a glowing orange, almost seemed translucent.  No sound was heard and they continue into the west.  I moved to the front of the porch so I could watch them further.  They headed into the the western sky and mountains.As we were enjoying the evening at a local bed and breakfast on the corner of 1st street and 5th avenue in Tucson, I was standing watching the stars.  I observed what I though were two shooting stars in the eastern sky.  I thought that was quite strange to have two shooting stars, following the same decent.  Before they reached the horizon they came toward the west. As they came closer...I told my husband the come here...he needed to see this.  We watched as they continued on toward the west.  There were two oval (like two flat bowls glued together) and flying side by side with slight movement from side to side.  They seemd to be glowing orange from the inside. There were no lights to be seen on them. Since we observed lots of airplanes from the Tucson Airport and the Air Force base and helicopters during our stay...we can say objectively they were not commercial aircraft.  It is hard to judge the distance and heighth they were, but they didn&apos;t seem to be extremely distant.  They continued into the the western sky and into the mountains. My husband and I were visiting our daughter in Tucson and we reside in Malaysia.  We are American citizens.  My husband is ex-navy and I am an artist.  I am 49 and my husband is 52.  I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenom, but have never observed one.  And my husband is a skeptic.  His comment was &quot; I don&apos;t know what they were, but I have never seen anything like it before.&quot;  The next day I was relating the story to our daughter.

19981010,19981027,"Hollywood, CA",changing,5 minutes,"I was standing outside on Sunset Blvd. at Vine and looked straight up which I normally do not do. I saw three bright white lights in a perfect triangle moving slowly to the south east, following Sunset Blvd.  At first I thought it was a low airliner but there was no sound and no landing lights.  I called to the security guard to have another witness.  We both saw the lights, then they split up with two moving slowly to the east and the other to the west.  Then they appeared to stop and very slowly fade from sight (about 4 minutes)  I kept my eyes on them (the two that turned east) as long as I could and they just faded to nothing.The triangle of bright white lights that I saw appeared to be very low in comparison to an airliner flying over head.  The triangle appeared to be an equilateral triangle.  The brightness of each light was about that of the planet Venus. The size was of each was about 3 times the size of Venus.  When I first saw it,  the triangle appeared to be just to the right over another highrise that is across the street.  That highrise has about 20 floors and the triangle was easily as big as the top of the building from my perspective.  I was standing next to the highrise I work in and felt a tingling on my neck and a thought popped into my head to look up.  So I looked straight up the side of the building with my head all the way back and just at that moment the lights came into view.  I thought &quot;that plane looks low&quot; then I realized that a plane would have flashing lights and a more elongated triangle with the front point farther away than the back two.  But this thing had all the lights equally spaced like a formation.  I slowly moved from left to right and passed the top of the building across the street in about 20 seconds. I then called to the security guard who came out in time to see the triangle and then a few seconds later the lights on the triangle separated with two lights going left and one going right.  The lights that went left stayed the same distance apart and rotated slightly.  The security guard said &quot;Thats wierd&quot; and went back inside as I watched the lights that went left slowly fade to nothing."

We had gone into town to eat and upon our return to camp we noticed a radio tower (rather the lights) east of the road, two of us were quite familiar with the area and unaware of the tower. We stopped and commented on the tower which was just over a hill from us. As we drove on a taller hill occluded the tower. When we rounded the hill we looked back to try and triangulate the position of the tower. We found the tower had moved! It was still due east of us and much too close to be parallax. It was a warm evening, the windows were open, there was no sound. I shut off the engine, the &quot;tower&quot; began to move, it moved due north at an increasing speed. One of my friends aimed his varmint rifle at the &quot;tower&quot; and watched it until it disappeared from view without any course deviation, this was perhaps a minute after it was lost to naked eye view. There was never a change in color or configuration while I watched. The lights were in the shape of a pyramidal type TV or radio tower all lights were white in color, and about as bright as the marker lights on such a tower, much brighter than any stars. My friend stated that through the 20x rifle scope he could see no features or shape only the lights. He stated there was nothing between the lights, he could see the stars through the formation. The speed of the objects could not be estimated, but appeared to move at a constant acceleration, probably at about mach 2-3 before dwindling from sight, alternatively the lights dimmed and the formation closed at a constant rate. Discerning the difference would require a range finder or triangulation neither of which was available."

I turned to point it out to my friends.  Turning back we noticed that the light was moving, not like a satellite.  It at first went down and to the right from Orion, then began moving down towards the horizon, but in a side to side swaying motion.  Possibly it was moving in a helix pattern downward (or away?).  My friend was excited and ran back in the house to get two others, but by the time they came back out it was gone.  3 of us saw it, 2 missed it.

19981202,19981202,"Columbus, OH",disk,5 minutes,"It was a round/disk shaped object that reflected the sunlight. It was hovering at an angle. I say hovering cause it moved like that, not like it was something flying in a straight line like an airplane. It hovered for a few seconds and then disappeared. It reappeared 3 more times in completely different spots in the sky, but in the same area. I was driving at the time watching this happen.I was driving out to my brother&apos;s Hockey Game to give him an envelope he forgot at home. I was getting off of the 270east freeway exit ramp at Easton and was watching an airplane (commercial, passenger jet) The sun was setting so I watched the sunset and there were white jet trails in the sky. There is an airport East of there so the Commercial Jet, was just at an upwards climb, and low in the sky. Out by the closest white jet stream, actually below it to the right, was a round/saucer shaped object that was hovering in the sky at an angle. It reflected the sunlight underneath it and was dark on top. It hovered for a few seconds, but long enough that I got a good look at it. I kept looking and it reappeared in a different spot to the right and above where it was before in the sky. It acted the same way and disappeared again. It was definitely the same object. It reappeared a third time below the second spot and to the right sort of making a triangle of appearances. It acted the same way again and disappeared, and I had to turn the corner. It didnt act the exact same way each time, but hovered and was at a slant. I parked at the Easton Ice Rink where my brother plays hockey and went inside to give him his envelope. I went back outside and watched the sky for a few minutes. I didnt see the object again. I drove down the bottom of the hill and across to a newly built parking lot  and turned around and watched the sky for a moment. The two jet trails were still visible, well obviously because there were jets attached ot the trails. I was about to drive away, and saw the object again. There was a black helicopter flying above a neighborhood near there, and the object was farther out in the sky about the same distance it was before, and acted in the same manner and finally disappeared. It was probably not as far away as the jet trails in the sky, but it was close enough I could see it clearly. I had to get back to my store, so I after it disappeared the fourth time, I didnt see it for a few minutes, I left and drove back. This might have been one of the same objects or four different ones, but they were all the same, all four times. My opinion is it was one object. I happened to not see it outside of the car, only when I was inside the car. But, it was definitely, something in the sky and not something like a reflection in my windshield. The car was not moving when I saw it the fourth time. I am 21 years old, and I run my own business in Westerville, Ohio. Which is where I drove from this day. I have seen many documented videos on recent UFO and/or flying saucer footage, and I didnt think I would ever see something to look and act quite that close to what I have witnessed on those documents. I would have never even noticed it if I hadnt been watching the airplanes, and the sunset like I was."

19980918,19981019,"Del Mar, CA",fireball,1 minute,"This was like a green colored light, like a star.  It was lower than any other aircraft would be.  It was decending, in an easterly direction, then moved west.  As it moved west it turned white, then it went out, disappeared.  No tail or explosion.I was traveling south on I-5, just passing the Del Mar Race Track. My friend was in the car with me.  I saw a green light floating above the area where the race track is, near the coast.  It moved east while decending, then it moved west.  It was the green color that caught my eye, I had heard on Art Bell&apos;s show of people having sightings of green flashes.  I grew up on the coast and the only green flashes I had heard of were the ones that appeared at the time of an intense sunset, but I knew that those were optical illusions.  So I was interested in this ob- ject in the sky that was green.  It was star like in size, but too low to be celestial.  And it wasn&apos;t flashing like any aircraft would be. By the time it caught my friend&apos;s attention it had turned white.  We both watched it travel west a little further then it just went out. The sky wasn&apos;t too dark that we wouldn&apos;t have seen something even with- out a light on it.  So we both searched for something but were amazed that nothing was there. Shortly after that you were on the radio announcing all those calls you received.  I finally found some spare time to submit my report.  I didn&apos;t find any other posts of sightings at the same time or place we had seen the light, but I&apos;m hoping this will help you in your research."

I&apos;ve watched satellites and meteor showers. This moved MUCH faster. It was a constant white light with a brightness greater than any star or planet. It moved from the WSW horizon to the NE horizon in a straight line(arc). Like the gentleman in Longmont, I thought I was imagining it. I couldn&apos;t believe its speed, and replayed it in my mind several times to get a grasp on the speed at which it must have moved.I still think it&apos;s possible it might have been a low orit satellite since sunset was only a couple of hours before the event.

19980921,19981012,"Redding, CA",light,ongoing,"Witnessing bright lights, mostly white with green and red, in the sky at every point on the compass, starting at 7:00PM and lasting until around 2:30-3:00AM.  Different heights and distances from my position. NOT stars, planets or aircraft.I have been witnessing a recurring sighting of something in the sky over Redding since the 21st of September.  The object(s) are still appearing as of tonight, the 12th of October.  These objects have been witnessed by three of my neighbors as well as my Grandmother, my Nephew and another friend.  The first object appears in the western sky at around 7:10 PM.  It slowly, almost imperceptibly, traverses the sky in a diagonal, downward track until it reaches the crest of a mountain called Boley Mountain which is roughly 6 miles from my location. It then disappears on the other side of the mountain.  Within three minutes, the object, or another identical object, appears in the northern sky, roughly 30 degree&apos;s above the horizon.  From this position, it tracks opposite from its path in the west until by 12:30 AM, it is very high in the northeast.  The object does not get much higher and does not move east or west.  The latest I have watched it is 2:30 AM.  At that time it had moved slightly south.  I got up at 4:30 AM about four nights ago and saw nothing but stars, the moon and planets.  I noticed on the 28th that another, seemingly identical object would appear in the eastern sky at the same time this object moved.  The eastern object must be either over or just east of Redding Municipal Airport.  On October 4th I started finding more of these objects in different positions around my location or encircling Redding.  On the 5th, I counted 16 that I could see.  These objects can only be identified as bright white, green and/or blue and red lights with the red light appearing to pulse or rotate around something.  Very reminisent of the old police &quot;bubble gum&quot; lights or maybe lights reflecting off of one of those aluminum christmas trees.  None of the witnesses, including myself, have been able to see a discernable shape.  I am using a fairly new pair of 20X50 Tasco binoculars to view this.  Not the best but I all I have available.  My neighbor, who was actually the first to see this, has tried to view the object through his 35mm camera using a 300mm telephoto lens.  Still could not make out what it is.  He took some time-lapse photographs of the first object but is not confident of the outcome since all he had was 200 speed film.  I have snapped several photos using a Kodak Max one-time use camera.  I know these will either be blank pictures or of poor quality but they are at least pictures.  Since I am now dealing with so many of these things it is difficult for me to list every objects position and behaviour.  Some of the new ones to the southwest actually appeared very close to the ground. However, being night time and not knowing the distance of my binoculars yet, they could have been thousands of feet in the air.  I think they were close to the ground because of my location and knowing the area they appeared to be over.  I have sensitivity to bright car lights so could not investigate even though I wanted to. I am a white male, 47 years old and have spent the last 17 years working with computers, 14 of those with Tandy Corporation in Texas. I am currently a private consultant.  I do take medications but none would cause this level of hallucination."

We both noticed how bright it was, we had never seen anything like this! Next think we knew the light was right over Mikes vehicle, we stopped and tried to look up at it but it was far to bright to get any lind of identification. There was &quot;no sound&quot; coming from it at all! We watched it for a few moments when we all of a suden heard jet engine noise&apos;s (we were both aircraft maintenance) so we knew the sounds but it wasn&apos;t coming from the light, it came from to British fighters shooting out &quot;photo flash cartridges&quot; to light up the sky for taking photo&apos;s. These were &quot;Recon&quot; birds but this light shoot across the sky like somethinmg out of &quot;Star Wars&quot; with the same type of light as the &quot;light saber&quot; would make!

The aircraft tried to &quot;chase it&quot;, they kicked into &quot;burner&quot; (full throttle - afterburner)but couldn&apos;t even catch up. While we watched this chase, the aircraft seemed almost half way to the city (London) when the light streaked back over us (it was like in the wink of an eye).

I raced back and woke my wife out of her sleep, also the security policeman at the gate (gate-guard) saw the light and asked if &quot;we&quot; saw what was going on!

I just had to report this to some agency that seems to care or at least act like they care! This was no joke! I wish I knew what what it was or that I could see something like that again! I now beleive that this was not of this world. I&apos;m a college graduate and private pilot that was decorated by President Reagan in the Oval Office of the White House (September 1987) for being selected as the Senior Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year for the US Air Force (worldwide, just to let you know that this isn&apos;t some guy making jokes. I now work as a government contractor (on the F-16 aircraft) if you ever would like to discuss this further please let me know (I&apos;m retired from the USAF) and would love to talk about it!"

As we waited for the light to change my husband told me to look out the drivers side window.  Both of us saw what appeared to be a World war 2 military cargo plane.  It was huvering  about 15 feet above the top of our car and slightly to the left.  The plane was a metallic army green color with no jets or propellers on the large wings.  As I started to panic, thinking that it was an air craft about to crash, my husband rolled down his window and told me to listen.  The craft made absolutly no sound.  I looked up at the cockpit window to see if there was a pilot, but the sun was reflecting of the window, and I couldn&apos;t see anyone.  The light turned green and we drove a block and a half to a Dennys restaurant, where my husband parked the car.  I got out and ran into the restaurant grabbing the first person in sight.  An elderly man exiting Dennys.  I asked if he could come with me out side.  I pointed the plane out to him, which had moved about a block away from where I first saw it, towards JC Pennys, at the Florin mall.  By this time it was about 30 feet higher than when I first saw it. It huverd there for a short time befor it slowly decended behind Pennys.  The man saw the plane making its decent.  I said to him &quot;What is that?&quot; as I pointed to the craft.  He stared at it for a few seconds, and replied &quot;I do not know!&quot; He turned and quickly ran to his car. When I first saw the plane it was huvering in one spot it then moved to the side gradually gaining altitude, huvering there for a few seconds, then slowly decended down like a helocopter would land.

After calling my 15 yr old daughter and getting a pair of binoculars, we took turns looking at the craft in the sky as it floated or slowly moved along the tree tops.  Then, before it came to a larger group of trees it seemed to turn south, still at the tree tops, and away from our view.  As it turned away, the shape of the craft changed from an oval with a bright, almost gold, lite in the center, to a more concave shape which we lost in the trees as it went south or fell slighty in the sky.

The window was on the north side of the house.  It was decending at approximately 45 degrees angle east to west, it was huge and around the circumference was seeming low flames with a fiery trail.  It reminded me of the huge special effects of the meteor that carried the space craft in the original &quot;War  of the Worlds&quot; movie.  It was eerie looking,  I was so excited I shouted for my wife to come a see.  By the time she awoke and got to the window it passed from sight.  I called the Ft. Lauderdale International Airport Control Tower and asked if they saw the object.  The person that answered said &quot;No&quot;.  I the called Channel 7 news room and a guy answered, I told him what I saw, he replied that he had not heard of anything.  I asked him if he did would he call me back and I gave him my telephone number.  I thought he was just humoring me when he said he would, but when the phone rang about 15 minutes later it was this fellow at the TV station telling me that the report was coming over the AP wire and that the object had been spotted as far north as Gainsville. He asked me to descibe what I saw again, I did, he thanked me and we hung up.  I could hardly sleep and stayed up most of the night.  The next day I was impatiently waiting for the news reports to come out about the sighting, but I personally never heard anything about it. Someone said something about a falling satelite or some other nonsense. That vision will never leave me.  This evening I discovered your Reporting center and curiosity drove me to find the report which had to be one in the sighting.  I was stunned to finally see a report by someone else that seemingly corroborates what I saw.  That report was posted 6/2/98 and the location was Hamton, Virginia Beach Amusment Park, VA. The report by a photgrapher. I&apos;ve waited 28 years to tell this, boy it feels good! Thanks.Round meteor with flame and trail,  decending as if it were a controlled decent.  The color was Orange/red and bright.  It did not move like a falling star or a burning up satellite or a meteor burning up in our atmosphere.  It was too huge and too controlled."

It was in one of these areas in Tioga County, PA that I was sitting in a lawn chair next to my van watching the sky.  It was extremely dark, yet despite some encroaching haze from the west, the stars were very clear overhead and to the south and east.  I got up to put something in the van, and as I set the object inside,  a light from above and behind me illuminated the area, enough to cause my arm to cast a shadow on the floor of the van.  I turned around in time to see a very bright light, I would estimate at a magnitude of brightness ten times that of Jupiter, located high in the southeast sky.  Suddenly, the light began to fade, made no noise, and before it went completely out, a dim, pale blue light tracked northward away from the source of the brilliant light.  The blue light travelled at roughly the same speed as any high altitude airliner for about 20 seconds, until it too faded out of sight.  I perceived it to be a re-entry of some kind, and, given the troubles with Mir, feared the worst.  The initial brilliant light never moved.  I spent many years in the Air Force.

However, as I focused, I saw it to be a large reddish orange fireball with a very bright and long tail. It appeared only briefly, shooting from left to right, just long enough for me to tell my 11 year old daughter to look at it. We rationalized it must have been a flare or fireworks, but the next day&apos;s paper confirmed our sighting. My background is that I have been a nurse for 22 years, with a degree in Nursing and a degree in Business. I am enrolled in graduate courses at the Citadel. As a child I witnessed a UFO following my brother and I though we told no one. I believe we are not alone in this Universe and we are foolish to even think we are."

It appeared to go down somewhere between my location and the town of Curlew, WA.  I am just south and slightly east of Bodi Mt.. (17 miles south of Canadian Border) A few minutes passed and a light breeze came up from the N. and I smelled a *very* strong smell like just before a rain storm. I think this is the smell of ozone.  This may or may not be associated with the phenomena. There was only a faint wisp of cloud cover and the 1/2 moon was nearly at appex. The fireball reminded me of a flare but there was no sound or scent of explosives. By about 8pm there was considerable airtraffic in the area.  Again this may not be associated with the fireball either but just something I noted. This is the thrid fireball I&apos;ve seen since mid summer.

A second high speed light followed but on a little different direction.  Both lights made no sound.  I believe these lights could&apos;ve been seen from other states due to the height of the moving lights.On 7/12/98 at around 10:25pm I went out back to enjoy the clear night sky and watch an occasional aircraft fly overhead.  This is something I often do.  I&apos;m 39 years old and paraylized from a recreational accident 9 years ago.  I use a Permobil wheel chair that allows me to do weight shifts by reclinging and tilting the seat back to about a 60 degree angle, perfect for watching the night sky.  This particular night was great just after dark.  The sky was clear.  I turned off all back of the house lights including the kitchen light that casted a light onto the patio.  I was in the recline/tilt position for about 10 minutes and was watching two commercial jets pass through the nite sky.  Then I noticed a small non-blinking light (10x smaller than the jet lights)traveling at a high rate of speed from overhead north to south.  I couldn&apos;t believe it.  I was coonvinced I saw something unusual and wished it lasted longer.  Then another non-blinking light appeared after the otherone disappeared.  It&apos;s path was a little different than the first light but very similar.  Both lights made no noise.  If the jets were flying at 30,000 feet (5-6 miles high) the lights I saw appeared to be 100 mile high or higher.  I&apos;ve never reported anything or have seen anything like this.

Object was high in sky and appeared to be smaller than pencil eraser held at arm&apos;s lengthMyself and a friend were standing in my backyard when my friend pointed out the object. I saw it as well. It was high in the sky and very dark in color and moved about the speed of an airplane or slower. At first it appeared to be an airplane, but then it emitted a bright reddish glow that lit up the entire craft. My friend had seen it &quot;flare up&quot; a moment before. The light was not like that of an airplane&apos;s because it gradually brightened and slowly faded, and lit up the entire craft and some of the sky around it. We both ruled out reflection of sunlight because the reddish glow would have been constant. My friend saw the first flash and both of us witnessed 3 more (total of 4 flashes seen). The first flash was a very bright one, seen by my friend. It was followed by 2 less intense flashes. The final one was very bright and dark reddish color. The object then disappeared behind the distant treeline. Note that the flashes were slow, gradual, and varied in intensity and length. Each flash occurred at non-consistent time and remained lit for about 1-2 (long) seconds. The lighting was totally unlike that of an airplane. The object remained in view for around 15-20 seconds. We hope these facts may help you in theorizing explanations about what the object may have been: -The sky was completely cloudless -It was just beginning to get dark(8:30) -Other airplanes were in our view so we could compare their appearance to that of the object we were watching Note that both of us have contributed to and agreed with this report.

It came from the southeast (Monterey Bay) and was heading northwest.  I also thought it was a plane going to the San Jose or SFO Airport until it flew over me. At that point I noticed it was going too slow to be an airplane, although my friend said &quot;wow a stealth bomber!&quot;. There was no sound, it was very low, very large and moved slowly over us, over my house toward the Santa Cruz Mountains. Once over the mountains it would be in the San Jose area. There were very large unblinking lights on each tip that showed the shape of the craft as it flew overhead as a triangle. I wish I spent more time observing it but since my friend said &quot;stealth bomber&quot; that&apos;s what I thought it was.  It was only later I realized a stealth bomber would probably be going much faster, be flying much higher, and make noise.

I remember getting a sneak peek at him while he was in the Hosp. he had white patches on both eyes, he was never the same again after that.

My back yard is rather deep and is backed by a large wooded nature center. All of a sudden a Large Green Fireball appeared from the west and headed out of my sight to the east (Lost it in the tree line). It was about the size of your thumb at arms length. What struck me as strange was the green color and almost sparkler like quality of it. It didnt move as fast as other shooting stars Ive seen. I had it in view for about 5 seconds. I called for my wife to come see it, but she was too late. I scanned the papers and watched the news for the next couple of days, but no one reported anything."
19981001,19981104,"Mosinee, WI",other,5 minutes,"I was driving south on U.S. Hwy 51 and I saw a craft that didn&apos;t move for 5 or more minutes.  The craft also made no noise.As I stated above I was driving south on U.S. 51, travelling from Wausau, WI to Stevens Point, 30 miles away.  Mosinee is approximately 10 miles south of Wausau and the regional airport resides there.  As I passed the airport and got away from the lights of Mosinee I noticed what appeared to be a set of automotive high-beams floating above the treeline about 3 miles ahead.  I assumed it was an airplane, but as I drew nearer I realized that I was the only one in motion.  When I was finally only a mile or so away I saw 2 blue lights on either side blinking in unison, and one light blue flash on top that comes only after the side lights flash.  I slowed from 65mph to approximately 30mph and noticed that it had a saucer-like base but it had 2 C shaped pieces sticking out of either side and almost meeting in the center.  It hadn&apos;t moved since I first saw it and when I was closest I measured it&apos;s altitude with my thumb, and it sat one thumbnail or about 25 feet above the treeline.  It was also right next to a road that overpasses the highway and winds into the countryside.  There are no homes or farms in the immediate vicinity of the sighting.  The second witness was not with me in the vehicle, but rather a truck driver who came up behind me.  I was in the right slow lane,(51 is a 2 lane freeway), he was in the passing lane.  He slowed his rig down to about my speed of 30 mph and I noticed that his attention was fixed on the object to the left of both him and I.  There was other traffic on the other side heading north, so this object was very blatant, it didn&apos;t appear to be hidden."

The craft asended in a straight upward flight exposing its complte triangular shape. The metalic frame of the craft had what appeared to be 10-12 equally spaced thrusters on one side of the craft. After a brief ascent it seemed to turn in a 90 degree angle which I figured was upside down now that the thusters were on the top side. As it rolled into that 90 degree turn the craft took on a thin flat shape. With  the thin edge I could  barely see, I could not see its shape any longer as the craft turned stealth like or (blended in with the blue sky). The thin edge I could still see excellerated so fast to the east that the edge was thinning into nothing. The black helicopter was gone as well but I had completly forgotten about it. I immediately whipped into a conveinent store to see if anyone on the inside just witnessed what I had just seen but no one seemed to be excited from any sighting so I kept it to myself. My family still laughs at me today until today (Sunday Nov. 15th) when the Charlotte Observer,page 2A, a gentleman writes that his wife swears she has recently seen the same type of craft.

The movement was slow.Aproxamatly 2200 hours mountain standard time a friend of mine and I were standing in the parking lot of our apartments talking. I noticed a very slow moving object out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look at for two reasons; 1. we live near Hill AFB and I like to watch the aircraft take off. 2. I noticed that this craft was moving at a very slow rate of speed. Upon closer observation we both noticed that is was only about 150 yards up. The craft we were looking at was a triangular shape with three seperate lights. We atributed these lights to being wing and nose lights. As it neared us we realized that we were wrong about the lights and the origin of this craft. What we were seeing was lights that were more towards the center bottom of the object. The one thing that really struck us as not being right ws the fact that as low as it was flying there was not a single bit of sound coming from it. After the event took place we both decided that maybe we shouldn&apos;t say anything to anyone in fear of ridicule.. A little background on us. He is currently working for a construction company.

Had direct communication with sphere.In October 1961, I awoke from a sound sleep with a feeling the something was in my room.  I was 7 years old.  My older brother (11 yrs) was already awake and he pointed towards a light behind the metal venetian blinds of our first floor bedroom window. I felt compelled to look behind the blind slats.  When I did I was face-to-face with a dull silver  metalic sphere approximately 18-24 inches in diameter.  The sphere was hovering silently and motionless right next to the window glass (single-pane glass with a metal frame).  The sphere had a recessed rectangular panel (approx 10 inches across by 3-4 inches high). There were red dots (unkonwn numer and pattern) and there was a very bright white light at the right and left sides of the panel.  (Two lights total).  The lights were the color and intensity of examiination lights in a dentist&apos;s office or in an operating room.  (At the time I had never seen either type of medical lights before).  The sphere hovered motionless and I was in direct communication with the sphere.  It was a very strange sense of consciousness that I never experienced before the event.  I was paralyzed and was in a one-way communication with the sphere.  It was telling me things in my head without audible words.  I was unable to understand specifically what was being said, but it was very important that I listen to the messages.  I believe there were at least four simulataneous &quot;voices&quot; talking at the same time in Engilish as I starred into the sphere.  It was a multi-voice message.  My brother was not involved in this contact.  The sphere slowly began to rotate silently  away from me to my right.  As it rotated, the lights went off.  The sphere&apos;s motion was very smooth and silent.  It rose more rapid;ly and disappeared into the sky.  My brother did not look out the window as far as I know.  I still look out the window evey night before I go to bed and whenever I wake up during the night to check for something.  I am now 44 years old.  Has anyone else seen a sphere such as this?"

It was only there for a little over a full second then a bright silverish vertical flash appeared(reminded me of something like on star trek, when they transport), followed by a flash similar to a &quot;mirror&quot; flash and it was just gone. I pulled up my bino&apos;s to see if I could see anything in the vicinity and there was absolutely nothing. the object like I said was kind a oval, but more like a circle with one flattened side to it, the flash appeared from this flattened side while it vanished. a guy I work with said his sister had seen a &quot;UFO&quot; the day before i did, this was after I had mentioned to him that I had seen one that he said his sister had mentioned to him a day earlier that she&apos;d seen one.  I haven&apos;t learned the details of her sighting yet. That&apos;s it."
19660610,19981109,"Hickory, NC",disk,5 minutes,"Bright Light in distance over mountains moves in very quickly, then moves slowly over suburban commercial district (Kmart).The object was initially a pinpoint in the distance. Within 20 seconds it moved into our area and slowed down to a low speed. It was dark and we could see only the lights but I estimate it to have been 300 feet in diameter (a perfectly round disk or squat cylinder with slightly domed top) and perhaps 50 feet tall.  It had a band of lights around the perimeter through which lights pulsated in a teardrop pattern (a band of teardrops moving head to tail around the perimeter of the object).  The faster the ship moved, the faster the light pattern went around the perimeter.  The lights were white.  The reason I surmise it had a domed top is because there was a blue light on top that moved around in a semi-spherical motion.  The object was utterly silent and incredibly swift.  If you did not look, you would not have known it was there.  There were other witnesses but no one spoke of it.  The object disappeared over a hill behind us and did not reappear.((NUFORC Note:  The following message is submitted on July 10, 2001, by the individual who submitted the report above.))I am one of the two people who have reported the disk in Hickory NC in June 1966.  The other reported sighting corroborates exactly what I saw but they reported seeing it about 2 days after I saw it, ...it has been a long time... I have also seen a report elsewhere on a very similar craft around the same time in Venice, California.  It could also be the craft of Hingham, Mass., sighting of 4/1/66.  There was also a similar craft illustrated on a UFO documentary a few years ago (it looked like the craft I saw, with the teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter but was much smaller than the craft I saw). My question is, how best can I research this particular craft at that time?  It was quite large, probably 300&apos; diameter and 50&apos; thick.  It had a pattern of large white teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter of the disk.  There was a blue light either above or below.  Other than that there were no visible features, except that it blocked out the! stars as it flew over.Thanks,((name deleted))  ph 678-((number deleted))((NUFORC Response to July 10, 2001, message))Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),Thank you very much for the message, and for the information.With regard to researching the events, there is probably no better way than going to local newspapers.  If even just a small group of people witnessed the object, newspaper reports might have been generated in the local publications.  Since UFO materials usually get front page coverage in local papers, you can usually scan just the front page of every issue, and that will tell you whether you are looking at the correct edition.If you have had sightings that you have not submitted to our Online Report Form, I would welcome such reports.  If you could take just a few minutes to generate a description of each sighting and submit it, using that form, that will preserve the sighting, and make it available to others to read.Also, if you would like to submit an illustration of the objects you have witnessed, we will scan them, and post them with your report in the future.Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!Cordially,Peter Davenport((END JULY 10, 2001, REPLY))((SECOND CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF REPORT))This is a correction for a sighting that I posted several years ago. I posted that the sighting was June 8, 1966. That was an approximate date. My mother passed away recently and, going thru her effects I found an entry in her journal for the noted event. The date that she wrote down was June 10, 1966. Ibelieve that her date is more accurate than my date. If you like, please change the date from the 8th to the 10th.Thank you.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the witness for investigating the sighting further, and obtaining the precise date for the sighting.

It got brighter and brighter, so I began to watch it closely.  We seemed to be coming up on the object, and I then thought that it was a jet plane with its light on.  It did not seem to be approaching us however, as we saw the light for at least ten minutes. As we approached the object, it was evident that it was NOT moving, but hovering directly over the freeway.  Its light was lighting up the freeway and the surrounding fields, as a plane light would, but it was not moving!  It was light like a search light it guess?  About that bright.   My assumption was that of a Harrier Jumpjet, but as we drove under the object, the was absolutely NO jet sound, and we did not notice a tail. The object was boomerag shaped, with green and red lights on the end of the &quot;wings&quot; I did not stop, as we were in a line of cars traveling together home to Portland OR, and as that my wife was petrified of the object, but everyone we were traveling with saw it, and could not explain it. I was not going to report it, as I thought that it was military considering the red and green lights on the ends, but there is no military base that I know of out there, and after hearing the womans report from Portland OR, on the Art Bell show of a triangular object in the sky with no sound, it sounded awfully familiar, and I though it was my duty to give the info I had, valid or not."

No sound, long tail.I live on the shoreline of Lake Erie. My girlfriend and I are police officers and both work the night shift.  We both are very enthusiastic about the night sky and were about to use my telescope on this date. It was an unusual night right from the beginning.  At about 2400 hrs. we both observed a spectacular display of the Northern Lights all along the length of the Lake.  That is unusual here. It lasted approximately 20 minutes.  Shortly thereafter, we went back to the telescope and were observing Jupiter and Saturn.  At approx. 0130 hrs. we were both startled by a Large Orange Fireball that appeared in the SW sky.  It traveled very slowly in a straight path at approx. 30 degrees to the southern horizon toward the SE.  The object had a very long tail which was also Bright Orange.  We did witness any sound.  It is very quiet here also.  It was difficult to say how far away it was. Although, it didn&apos;t appear to be very far away.  we viewed it until we lost it in the horizon....it didn&apos;t appear to burn up. We both have seen many things in the night sky before from many types of meteorites to having seen sattelites return to earth.  but have not seen anything like this. I probably would not have reported this if I hadn&apos;t heard of so many similiar sights on your appearance on the Art Bell Program the other night. Another funny thing happened that morning.  I had to appear in court that morning and drove my truck.  It is newer with the digital compass in the rearview mirror.

The object&apos;s lights were elliptical in shape, had an outer ellipse that glowed a dark orange color and contained a smaller yellow white ellipse. The three objects moved in perfect unison with one another as they passed in the sky. They did not vary up or down but the triangle did tend to flatten as it passed across the night sky. The stars it passed in front of were blocked and could not be seen between the 3 lights giving the indication of sides to the object. The three lights did not disappear over the horizon (past trees, houses, etc.) but stayed in the sky and disappeared into the darkness. The object appeared to be very high in the sky (10-20 miles) and moved very quickly as it passed. There was no sound that could be heard. This was unlike anything ever seen by any of the three of us.

As we were looking we saw a bright light that was &quot;gliding&quot; across the sky we were shocked because we could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane. Soon another light appeared floating nearby the first.  We watched them for awhile until we began to lose sight of them so we ran down the road to a park to watch more. When we got there, what appeared to be two jets (possibly from Grissom Air Force Base) were in pursuit of the lights.  The lights broke off from each other and the jets broke off to follow. The first jet went after the first light and as the jet got near to it, it seemed like the light paused for a moment and suddenly shot across the sky leaving the jet behind like it was standing still. The second jet followed the second light until it got too close and suddenly the second light made a DEAD stop in the air and made a complete reverse of direction passing the jet and soon after disappearing in the same fashion as the first.

The size of the light was about 3/4 the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. I understand that stars somtimes (twinkle) and planets do not however no other stars doing anythig odd at this time.

Rd. 810, I observed a very large flash of yellow lights in a diamond shape sequence, immediately following this flash was a blast of what appeared to be fire from the rear.  I saw no &quot;shape&quot;, just these flashes, and the flame.  The night was rather clear, with no clouds.  The object appeared to be flying in a downward motion.  I recall thinking that if it continued to fly in this manner, it appeared as if it would land in Hidden Acres Campgrounds.  I observed this phenomenon 5 times before turning onto Twp. Rd. 810, and immediately onto the private drive.  I was still watching this through the trees, and saw it flash and fire 3 more times.  I parked my car, and got out to see if I could see it better.  When I did so, it was gone. If comparing these yellow lights, if a star would appear as a . (period), then these lights appeared to be o (a lower case o).  There appeared to be 4 seperate lights, but all flashed together. The &quot;fire&quot; from the end of it was even larger. I would compare the width of it from a small &quot;o&quot; to a capital &quot;O&quot;. And the length of it was 4 times more. The lights were yellow, reminding me of caution lights, the flame, was first in line was blue, and then orange, and then red, but all together. Very similar to what a jet engine looks like when it takes off and the flame shoots out the back of the engine.

We had not been drinking or undre the influence of any narcotics when we all saw a crystiline like apparition coming towards us at a high rate of speed. I think it was traveling at a speed faster than 150mph. The apparition  traveled towards us and flew over our heads at least 100 feet  above the ledge. The wind current that hit us after was extremly strong and we were almost blown over. The shape and composition of the apparition was like no other I had seen. It reminded me of a swarm of fireflies with multi-colored tails. All of my friends agree to these details in full. None of us have any clue what it was.

The sky was in full view with no clouds. As I was singing I looked up and saw a very bright sphere like object moving very fast across the sky from West to East. Before the object disapeared, it shot out a bright orange/red flame from the back of its flight line. The flame did not extend that far from the object. The object was in view for around 5 seconds, then just disapeared. My guitar player also saw this event.

The road is hilly and twisty with no place to stop, so I&apos;m not sure where it went after we saw it. From the time we first saw it until it disappeared couldn&apos;t have been more than a few seconds. It was being followed by a military jet. It was also less that 1000 feet up, and clearly following the objest. The plane was close enough so we could hear the jets roar, and this was with the car windows rolled up and the radio on. The jet made a turn toward the south, I know this because I could see two cones from the exhause of the jet."

After the fifteen minutes, I decided to check out UFO websites for reporting. When I came inside to do this the object was in the same place as I originally saw it. I had to go back outside to see if it was still there when the form asked for a duration period. The object had changed its position.

They all illuminated bright white lights that would light up the surrounding sky. There were airplanes flying all around them so we ruled out aircraft. They weren&apos;t planets or stars because they kept illuminating a bright light that got brighter then dimmer.

19980711,19980711,"Hwy 30, heading west, PA",other,15 secs,"A black jet chasing a prop plane with unusually long wings at extremely high speed. Jet was right on planes tail a plane was twisting back and forth in an evasive manner. Plane fuselage was skinney almost non-existant. Both vanished in clear blue sky in 10-15 seconds getting smaller as thay went off in the distance.My wife,2 children and I were on our way to visit relatives in Lancaster, PA. heading west on Route 30(Coatsville-Downington By-pass)about 7-10 miles east of Octorara Trail (Hwy 10)when I saw a very dark black jet chasing what at first appeared to be a propeller powered plane with an extremely long wing span. Both planes were heading almost due north from the south side of Hwy 30. I first caught sight of them when they were slightly off to the left and about 30 degrees above the horizon. They were about 1000-2000 feet away(and maybe at an altitude of 800-1200 feet) and moving extremely fast( I would guess at between 1000-1500 mph. My guess is based on seeing passenger jets go over at about 3000 feet and knowing their speed to be about 650 mph. However I am not too confident of my air speed estimates, but they were moving much faster than what I&apos;m used to seeing. The black jet was right on the tail of the other craft( if my previous guess of their distance from us was correct at 1000-2000 feet then these craft were no more than 100-200 feet apart and maintained that distance thruout the sighting. The jet appeared to be chasing the plane. The plane&apos;s wings were rocking back and forth(twisting)giving me the impression that the plane was trying to evade the jet, however the twisting seemed not to effect the direction that the plane was heading. The twisting motion was as though its very thin fuselage was rotating on its axis which caused the wings to pivot up and down.Howver, that this did not effect its flight path! In fact the entire apparent pursuit was virtually a straight line from left(south) to right(north)where the 2 craft quickly receded into the distance. From the time I first saw them until thay disappeared 10-15 seconds had elapsed. They disappeared from sight to the right of my first sight of them and they had traversed about 45 degrees of arc(based on 360 degrees)during the 10-15 seconds.As soon as I saw the craft I called them to the attention of my family, my wife(43), daughter(11), and son (! 7). My wife and daughter saw it within a few seconds but my son didn&apos;t(he wasn&apos;t wearing his glasses and didn&apos;t immediately start looking when I called out to them.)I was driving and had to look forward several times during the sighting to make sure we were still on the road. Therefore I did not get to take in as much detail as I would have liked. My daughter watched from the time I called out until the craft disappeared. She atarted watching about 3-4 seconds after I did. I called out almost immediately after I saw the craft because they looked so odd. In fact when I first saw them I thought they might be models- but their speed and the distance they were covering ruled that out right away. Halfway through the sighting I started to doubt that the plane was a plane with extra long wings and a very thin fuselage but might be a long flat rectangle flying sideways! That seemed almost as absurd as a prop plane being chased at high speed by a jet! My wife had little to say about the event when we later were discussing the sightings later that afternoon. Her main comment was that the black jet was a shadow of the first craft. My daughter and I took her to task over that as planes don&apos;t cast shadows on the sky! I am a construction Project Manager with both feet firmly on the ground. I do have an avid interest in things scientific and paranormal-including UFO&apos;s. My wife does not share my interests even a little bit and the sighting left  a little desperate for an answer-thus the shadow. The plane that was in the front had a metallic quality to it-more gray than shiney."

A point of very bright light that was about the size that a large planet would appear in the night sky, moved quickly and deliberatly in a perfectly straight, horizontal line from the point it had been sitting at to a point an unknown distance away (it may have moved about a foot if a ruler could be held to the sky).  Upon abruptly stopping, it disappeared.  I was unsettled as I had never seen anything like this before. It was a point of light in the sky that suddenly and unexpectedly moved.  I had watched it remain inanimate for approximately 1 minute before it just took off.  It was not a meteorite or shooting star, as these don&apos;t move horizontally in such a perfect line, or with such deliberate manner.  A plane (of the kind that are seen around here, namely commercial jets) cannot possibly move that quickly.

The fireball was about 4 times the size of Jupiter currently in the Southern sky and brighter than a full winter moon.  The inner core of the object was a very bright white and the larger corona was a very intense blue-green color.  The tail was seperated from the object and was also blue-green with shades of yellow and red.  I-495 is the mega-highway that encircles the Washington D.C. metropolitan area and is extremely well lit.

We lived in what was called Riedels trailer park in Schertz, TX, off of highway 78. My dad was stationed at Randolph AFB and it was only 1.5 miles down the road. This one afternoon I went outside to check if my siblings were coming down the road home and glanced up in the sky between the trees that were on each side of our road and approx 150 FT in the air was a whitish disk sailing through the air with no sound. It was tilted on its axis toward me like it was making a turn. I froze and followed it through the air which was about 15 secs when it became obstucted from my view by the old Starlite theater screen we lived directly behind. i have told a few people in my liftime and the best i always described it was like it was made out of concrete, the color description it looked like. It was approx i&apos;d say 50 ft in diameter and approx 8 to 10 feet thick. it was like a giant nickel but whitish color. there were not any markings on it i could see and no windows. I never heard a sound. The weather that day was clear and i was i&apos;d say approx 1/4 to 1/2 mile away from it as it seem to make an arc in flight around me. I rushed in the house and told my mom but she said i probably just saw an airplane. I was about 4 to 5 years old at the time. I would have to assume that alot of people would have seen it since it was so close to ground and good weather. I havent seen anything in the blue book files about it; you&apos;d think you would since it was right by the air force base. The object left no trail or emitted any kind of light either."

Traveled between mach 4 and mach 10.  Could not see object.  Could only hear it.My six year old son and I were working in the back yard when I heard a loud whooshing sound from approx. 10 miles NW of my location.  At first I thought it might be the sound of a very large fire, such as a large farm structure burning.  Then I noticed the sound was moving from NW to NNW.  The sound then appeared to calm down for a portion of a minute.  Next the sound began to move rapidly in my direction and passed almost directly overhead.  Neither my son nor I could see anything, but I judged by the level of the noise that the source of the noise was either very low in altitude (500-1000 Ft.) or the object was very large and moving air like an object larger than several barns.  The sound continued in a SSW direction for about 30-40 seconds and then appeared to travel beyond audible range.  I estimate the distance traveled to be about 40 miles in under a minute.  On a map this would have been approx. 10 miles SSW of Corvallis, OR. to the vicinity of Springfield, OR..  For the entire duration of this event, I could not see any flashes of metal, nor could I see a con-trail or any other evidence of a common aircraft.  After I thought about this event for five or ten minutes, I decided to call air traffic control at the Eugene airport to see if they had noticed anything or had phone calls about an unusual event.  Their reply was negative. I am reporting this event 3 months after the actual occurance, so the exact date and time are approximations.

I noted it in the back of my mind and went on about my business, until Art Bell came on and I heard about the large sighting in Seattle a couple of hours later.

It was a silverish metallic color, I don&apos;t remember if this one had lights or not.  There was no noise or humming, it just sat in air, I do not remember it leaving.I do not wish for my name to be used, my husband would never believe me.  My grandfather, a minister in Chocowinity, suggessted that I contact you about this.  This incident is not the first one I have encountered, I remember at least four more.  However this one was different in the fact that it was much larger, it made no noise, and most of all, this time I was not afraid.  I felt a since of familiarity with them or it.  I remember reaching up to touch it ( I think I did touch it, but I could not bet my life on it), and thinking it was bigger than the last, and actually admiring it.  I am a very stable and sane person, I have never really believed in them, even after the first encounter, I just kind of blocked it out.  The first one came when I was about 11 years old, my brother was about five.  We were standing at the edge of our field playing when a small saucer shaped object flew down and hoovered above our heads only about two to three feet from us.  It made a hypnotizing humming noise.  We stood frozen with fear and awe,(I don&apos;t know how long we stood there) then we started running as it chased us about a hundred yards then dissappeared.  The strangest thing was we hardly ever talked about it.  You would think as kids, we would of tried to tell the whole world.  We just did not have much to say about it to anyone, not even each other.  It was very small though, I don&apos;t think any &quot;being&quot; could ride in it.  It was about the size of a a teachers desk.  The one I saw on Monday was much larger though, about the size of a car.  I know that someone out there knows what these things are, and I want to know.  I am not afraid anymore, in fact, I actually now look forward to the next time.  Can anyone tell me why it would pick me?  Oh, and I don&apos;t know if this will help, but every incedent has occurred between June and September.  I do not wish to go public with this, I know people would think I am crazy, but I think anyone that does not believe it is possible is crazy and ignorant.

The objects didn&apos;t appear to be balloons and were definitely not aircraft.The objects seemed to move independent of each other but at times did move together.

Balloons were ruled out because no one in our area has a hot air balloon and we&apos;ve never heard of 7 weather balloons being launched at the same time. The objects eventually moved due east, heading out over the ocean. One of the observers managed to videotape the sighting and when he asked his neighbors for their thoughts (they witnessed it as well), they had no idea as to its origin either. Although the observers watched the object by eye and with binoculars for close to 30 minutes, it was nearly impossible to detect any specific features on the objects.

19881222,19980804,"Santa Rosa (23 km. south of), CA",changing,2 hours,"First off, I am a very skeptical person.  At the time of the sighting, I was a California Highway Patrol Officer for 6 years and very good at detail and observation.  A friens and I were driving fron San Jose, CA. to Mazatlan, Mexico over Christmas holidays in Dec. 1988.  It was approximately 3:55 a.m. when my friend kept insisting that I look out the driver&apos;s window (he was driving, I was in the passenger&apos;s seat).  I was busy talking and kept ignoring his request.  Finally, just to shut him up, I looked out his window.  What I saw made me scream in excitement, not fear.  I told him to immediately pull off the road so I could have a better look.  I sat on the hood of the car for the next 2 hours writing down my observations.  We thought, at first, that what we were looking at was a freak act of nature where a star was unusually close to the earth.  It looked like a partical star at first except that it was 3/4 the size of the full moon that was out that night.  Also, when we were driving, my friend told me that this object he was looking at did not seem to be left in the distance as we were driving, but rather keeping parallel to us.  It was hugh!  If the stars in the sky could be compared to a golf ball, this ufo was the size of a  over-sized basketball!  At first, it was just this white light being eminated from it&apos;s center.  There was no solidness to it, just lights being refracted.  The &quot;star&quot;  slowly floated in several directions ( I wrote it all down as to it&apos;s positions) with no rhymm or reason.  Then it changed colors and a red light appeared in the center of this &quot;star&quot; horizontally and vertically (like a cross), in it&apos;s center.  It still continued to &quot;float&quot; from left to right and up and down.  The object continued to change color as the points of the light continued to grow and shrink with a blue color. (It looked like a starburst that was growing and shinking.  At this time, I still thought that it was some unusual astronomical  disturbances until this &quot;star&quot; suddenly &quot;ZOOMED&quot; in closer to us! .At this time, I became fearful and jumped into the car.  this &quot;star&quot; &quot;ZOMED back and forth without any visible  signs of movement!  My best analogy would be this,  it looked like the opening and closing of a camera lens, (like the aperature of a camera opening and closing.  It was as if this &quot;star&quot; &quot;Zoomed&quot; in on us to take a better look!  Ithe &quot;star&quot; continued to change colors from white with red, to white with red, to white with red and blue.  It contiued to slowly float in various directions and changing shapes.  As the sun was rising,  the other stars in the sky disappeared except for this one.  It was the only object in the sky as the sun rose.  The lights disappeared as the sun was rising and I expected the object to disappear.  Instead, a thin, long silver/gray line in the sky remained.  There was no longer lights, but rather a very bright or very big object remained.  As the sun was high in the sky, this &quot;star&quot; slowly drifted higher and higher into the sky until just a pinpoint was visible.  It slowly disappeared. As we arrived in Mazatlan, I quickly bought the newspapers to read of the incident.  No article was written re: a U.F.O that night.  THIS WAS NOT A WEATHER BALLOON OR ANY OTHER MILITARY OR GOVERNMENTAL EXPERIMENT.NOTHING ON THIS EARTH COULD POSSIBLY MOVE AND &quot;ZOOM&quot; AS THIS &quot;STAR DID!"

19980727,19980918,"Castle Creek, NY",circle,10 sec,"Driving home from work on a clear night, I saw in the middle of the sky four bright lights grouped together in the shape of a square.  They didn&apos;t appear to be moving.I think it was the last tuesday of the month of July.  I had just gotten done with work, and it was about 9:13 pm.  I wasn&apos;t looking for anything, I was just driving home, like I did every other night.  (currently I am enrolled in college)  I live on a big hill, with a nice view, so when I got half of the way up there I saw some lights in the sky.  It was freaky, all I could do is stare.  Then I got to a patch of trees where I couldn&apos;t see anything anymore.  The sight scared me so much that as soon as I got home, I told my dad about it and I took my younger brother down to the exact spot to see it again.  When we got down there, it was nowhere to be seen.  I waited a bit, but nothing happened so we drove back home.  As I recall, there were four bright objects, floating directly in the center of the sky.  There is no way they could have been attached to anything on the ground.  Since then I put it in the back of my mind, saying that it was just my imagination, that I wanted to see a ufo so much, that I wanted to believe so much, that I created the image in my head.  I discredited the fact that it could have been a reflection in my mirror or window because there were no other lights around, and no one had been following me that night.  So I forgot about the whole incident, until today.  I just read the November 1998 issue of UFO magazine, and on page 9 it shows a picture exactly of what I saw that night.  I am now, totally convinced that what I saw that night can be classified as a UFO.  The sighting that was pictured in the magazine was taken in Texas, in 1996 and I had never seen the magazine before in my life.  I don&apos;t think that I could have made something like that up on my own."

It might have been several craft in a straight line, but I&apos;m not sure.  It didn&apos;t have any beacon lights. The color of the lights was white or yellow, but I don&apos;t remember exactly.  At the time, I was 9.  Don&apos;t think that I was young and made a mistake, I was sure of what I saw, because my friend saw it too.  He was 10.  We both were at an astronomy night at my school, and we were the only ones that saw it, as far as we know.  It was visible to the naked eye.  It was either very large, or very close.  Since it was at night, it was hard to tell how large or far it was.  It was just hovering, and we were watching it from the north, so it was south of us. we were on an asphault campus maybe 80-100 yards north to south.  We spotted the UFO over a tree that was about 100 yards away, and maybe 50 feet high.  From our view, the thing was as long as the tree is wide (including the branches).  About 10 seconds of watching it, it started moving west, but made a zigzag, and moved east, somewhat downward, until it disappeared behind some trees and buildings.  I seemed a little slow, but if it was as large as a Boeing 747, it was moving a little faster than a 747 5 miles from the runway.  I have another sighting, but it isn&apos;t mine, so I just want to say, my dad and brother saw the same thing almost exactly 3 years later, only it moved a little faster.

I arrived at my girlfriend&apos;s house to find her with her neighbors on the back porch who had been watching the same thing.  They claimed that the lights were swaying as they moved up the sky and 2 of them looked like they exploded and there were bright white sparks when this happened.

He commented &quot;There are no blinking lights from this object which is unusual for a flying object at night.&quot; I stopped our van off the side of the highway. We saw a disc with lights all around it glowing from inside. We saw the shape of it very well; maybe from city lights or moonlight. The left and right side of the disc shape was not a pointed shape as in most photos. The shape of the disc had sharp corners more like rectangles, yet it looked like a disc. It hovered above trees for a few minutes and moved toward the right behind trees. So then I moved the van a few feet and saw it hovering again. The disc was close to the trees, did this once more, and we followed again to be able to see it. And then it went behind trees one last time and it disapeared from our vision. It did not spin or glow, it just hovered in one place for a few minutes at a time and slowly went behind trees toward our right. I had never seen a Ufo before. My husband saw one in 1978 while on duty at Fort Dix, New Jersey, 04:30am with 250-300 hundred other soldiers. As for this recent sighting this July 98&apos;, the oddest aspect to him was that there were no blinking lights, no apparent motion at times, and that the shape was large and seemed cigar shaped to him. We drew pictures of what we both saw. And what we saw was very similar. The best and frankly the only way to describe it was to draw a picture of it.

I stepped out of the doorway to look in that direction and heard a second noise exactly the  same.  At that time I was looking at the horizon (tree top level) and saw a bright green flash ( I did not see the &quot;ignition&quot; it was a flash that had occurred and retained the shape of the flash).  It was like a jagged edged star with many irregular points, like a cartoon explosion.  It was bright green, rimmed with white, and retained that complete shape as it streaked down from the sky.  The streaking downward coincided directly with the loud noise (the noise followed the downward path) until it was below my point of vision.  It did not burn out on it&apos;s way down but retained the shape the entire time.  I did not hear a crash or any ending, the noise just quit. From my location at Scottsdale Rd. and McDowell Rd. it would have been approximately over 4 Peaks or maybe a little south of there.  There were very few stars in that direction, and it occured between two stars that are about 2 fingers apart vertically at arms length, and about 6-7 inches above the horizon at arms length.  It started just below the top star and a little to the north, and streamed down at about a 60 degree angle in a northwesterly direction.  The entire episode lasted about 10 seconds.

I was in Oxford, MS on business, and stopped at a friends apartment befor going out for the night.  On the drive over, my other friends and I had japed that it was a perfect night to see a U.F.O. because of the beautiful clear sky.  I stepped out back (9:45)to light a cigarette, and happened to glance at the tree covered sky line, to see what I thought was a kite flying in the distance.  It appeared to be a black plastic triangular kite, barely reflecting the light.  As the object got closer (about the size of my hand held at arms leangth), I thought maybe someone had lost a kite and it was flying free. The only thing that seemed stange was the fact that the object was flying in a straight line. At this point I realized I could make out the shape of the object because of it&apos;s reflective or illuminated front sides.  As the thing approched almost directly overhead the it was still almost invisible, other than the nine or eleven very dim lights outlining the front.  at this time it had gone from legal pad sized to a full arms lenght across.  I new I didn&apos;t have a camera, so I called into the apartment to get some attention.

19760721,19981102,"Brevard, NC",sphere,5 minutes,"Saw two star-like objects, one bluish, theother orange, remain stationary for at least 5 minutes, then, in sequence and at about a 2 minute interval, zig-zag rapidly for several inches, then accelerate in a straight line and fade away.My sister and I hiked to the top of a bald mountain, Black Balsam Knob (about 5800&apos;), in Haywood County in North Carolina.  It was a cloudless night with no moon at the time.  We arrived at the top of the mountain about 9:45pm.  We had an unobstructed 360 degree view of the horizon.  We ate sandwiches as a late dinner, and gazed at the stars, locating several constellations, the Milky Way, etc. in the clear mountain air. After eating, we lay on our backs and looked at the sky with our 8x35 binoculars.  Almost directly overhead, near the constellation Cygnus, we saw two objects that we were uncertain about.  Both were slightly larger than stars, one bluish and one orange-tinted.  Neither were familiar to us, though we had been amateur astronomers throughout our youth.  They were no brighter than Vega, an Magnitude Order 1star.  We commented to one another about these two objects of which we were unfamiliar. I looked at the orange-tinted one through the binoculars to see if it might be a planet, but could not identify it as such.  As I was watching it, the binoculars stable against my eye sockets and my head resting directly on a rock, I observed the object begin to move in a zig-zag pattern toward the southeast, with abrupt near-ninety-degree turns at each zig or zag.  The zig-zags were not large, but were about the distance of the width of my index finger held at arm&apos;s length, relative to the stars.  After zig-zagging about the distance of the width of my hand held at arm&apos;s length, the object accelerated in a straight line for another realtive two inches, then faded from view.  The object did not change in intensity of brightness or color during its movement. The duration of movement was about four seconds. This amazed me, and I exclaimed how cool it was and asked my sister if she saw it.  She answered with an anxious yes.  We discussed what it might have been, and she asked for the binoculars.  I gave them to her, and we commented on the strange bluish object.  As she was watching the bluish object with the binoculars, and I with my naked eye, it proceeeded to move in the same manner as the orange-tinted object, and faded from view. There were no sounds emanating from either object.  We ruled out helicopters due to the no-sound factor, and that we were already at almost 6000 feet.  We ruled out airplanes, due to the impossibility of performing the stationary moevement, then the zig-zag.  Same for balloons.  While they might have been satelites, this does not explain the erratic and substantial zig-zag movement, nor the change from being a stationary object to being a moving one.  They were not comets, as these obviously do not have an apparent movement over that small a time-interval.  They did not behave like meteors, in that they were clearly visible in a stationary fashion for at least five minutes before they moved.  We were left with no aceptable explanation in identifying these. My sister was a rising junior at a state university, and I was a rising freshman at UNC.  Neither of us took drugs or alcohol."

I was on my way home and my brother was with me. I had just turned off Highway 18 near S.I.R. in Kent, WA. When I rounded the turn on the exit ramp I saw a very bright, round ball of orange light. It was small from my view and at treetop level.  I have no way of judging the distance because it was just hazy enough to block out any terrain refferences or landmarks.  The object appeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon, at treetop level (from my perspective).  The object was south of my position. It moved at a high rate of speed from East to West. I observed it for about 6 seconds then it was gone. When I made the turn off the highway I was headed West, the light was moving past me, not in the opposite direction as when you pass a light on a pole.

I saw it from a distance for a very long time, but for a minute or two it came extremely close. seconds after it took of never to be seen that night but as NASA&apos;S project continiud more sightings apeared. I believe that what NASA was doing was distracting the public so that some other government agency would have the chance to perform their testing of a program in fact something was happening on the opposit side of the Island in lajas this is a town on the southwest side. After watching NASA have a rocket failier on almost every one of this, I began wondering NASA CAN&apos;T be so disorganize. That&apos;s when I personally saw a lot of activity on the sorounding area of the laguna cartagena, many different government and military vehicles sighted there all thru the same time NASA was launghing rockets. Look I spent some time in the military with top secret clearence and I know something enough to understand that something is going on. Soon after roswell was hit by the media that&apos;s when plenty of night activity in the skies began hapening more government personel were being seen and on US military bases housing construction for more military personel is taking place at this very moment.

They did not move but remained motionless. Very bright but looked like large polished silver balls. The most forward of the balls suddenly inflated in size and then they all vanished.I could not tell the size of the object. They seemed to be within a mile or so. To me they looked @ 3 inches big from the distance I viewed them. I would guess they were ten feet in diameter or larger. The day was partly cloudy. The interstate runs downhill at the point where I noticed them. They remained for @ 5 minutes before the sphere closest to me became larger and then they all disappeared. I was wondering if any one else had seen it out of the many people on the interstate going home. The objects were a good 50-70 ft off the ground. I could not tell if they were lighted or if the sun was reflecting. That is really the only thing from the list below that I saw.

Object when first sighted was moving towards the west.On the night of November 12, in Bend, Oregon, I was outside of my home observing the moon and the planets currently visible. My roommate had asked that if they were at all visible to let him know (it has been overcast alot here lately). It was clear. I went in and we both came out. I was pointing out a neighborhood light that was in violation of an Oregon code because it was not subdued (any amateur astronomer can relate,) when he pointed to an object in the sky and asked me what it was. I first saw the object heading due west and was about to say it must be an airliner when I saw it do an unbelievable U-turn. Astonished, we both watched this &apos;craft&apos; do maneuvers that would be impossible for any known aircraft to perform. I am a veteran, and used to work while A-10&apos;s and a variety of other aircraft flew overhead. What we saw seemed to be so unhindered by gravity that I can only describe it&apos;s behavior as playful, like it was &apos;dancing&apos; in the air. It performed multiple U-turns, and would accelerate to incredible speeds and then come to a complete halt in what seemed milliseconds. It made absolutely no sound at all. I would estimate it&apos;s distance from us to be anywhere from one to three miles away, and it&apos;s size as possibly quite large. I did see a very distinct &apos;disk&apos; shape. The thing eventually seemed to vanish, and we remained outside for about another hour watching for it before we gave up and went inside. I am an Archaeology student, my roommate is a Geologist. We are both well grounded in science and the tradition that believes empirical data adds to the human understanding of ourselves and our surroundings. If this comes off sounding like a disclaimer let me just add that our &apos;data&apos; goes against everything we have been tought to believe. I did not want, nor wish, to see such a thing.

The formation seemed to narrow (tighten) and then spread out ... meanwhile one light was zig zagging in and out of the formation. A plane circling for landing at Toronto International Airport could not have missed the spectacle in the sky above them .We thought at first we might be looking at migrating geese with the lights of the city reflected off their white bellies, but apparently Canada Geese seldom fly at night, prefering to rest, and besides the lights appeared to be much too high up for geese... the lights were the size of bright stars. A week later I saw a single object streak accross the sky, around the same time of night. This object was much lower down, and appeared to be triangular(although it seemed to have wings) in shape, it looked almost translucent and was a shimmering bright orange. It was travelling from the South East, towards the North over the city of Waterloo, at a speed much faster than any plane I have ever seen. Both these sightings have left us puzzled and a little scared... the more time passes the more we doubt our own eyes and the experience we both had. Very interesting! The day after I had the single sighting, I phoned a professor who has a strong interest in Astronomy at the University of Waterloo. She was extremely interested and told me that she had been seeing unexplained lights near the horizon for a week, and like us, thought their must be some other explaination for them.

See description below.After calling my roommate upstairs I stuck a pair of binoculars in his hands and, before telling him what I saw, I asked him to describe what it looked like to him.  Through the binoculars he saw five or six lights arranged in a compressed oval pattern.  Through the binculars each of these lights seemed rather faint, but with the naked eye it was very bright and impossible to miss the colors flashing between red, blue and white (the colors changed rapidly, more than a strobe light even).  To my surprise, he was seeing EXACTLY what I was seeing.  We watched it for about twenty minutes and, before we decided to give it a rest, what was originally five or six lights had become one -- perhaps whatever it was was moving farther away, although it seemed to hold the same position for the time we watched.  (I continued to watch it from my bed -- I&apos;m in a loft and have a terrific view of the sky.) If I had to pinpoint an exact location of the light, I would place it at at least two miles away in the SW sky over Lake Michigan.  I&apos;m on the North Side, so I guess that would put it parallel with the Lincoln Park/Gold Coast area.  It could easily have been overlooked by people on the ground, but once they saw it I guarantee it would have raised an eyebrow.

The light dissapated and then through partially cosed vertical blinds, a light entered my room and circled the room. Through the verticle blinds a shadow appeared in the light in the room. The shadow had an elongated head (not long as in high, but as in a sort of football shape) a long thin neck and a thick body. I shadow didn&apos;t move with the light, but through it.  So in otherwords the light behind it was not moving, the shadow was. I thought of more rational possibilities than an extra terrestrial or alien or other life form, whatever your preference in title, but because of the angle of the blinds, I couldn&apos;t justify the way the light moved around the room instead of on one wall. Perhaps this is something to report, or perhaps I need a lesson in light movement?  I&apos;m not ruling either possibility out. when I got the nerve up to look outside, the light had vanished and car alarms were going off. I got back into bed and heard a low level ???hum or ??? - an easier sound to make then to describe - type sound."

19600915,19980830,"Kingsport, TN",circle,5 Minutes,"An orange, circular craft drifted over the house from east to west shortly after sundown.In the late summer of 1960, a group of youngsters (myself included) had finished dinner and were playing a game of hide-and-seek in the neighborhood.  I imagine there were about 8 to 10 children, mostly in the range of 5 to 10 years old.  I was 6 or 7 years old.  The sun had just set, but the sky still had a warm orange glow.  We played for some time and finally it was my chance to be &quot;it&quot;, the one who counted then went to find the others in their hiding places.  I recall that I couldn&apos;t count to 50, so I counted to 10 five times.  I was leaning on a tree in the side yard of our house.  By then it was pretty dark and I felt compelled to look up.  As I did so, I observed the leading edge of a circular object emerge from over top of our house.  I was transfixed: I just stood there speechless and stared at it.  It was bigger than our house and perfectly round.  I assume it was a disc and I was observing the bottom of the craft.  It was uniformly a brilliant red-orange.  There were no external marking, windows, lights, or construction details.  Just what appeared to be a self-illuminated object.  It was perfectly silent, which added to the drama.  As soon as it dawned on me that I was seeing something extraordinary, I was filled with the strange sensation that it or they  had seen me, too.  I ran into the house to get one of my parents.  My mother was finishing up the dishes, but she came outside to see it.  It was no longer visible.  We looked in the direction of the sunset and the sky was almost the same red-orange of the craft.  This has made me wonder if the craft was reflecting the sunlight or glowing on its own.  None of the other children saw it and my mother commented that I&apos;d seen a falling star before returning to the kitchen.  I knew I had not seen a falling star.  I was always nervous that whoever was responsible for that craft knew I saw it and might someday return.  In the years following this incident, I have had many occurences which can only best be described as psychic.  I&apos;ve had lucid drea! ms and numerous sleep-walking episodes -- once even going into the front yard of my grandmother&apos;s house and staring at the eastern horizon, only to see the moon rise just at that moment.  My entire family and I observed a spherical craft while on a drive one evening in Greene County, TN.  I discovered in a casual conversation one day that two of my three brothers had also seen spherical craft during their lives - in the exact same neighborhood where we lived when I had the episode mentioned above.  We believe in the reality of the experience, but have no conclusion about the exact nature of the phenomenon."

The Illumination dimmed after about three minutes, and when it dimmed completely the object dissapeared (in no direction without sound) Just as we had convinced ourselves it was an airplane refecting the setting sun, a formation of 3 low flying, military style, black helicopters flew by directly over head in the direction we viewed the object.

Shortly after it emitted a blue orange glow underneath and went up out of the atmosphere. Out of site. No sound was heard during the whole event and it was quite windy.  The object never diviated from it&apos;s local position, was not affected by the wind.  At that point I desided it wasn&apos;t a weather balloon I continued to scan the sky about 1 minute after the object left the atmosphere a military jet flew into the area where the object was and circled as if searching for something then it left.

At the crossing point of both objects their largest angular extent was the size of a ping-pong ball at arm&apos;s length.  There was no sound heard throughout the sighting except near the crossing point when a very faint jet aicraft-like sound was heard for less than one second. Since it was dark during the sighting, no shapes were observed for either object.  However the distinguishing features of both these objects were three whitish lights arranged in an equilateral triangle, with a brighter red-orange light in the center of the triangle.  The red light seemed to pulsate.  Strange as it may sound, the red light appeared to grow especially intense during moments of skepticism as the observers speculated about these objects actually being terrestrial aircraft.

The main light appeared to shift position to regain a position relative to a star we were measuring against.  The sky was perfectly clear.

Several streaks across the sky followed and each time a streak was seen there was an object flying across the sky at the starting point or beyond the finishing point of the streak. There were several fly-overs at altitudes exceeding the normal for passenger jets. Then there was a large silver and bright blue streak across the sky in a westerly direction. This streak exploded into many directions. The explosion seemed to be very high in the sky, and no report was heard. Within less than five minutes the &quot;Stealth&quot; came back overhead from a south-east direction and proceeded north-west. The &quot;Stealth&quot; was low enough that you could see its outline. The objects flying at high altitude were moving in several directions, but did not follow the horizon line. Some dissapeared in the middle of our line of site. Some were just flying across the sky, turned bright blue, and was gone. Some flew across the sky, stopped, and held position. Five object held position for almost an hour, moving closer together then separating. These were also a extremely high altitude. These objects had no back-trail, and were traveling 15-20 times faster than the &quot;Stealth&quot; when it flew over. The last things observed were several objects flying overhead, and a bright blue/white atmospheric something. The horizon was lit up for 360 degrees around us. It was bright enough to light the whole horizon and silouette the trees at the horizon line. We wanted to stay outside longer to see if anything else would happen, but it was late and there had only been two objects flying over the last half hour."

I was looking towards the direction of where the car was parked when I noticed with my right field of view, a very large  dark object that was moving from East to West just above tree top. The event happened so fast that I could barely point fast enough with my hand (while yelling Look..Look!) towards the object, hoping to get my wife&apos;s attention. Even though black in color, it had dimly glowing light along all the bottom edges and the sihlouette of the object was easily distinguished as a large silent triangle. The scene was fairly quiet and I was able to clearly hear in the background the motor noise of a small plane, during and well after the event took place. I was so shook up with my heart pounding that I could hardly breathe.After the event took place I noticed that to attract my wife&apos;s attention to the black triangle I used my index finger with my arm fully extended.  This would later provide me with a scale of the relative size of the object.  The speed of movement across my field of view (in this case approximately 70&deg; to 80&deg;) took ~2 seconds. The altitude I estimated had to be less than some visible background mountain peaks that are ~3000ft about ~5 to 6 miles from wher I was viewing. It travelled right over the city and made no sound whatsoever!.  If I had not been gazing at exactly in the direction of the mountains behind the city, I would have missed the event.  It was that quick and that lucky.  After gaining my composure my wife and I exchanged information, but it was clearly evident that she had missed all the initial trajectory as i was trying to get her to follow the object by my pointing towards it.  The next morning I went back to the exact place I was standing the night before and took a picture.  From the picture I was able to determine the relative speed at &gt;800 mph!...and an object size (when compared to some features of the background) observed the day I took the picture. I estimated the object to be some  60 to 80 meters? in some size (It&apos;s hard to extract all this from such a short mental picture). It also looked blunt at the back, not aerodynamic per se.  I noted that fromthe perspective that I saw it dissapear behing the trees, it looked more like a wide arrow head but was flat across the back. I purchased newspapers and asked around if any reports were submitted, but was not able to confirm any other observers which would have seen this craft.  I decided to document all my findings before submitting the information back in 1996, but regrettably I lost my report on a disk crash and later was not able to recover the file."

I jumped in the car and sped back toward the intersection.I almost didn&apos;t get stopped and would have collided with a tractor trailer truck.When I looked around all I could see was some blinking lights off in the distance.I headed home and told my parents,only to be laughed at.I told my boss at work the next day and he laughed too.So I just didn&apos;t talk too much about it anymore.I know what I saw was real and I was not under the influence of anything.A few years later I found out that I wasn&apos;t the only one to see the object.A guy(who is a baptist preacher now),his brother,and mother saw the object just up the road a mile or so from where I saw it.He said his little brother got down in the floor of the car and started praying.He also said his mother went back to the sight almost everyday for 2 weeks.I know it&apos;s been! a long time since I saw this,but I still have a vivid memory of it.That&apos;s the only time I&apos;ve ever seen anything like that,but I look to the sky often.Who knows?"

I was about 3-5 miles from Battle Ground when I saw a light traveling south at approximately 1000 feet high in the distance in front of me. The object appeared to be far enough away as to be flying over Battle Ground. It&apos;s appearance was like an airplane at night. It was a white light with a smaller red light on it. At this distance, an airplane would appear to the eye to be traveling relatively slow in perspective. However the object was moving at a fairly rapid rate. My estimate based on it&apos;s altitude and distance in front me was that it would be traveling at several hundred miles per hour. It is the velicity which grabbed my attention. I am used to seeing planes fly as Portland International Airport is about 25 miles away. This moved way faster than anything I&apos;ve seen before. If it weren&apos;t for the velocity, I would have thought it was an aircraft of some sort.

Looking through binoculars, another male 65 years old, sighted small lights below the planet.  A female 64 yrs old sighted three lights in a horizontal configuration, moving from south to north with a brilliant halogen-type beam coming down from above the three lights.  A fourth light came into view on the left, as if something were rotating.  Another female, 65, saw the lights through binoculars.  The lights seemed to be at approximately 20,000 ft.  The observers had been playing bridge in a mountain cabin, drinking only coffee; first observer had stepped outside for a breath of cool air, then called the others to come and see &quot;the bright light in the sky.&quot;The four observers are retired from their professional fields: a teacher, a writer, a photographic processing lab owner, and a printing company owner.  The first to notice the &quot;bright light&quot; was able to see it with the naked eye.  The other three observers needed the binoculars to see the detail of three lights in a row.  One of the observers noticed that as the lights approached, a bright halogen-type beam of light seemed to be aimed down at the earth below from a point just above the three lights.  As the lights approached very high in the sky (approx. 20,000 ft) they seemed to move sideways several times as the binoculars moved...as though the lights and observer were somehow interacting.  This &quot;interaction&quot; was very brief---perhaps 20 seconds---and then the lights were gone.  Afterwards, all four observers talked about what they had seen.  The teacher saw something but felt the binoculars were too unsteady to say what she saw.  The retired owner of a printing company was the first to see the thrr horizontal lights, first with the naked eye, then with the binoculars.  The writer saw the lights approach and then the halogen-type spotlight, and then a fourth light appearing on the left of the other three, as though rotating into view.  The photo lab owner saw the horizontal lights but later decided they were just reflections on the lenses from two distant lights that illuminate the driveway in this otherwise pitch-black mountain setting in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

I went with friends to watch a meteor shower in the desert. It was late at night and we could hear normal night desert sounds. We were all watching the falling stars when one person noticed lights slowly approaching. As the lights neared us we saw three triangle shaped craft flying in a triangle formation. The craft were (RAM?)black, with three lights on each one. I do not remember which lights were red and which were white, but each craft had red and white lights on the 3 points. The craft were 500 to 1000 feet above us as they went past. They were moving at about 350 mph judging by how low they were and how long it took them to pass. They were completely silent, as they passed we still heard the desert night sounds. there were no car engines running or lights on,(so I do not know if they would have had any effect on them,) as we were all watching the sky. Most of us they worked at the air force plant and held security clearances,  but none of us had ever seen any craft like that before. We were all used to watching fighters and bombers fly by, so were used to judging aircraft size and speed. We had never saw an aircraft that was a perfect triangle float past us at 350 mph though! They flew/floated overhead and vanished in the distance. The profile of the craft were very low. We saw the light before we saw the craft and the craft outline vanished before the lights disappeared. We were used to seeing F117 fighters, and these were not shaped like them. I worked briefly on the first F22&apos;s and they were not flying yet. Besides, both of these craft make a lot of noise and cannot glide that long and that low without power. This craft was powered by magnetics or atomic/nuclear fuel. There was no exhaust vents visible on the trailing edge of any of the three craft. It was probably 11:30 at night and as they passed no heat from them distorted any stars behind them as they passed. I heard of Art Bell seeing a single triangle craft abou! t the same time, or a bit after we saw these three. The artists rendition of his craft on his web page makes the craft way to big. They were all three the size of an F15 or F16, not any bigger than that. I realize this happened in 1993, and it is now 1998, but I told the story to people I worked with when I was transferred from Palmdale to Everett, Wa. Those people could vouch that I told them about it in 1993.

I often look out at the stars. This particular night there was a glowing greenish light that caught my eye. It was bright an unusual and unfamiliar. I live close to an airport, but the airport&apos;s last flight in/out is not past midnight. There is a cargo plane that takes off every night around 2 am, but I can hear it; it is a familiar sound to me.I also see the planes come in and out and I can not remember a plane or helicopter ever hover or circle around the airport. The light was not familiar to me, so I stared at it for awhile and went closer to the window to study it...it just sort of loomed over the hillside. Then it moved slowly and two other lights appeared. I heard nothing. It is very isolated and quiet where I live. I can hear the planes that take off very well, but I could hear nothing; no rumble of a motor or screem of engines. I thought it was a helicopter, but thought it strange that it hovered in this particular area at this particular time at night. The lights were the size of a melon at my distance and moved in unison now. All together the lights moved like they were attached to something. First they moved &apos;forward&apos; or my direction (west), then they went up and over further(south) and then back and down and back(east). And, then, suddenly they seemed to just disappear. There was no cloud obstruction and it didn&apos;t seem that the object/lights went behind the mountain or that a craft had landed. The lights were too far away from the airport to be able to land. It was very strange. Almost as if they went out all of a sudden. I would not be even reporting this if I had not been listening to Art Bell tonite. All of a sudden I felt this strange familiarity with the reports that were coming in on his show (11/16/98-Monday). I had no idea that other people were seeing this kind of thing. I just wrote it off as &apos;being tired&apos;; seeing a strange star(s); or, a cargo plan or helicopter I just couldn&apos;t hear. Ironically, I&apos;ve been ! looking for the lights every time I get up late at night...just to satisfy my sanity more than anything...did I really see something or didn&apos;t I? Until tonite, I wasn&apos;t altogether too sure. Now, I know, that others, during this very same time period really saw something like what I saw. It is both reassuring and eerie at the same time. I only wish I had written down the experience right away or called the air control tower or something. I was afraid to call or report the sighting because I didn&apos;t want to be &apos;wrong&apos; about what I&apos;d seen.

I had been at just gotten to work and had time to spare the set and it was dark the parking lot lights had not come on yet so the sky was pretty clear.  There were no clouds, it was a perfect evening.  I had glanced around a bit and was going to grab my book, when I saw a plane in the sky which looked like either a medium sized prop plane or a private jet.  Behind this plane about 50 to 100 feet or so was glowing red ball.  The plane could not be that long for the altitude it was flying at.  Behind the glowing red ball was what looked to be 3 helicopters in formation.  I was able to tell they were helicopters because the lights on the tail were flickering from the tail rotor.

At that time in my life I was interested in astronomy so I looked at the sky alot. On this particular night I was looking to the south over the top of a mountain range and to my surprise I saw 2 seperate sets of 3 red lights approach each other from the East and West. The objects came very close to each other but didn&apos;t appear to touch. I was able to get a relative to come outside just in time to see the objects seperate and fly away in different directions. One object flew back to the West while the other flew North over the house. At no time was I able to discern a shape of the crafts or even any engine noise. I would guess that the crafts were approximately a 3/4-1 mile up, as they didn&apos;t appear to be much higher that the mountains.

Weather clear ca. 70 degrees F. light breeze from north.  Object was very bright blue-white light, steady illumination (no variation in luminance or color).  Object was size of small pea at the end of my arm.   When I first noticed it, I thought it was an especially bright satellite given its steady  tracking characteristics,  but the object suddenly disappeared when it reached a position straight on from my observation point, and I also am not aware of many satellites in easterly to westerly orbits!  As I could see no evidence of running lights or strobe, and I could hear no noise during the sighting or for two minutes after the object disappeared.  It also did not appear to be in usual flight approach or departure lanes for PDX.   I decided to report sighting as unknown. Track:  appeared to be very high.  About 4 degrees below a very bright star or planet (slightly less bright than the moving object), and about 80 deg. above horizon.  Went through 3--5 deg. of arc in about 40 seconds.  Sudden winkout at 90 degrees azimuth. I felt strange after seeing this.  I thought I heard a couple behind me say &quot;Oh, another sighting!&quot; but no way did I want to talk to anyone about what I saw at the moment.  Needless to say, I debated a long time before deciding to report this. I am a professional archaeologist  trained in photointerpretation and physical observation techniques.  On two other occasions I have seen odd high altitude night lights behaving in ways not characteristic of aircraft or satellites, but have not reported those.  I also witnessed one of the Blue Book daylight unknowns in summer 1954 in Alcoa, Tennessee, along with several of my friends.   I am interested professionally and personally in UFO subject.

It was a triangular formation of 6 perfectly round circles moving at about 5 mph. Shocked to see such a shadow, I looked up to see what was in the sky above me. There was nothing (no birds, no clouds, no planes; the sky was all blue and they weren&apos;t sunspots because I was not looking up until that point). I started to follow the shadow, looking back &amp; forth from ground to sky. I followed it for about 20 yards until the end of the property.

19730920,19980828,"Mansfield, OH",cigar,20 minutes,"In the Fall of 1973 my sister and I came upon a large silver object hovering approximatley 20 feet above us on a clear, sunny afternoon in a heavily populated residential area. We walked around and underneath the craft for 15 or 20 minutes while it remained motionless and soundless above what should have been a busy, suburban street. Without apparent means the craft suddenly shot straight up into a small cloud and drifted away. We both completly forgot about this incident for 3 years. I think it is also relevant that both of us felt then and now that we are missing a 24 hour period of our lives.Please forgive me in advance if this narrative seems to ramble. Frankly I am a little trepeditious of relaying the events of that afternoon 25 years ago. I am still fearful of what I saw but I am more afraid of what I cannot remember. My hope is that by relaying this bit of truth I might be able to let go of some of the isolation I feel in a forum of like-minded individuals and perhaps make contact with someone who also saw what we saw. As for autobiography I am a 41 year old Police Captain who has led a relatively normal life of ups and downs, good times and bad. I had an average childhood and an interesting adult life of travel. love affairs and advanced education. I suppose I&apos;m just pretty damned average in every way except for this nagging experience which continues to haunt me. In either September or October of 1973 at approximately 1515 hours, my sister ((Name deleted)) (13yoa) and I (16yoa) had just been dropped off by our school bus in front of our house. We were living in a heavily populated suburban area of Mansfield Ohio in the ((Address deleted)) block of Cook Road. Cook Road itself is a busy two lane street and, although our section was mostly residential, a school and a convenience store were both within half a block from where we stood. Our house was at the base of two gradually sloping hills amidst dozens of homes on both sides of the street. I had exited the bus before my sister and stood waiting for her on the sidewalk. As she stepped from the bus and it pulled away I was startled to see a large object hovering over the street where the school bus had been. I pointed it out to my sister and we both stood captivated by it&apos;s appearance and proximity. The craft was approximatly 40 feet long and 15 or 20 feet tall. It hovered silently 35 or 40 feet overhead and had lights encircling it&apos;s cigar-shaped structure. I believe there was a larger red light on one end and a green light on the other but the rest of the smaller lights were multicolored. It was of a metal which looked like brushed aluminium and had no visible means of levitation or propulsion, no wings or propellers. I walked into the street underneath the craft and accross the street to see it from the other side. There were no numbers or letters of any kind displayed and I could not see any seams for the release of landing apparatus. At one point I picked up a rock to hear what it would sound like bounced against the exterior but my sister disuaded me from throwing it. I remember we were becomming increasingly distressed when I was not able to identify this object and by the fact we were alone. It had been at least 15 minutes since we first saw the craft and during this time, remarkably, no one had passed by. No one came out onto their front porch, no other kids walked the sidewalks and no cars drove by. In retrospect this seems absurd given the time of day and usual traffic on Cook Road. When I returned to the side of the street on which my sister stood I now saw a small black oval slightly above the row of lights. We thought it might be a window and waved but there was no response. Several minutes later the craft silently shot up and into a small cumulus cloud which drifted away. I remember my sister asking me what it was to which I replied &quot;I don&apos;t know. do you think it could be one of those UFO&apos;s the paper&apos;s been writing about?&quot; We were both excited and scared as we walked into our ho! use whereupon we both completely forgot about it. Although we had no apparant memory of the event I recall that we were both very upset with our mother whom we accused of leaving us for a 24 hour period. Mom insisted she had never done such a thing but we were convinced we had experienced a full 24 hours without her. This missing time was particularly perplexing to both of us and, to this day, remains a disturbing reality. I know that I am missing a day, but I cannot explain it. Three years after our encounter I had a sudden recall of the events described above while talking about the cosmos with some college friends. I called my sister and asked her if she had ever seen a flying saucer. At first she said no but when I mentioned the school bus in Ohio she also had a sudden realization and literally gasped on the phone. Her memory of the event is almost exactly like my own including the little window and the strange missing time. There&apos;s a lot more to tell about subsequent related occurances and some strange stories of little men I used to tell to my mother when I was very young but this is the heart of the matter. Life goes on but I sure wish I could understand the &quot;what&apos;s&quot; and the &quot;why&quot;s&quot;  of this event."

Then three light balls appeared less then 30 feet from me appearing as multishaft lucite stars with rods emanating from center 15 feet in diameter floating one foot above ground.I am a retired air traffic controller and I have an airline transport pilot license. I&apos;ve been trained specifically to see and interpret correctly what I see in the sky and on radar. Technically speaking, people like me are the most credible of witnesses. Not that that will convince the people with their heads in the sand but for what it&apos;s worth, I saw three UFOs and they were, at their closest approach, no more than 20 feet (not less than 15 and not more than 25 feet) from me. I was parked in a tourist attraction parking lot in Ponce, Puerto Rico at a place called &quot;El Vigia&quot;. There were at least 30 other people there with their friends listening to music from their car radios or portable radios. Some were drinking. I was not. It was April 9, 1990. I got to the parking lot right after dark. I watched the moon rise. It was a lovely night and I was enjoying the full moon. At about 9:00 P.M. the moon became obscured by clouds. Then the clouds began to boil just like in the movie cucoon. This thunder cell of clouds or whatever it was (it made no sound) began moving from east to west towrds the city of Ponce. I was somewhat worried but just kept standing outside my car and watching it move. It was lighted from inside with a white glow. I could here the gasps and oos and ahhhs from the people around the parking lot. After about 15 minutes of this two lights shot out of this cloud formation I estimated to be at about 6,000 feet maximum altitude at 2000 plus miles an hour and moved south, made a hairpin turn and went north and disappeared. Then I heard this poof sound and three 15 foot diameter light balls appeared in front of me at about 20 feet away (one poof sound for each ball), floated across the parking lot about 2 feet above the gound  for about 3 minutes and disappeared with the same poof sound. These &quot;light balls&quot; as I call them looked like giant sea urchins with clear lucite rods  extending fom the center in a star burst design. Another similar item is a fiber optic lamp with straight fibers bristling ! out of it. The rods all came from a compact center. They were basically all glowing with a white light and rotating slight lightly and lazily as they floated along.I observed that the black asphalt beneath the light balls was lit as the balls passed over. A couple of 4 year old children practically walked into the leading light ball. The children turned away towards there parents with their arms above their heads and ducking their heads as if something was bothering them (similar to what a child woud do if a bee was buzzing around him). They quickly got away from the light balls. I clearly saw each ball disappear with a poof sound. To someone who didn&apos;t know that stars are huge infernos in the sky such as the sun, would assume that these were stars. The boiling cloud slowed to a normal cumulus formation. It all happened in about 20 minutes. I left about 30 minutes later but spoke to nobody else there about what we had all seen because I didn&apos;t know anybody there. No one approached me either.

On one occasion there was another witness. On this particular occasion, (11-22-98), it was a misty night and I went out to feed my livestock.  At 8pm it was very dark.  As I was walking to my barn (north) in my pasture, the flash took place to my south on the other side of my house.  The light was coming from ground level, or withing 25 feet or so of ground level near a neighbors house or in the woods behind it.  I estimate it was no more than 200 yards south of my position.

Although I do not recall precisely what week we were there, this incident took place on a Friday night.  I and my friend, both females aged 14 at the time, customarily strolled along the shoreline in the evenings.  I estimate that our &quot;sighting&quot; occurred around 8 p.m., but that time is not absolute. I recall that night as very dark, both starless and moonless.  However, it is possible that the fear I felt after we encountered the craft skewed my impressions of the environment; to be certain of the moon phase, I&apos;d have to check a calendar from back then.  I do remember absolutely that the evening began clear and temperate, with just a few stringy clouds hanging here and there over the ocean.  I was looking down, trying to avoid stepping with my bare feet on the sand crabs that come out at night.  So it was my friend who first saw something odd in the sky. &quot;Do you see those lights?&quot; she asked me.  I followed her gaze, then, and I saw five lights in a tight triangular formation...the center light was red, and it was the largest.  It was flanked on either side by two smaller white lights.  I do not remember any of the lights flashing; they all maintained a kind of focused dull sheen, if that makes sense.  They did not emit beams or illuminate the sky around them.  Together, they formed what we later interpreted as the &quot;nose&quot; of the craft, although we did not at first notice any other lights or even an outline of the craft&apos;s shape because the night was so very dark.  I am guesstimating the craft&apos;s distance from us as about 50-100 feet -- very close -- and about the same distance up in the air from the ocean, but the darkness and the lack of earthbound objects (i.e. trees) by which to judge height/size made it difficult to pinpoint how large or how close this object was. As I looked up, I caught this &quot;nose&quot; emerging seemingly out of nowhere.  In retrospect, I believe that I decided on-the-spot that the craft must have been behind cloud cover because that was the only way I could rationalize its sudden appearance.  But as I said above, what few clouds there were that night were unsubstantial and spaced far apart from one another.  As farfetched as it seems, I have to consider that the craft may actually have been &quot;cloaked&quot; in some fashion and then it revealed itself...?  I feel ridiculous writing that, but I have no other explanation.  It&apos;s possible that my friend and I just happened not to see it until it was dead even with where we stood.  But the enormity of the craft and its apparent proximity to us makes that possibility seem unlikely to me. Regardless of how the lights got there, from the moment my friend and I first noticed them, some inexplicable quality they seemed to give off made us both vaguely uneasy.  I think that strangeness was why my friend had to ask me whether or not I saw what she saw, and it was why I didn&apos;t question her needing my confirmation.  I&apos;m not sure how long it took us to realize that a big contribution to this strange &quot;vibe&quot; we were experiencing was the craft&apos;s utter silence.  It wasn&apos;t merely an absence of engine or other familiar aircraft noise; it was an intense, all-pervasive silence that was eerily powerful precisely because it was so absolute.  It was a consuming silence, the likes of which I cannot recall experiencing in any other situation. I have always remembered that silence and have tried to describe it on the few occasions that I have discussed my &quot;sighting&quot; over the years with friends.  But it wasn&apos;t until I happened to catch a bit of a cable program the other night that I heard another so-called witness state that she had viewed a completely silent airborne object.  That was the first time I had ever heard a UFO-sighting detail that matched my own experience, and it made me snap back to the events of August &apos;85.  I researched online and came across this site; now that I&apos;ve read numerous other reports, I understand that very many people indeed have witnessed silent crafts.  A few have also seen triangular crafts (another detail from my personal encounter that I had never heard elsewhere).  Obviously, I have not made a point of keeping up with ufology!  Hearing and reading some other people&apos;s testimony has encouraged me to share my experience now.  Although I have never doubted the nature of what I saw that night, the content of other witnesses&apos; reports lends credence in my mind to my personal memories, legitimizing them somehow. So I will continue with my report:  I and my friend stopped walking to watch these lights for awhile.  At some point, we became aware of a sixth light.  It was the same color and size as the large dull-red light which marked the center of the &quot;nose&quot; of the ship, and it was straight back from that light.  (Imagine an arrow, designated only by five points outlining the tip of the arrowhead and a single dot at the base of the arrow).  Here is where my friend&apos;s and my accounts differ; one of us thought that the space between the original five lights and this single sixth light encompassed about one football field&apos;s length, but the other thought it was closer to two football fields long.  After all this time, I don&apos;t recall which of us insisted on which length.  Let me reiterate how hard it was to determine size and distance in that environment. Now that we saw the sixth light (it, too, just quietly asserted itself; it may have been there all along, or it may have appeared after the others), we determined that the entire area in between must be one giant craft.  This final light marked the middle of the third leg that formed the base of the triangle.  I know that my friend and I agreed that the ship was triangular and basically flat, but as far as I remember, we couldn&apos;t actually see an outline.  It was like this ship swallowed the whole night sky above us.  I remember just barely discerning the distant horizon break between the dark blue ocean &amp; the deep black sky, and my vision was 20/20 at the time.  So if the night really was as dark as I am remembering, the craft was either pitch black itself or it was utterly transparent. We never questioned that the sixth light belonged to the same craft.  All of the lights moved in tandem.  They slid so smoothly and slowly across the sky that their motion was almost imperceptible.  They moved in the same direction in which my friend and I had been walking, and then shortly after we stopped to watch them, they stopped, too.  After I&apos;m not sure how long, we tried moving forward again, and the craft moved with us.  We stopped again; it stopped again.  I think anxiety started seeping in to me about then if it hadn&apos;t already.  Perhaps the coincided movements were an optical illusion, as when you view a painted portrait from many angles and it seems to always be looking directly at you.  But my friend and I got the very definite impression that the craft was watching us.  We reacted by speaking in low murmurs as if it could hear us, and for some reason I got it into my head that we ought not stand looking at it for too long at a stretch or it would overpower us.  I kept having to shake off a certain numbness -- not so much a physical numbness as a mental one.  It was very easy to fall into a sort of spellbound state as we watched these lights. Eventually, we decided to head back in the direction we&apos;d come from.  I think we were both beginning to feel frightened, but the onset of fear was slow.  We turned and walked back down the beach, and lo &amp; behold -- the craft switched direction, too.  It did not turn; it just moved &quot;backwards,&quot; so that the sixth light -- the second red light -- now became the &quot;front.&quot;  I remember feeling a bit scared, but more giddy.  It was like a game we were engaging in with this strange craft.  Now we stopped and waited for awhile to see what might happen.  My friend felt less anxious than I did, and I took courage from her equanimity at first. I don&apos;t know how long we stood there.  It was probably under 10 minutes, maybe even under 5 minutes, but it could have been hours.  I had absolutely no grasp of time.  I know that I got that numbness again because I realized at some point that my friend had sunk down to the sand and I hadn&apos;t even noticed.  She and I had stopped talking.  The object mesmerized us, or we allowed ourselves to believe that it did.  It continued to merely hover, stationary. After we had watched it for some time, rain began to fall, lightly at its start.  Maybe it was the rain that jolted me back to my senses or maybe I just &quot;came to&quot; again of my own accord, but whatever the reason, I forced my attention away from the lights.  I bent down to look at my friend&apos;s face.  I had to get close up to her because of the darkness, so when I looked in her eyes, we were only a few inches apart.  I remember that what I saw in her eyes sent a chill through me.  She was smiling a strange little smile and her eyes were all glazed over.  It wasn&apos;t like she was totally unresponsive or anything, but there was an unnatural excitement and faraway attitude that she conveyed.  (I should clarify here that we were both very much drug-free).  When she spoke -- something like, &quot;you&apos;re in my way, I want to see them&quot; -- her voice quality had changed, too.  It was then that I understood that what I&apos;d taken for her equanimity was actually closer to her willingly &quot;zoning out.&quot;  That really scared me.  The rain started to fall harder. Then, quite suddenly, the whole craft just took off at a speed that made my breath catch in my throat.  Again, absolutely no sound unless it was quieter than the rain.  The craft went up the beach about a half-mile at approximately a 30-degree incine, and there it stopped near a short cliff.  At first we thought it wasn&apos;t doing anything, but then we noticed that the positions of the lights relative to one another seemed to change.  That was because, as we soon figured out, the craft was turning around.  It did not bank at all -- the nose did not dip down.  The whole craft just turned on a flat plane.  Oddly, as it turned, we could see all of the lights all of the time.  It was as if the inside of the craft were invisible -- we could see the &quot;nose&quot; lights through the &quot;tail&quot; light like no craft was in between.  Yet we had no doubt that there really was a craft in the shape of a triangle, not just disconnected lights.  So I think that the ship must have been very, very flat. Another few minutes went by, during which we couldn&apos;t tell what the craft was doing.  But then we understood that, in a slow, steady, direct line, it was returning -- it was approaching our area again.  It was moving so deliberately and so directly towards us that at first we hadn&apos;t been able to perceive its motion.  Somehow, seeing those lights begin to get larger with the perspective as the craft neared again, my friend and I finally got filled to bursting with a sort of elated terror, and we ran all the way back down the beach where we&apos;d come from and then up a gravel road to our cabin.  The rain was furious now and blinding.  I am not a sportive person, but I ran fast and hard that night with no regard for my bare feet on the rough gravel.  They got fairly cut up from our run. I remember seeing other people on the beach as we ran back.  Being 14, we yelled loudly all the way home, garbled giddy warnings about &quot;the lights!  the lights!  don&apos;t let them take you!&quot; and so on.  People flitted past in a blur as we ran, but I do remember some puzzled looks on people&apos;s faces.  It occurred to me later to wonder whether they even saw these lights at all.  But when I and my friend finally got back to our empty cabin (my parents were out for the evening), we slammed &amp; locked the door and turned on all the lights and pulled down all the blinds -- and as we yanked down the blinds, we kept peering through the windows.  We couldn&apos;t see the lights where they should have been.  The whole run back had taken maybe 5 minutes and we hadn&apos;t checked behind us to see the location of the lights since maybe 2 minutes earlier when the other houses had obscured our view.  Now, gazing through a back window, we finally located the lights again.  Maybe the reason we had gotten puzzled/startled looks from people as we ran was because the craft had zoomed off, far past the area where it had made that no-bank turn earlier, and higher up.  It must have moved very quickly.  The fact that it had flown away again rather than continue to move toward where we had been standing excited us because that &quot;confirmed&quot; that the craft had actually been focusing on me and my friend.  We decided that it had wanted to abduct us and that it nearly had.  I&apos;d still like to think that.  But who knows."

We saw two objects flying toward us from the SW (moving NE).  Objects were side by side with a single light on either end (?) front &amp; back.  Moving slowly toward us, they came to a stop and one of the objects just sort of pivoted it&apos;s front end out to the side, heading E and started moving again.  The second object did the same and they continued one behind the other to the E.  We stopped the car when we first saw them because they looked so strange and we were on a secluded dirt road.  There was no noticeable engine noise.  My son and I live very near an active MCAS in So Cal and we are very accustomed to seeing military craft.  We have also been to Tucson several dozen times in the last few years and we have become very familiar with the military aircraft at the Davis-Monthan Air Station in Tucson.  My son can identify most any military jet with only a slight glance - he loves them!  But these had him stumped and spooked.  We watched them for about a minute as they disappeared off into the eastern sky.  The way they turned was not at all like any aircraft we have observed.  There was no banking involved.  They just stopped and one of them slid out to the side, started moving E and the other followed with exactly the same kind of pivoting turn."

We were facing east over the city of Carbondale when we saw it.  It then disappered into the blue sky.  About an hour later an F-16 fighter flew down from Springfield Il. and buzzed the city of Carbondale 5-7 times.  I have been here for 3 years and have never seen a military fighter jet fly over Carbondale.At approximately 2:30pm CST myself and a friend were sitting on a couch outside of our fraternity house in Carbondale Illinois.  I looked at the sky to see some birds flying around and then behind the birds was a black object not moving.  It was about 1500-2000 feet in altitude, and about the size of a gumball held at arms length.  We both stood up to get a better look and could not figure out what it was.  We were faceing east and it was about 3-6 miles away from us.  The object began to move from north to south and back, in the sky.  The object was also changing shape.  When I say changing shape I mean it looked like a large rubber bag full of water suspended in the air and the bag was changing shape.  I have been around flying aircraft all my life, I am a pilot, and I have never seen anything like this ever.  To prove to my friend and I that we were not crazy, I went inside to get some othrer people to witness this object.  I brought out 5 people.  They all saw it, some skeptical, but they did admit they saw something not normal.  Then another friend of mine drove up, and stated he saw the object from one of the dorms on campus which is about 2.5 miles from where I saw the object.  The object then disappered into the blue sky after about 20 min.  It was a slow disapperence, it was not a quick bolt out of the atmosphere.  After all this took place, about 1-2 hours later an F-16 fighter jet from Springfield Illiionis flew over the city of Carbondale 5-7 times.  There were several rumors of why the jet was flying around down here, but nothing official ever came out.  The odd part of the jet is that for the 4 years I have been in Carbondale, I have never seen a fighter jet fly around this area.

The objects came to a smooth halt, rigidly maintaining their formation. They were flying in a box formation --one at each corner, the fifth in the center. Their altitude would have been between 2000-3000 feet. The objects were disk-shaped, 30-50 feet in diameter, and emitted a &apos;soft-white&apos; glow. As I watched, the objects underwent extreme acceleration, disappearing over the eastern horizon in seconds, while maintaining their formation. I looked back at the Point, and another group of five objects appeared, in the same formation. They came to a smooth halt, then &apos;backed up&apos;, the way they had come. At no time did the objects &apos;turn&apos; in any way. They made no discernable sound.

I have had an abiding interest in helicopters from a very young age, and I have never seen any helicopter perform maneuvers that even remotely resemble what I saw that night."

19950615,19980926,"Washington, UT",unknown,3 Minutes,"A red glow lighting up low lying clouds. After a few moments the glow got more clear and about a dozen red lights in no noticable arrangment dropped through the clouds and then quickly shot upward.While driving south on Interstate 15 about 20 miles North of St. George Utah I noticed a red glow lighting up a small area of the low lying cloud bank.  I could tell that it was being lite up from above and not below (as city lights would do) and it was also not a very bright light or it would have lite up a larger area. The area that was lite up was about the size of a very large house. I was driving a loaded semi, so it took me a about a minute or two to come to a safe stop. I got out and observed it for about a minute or so. The spot of glow never moved in any direction for the few minutes I watched it. I say this because the glow never moved even up or down because the lighting did not get brighter or dimmer. Then it became clear that the object was lowering itself straight down. The glow became brighter and clearer until it completely dropped below the clouds for about 2 seconds, then quickly went straight up until I could no longer see even a hint of red glow. It moved up about the speed of a helicopter on a quick take off. The clouds were so low that I could have easily seen if the clouds were being disturbed by the wind that a helicopter would have produced but the clouds were not disturbed at all. Leaving me most curious about what propulsion system could produce no push or pull wind. A hot air baloon could have done what I saw if it wasn&apos;t for the lights. This had about a dozen red lights about the brightness of marker lights on planes and seem to be placed in no particular order. I could not see any of the object that the lights were on because it was dark except for the clouds and the glow. The craft ( as I assume it had to be ) was not flat, round, tubular, or anything else that would have a uniform surface around it. The lights were as if they were mounted on something with various surface levels. Like lights would look if mounted on an engine. My personal opinion of the movement of the craft was as if it was peeking below the clouds or suddenly realized it was below the clouds and didn&apos;t w! ant to be. Then took off like a child who has been caught."

We followed it on a surveyor&apos;s transit, as did the other family about a mile away, whom dad had me call, as the man was also a surveyor.This is a direct quote from a diary I kept at the time, which I just got back from mom a year ago after dad died.   &quot;April 8, 1968, Monday.  {....I am skipping the first four paragraphs.....}  After dinner I did the dishes and after that I went outside for a cigarette.  At about five to seven I looked up at the sky and saw a strange sight.  A huge, lighted object, quite noiseless, was hovering and swaying over the city to the SoutEast.  I watched it go slowly across the sky, stopping here, going up there, and it moved very slowly.  I was intrigued, thinking at first that it was  helicopter, but then I became aware that there was no nise.  I watched it and I went to the front of the house to have the folks come out.  I had that silly egoistical feeling that the thing was there just for me to see and that it was watching me and reacting to me.  Anyway, before I got too far, it had one large lighted sphere on the bottom and one small one on the top, aparently connected by some metal structure I could only get glimpses of (here I have an arrow pointing to a drawing I made of the object).  It was the shape that intrigued me at first.  As soon as the folks came out, it egan to pick up speed and travel up, and then after about five minutes, like a trajectory it went into &quot;orbit&quot; and disappeared.  But, mind you, the thing was very close to ttown and earth at first and later went up, up, &apos;till it vanished.  Here I want to inject the story Steve, my 12 year old brother, wrote about it.  It&apos;s not quite right, but it inspired him to write and that pleases me very much.  I copy even his spelling. &apos;Steven Smith and family  April 8, 6:45-7:20 spotted a UFO  At aprovamatly 6:45 Mr. Ken Smith (my brother) saw an oblong [here I edited with: not so, but he must not know it - K.L.S.] shaped object hovering over southern Walla Walla.  It was a lumonus object oblong with a smaller light, a foot above it, at first he thought it was a helicopter.  But as though someone in it saw him looking at it put on &apos;full speed&apos;.  It was th! en he notified us, [myu mother, father and me] it was now southwest and moving rapidly.  My father then got his trancit and sighted it.  It was now west and going up!  It was passed the clouds and shining brightly.  They were very thick.  After changing poisition it looked like a &apos;cone&apos;.  The light on top sent rays and shaped a cone.  But we soon lost it.  Now turning from the transit it was found, but going higher, soonit dissappeared but to reapere and then leave for good.  I hope .   Later my broter phoned the FAA and they said no sattilite was scheduled now.  Well, we know its UFO, funny.  it was noiseless, I was expecting at least a beep.&quot;   Written by Steven Smith.   I hope he&apos;ll be inspired to do more writing.  That is right - Dad and I called several government agencies, but they laughed us off.&quot; end of quote from my diary.  I am writing to you with this sighting as it has haunted me for the past thirty years, I think of it often and before I die, I&apos;d like it recorded somewhere besides my spiral college notebook that I used as a diary."

It was about 50 Feet tall and had about 10 beams of white light comming out of the bottom of the lower half of the triangle (Like a skirt)  They were about 20  feet long in length and glowed like Florescent Lights.  The beams were straight but they came out of the ship at a slight angle.  The object moved away and the beams of light disapated as they blew away in the wind.I think the beams of light were generated by some sort of Ionization from the vehicle.  The beams were of almost equal lenghts even though they  were from farther up on the ship.  The light from the moon on the left of us distracted our vision from the right where the diamond was heading. At that time we pulled over next to an off ramp and tried to see where the diamond went to but it was too late.  There were other vehicles on the off ramp backed up.  I don&apos;t know it they was what I saw!  But it was unusual for a off ramp to be backed up at 2:15 in the morning."

The first time I saw it I was driving home from work aroung 6:30 pm EST. It had been dark for half an hour. I was traveling north on 441 about 7 miles north of Gainesville on my way home. I then noticed this orange ball of light hovering above the treeline. It just sat there. It glowed but didn&apos;t move. At first I thought maybe it was a heicopter searching for something, but the more I looked at it I realized it couldn&apos;t be a helicopter because the light wasn&apos;t a searchlight. It didn&apos;t reflect a beam of light: it just glowed. It couldn&apos;t have been a plane or helicopter because there were no other lights on it and no strobes. There are some towers in this area but it wasn&apos;t them because I could see them off in the distance and besides they having flashing red lights on them. I didn&apos;t stop to watch further because I had to get home. It was still in the same place as I watched from my rear view mirror until I was too far away from it to see it anymore. The second time I saw it was about a week later with my wife in the car as well. It was in almost the same spot that I saw it in the last time, but I think it was further north along the road. She didn&apos;t want me to stop and look at it so we continued on home. I saw it again about a week after that. So this time I stopped my car on the edge of the road to check it out. Unfortunately because of the height of the trees next to the road, it blocked my view of the orange ball of light. There was no sound from that spot in the sky. I thought surely I would hear an engine of some kind, but I didn&apos;t. When I got backl on the road I could still see it above the trees until I was too far away to see it anymore. I never reported this to anyone because of the skepticism most authorities have towards this type of siuation.

I didn&apos;t hear a lot of what she said because there was a lot of static.  It reminded me of a situation that happened to me about 2 years ago in the same area.  I left Lake Arrowhead and I was heading down the mountain.  When I got on Highway 18 I saw this round glowing object nearby on the lefthand side of the road.  At first I thought it was the moon and I remember thinking that it was so pretty and so close.  Then, and I&apos;m embarrassed to say this, I realized that it wasn&apos;t the moon because I was heading west not east. This object kept pace with me and it was playing games and taunting me at the same time.  When I speeded up to get a better look it moved away but still kept the same distance between us.  Then I realized I was witnessing something quite interesting and certainly not a normal occurence.  It was rather large too.  The next weekend I went back to Lake Arrowhead.  I went into the Stater Brothers market to talk to Sharon who worked in the bakery department because I wanted to tell her about my experience with the object.  She got this knowing smile and said, &quot;Oh you saw it&quot;.  I said &quot;yes&quot; and asked her what it is.  She said these glowing objects/balls come up along the road.  (I must say if you have never driven Highway 18 it is very winding and there is the mountain on one side and the valley below.  It is a very spectacular sight from this road).  So they come up along the valley side of the road. She said that these objects appear to selected people, they are friendly, and they are communicating with us telepathically, teaching us and warning us. She said they appear quite regularly to selected people.  Anyway, I thought this might help you to piece together a pattern because I know there have been quite a few sightings near Lake Arrowhead, Running Springs and Crestline."

As my friend and I were talking he interupted and asked me if I heard something. We heard a faint blowing sound but couldn&apos;t tell what direction it was coming from.  At first we passed it off as a strange wind.  However, a few minutes later the sound suddenly became much louder from behind us. We turned to see this strange object in the sky slowly moving toward the ground.  The closer it came to the ground the more dust it kick up, yet we didn&apos;t see any type of engines or blowers on the object.  The object never did land.  I was able to take two pictures. The first did not show the object. I only assume I was so stunned that I clicked way to fast. The second is the one I will send to you.  After I took the second picture the object became much quieter and in a flash shot straight up in to the sky and dissapeared. The object was perfectly round with several smaller circles on the bottom of it. These smaller circles were somewhat reflective.  My best guess is the object was no more then 25 feet from one side to the other and about 5 to 8 feet high.  The main part was gloss black and the smaller circles were a peach color.

19821101,19981104,"East Texas River, TX",egg,10 minutes,"Four witness huge craft in East Texas.At the time of this occurrence, my brother was 24 years old. My brother&apos;s fiance&apos;, my husband and I were all 21 years of age. My brother, sister-in-law, and myself all have IQs above the 98th percentile, are college educated, and are in business administration, mainframe programming, and systems engineering, respectively. My brother, his fiance&apos;, my husband and I were riding around in the county back roads late at night with my brother at the wheel, some fifteen miles from the nearest town. We decided to park the car at the end of a dead end road, a well known spot to the local young people, near the river bottom. Facing in a northerly direction, directly in front of the car was a pasture, then virtually miles of undeveloped &quot;bottom&quot; land covered in timber and underbrush, and used for nothing other than an occasional hunt. As we sat there in the car, talking and listening to the radio, we began to notice a faint glow quite some distance away, which formed a semicircle above the tree line which we were facing. As we watched, the glow began to brighten, and slowly a very large egg shaped object began to rise from the forest at a distance of approximately three to four miles from our location. As the object began to move in a SSE direction (and closer to us), I became extremely nervous and began to ask my brother to leave. Moving very slowly some 100 yards above the earth (judging by the proximity of the 60 ft oaks),  and glowing white much like a huge florescent street light, it had no visible windows, lights, portals, or attachments of any kind. The others in the car at first seemed very curious at this sight, and were wanting to stay and watch it. I, however, was insistent that we leave immediately, and I soon convinced my brother to start the car. In order to leave the area, as we were on a dead end road, we had to travel due east approximately one mile to the intersection, and then travel south back toward town. As we began to approach the intersection, the object had traveled just to the SSE of the intersection, and had stopped and was hovering in mid air for a moment, and then reversed it&apos;s course as if to meet us at the intersection. We were moving down this small, dark backroad at an incredible speed, and as we reached the intersection, the object had almost reached it as well. The only sound that was emitted was a strange, barely audible humming noise. It was at this point that we realized that this &quot;ship&quot; was approximately the length of a football field, and twice the width. As we rounded the corner of the intersection and began heading south, the object redirected it&apos;s course as well, and began heading south directly behind us at a distance of some three hundred yards. I watched out the back window as we sped down the road, all the while yelling at my brother to &quot;Hurry Up!&quot;, and in and instant this huge object literally zipped into the sky so fast that I could not distinguish it from the stars. I continued to look for it, and soon, I watched as it moved slowly in a horizontal direction, then reversed and rapidly danced around the sky in all directions for several moments. I lost track of it at this time due to the tree limbs rushing by overhead. Judging by the size of the object as I had observed it previously, it had managed to ascend to an altitude of some 30,000 feet or so in a split second, without any increase in noise level. The most bizarre part, in my opinion, is that we had spoken about the occurrence immediately after it occurred but after that night I was the only one who mentioned it again. A week or so after this event,  my husband and I had joined some friends at the lake, where they had a small bonfire and party. I was sitting on the tailgate of our pickup and again it was a very clear night. I noticed something move in the sky, and began to tell our friends of the experience we had had the previous weekend. As I started to recount the story, I began to feel extremely nervous, and decided to drink a beer to calm down. As I began to cross the parking area toward the beer cooler, I felt the most excruciating pain of  my life. In mid stride, several yards from where I began, I felt as if a bomb had exploded in my head. I had collapsed on the ground and was throwing up from the intensity of the pain. My husband picked me up and loaded me into the pickup, then drove to my parents house just a few miles away. I laid on the den floor, still sick and in extreme pain, while my father applied ice packs to my head and waited for my mother (a nurse) to return from work. A couple of hours and narcotic pain killers relieved the pain. I didn&apos;t mention the ufo incident to anyone again for over ten years, strictly out of fear. Over a decade later, after thinking of that night again and again, I mentioned something to my sister-in-law about &quot;the time we saw the ship&quot;, and literally watched the hair stand on her arm. She had an incredible look on her face, as she told me that she had not thought of that night since it had happened. She wondered how she could have forgotten such a sight, and shuddered as she relived it. Based on this, I then asked my brother (now her husband), the same question. Again, the same response. In over ten years together, neither of the two had thought of that night until I had brought it up, and then all the details rushed over them as if it had happened yesterday. My husband and I were divorced just thre! e years after this occurrence, and he had never mentioned it to me in those three years. I have thought of  contacting him to ask the same question. I have always had full recollection of  the entire episode, and have remained silent due to fear. I wonder why I remembered and they did not."

When we went outside on the balcony to have a smoke, we noticed a beam of light behind Kapiti Island. This is not necessarily unusual as sometimes Sea and Rescue Searches with Helicopters produce similar visual effects. However, standing there arguing why S&amp;R was called out again, we noticed that the colour of the light changed from the usual bright white to an alteration at low frequency of a dull, surealistic green and pink. Slowly, the source of the greenish light appeared to rise from behind Kapiti Island. At this stage, we could not make out the body of the object emitting the light nor could we hear any sounds. The objects movement appeared to be relatively slow. When the light changed to pink, we briefly noticed that the source of the pink light was positioned behind the source of the green light making a huge squshed cylindrical object in front of it visible for a couple of seconds. Unfortunately, the pink beam of light and the object in front of it synchroneously set slowly behind Kapiti Island. The whole spectacle appeared to last a long time, but judging by the length of the cigarettes we smoked, it whould have had been lasting for less than one minute."

19981107,19981110,"Isle of Palms, SC",cone,7-12 minutes,"We were looking towards the city of Charleston from the Isle of Palms when we noticed an extremely bight orange object moving slowly acoss the sky.  The object was four times the size of the north star &quot;Polaris.&quot; It was at least 10 times brighter than the brightest star in the sky. At its brightest moment it appeared to have the structure of a cross which bulbed out at each end. It traveled N.W. to S.W. at a consistent speed and appeared to be floating, instead of being propelled across the sky. Between 7-10 minutes later, as it approached the South West, it came to a complete stop for about 10 seconds. Then between 5-8 smaller objects began to fall out of the larger object. The smaller objects which fell out of the larger one fell for 15-25 seconds.  Each object that fell from the larger one, fell straight to the earth for 2-3 seconds and then another one would fall. The smaller objects were extremely bright and moved at a high consistent speed. After each of the smaller objects made their way to the earth, the bigger orange object became less bright.  After the last small object fell, the larger orange object dissappeared for a split second and then re-appeared brighter than before.  This is when the cross shape structure of the object was visible. It remained at a dead stop for a few seconds and then dissapeared completely.My girlfriend and I have just recently moved to the Charleston area from Denver Colorado.  She was raised in Atlanta and I was raised in Denver, Colorado and Seattle Washington. She has been living on the Isle of Palmes for about five months.  On November 7, 1998, we had just returend from dinner.  It was between 21:50 and 22:00 when we both noticed a bright orange object in the North West.  There was no clouds in the entire sky. It was about four times the size of the north star and at least ten times brighter.  It was a bright consistent orange light and it never changed color or brightness until the end. It moved towards the South West, traveling very slowly at a very consistent speed.  It appeared to be floating instread of being propelled.  It made no sound. We watched it float across the sky for at least five minutes before it came to a complete stop in the South West sky.  It stayed there for about ten seconds. The stop was extremely sudden and abrupt. After about ten seconds, smaller objects began to fall from the large orange object. They fell for about 15-25 seconds and there was between 5-8 total objects that fell from the bigger one. They were very bright and fell extremely fast. Each small object fell for about 2-4 seconds and then another one would fall.  Each time a smaller object would fall, the orange object became less bright.  After the last small object fell the orange object dissappeared for a split second and then re-appeared brighter than before.  At the objects brightest moment, it appeared to have structure.  The structure resembled two perpendicular bars that bulbed out at the end.  My girlfriend discribed it as two dog bones perpendicular to each other."
19980923,19980924,"Renton, WA",fireball,4 sec,"Green FireballI was driving southbound out of Renton, before the 212 exit, when I saw a brilliant blue-green (mostly green with a hint of blue.) ball of light with some yellow at the end of the tail.  It was much bigger and much much brighter than any star, but smaller than the moon (maybe 1/6th to 1/8th the size of the moon.  It looked like a bottle rocket except it was green and the angle wrong.  It was traveling from East to West, coming down at about a 45 deg. angle.  It lasted about 3 to 4 seconds.  It looked like it landed in north Kent.  It had all the characteristics and trajectory of a meteorite except it was a little slow for a meteorite, but I think that may be explained if it were moving toward or away from me.  It did seem to be low in the sky (I could see it at the top of my windshield and it ended up about half way down on the right side. I have seen one or two like it before in my life except they were not green.  It did not do anything funny like stopping or changing direction.  I think the green comes from copper material in the meteorite burning up.  My final conclusion:  It was a meteorite.  Probably the most spectacular one I&apos;ve ever seen, certainly the most colorful.  When I got home about 2145 I called my flight instructor and told him about it.  Then I turned on my radio about 2218 and tuned into the Art Bell show and heard you guys talking about what I saw."

A large light slightly brighter than a large star which had been sitting motionless for a half hour suddenly, started moving from N.E. to S.E. at approx. 45 degrees above the horizon We had been watching planes fly slowly by during the evening and knew immidiatly it was a UFO.  We have seen ufos many times before so are familar with their flight pattern. From a stopped position it speed up three or four times faster than the planes or jets that we could see in the distance.It varied its speed slowing down and speeding back up for about ten seconds than James who had been looking at the ufo with his binoculars took them down for a quick readjustment.  I looked at my night vision scope in preparation to looking through it.  This took about one second for both of us to make these adjustments when we both looked back to our amazement it was completely gone from the center of the sky a distance that would have taken a plane about ten minutes to travel. We both realized even more deeply how prevalant and a part of the universe UFOs really are."

I am certain that the second ball of light hit landfall. The first glowing ball was now hovering 1/2 mile out over the ocean directly in front of me. The second ball rose up into view again, hovered, then slowly flew out to join the first yellow ball.

There was no sound and viewing conditions were optimal.We were moving harvesting equipment from a remote field back to the farm.

The fireballs were distinctly orange, had a definate round shape, did not move, were all of the same appearent size, and faded quickly after about four seconds.  There was no pattern to their appearence; 2 were seen at the same time to the west. I could see only a small area of the sky while driving but saw these while driving for only 15 minutes. The fireballs were approximately the size of the full moon, about half a degree of arc.  After arriving at the farm on the prairie at 9:15 PM I asked the other drivers if they had seen the fireballs but no-one had.  We scanned the sky and noticed a very bright light to the SW low to the horizon. It was a point source but did not appear to be moving.  I determined that it was not a planet because it was south of the plane of the ecliptic.  We observed it for a while until  we realized it was gaining altitude.  It soon resembled car headlights about 2 miles away and was at about 15&deg; elevation.  At this point it became evident that it was an aobject moving directly at us and maintaining altitude.  I remembered I had my Pentax with a 205mm lens in my truck a started taking pictures.  The object flew almost directly over our heads.  It had 3 bright white lights that were visible from all angles. There was a white light on each side with the center light  slightly ahead of the other two. There was also a cluster of green lights in the center of the object with one or two red ones intermixed.  These lights were very faint and did not blink.  There was no sound whatsover. As it continued to the NE the white lights were still dominate but there was also faint reddish lights visible from behind.  We eventually became bored with the event an left the property about 9:30PM with the object still visible above the horizon.  We were treated to 2 more orange fireballs in the west as we left.  My cousin says he returned to the field at 10PM and saw the object again.  I recall an incident in April of this year just a few miles to the north of this sighting that I saw the same lights (the rear aspect) at about 10PM along the same flightpath as abseved on 10/1.

At the same moment, I saw what at first appeared to be a fast-moving jet moving from NNW to SSE. Because of my location, I could only view about as much of the sky as the equivalent of twice the width of my hand held at arm&apos;s length. The object crossed this section of the sky in less than two seconds (possibly as quickly as one second), only long enough for me to barely open my mouth to draw attention to the others sitting with me, but not long enough for me to utter a word. What surprised me about the object was that it was very dark compared to other jets in the air that evening (dark grey) and the way the &quot;wings&quot; met at a right angle, giving the appearance of a carpenter&apos;s square flying through the air. There was no fuselage visible. I thought it might be a very large, very fast jet flying at very high altitude or a smaller, slower jet at lower altitude. I observed other jets crossing the sky within the following quarter-hour and, even though some were quite some distance away (i.e. viewed at 45% from the horizon or less), I could clearly make out their fuselages in all cases, they were much lighter in colour than what I had observed earlier, their wings did not have the distinctive right-angled proportions or even width from fuselage to tip, and they travelled at much slower apparent speeds. There was no sound from the object (not necessarily surprising if it were in fact a very high aircraft), although I could hear most of the other aircraft I observed that night, even the high, distant ones. Anyway, it made me curious, and I&apos;ve been closely watching a lot of aircraft for the past few days and nothing I&apos;ve seen in the air even closely resembles what flew over on Sunday night. The object&apos;s flight path struck me as rather strange, as most commercial aircraft fly either more-or-less on east-west lines in this part of the country or northeast to southwest if they&apos;re overseas flights. I&apos;ve never seen anything flying on so nearly a north-south axis (although this might be a good route for commercial flights from Russia or military craft returning from the far north)."

By 21:40, the sky was dark, the aircraft was very close to us. By that time, we could see 4 lights, two on each side of an inverted, very broad V. The lights looked like the headlights of two cars flying sideways. We could see the air move around the lights, like you can see the air move over a hot road in the summer. The aircraft came down right over us, it was barely over the fir trees around my pond, maybe 100 feet directly above us. There was absolutely no noise, except for a barely audible hum which seemed to encompass everything. There was no noticeable air movement. The aircraft was going very slowly, maybe 20 or 30 mph. At that point, we could see its underside: it was rectangular in shape, light colored, and the very bright light we had seen earlier was right underneath the middle, lighting itself more than the ground. We could see two wings, the tips of which barely went beyond the rectangular underside. The whole aircraft was very large, at least as large as a large commercial airplane. As it started going beyond us, we could see from its outline against the sky that it was triangular in shape, probably dark in color. The back of the aircraft had a vertical column of yellow-orange light. The light moved up and down the column in a seamless wavelike pattern. The pattern was not regular, and when I told my friend that it looked more like a language of some sort than a simple aircraft lighting system, at that very instant, the pattern changed completely. After that, the aircraft started going back up and disappeared behind a hill. I tried to report this sighting to one local newspaper and one TV station the next day. I wanted to find out if anyone else had seen it. I got some chuckles and I did not insist. This year, on July 2nd also, I invited my friend for a sky-watch evening. She could not make it, but 2 other friends came. The sky was perfectly clear. Around 21:30, we saw a very bright light in the South sky, just as I was describing my experience of the previous year. One friend pointed to that light and asked: &quot;You mean to tell me this is a UFO?&quot; Within 2 seconds, the light was gone. It just faded away. My friends went home. Later that night, at 23:00, I went to pick up my daughter from town. On the way back, I saw the same bright light, closer than before, I showed it to my 14 year old daughter, and it was gone before she had a chance to see it. Around midnight, I went outside and saw the same bright light close-by in the Northwest sky. As soon as I concentrated my attention on it, it disappeared. 10 mn later, I looked out my bedroom window and saw the light again in the Western sky. I went to get my binoculars, pointed them at the light, it disappeared. I went to sleep. I am a 49 year old female, and I grow grapes and aromatic plants. I also teach plant propagation. My female friend who saw the large aircraft with me is an herbalist, as are the 2 other friends who saw the lights with me. Neither of us believed or disbelieved the presence of UFOs before."

19980922,19980927,"Ladson, SC",sphere,0.5 Seconds,"At approx. 23:55 EST 09/22/98 what is best described as a small orb or disc passed at high rate of speed directly above witness and was travelling from NE to SW.At approximately 23:55 EST on 09/22/98 I was standing in my driveway  in Ladson, SC. and was looking to the night sky directly overhead.  I was facing towards the Northwest and suddenly something streaked across the sky directly above my position.  It was heading in a Northeast to Southwest direction.  The sighting was very brief, maybe a half second, as the object moved very quickly.  At first I did not think much of what I had seen.  After further consideration of the event, I began to realize that I could not figure out what it could possibly have been with any certainty. When I had originally sighted the object, my first thought was that it must have been a shooting star.  I then rejected this idea as it did not &apos;burn and spark&apos; as other shooting stars that I had seen in the past.  The object had been, in fact, rather dull in appearance.  It had no luminescence to speak of and my best guess is that it was only illuminated by ambient light from the ground.  There are streetlights and other less intense light sources in the immediate area.  The night was clear and visibility in the sky was quite good.  The moon, if I remember correctly, was low on the horizon and not full.  I do remember that whatever the moons&apos; aspect, its light did not interfere. I had been rather pleased by the clarity of the stars and this is why I had been looking skyward in the first place.  Dirtectly behind me was a streetlight that was approx. 120 feet away and I had faced away from it in order to see better. The best way to describe what I had seen is to say that it appeared to be a small orb or disc that was a dull, metallic color.  It had no external sources of light and did not emit any noticeable sound.  There was no trail or glow to the object.  As I had indicated previously, it appeared that ambient light was reflected from the object.  It looked rather dim/dull and was only visible for a brief instant.  This leads me to believe that it was travelling very low to the ground.  I had considered that it may have been a bird or bat.  I dismissed that notion also as its velocity was far greater than any bird or bat I had ever seen.  I also briefly thought that it may have been a airplane of some kind.  I again rejected that idea as the circumstances and my perceptions of the object strongly refuted this.  There is alot of low-flying air traffic in this area.  This is due to the nearby Air Force base and small commercial airport that share runways.  Mostly they are rather large commercial and military planes with a few small, private planes and jet fighters.  However, the vast majority of the air traffic are large planes.  The Air Force base is part of the Strategic Air Command. The only other information that I can provide is that, by my estimation, the object covered 30-40 degrees across my line of sight.  The object appeared very suddenly and had disappeared just as quickly.  This reminded me of something flying low and only visible by ambient light from the ground.  The object moved in a very straight trajectory.  This is the best and most accurate description that I can provide of the events and observations on that occasion.  I do not completely rule out any possible explanation to what I saw that night.  I can say that, whatever I had witnessed, I am perplexed and had never seen anyhting similar."

The object moved at constant speed and looked like a round glowing sphere, green in color with no distinguishing marks. The color was light green and looked similar to the bio-luminescent green light sticks the kids use on Halloween.  The diameter appeared abount ten times Jupiter and brigter than the Moon. The Moon was full, due South, close to Zenith with Jupiter just to the West, sky was very clear. Just before disappearing (.5 sec) a second smaller sphere appeared just in front of the larger sphere. It traveled at the same speed, with the same glowing green light at about one fifth the size.  The objects moved much faster than any jet or prop plane, but slower than meteors. There was a slight hint of a tail but I&apos;m not sure if that was just my eye&apos;s retina persistance. I have worked as an engineer in the aerospace industry for 25 years. I have extensive knowledge and experiance in Astronomy, Optics, Electronics and Astro-Physics having designed Earth, Moon, and Sun sensors, star trackers and Star Magnitude Photon Detectors for use on communication and spy satellites.

What I saw was what appeared to me as a shooting star, the object resembled a shot from a roman candle that was what I judge as about 10 times that in diameter.  It appeared at the area that I described and traveled at a high rate of speed in a strait line towards the horizon and appeared to be traveling in a descending northwesterly direction.  This lasted about 1.5 seconds and the object disappeared at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  The object did appear to have a slight bluish or greenish tint and was quite bright.  The tail seemed to have the same property of a comet as best as I can describe. The object though appeared to be at a great distance from my location, but still appeared proportionaly large from my perspective. I thought this interesting, mentioned it to my girlfriend who was riding with me.  She had not observed it.  I thought nothing more of this until listening to The Art Bell show this morning at 3 am, and heard the reports from Seattle from Mr. Peter Davenport. I felt compelled to report this in some manner.

19770901,19980916,"Middletown, PA",disk,5 mins,"Adamski type craft visible for 5 mins 500&apos; above Swatara Creek. Portholes, red light, ion-blue glow on bottom. Craft accellerated into beam of rainbow colored light after interceptor jets from Olmstead Airbase gave chase.On our way home from work, we passed under PA turnpike on Middletown Rd heading south. I saw a red light on an object in sky on left (east) side approx 15 degrees elevation. I am a private pilot, so I knew the object was not a plane or helicopter. To get a better view, thinking it might be a saucer, I pulled the car over and shut off the engine and lights. I rolled down the window and observed a saucer shaped craft. Once I knew what it was, I got out of the car to get better view of object. The saucer hovered motionless above the trees and over the Swatara Creek. The saucer had cupola on top. There were portholes emitting a bright yellowish glow that bathed the top of the saucer. The bottom of saucer had an ion-blue glow.  I observed solid red light (no other lights) on top - very bright, casting a red glow over top of cupola. I looked for silhouettes in windows but observed none. Craft was as big as thumb held at arms length, maybe 1/2 mile distant.  Est size of the saucer was 30&apos; in dia. Sky was overcast. Clg was 1500&apos; or more. Visibility was two miles or better.  Temperature was approximately 55 degrees.  I remember it was damp.  The sun had set and the sky was almost dark. The saucer was positioned 1/4 mile from my residence. I was a little scared but elated, too, because I knew that this was a really rare event.  I wondered what would happen if I waved.  Would it move?  So, I mustered my courage and waved at the saucer and sent a mental message out, &quot;Peace be with you!&quot; but there was no response. My wife said she was too cold and told me to shut car door.  I asked her if she would get out and look at the saucer. She didn&apos;t believe me and said it was just a helicopter. While we argued about that, I heard a roar of jet engines/afterburners from Olmstead AFB across the Susquehana River. When I heard the sound, I saw the saucer dart from my 10 o&apos;clock to 11 o&apos;clock instantly. There was a yellow flicker in the sky from the west as the jets got closer. After two seconds, the saucer darted back to the same position it was in before, only 250&apos; higher. I thought, is it trying to triangulate the position of the jets or get out of their radar beam? Then, the flickering in the clouds and the afterburner noise got very loud. The west side of my sky started to turn yellow, they were so close above the town of Middletown. The saucer had had enough. It shot up at a 70 deg. angle instantly, leaving a rainbow colored trail behind as it went up through the sky.  The jet&apos;s never descended below the clouds, but turned upwards to chase futily after the saucer.  In a minute, the light and sound had faded. I stood for a few minutes, waiting to see if they would return, but they didn&apos;t. I got back in the car with my wife and drove home.  I decided not to report this incident because I knew that the military was involved in a cover-up and feared reprisal and did not want my life interfered with at that time by the government. Years later, I saw the pictures that George Adamski took of his saucer. That was the same saucer I saw. How could what he saw be a fake if what I saw was as real as the car I was driving home in? The chasing of the craft by the AF jets validated my experience for me.  There were no reports in the local papers anytime thereafter. It would be interesting to try to use FOI Act to obtain information from any records kept by the AF from Olmstead AFB during that time period to see if there were any evening chases of an &apos;unknown.&apos;  I do not, unfortunately, remember the exact date of the event, except that it was a week-day because we were coming home from work. The location of the sighting was a few miles from Three Mile Island.  The famous TMI reactor meltdown occurred there the following year.  Was this a coincidence? I think not. In the last 22 years, I have not seen another UFO. Feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions."

It seemed to be lower than the tree tops.  It was probably at least 50 feet across.  One was illuminated by the moon and had a rounded or bull-nosed edge.

I watched the objects through an open windoe (without a screen)  Over the rest of the 2 weeks I observed the objects about 10 out of the 14 days.  I observed a pattern that seemed to support the idea that they were looking for something.  The area they were located in was beside a cliff that led to the Bow River, just down from a church.  Some of the things I was able to observe between the objects was a sort of &quot;static electricity&quot; bolts as the objects came close together.  The oval objects had a brighter band around the middle.  Most curious was that the objects seemed to remain the same sort of yellowish colour, sort of like reflection off the city lights."

19980718,19980719,"Longmont, CO",triangle,3 to 5 minutes,"Traingle craft about 60+ feet in diameter was sighted flying west of Longmont CO.Large dark triangle craft spotted. On 7-18-98 at  about 10:02 PM Mountain Time (04:02 Universal Time) as my family and I drove west away from the Wal-Mart store in Longmont Colorado we spotted a craft flying from the southwest of our area and moving northward across our field of view.  It was moving slowing and in a slightly jerky manner and this caught my attention.  It seemed to have a great many red pulsating lights with some white lights in the central area.  At the time I wondered if it were a helicopter.  It descended toward the Longmont Airport, but it did not follow the usual flight path and was actually going down toward the farm fields just south of the airport.   We lost sight of it behind trees as we drove and I forgot about it.  About 5 minutes later (about 10:07 PM) we were driving north toward the west end of the airport when we spotted a craft that looked like the first one.  We assumed it was the same one.  The craft looked like a very large plane ascending from the west end of the airport.  It was moving slowly and was large enough that as it crossed the road ahead of us the lights on the front passed over the farm fence west of the road as the rear lights were still well toward the east of the road.  The length appeared to be 50 to 60 feet.  As we drove up toward this seen we assumed that this was merely a very large plane.  The airport normally handles small twin engine and single engine aircraft.  Thus, we eyed the craft as it slowly flew over the road about 50 feet above the ground. I commented that it was lit funny because it seemed to be box shaped in that the rear had at least two red lights one above the other, and the front of the craft had two or more red lights in a vertical column.  In the middle area were other red lights and some white.  All four of the four people in the car continued to stare at the craft  on the West side of the Airport as the car was greatly slowed.  The craft ascended slowly toward the west to about 120 feet above the ground and about 1300 feet west of the road.  Then it appeared to stop! and hover.  At no time did the lights change direction and the craft at no time banked or turned around.  Because the lights did not change their orientation we continued to assume that the craft was still going west even though the craft was now growing larger.  Suddenly we realized it was headed back towards us, it having never executed a turn, and it was ascending as it moved back toward the airport in a slight northeast direction.  It came very near the rear of our car (from 160 to 200 feet).  No airplane motor noise was heard - at other times we have heard the engines of smaller craft passing over the road.  It passed over the road at about 170 feet above the ground.  As it neared the road three people in the car saw that the craft was shaped like a triangle with three equal sides.  The leading point was facing the northeast in the direction of its movement.  Many new lights were seen on its bottom hull.  Along each of the two side angles there ran long tube like lights, like neon tubes, that were a yellowish-white.  These tubes curved inward near the west end of the craft and came to sharp points. Just east of each was a large round red light and toward the west two more red lights.  Near the apex of the triangle, the east tip, was a large round recessed hole in which was a bright light-blue light.  While the red lights had been pulsating earlier as the craft was moving west, now all the lights were continually on with no blinking or pulsation.  The lights provided enough illumination to allow the viewers to see that the craft had a dark triangle hull.  We quickly tried to pull over onto another side road to we could get out.  We saw the craft move silently toward the middle section of the airport area, just north of the runway at about 350 feet above the ground.  Then the craft changed course and moved northward until it was hidden by trees near us.  We drove to another location where we could see the surrounding area but the craft was no where in sight.  AT this point it was about 10:12 PM Mountai! n Time. It appears that as the craft lifted off from the airport grounds toward the west it was moving with the flat side of the triangle toward the direction of its movement.  It then stopped and hovered a moment as it lifted the east tip of the triangle and reversed course in a slight climb back over the airport grounds."

It was moving north by north west, at an average speed, compared to commercial planes in our area from the Nashville terminals.  This object was a solid light, though, so I was interested in it, and I took two or three camara shots of it.  When the object was nearly due East of my position, it seemed as if it grew or swelled in proportions.  It dimmed, and an object with running lights exactly like a plane shot out of it, the new object hovered in position to the East of the first object, then began moving to the West.

When it neared the ground, it began moving slower, and dimmed considerably once or twice before resolving(Don&apos;t ask me how, I didn&apos;t see this, it just happened between one moment and the next)into what looked like a larger object than it&apos;s original appearance, however this one had a cross of 4 small lights underneath, and red and blue lights, like a jumbo-jet that had it&apos;s landing lights on, but much dimmer.  I took a total of maybe 10 shots and, though I&apos;m fairly handy with a camera, I&apos;m by no means a pro."

This thing was gigantic and I did not detect any sound as it passed overhead.  It was not moving fast like the airplanes I had seen just a few moments before, it was moving very slow.  I got up and started to walk across the backyard in the direction the lights were travelling, then the lights disappeared as if they had tilted upward, a few seconds later the stars and planes reappeared as if nothing had been there.

I went in to get my binoculars, but when I came out, it was gone.As I mentioned in my summary, this object was not something that I could identify. It seem to have some metallic components because it did reflect the sunlight. It also had a strange movement, like drifting and yawing at the same time. What amazes me the most is that it was not there when I came back, about a minute after. At the pace it was moving, it should have been there still. I immediately called the San Juan Flight Services Station, to find out if they had seen something in the vicinity with their primary radar. They offered me your number instead. I place a call and left a message in the answering machine, but I erroneously reported the time of the event as 1605Z, instead of 1805 which is correct. I later called the San Juan Center (CERAP) to check if they had any information that could confirm or explain my sighteen, but they said it was difficult to check their recordings and data bases and to get something usefull from there. One more thing, the object was in the vicinity of the Dorado Beacon (DDP) which is an NDB used as reference for IFR flights inbound to Puerto Rico.

19731006,19981128,"El Centro (a few miles west of), CA",light,about 1/2 hour,"orange nocturnal lightThis happened when I was a young child. The date is based on a similar report I read about in Kevin Randle&apos;s _The UFO Casebook_(p. 141). My mother, grandmother, and I had stopped for dinner in El Centro, CA, and were westbound on I-8 when we observed a very bright, orange light to the north. Soon, the object began to emit a cloud of smoke or vapor, which was greyish- white. The light &quot;blinked out&quot; and then came back on several times during the sighting (I don&apos;t remember exactly how many times), leaving the cloud hanging. The light was stationary (yet it seemed to &quot;move with us&quot; as we travelled down the freeway) and was approx. 20 degrees above the horizon. My mother and grandmother were panicking, I was was very scared at one point and hiding my eyes; it was then that I heard them exclaiming that several smaller lights were emerging from the light, flew around it, then returned to it. Unfortunately, I myself did not witness this.  Finally, the light went out permanently and the cloud dissipated. One strange feature of this event was that our car was being tailgated by a semi during the duration of the sighting, rather relentlessly (I remember we were in the slow lane the whole time, but don&apos;t recall if my grandmother, who was driving, tried to &quot;shake&quot; the tailgater at any point by changing lanes). I&apos;m posting this primarily to find out if anyone else was a witness to this, even though it was long ago."

All lights shot into sky getting smaller and smaller until so far away you could not see.On my way to Mount SAC college from Costa Mesa in the early evening, my ex-wife and I where on the 57 highway going about 60 MPH. I was distracted by a very intense light by the horizon on the hills where ther are no houses or roads. This very intense disc of light made is way over the side of the 57 highway and was causing cars to start pulling over to side of the road on both roads. It would come closer and lower and then go back up and farther away. It took me about a minute to stop the car and get out. By that time it was gone. The way it disapeared was very strange. It shot up into differnt spots in the sky that were not to distant, however; Every time it would move it would go from a complete stop to an increadable speed in an instant. It would also go from an increadible speed to a complete stop in an instant. At the end it seemed to break up into about 8 distinct balls of light that were many miles up in the air. I am very good with estimating speed and acceleration of jets and rockets. I would estimate that this object must have accelerated to a speed of 10,000 MPH in a fraction of a second only to come to a complete stop and accelerate again on a vector that was in the opposite direction. I know that this was not any aircraft or lightning. I know many others had seen it. I have recently stopped mentioned it to people, because most people either dont care or think that I am not correct."
19980703,19980804,"Campbell River (Vancouver Island) (Canada), BC",triangle,3-5 seconds,"It had 3 points of light forming a triangle. There were 2 more lights side by side near the center and front within the triangle shape. It flew in northwest directionI was laying out on my sundeck looking at the stars. It was just after midnight and the sky was mostly clear with some high cirrus. As I looked up I saw what I thought was a satellite, except it seemed to be moving almost twice as fast as the average satellite. It only took a fraction of a second for me to realize that there was more than one point of light moving across the sky (as described above). The three points of light that made up the main outline of the triangle were a dull reddish-orange colour and about the same size as most of the smaller stars that make up the night sky. The two other lights that could be seen from within the triangle were a white light but were no larger and only slightly more intense than the outer lights. These two lights were quite close together and located on either side of a central axis extending from a halfway point  at the base to the apex and closer to the front of the craft. I could not see any of the usual running lights associated with typical aircraft ie. (port and starboard lights and the bright pulsing  central light).  As it moved across the sky in a southeast to northwest direction it seemed to me that there was no substance to this shape, as if it were held together by strands of wire, with the leading light pulling the others in tow.  The colour within the triangle was exactly the colour of the night sky, and there was no dark siloette, and no reflected light.  It did make a slight sound as it passed overhead but, the sound was not far behind which seemed odd considering the speed it seemed to be travelling at. It was not as loud or delayed as even the highest jetliners that fly over.  The best way to describe the size would be to say that across the base of the triangle it would measure about the length of an average human thumb extended to arms length, with the two sides being slightly longer than the base. I was the only one in my family to see this although my wife and three children were all sleeping beside me. I tried to wake my wife but the duration of the event was so short that she never had a chance to roll over.  I am 45 years old and I have been married for ten years I have three young children and I live an otherwise normal and routine existence.   I have my own design and construction business and my wife is a recreational coordinator.  We own our house and live in a suburban neighbourhood.

No sound or other disturbance.Myself, mother and father  were west bound on Hammerly road when my father started looking at something in the sky. He stopped the car and got out and saw a saucer shaped object to the northwest of us. It was dark while a red light was on located on the bottom in the center. When the red light went out there was a glow coming from a circular area out from the center. This glow was greenish-blue in color. We stood next to the car for about 2-3 minutes watching the object as it was stationary directly above us. It did not wobble, there was no sound or distubance to indicate a propulsion. It then moved to the east following hammerly Road. It went over a Parking lot at Wirt rd. and Long Point Rd. where there was a carnival being held on the parking lot. It stopped over the carnival as if it was watching. We could see the lights reflecting off the bottom. It then started moving east bound following Long Point rd. We got back in the car and went home, which was about 3 miles north- west from that location. We were able to keep it in view the entire distance. We called my uncle that lived about 10 mins away and he came to our house where he and my father tried to observe the object through an eight inch telescope. They only said it looked like it had some type of windows. We last saw it following Hempstead highway to the north west After this night we rarely discused the sighting between ourselves and never with anyone else. The object was the classic saucer shape and would be about the size of a 24 inch plate held at arms length while it was above us. While it was above us and when we saw it over the carnival it appeared to be about 300 feet up. I only realized several years ago that the red light on the bottom was like a lazer light in the scanners used in stores. There could have been missing time. My father, mother, and uncle have since died of cancer. My mother had a rare form of eye cancer.

This object made absolutely no sound even though it would seem by the size of this object and the speed it was going that it would make some kind of sound.  We at first thought that it was a meteor, but the ones that we had seen it the past had never been so bright green. The object passed over our heads and disappeared behind the mountains (near the Acadia National Park area).  We were very surprised and had never seen anything like this before.  This object seemed very close although we could not precisely judge the distance.  This object was so bright that when it disappeared behind the mountains, it left a huge silouette of the mountains behind it.The object was bright green.  No sounds, lights or sparks were seen coming from the object.  It passed from ahead of us literally over our heads then disappeared behind the mountains in back of us.

Color very dark grey.Like I say, it was nearly dark. I had finished work and was sitting outside the rear of my store having a cigarrette. (The First sighting.) I first thought it was a helicopter, as we used to have a tree at back of the store, and my first glimpse of it was through the branches. I expected any minute to hear the sound of rotors, there were none so I looked again. When it cleared the tree and I saw what it was,.....well, I have not spoken of this to anyone except my cousin. He asked had I been drinking and laughed when I phoned him. I told him I was about to start, and indeed I bought myself a drink while I thought about it. A month later,,full moon time again (give or take a day)I saw the same thing following the high street at the same twilight time. (This should give a clue to the exact date in 1996) I was looking into the sunset or what was left after the sun had set, you know, the brightness that hangs for a little while in the hight desert There were people standing outside Le Mairs store.  I waved frantically in hope someone would see what I saw. I didnt realise until I turned, that both I and the object were East of the people and obscured by darkness. The object (hate the word saucer) made no noise at all. Late roosting birds were flying and a light aircraft was landing at our small airport.

19980725,19980728,"Tigard (suburb of Portland), OR",oval,30+ minutes,"A silver, oval shaped object hovered directly overhead at high altitude for at least 30 minutes.  A jetliner passed near by the object.  Then a second object  passed near the first, travelling at a speed similar to the jetliner with an apparent heading.It was late afternoon with clear skys and bright sunlight. I was taking a rest after chores on a hammock under a wooden sun shade on an otherwise open air deck. As I layed back, I saw a shiny metallic spot in the sky directly overhead.  It was maintaining a constant position in the sky.  In an attempt to determine what it was, I got my binocculars and returned.  The object had not moved while I was gone. With the binoccular I was able to determine an oval shape.  It was not a convetional aircraft, it could have been a balloon based on it&apos;s shape.  I could discern no further details of the object itself. While viewing the object a jetliner passed in the same viewing area directly overhead flying south to north. From my perspective, it seemed the jetliner had to also see the object.  The jetliner appeared to be 16-20 times larger than the object. A short time later, another object of similar size and shape flew across my viewing area directly overhead. It had a heading of NE to SE.  It approached the first object, and went past.  Speed was similar to the rate the jetliner passed. A startling observation for me was the very limited viewing field where I could see the stationary object.  If I left the cover area to an open area of the same deck, I could not find the object in the sky.  If I returned to the hammock and looked straight up I could see the object solidly.  The difference of shade and light surrounding me could be the cause of this effect.  I repeated this several times, until I was convinced near the hammock was the only place I could see this object. I then went to get my video camera.  Laying on the hammock, the object was too small to show up in the view finder.  That discuraged me from shooting tape. I figured that if the viewfinder couldn&apos;t see it, I would probably have nothing special on tape. All of this ocurred over about 30 minutes.  In that time the stationary object had drifted only a couple inches south relative to my deck shade. Finally, I just quit looking and went back to my other activities."

Please get back to me on this Image that I took of this event.As I said before the object appeared to Spherical in shape while glowing brightly, I noticed the sun&apos;s reflection of the jet was sort of bright but it wasn&apos;t nearly as bright as the object I was observing, and the object appeared to be much more further away than the jet. That&apos;s why I was at a loss for an explanation. It was so bright and there were no clouds in the sky, It was Sunny out. The way it changed directions was very awkward. It was very subtle but quick. When I took the picture I thought that was enough of that. To my surprise when I get home all I see is A bright Blue sky.

Object was in a flat horizontal projectory. More information can be found in depth at the URL above.UFO Spotted on Mt. Baker, Washington (September 12, 1998) UFO Skywatchers from several parts of the United States gathered this year at Mt. Baker&apos;s &quot;Snowline Inn&quot;. The group was gathered for the yearly rendevous at this location where organizer, Tom Sanger, of Arizona, had his UFO experience in 1988. He and a buddy were hiking near the US-Canadian border when they were closely approached by a UFO. Oddly, the ridge closest to the UFO&apos;s position is called the Pleiades. Since then, Tom has gotten a group together every year for the outing to Mt. Baker. This object was clearly seen by ten people that were in our party and 4 others that were set up farther away with telescopes. It initially approached from west to east traveling approximately 7,000 miles per hour, according to retired Air Force personnel in our party. Far too fast to see through binoculars or telescopes. It was clearly visible for 5-10 seconds before it faded out. Interestingly, it was on a horizontal trajectory and not arching as a meteor would. The UFO had an orange corona as something traveling very fast in the atmosphere. It was the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. Distance was difficult to judge in the darkness, but it was between Mt. Baker, and Mt. Shuksin and at about 15 degrees. Last year, several residents of the area reported bright green lights over Goat Mt. and what appeared to be a large round circular area &quot;cut out&quot; of the snow. The area is only accessible by air or walking. There are no logging roads to get up there. The &quot;cut&quot; was on the northern slope where there are no residents on the other side to see it. Local deer hunters ran across it. Shortly after, black helicopters were seen in the area flying over the area of the missing snow. No mention was ever made to anyone in the area as to what this might have been. After we observed the UFO, the moon rose and shone brightly. We could clearly see a dense fog rolling into the area making it impossible to see any further. We opted to leave. In the 8 minutes it took to get everyone going, the fog was so thick you could hardly see the one in front of you. The road was twenty miles of winding hairpins. That combined with fog was more than we wanted to chance. We took off down the road slowly at first. We passed only one car coming up. Our driver, a lady from Arizona named Tina, was sharp eyed and spotted Owls in the trees alongside the road. She stopped and we shone the flashlight on them. They stayed put. We saw about four of them on the way off the mountain. Were they really owls? One might wonder.... The following morning at breakfast, we spoke to the driver of the car that was coming up the mountain. She said there was no fog when they got to the top. Amazing, since it was only 20 miles, and they were almost to the top when we passed them. This fact and that our driver could spot owls in the trees on a treacherous road at night in the fog was just totally amazing. If Tom has this next year, it&apos;s a must go for me! You can&apos;t spot them if you don&apos;t look for them! If you want to take part in it, email me and I&apos;ll put you on the list. Your mind is like a parachute. It only works when it is open!"
19980731,19980801,"San Diego, CA",other,non-stop,"Strange bright, white light with 4 other smaller lights. All in a diagonal row.I went out to fill the dog bowl before going to bed. I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye. I just thought it was the moon. When I turned around I saw a very bright light high in the sky. I was looking east from a small town outside of San Diego, California. I have seen bright lights before but none this bright. So I went to get binoculars. At first, the light was just bright and blury. Then I steadied myself against the house and this is when I saw something very strange. Starting from what would be one&apos;s lower left corner of a screen there were smaller lights (star-like) that were spaced apart. There were 3 of these smaller lights in a diagonal line which started at the lower left corner of view and moved up to the higher right side of view. What appeared to be right next to the 3rd light was the larger bright light. Then, still going diagonally up to the right, there was a 4th small light. It was like a perfect line. I didn&apos;t know what to make of it. I tried to capture it on video but it just shows a blurry bright white light. The smaller lights wouldn&apos;t show up on the lens with the zoom all the way out. Anyhow, I have never seen anything like this. I use the Internet a lot and decided to type in a search for anything that would give me a place to tell about this sighting. I found a site with links that led me to this page. The objects did not move at all. I don&apos;t believe it was alien, but then again I don&apos;t have a clue what could it could be. The 5 objects were aligned in such a perfect line that it is not something I think is common to see. The distance from earth that these objects appeared to be must make each of the objects very far apart from each other. I have no clue about the stars and systems in space. Maybe the bigger bright light was a satelite that just happened to be in alignment with a row of stars. If anyone has seen similar or knows what this is, please let me know. I am just curious. I have never seen anything like this. And as I write this, it is still visible. Thank you."

They were black with no lights or markings.I was taking my morning walk around the hiking trails on my property on the morning of Tuesday, Dec. 1, 1998. It was 7:10am. (07:10) As I was approaching a clearing near the treeline I heard a familiar sound that I have heard several times of birds swooping down making only the sound of air passing their wings. The sun was just starting to peek over the hills behind me. It had not yet shined on Mt. Konocti directly across the lake from where I was waiting for what I expected to see, birds. Instead of birds, I saw four objects flying in close formation. They were black in color. They had no visable lights or markings. I have to guess their size to be approx. six feet across the wings and equal in length. The fuselage was round and pointed at both ends. The wings were narrow in relationship the the fuselage, located in the center and were pointed at the ends. The wing span was maybe just a little wider than the length of the fuselage. I heard the swooshing sound about two or three seconds before seeing the objects. They seemed to have flown down the ravine that I had just walked down and was flying just above the tree tops. Immediately after first seeing them, they leveled out and flew in a straight line out over the lake toward Mt. Konocti. Buckingham Peninsula extends out into the lake at the base of the mountain. They flew to where the peninsula is, then the one on the left made a smooth turn to the left. The other three wobbled just a bit as if they were not aware that they were to turn left, then they too turned. They flew in front of the mountain where it was still dark. Because of the darkness they blended in with the mountain and I lost sight of them. I waited to see if they would reappear in the light of the sky to the left of the mountain, but they did not reappear. From the time I first heard the familiar sound to when they flew out of sight, was about 6 seconds. They flew in a southwesterly direction before they made their turn. At that point, they were flying south across the face of the mountain."

As I watched one meteor directly overhead, the meteor trail crossed the path of the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, with three hemi-spherical projections from the bottom.  Imagine three silver ballons with their stems tied together.  It was about the size of ones thumbnail if held at arms length, or the distance between any two of the three stars that make up Orion&apos;s belt.  It&apos;s leading edge and the leading portions of the projections seemed to be reflecting the pinkish color of a nearby streetlight, or possibly the glow from Austin, but it did not seem to be creating any other light of its own.  The wind was a dead calm and it made no sound. It was moving extrememly fast.  I approximated that it would travel from horizon to horizon in about 10-15 seconds.  I saw it first when it was almost directly overhead, and watched it for about five seconds before it was obscured by a house.  During that time it travelled N-S along a line from Polaris passing roughly between Leo and Orion. I felt it might actually be three silver ballons that someone had let go, or possibly a set of weather balloons, but the object was moving very fast and the wind was a dead calm.  I continued to watch until 3:00 AM but saw nothing else except meteors. I am an amateur astronomer with a degree in Physics.  I am very skeptical about what I saw, but I have no explanation.  I have to count out normal balloons or weather balloons due to the extremely fast movement of the object and the lack of any wind whatsoever.  I was very startled to find a similar report in your database dated 10/8/98, also in Austin."

I said something like &quot;Woah!&quot; and my friend looked up to catch it just as it was going past. It seemed to be an egg shaped thing, travelling very very fast and it was glowing green/yellow in colour. It appeared to leave a trail behind it which was also green/yellow. The trail didn&apos;t remain fo any length of time so it may have been just the light from the craft leaving a trail because of its speed. There was no noise at all. It appeared to be quite high in the sky, but not high enough to be any sort of plane or shooting star. It travelled in a very straight line, unlike shooting stars which fall rather than fly.

I then made a right on Placentia. The light was now about a half a mile away and now moving north at a rising 30 degree angle. It was heading towards March AFB. I finally got home, told my parents and my sister to come and see the UFO. When they got out side the light was moving slowly up.  The light was, at the most, four miles from us. I did not see it move that distance in that short of time. The light then made a fast U-shaped turn in the sky and went out. The whole ordeal only lasted about three minutes.

It was trailing faint red sparks.  I believed it burned out before reaching the horizion as i continued to follow the trajectory after it wnet out to see what would happen nothing did but I had no horizontal reference point so it may have passed over the horizon.  The direction noted at the time was Northeast to Southwest.  The altitude upon sighting was extremely high and then it lost altitude as it moved to the Southwest from the Northeast.  The range from inception was just South and an undetermined distance east and it moved considerably down range during the sighting.  As for the altitude and range estimations no Earth visual clues were availible.  Immediately upon seeing this object I noted my watch as 9:11 Pacific Daylight Savings time. The object itself:  Since there was not a frame of reference the exact or reasonably estimated size object is unknown.  The object was large and the green light probaly could have illuminated clouds if they had been around.  The color was bright emerald green.  The center of the ball was almost bright white/green and it was about 20% of the diamter of the object.  The object also trailed a sparky red tail that was about 2 times longer than the grren ball&apos;s diameter.  Interesting to note is that I was driving at about 60 mph and the object was spotted out the top of the windsheild.  I wonder how far it may have traveled before I started observing it.

The objects were not abreast each other in a perfectly straight line. At one time, one object fell behind and then quickly caught up to the formation.  The two sets were close to being in line with each other at a distance of 8 to 10 lengths of a single formation. The objects continued to move at a constant speed toward the northwest.  The two formations then separated at about 70 degrees off the northern horizon; one direction unknown, the other moved west and the formation appeared to close in on its self, but still abreast one another.  The objects could be seen with the naked eye, and appeared as fuzzy or hazy lights, not sharp like that of a star. The objects then appeared to fade or diminish in intensity as they moved westward. The object were obscured from view by trees and could no longer be followed. The objects were first noticed while I, an amateur astronomer, was observing Jupiter."

The main things I remember was that the UFO was about the size of my fist, perhaps a quarter of a mile away from me, it was white/yellowish and at impact it emitted a brilliant white/blue light that sent a kind of &quot;hot flash&quot; through me as it shined. I remember not being able to move and being forced to watch this occurance. The night sky also seemed to not have any other stars that were visible either. The moon was also not visible, but when I was able to move, reappeared. The stars never reappeared. Colfax is a forest setting and the UFO grazed the treetops in its descent.

At approximately 10:45 p.m. on June 22, my fiancee and I both noticed a strange speck of light as we stood on the ledge of our second story apartment.  The light behaved in a bizarre fashion, moving at what seemed to be incredible speeds in a zigzag motion back and forth.  It would disappear into some trees for a moment then reappear.  The entire episode lasted until 10:50. In are attempt to give this moment a rational explanation we both ruled out the following: The object did not appear to be any type of aircraft due to it&apos;s bizarre flying behavior, nor was it a search light because there was no ground source projecting it. I am writing this to the National UFO Reporting Center in the hopes that there may have been others that had witnessed this strange event.  It may be possible that the object was picked up on radar at our local air port though I could not obtain that information at this time. Whatever it was it has defiantly spooked both of us into thinking that much of the stuff we see on TV may not be figments of the imagination."

It then slowly went back away from me and floated out of sight.  I went to the house of a girl I knew in the neighborhood and told her about the incident.  She said that about the same time their german shepard dog started barking very wildly for no apparent reason.

No lights or sound.I was outside in my driveway lying on my back in order to view the evening meteor shower.  Suddenly, I noticed an odd looking triangular shaped craft moving at the speed of a commercial airliner flying directly overhead.  It was very faint, barely discernable, had I not been attentively focused on the stars I probably would not have noticed it at all.  The object obliterated any starlight behind it as it silently glided from north to south.  The leading edges of the object had an eerie faint orange glow.  No lights were visible on this craft.  I often watch the night sky and must say that I have never seen anything quite like this.  It was exciting to see.  The object moved behind a tree and I jumped up to see if I could reestablish a visual contact.  As I expected, once the visual contact was interrupted, I was not able to focus on it again. I did notice the red light of an aircraft in the vicinity but probably at a much lower altitude than the object.  This aircraft certainly was not in pursuit of the object and was moving almost perpendicular to the object trajectory. I called the sighting in shortly therafter to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I was quite surprised but at the same time elated to find myself speaking directly to Peter Davenport, Center Director.  Having heard him speak in the past as a special guest on the Art Bell Show, I recognized his voice immediately.  After phoning in the sighting, I returned to my post, hoping to see more, but there was nothing but stars once again.  I thought about what I had witnessed, and wondered if I would ever see something like this again in my lifetime."
19940103,19980709,"Albuquerque (30-60 miles west of city), NM",triangle,3-4 minutes?,"Saw triangular craft approaching from horizon from the N.W., approached slowly, silently, and low to the ground.  Passed directly over our car as we drove west on I-40.  Very large - 200-300 feet long, with circular thing in front on bottom.  Saw beamwork, tubing, ducts, wiring, lights.My husband and I were travelling on I-40 westbound from Alburquerque, New Mexico toward Arizona.  We were approx. 30-60 miles west of Alburquerque at approx. 11:30 pm when I sighted a lighted object at the horizon line, northwest of us. I guess I must have noticed something unusual about it, because I became fixated on it.  It was triangular in shape, with lights.  I remember at least three lights at the point of triangle at front of craft and one on each back corner. It approached silently, at a very slow steady rate.  I continued to stare at it, and the next thing I knew it was gliding directly overhead, over our vehicle and I-40.  It was huge - I would say 200-300 feet long, and very low to the ground, about 3-5 telephone poles in height from the ground.  I could clearly see the underside of the craft as it was illuminated.  It was so big as it passed over it blocked out most of my view of the sky.  I watched it by looking directly up through the windshield.  It now appeared an elongated octogon-shape (rectangle with corners cut.)  I was viewing the underside: There was a large circular thing in the front center, beamwork, ducts, tubes, wiring of some kind. I would say it was dark grey or black metal.  As it glided across the highway heading southeast, and over the car eventually obstructing my view, I then looked through the driver&apos;s side rear window to continue watching it....but it vanished!  Completely!  I looked and looked, all over the sky--nothing!  I continued to be alert and watch the sky as we drove that night, but never saw it or anything else unusual again. I should clarify that I was a passenger, sitting in the front seat.  My husband was driving. I am sending sketches of what I saw via e-mail. Reactions:  I had totally conflicting reactions to this event.  The craft appeared mechanical in nature (lights, beamwork, even rivets) so it could have been some kind of military craft.  HOWEVER...the craft was moving at an extremely slow speed. I would estimate my husband was driving about 60 m.p.h, and the craft was moving slower than that.  It made no sound that I could hear.  What is even more bizarre is that even though I viewed it approaching all the way from the horizon, for several minutes, and I strongly desired to tell my husband to look and pull over I did not. I did not say anything. I just watched it!  There were other cars on the highway, and I could not believe they were not all pulling over and freaking out.  They were all just travelling like everything was normal.  Then it disappeared right after it went overhead!  Something 200-300 feet long just disappeared!  I was completely dumbfounded, and just remember continuing to watch the sky for the duration of drive that night. Although I thought I remembered saying something about it to my husband after it passed by, he had absolutely no recollection of the event at all, and said he did not see anything that night, that he must have been concentrating on driving. I think I did not bring up the subject and describe it in detail to him, including drawing a sketch, until we were in Florida a month later.  How could he have NOT seen something as big as a football field fly directly over our vehicle that night, even if he was watching the road? If it was some secret military craft on a test flight, why would it travel over a major interstate slow and low to the ground, with lights and in plain view?  I can&apos;t reason this through, and my reactions were definitely out of character.  It has been perplexing me for a long time, and I&apos;ve always wondered if anybody else on that highway that night also saw it. So I decided I should report it.  I am now 33 years old, female, married, own my own small business, have a bachelor&apos;s degree, and currently live on the west coast. I wish my memory was clearer so I could remember more details - I am capable of drawing and wish I could offer more information."

I was looking south toward the massachusetts turnpike and toward the town of Indian Orchard, Mass which cast a glow into the night sky. I was ten years old at the time.  My stargazing was interrupted by a rapidly flashing bluish white light.  I thought it was some kind of firefly but when I looked directly at it I saw that it was on one edge of a black silhouetted cigar shaped object.  It reminded me of a weapon discharge such as a machine gun.  It was &apos;firing&apos; in the same direction of travel as the object and appeared to be slowing the object down as if it were a retrorocket.  The object (which I estimated to be large...at least several hundred feet long) slowed to a halt over the hill.  The blue-white light ceased to discharge.  After a few seconds it slowly descended behind the hill and out of sight (there is a valley there where the Ludlow River (it may be called the Chicopee River actually) flows.

It caught my attention, so I watched it for a while. It had no apparant markings, and I recall it being dark grey in color. It was still light, and visibility was good except for scattered clouds. There were some clouds to the West of us. After the small plane circled for a few minutes, an object came out of the clouds. It was either the size of a fighter plane at about 1000 feet, or something larger much higher. My 7-year-old son who has very sharp eyes said it looked like a fighter plane to him, but I couldn&apos;t make out the exact shape. It didn&apos;t look like any fighter I was familiar with, but was roughly that shape. What was odd was that there were two glowing orange circles on the back of the object like it was a fighter jet on afterburners, but it was completely silent. It was not that far away nor that far up -- a fighter on afterburners sounds like a freight train. After the object came out of the clouds, the small plane stopped circling and they both headed off to the East. If it was a fighter on afterburners, it was moving much too slowly. I estimate it was going only about 2-3 times as fast as the small plane. It looked all the world to me like the small plane was waiting for the object, and then escorted it somewhere. An army base is in the approximate direction that the two craft were heading."

Everyone else saw craft in the shape of a suacer and I see one shaped like a Big Mac. As I was driving home, I saw a National Speed Limit Sign. This is when In realised that the thing that I saw was in fact spherical rather than shaped as described above. If you rotate the National speed limit sign in England, around, about 45 degrees and you shrink the black centre line by a little, then you have the basic shape of what I saw. The colour was the same colour as Ragoo, a kind of sandstone orange. I have been asked how big it was? If you take a double decker bus and then split it in half, make the square bit that you have left, round, then this is about the size of what I saw. There were no flashing lights or anything to make this interesting, but I know I saw this object (although I somtimes even dought myself) and I know, having thought about it since, that every natural object, by it&apos;s natural shape is spherical. To travel at speeds exceeding light, which is not generaly acceptable today through the scientific channels, we would have to be super-human, but I know what I saw, and I have considered what I saw.

My girlfriend had fallen asleep, but as I was going around the many rock strewn mountains that cover this area, I witnessed what appeared to be a saucer-shaped object hovering about five to six feet above the ground in one of the canyons there.  It didn&apos;t exactly glow like in many sci fi movies but any light that hit it seemed to brighten its surface, like that material that glows in the dark when you expose it to light.  For about two minutes it just floated there silently.  It was shaped like a cross section of a cylinder, perfectly smooth, no lights, no portals or doors. In other words a smooth sided saucer with no curves. It then rose perfectly verticle into the air then zigzagged around the mountain peaks and finally disappeared into the night sky.  I tried waking my girlfriend but the events were so fascinating that by the time I could wake her the object was gone. I spent the rest of the trip trying to explain away what I saw."

If visitors to this site have any questions I&apos;ll be glad to answer if I can. If anyone has any further information or explanation on them I&apos;d appreciate a reply. I&apos;ve copied these experiences from a past journal.))I went for a drive one evening, down south on highway 71 and about 6 or 7 pm when I was returning, happened to glance off to my right, in the sky and noticed two light-blue colored lights, side by side, heading angle-wise toward the road (&apos;8 oclock&apos;). The distance between the lights, perspective-wise, was less than an inch apart, and didn&apos;t blink or flash. Also, what struck my attention had been the color...almost a neon blue. I kept an eye on the because I knew they&apos;d soon pass across the road; however, when they got closer and I could see better what they were attached to, they began to arc south (back toward &apos;6 oclock&apos;). These were particularly curious because I&apos;ve never seen that color blue before ~ this neon or flourescent blue is as close as I can describe it. I pulled onto the shoulder and stopped, got out and watched. THIS event scared me damn near as bad as the moon-looking orb. The object or craft was a thin rectangle, and the lights were inside either end. It looked like a big 2x4 on its widest side, and perspective-wise, about 3 feet in length if at arm&apos;s length.  The lights were inside the narrow-most side, like the eyes of a hammerhead shark, only in front, not the side. ___________________________ |_*_____________________*__| Initially I assumed it was a plane but it made no sound at all...literally soundless, and as it went by, there hadn&apos;t been any more to it ~ just a simple, black (or possibly dark gray, steel color) rectangle. If it would have been a plane (and this was a low as a low flying plane could fly without dropping out of the sky, and about twice as wide as the wing span of a little charter plane), I could have seen the rivits and seams and bolts, etc. This was solid and looked seamless. It cruised at plane speed. My rationale tried to convince me this was likely some new machine  that they&apos;re testing out...maybe a remote operated spy plane or something...military jets do a lot of low flying out there in that part of the city (outskirts of Bossier City)...but reality said it was doubtful...this IS Barksdale. I watched it head south at a languid speed until it was no longer visible, and gathered myself, and went home. Later, I mentioned this event to my mother, who related a similar account she&apos;d had with the same sort of object being chased by two military jets, and it shot off out of sight. I also asked an Air Force buddy of mine if they were testing something out there and he said they weren&apos;t, it wasn&apos;t ours, and several pilots on base were all wired over it because no one knew what it was or where it came from.  I found this a little hard to choke down tho, because I would think that it would&apos;ve been shot out of the sky had it breezed in over an air base. He also said, tho, that we have nothing at Barksdale that could fly that low without making deafening noise, much less crashing. I would appreciate any details on this from anyone military with suggestions!! *** I have posted the other events here also. Look for: 1. MOSES LAKE  WASHINGTON  MARCH 23, 1995 2.

The airport at Chico is used for pratice approaches by aircraft from Beale AFB for the U-2 and SRC71.  The Arrora replacement for the SRC71 is currently being hangered at Beale for short periods of time, in training situations.This is not meant to downgrade the observation of the Lady from Paradise,  but I think it is important to note that Beale has a ready crew of ground personnel and equipment for Chico and the runway is capable of taking large aircraft.  I have 26 years of experience in the distant early warning system, tower and radar approach controll and carrier approach control and have observed UFO activity as early as 1957 over the North Atlantic and reported same to NORAD by single sideband direct communications.  I have observed many &quot;large military&quot; aircraft on pratice approach to Chico since 1979 and am aware that it is a designated dispersal point for certain types during national emergency situations.  There are old military silo launch sites in the Chico vicinity and some may still be active.  Happy hunting from one who knows first hand that you are not on a wild goose chase."

There was a very low hum coming from it.  We went into a panic and started trying to get into the house but it was locked because my friends parents were gone for the night.  So, we tried to think of a plan to get around the craft so that we could run down the street to my house which was two houses down.  But, we were to scared so we just climbed back into our sleeping bags and pulled it over our heads.  The dogs were going crazy in the house.  One kept on trying to jump through the window.  We stared at it for quite awhile.  It finally started hovering about 5 feet from the ground and slowly took off and hovered above the house across the street for about 10 minutes then it just took off so fast that we had a hard time following it with our eyes.

Baldy. I was coming down the mountain and was about 6 miles north of Alta Loma California when I and my partner observed the bright circular object appearing to maintain both it&apos;s altitude and position. We pulled over to the side of the road and I inspected the object with 10X50 binoculars, but could dicern no further detail because of the extremely bright &quot;reflection.&quot; We initially thought the object was a weather or scientific balloon and that it was reflecting the sun - over the horizon. Given the approximate 2000 asl of the hills I estimate the object to have been about 3500 to 4000 feet above sea level. As we watched the object we were perplexed to see how the object could have been reflecting the sun which had already set. Additionally, we were viewing an object which was south-west of our position. Which should have minimized if not eliminated the potential reflection. After deciding it &quot;couldn&apos;t be a UFO&quot; we proceeded down the road and lost view of the object. I am very familiar with the area as both a resident and private pilot, having flown throughout the local area from Brackett airport in Pomona. Such an object would be a hazard to airmen in the area, especially at that time of night. I returned on the following day at about 1900 and observed the object again. This time I only watched it moving for about 20 minutes, then proceeded along the mountain road in an effort to gain a closer vantage point. Once I moved to a point that should have been directly east of it, I was no longer able to see the object. I returned to the prior vantage point (north-east where I lost visual contact) and could not relocate the object. There was a period of about 20 minutes from the point that I moved south-west to get closer to the object and when I returned to the initial vantage point. I am a former California licensed private investigator with over 15 years of surveillance experience as well as a former Marine Corps Intelligence Analyst assigned to the Air Wing. I am very familiar with most objects/craft including fixed/helo military and civilian and I could not identify what this object was. I continued to be struck by the brillant light eminating/reflecting from the object. If it is (i.e. the sighting report on 11/10/98 at 1138) a &quot;metallic weather baloon&quot; there should be some known data collection location. I was unable to locate one through my contacts with the FAA control tower at Brackett airfield."

The craft was very bright and when we got closer it was actually hoovering over the desert with a very bright light illuminating the ground.My wife and I were on our way home, Phoenix, from San Diego.  We were approximately 1/2 hour east of Yuma, Arizona.  She was sleeping, and I noticed this bright light flying above the desert off in the distance.  I didn&apos;t think much about it, not being familiar with the area, I just assumed that it was probably a crop duster or something of that sort. As we got a little closer to the object, I noticed that the lights were much brighter than that of a crop duster! The entire desert was being illuminated by this craft.  I woke my wife up, asking her if she believed in UFO&apos;s!  She was upset at being woken, and smarted off to me &quot;Why?&quot;  I simply told her that I was not a big believer, but that what ever I was seeing off in the distance was certainly making me believe.  When she looked, she too was shocked. We were getting real close to the object which was black in color.  We noticed that it was not one bright light, but a series of bright lights shining down.  The craft had one in each corner, one in the middle, and several others red, possibly amber, surrounding it.  A semi driver that had been in front of me this entire time pulled off to the side of the road, as did we.  The craft was actually hoovering over the desert with the middle light shining down bright on the ground.  It was as though it were looking for something.  The craft would then move very slowly twoards us, and as it got to where the highway was, all the lights, except the amber lights, would go off until it crossed over the highway.  Once on the other side all lights would return.  The craft was not moving incredibly fast while over the desert but, as it crossed the road it would do so in a hurry.  It concentrated most of its time on the south side of the highway and it passed directly over us severaal times.  It was a very warm Arizona night and we had our windows down, yet heard nothing.  We did not realize this until we were driving away.  My wife was very scared while we were parked there and she begged me to continue driving.  We co! uld see this object for a few miles as we drove away, then it just vanished.  Both of us agreed to tell no one what we had just seen, for fear of being laughed at.  I had to tell someone so I told my parents the next morning.  Yesterday, February 28, 1999, I was golfing with my cousin who was talking about the Phoenix sightings and explaining what the craft looked like.  I told him what my wife and I had encountered so he sent me via email your web address, as well as some pictures that he pulled off the internet.  The pictures that he sent me are very similar to what my wife and I seen, the craft was not huge, but not small either.  The lights were very bright yet, not blinding.  The whole experience was kinda nerve racking to say the least.  Yet, I have no doubt what I seen over that portion of the Arizona desert.  I now believe in UFO&apos;s, but I believe that it was a millitary craft given our location.  Yuma has a large millitary presence.  Anyway, thats our story."

It was not in the flight path of either O Hare or Midway airport. As I continued west bound I realized that what ever it was would be passing directly over head in a few moments. As I came closer to it, I noticed that what seemed like a line of nine lights was a series of three triangles with three sets of lights in each. I slowed to 25 to 30 miles per hour as it passed directly overhead. There was no sound as it passed over the highway. The lights were to bright to allow any sighting of the craft itself, although the outline of the configuration of the lights suggested that the craft was V shaped wing. The altitude is only a approximation. If it were higher in the sky then it would be of a larger size, if it were lower it would be slightly smaller. I have flown ultralight aircraft and no a little about determining altitude from the ground level persective. Other cars had slowed down and were also looking up as it passed dircectly overhead.

19990227,19990307,"Laughlin, NV",light,6-8 min.,"A group of approximately 50-70 adults watched 5 white lights, the apparent size of bright stars, maneuver in the night sky.The sighting occurred during the banquet and closing ceremonies of the 8th Annual International UFO Congress, being held in Laughlin, NV.  I had been a speaker at the event on the prior morning of the sighting reported here. At approximately 2130 hrs. (Pacific), a friend approached me in the hallway of the hotel and urged me to run outside immediately, stating that a UFO sighting was in process.  I was skeptical, but since I know the individual well, and know him to be a serious-minded person, I responded to his request. I went out to the east side of the hotel, and found approximately 50-70 individuals looking to the east over the Colorado River, generally in the direction of Bullhead City, AZ, which is directly across the Colorado River from Laughlin, NV.  I looked in the direction that they appeared to be looking, approximately 80-90 degrees (azimuth; true), and quickly spotted 5 small, luminous objects, which at first appeared to be prominent stars, approximately the same magnitude and &quot;size&quot; of the stars that form the &quot;belt&quot; in the Orion constellation. Three of the lights on the right, approximately 45-50 (est.) degrees above the horizontal plane, were in a formation that made me believe initially that I was looking at the Orion constellation, but the &quot;lights&quot; were in the eastern sky, and the Orion constellation is located in the southern sky at that time of night. Approximately 2-5 degrees above the three lights, and approximately 5 degrees to their left, were two more, similar, &quot;lights.&quot;  Just a few seconds after I had begun looking at the two lights on the left, I observed that they were moving relative to one another.  They were turning, accelerating for a second or two, slowing suddenly, and then changing direction again.  Their movement seemed almost random, although they clearly were changing position, circling one another, etc.. At this point, I was intrigued by the display, given that it was profoundly bizarre and anomalous.  The display was like nothing I had seen in 51 years on this planet!  I then looked back at the three lights on the right, and was even more intrigued to note that they no longer formed a straight line, but they were moving, and within seconds they were beginning to orient themselves relative to one another in a triangular formation.  Within an estimated 5-10 seconds, they had formed into an isosceles triangle, and all of them were moving generally to the southwest, or south-southwest, at a very slow (angular) velocity, e.g. approx. 1 deg./sec..  That is, they had reversed their course from generally south to north, when I first observed them, to north to south. The entire group of witnesses stood in place, watching the lights slowly drift in that direction, for approximately 6-8 minutes.  All of the lights passed &quot;below&quot; an almost full moon, becoming fainter, it seemed to me, as they moved to the southwest.  Finally, the lights were no longer visible to me and they became progressively fainter until they were no longer visible to any of the witnesses.I have no idea what the objects were, but they CLEARLY were not meteors (!!), conventional aircraft, birds, insects, satellites, or any other object of terrestrial origin, with which I am familiar."

In the summer of 1989 or 1990, I don&apos;t remember which, I was driving with my then-girlfriend north on State Line, near 89th Street. It was probably no later than seven o clock, because it was very light. She was first to notice what appeared to be a tumbling, white object. It appeared to be disintegrating, but was not throwing off light. It was traveling S-N and seemed to be on a near level path. We were in busy traffic and lost sight of it. My girlfriend noticed it because she thought it was a plane crashing! But there was no report of any crash that day, and I was aware of no one else who witnessed the phenomena. I would have loved to have watched it standing on that road instead of navigating a car through busy traffic at 40 mph! I was amazed how similar this report was to mine, and was especially intrigued by the geographic proximity of the two sightings. I had always chalked it up to a meteor, but the lack of light and the fact no one else seemed to have seen it (it was really spectacular) always puzzled me. Now I don&apos;t know what to think! Occurred : 11/30/1997 19:11 (Entered as : 11/30/97 19:11) Reported : 12/1/1997 07:05 Posted : 12/15/1998 Location : Kansas City, MO Shape : I witnessed what was obviously a single object entering the atmosphere. It descended from north to west at a 45 degree angle at about 30 degrees above the horizon. It burned a very bright white and I witnessed sparks flying off of the object. I have witnessed many meteor showers, and while this object was similar it seemed lower in the atmosphere, very large and extremely bright as I was in a brightly lit part of the city."

Convinced these were helos we rolled down our windows, but heard no sounds other than roar of traffic. I have lived on military installations for about 15 years and never have witness these types of manuevers. myself, husband and my 3 children witness this from our car. even as we approached gulf breeze we could see these 4 lights but they moved so that 2 were over pensacola sound and 2 were over 2 navarre sound so direction they moved was north. again we were almost onvinced that these were helos but after rolling down windows we heard no sound."
19990319,19990319,"Weaverville, NC",other,forty seconds,Two black helicopters following possible object near Parkway entranceTwo black helicopters flying about 200 feet above the ground went across the valley very quickly. I may or may not have seen an object- there was a brief orangish flash that might have been the sun behind the mountian. There was no reason for those helicopters to be in this specific area in this time- I&apos;m reporting this mainly to corraborate an earlier report of black helicopters pursueing a UFO.
19680815,19990222,"Church Hill, PA",sphere,about 15 min,"Silver sphere flew overhead at high altitude with two delta-wing fighters in pursuit.Time is late summer of 1968.  Afternoon.  Observer location at the Eastern end of Manor Road, Church Hill, PA (located on US 322 between Reedsville and Milroy). Visual angle on the object was about 85 deg above horizon.  Object appeared to be silver sphere, moving from North to South.  Sighting started &amp; ended about 45 deg to either side of zenith.  Two delta-wing fighters (considering the year probably F102s) trailed yhe onject (in terms of flight path), with distance between the object anbd the fighters increasing -- ie, object appeared to be faster than fighters. Object was *not* a reflection from a conventional airplane.  The angle between the sun (cloudless day) changed markedly between beginning &amp; ending of sighting, but the appearance of the object as a silvery sphere did not vary. Also, the fighters were always visible as conventional aircraft throught the sighting. The question, of course, is:  what was the actual altitude of the UFO? If at the fighter&apos;s altitude or greater, it was going faster than the fighters.  If less than the altitude of the fighters, it could have been slower than the fighters -- and if enough lower, could have been a balloon. At no time during the sighting did it *feel* like it was a balloon, however."
19981205,19981206,"Marina del Rey/Los Angeles, CA",unknown,full minute,"While walking with three other witnesses at about dusk, I viewed a contrail headed toward me from a direct West compass heading.  The object looked as if it were decending from a long way out (very long contrail) and as it approached to about 90 degrees overhead the familiar offing of bright &quot;sparking&quot; which might normally be viewed coming from the nose of a missile or Space Shuttle upon re-entry into the high atmosphere.  When the contrail hit 90 degrees, it vanished indicating that any object (unseen) might have entered or exited friction points.At the same time the contrail was being observed, a Boeing 747 was in a landing patern bound for Los Angeles Airport.  This aircraft was flying at a ruduced speed at about 12,000 feet along the same direction nearly crossing the path of the higher contrail.  The object creating the contrail was clearly moving at four to five times the speed as the 747 from our vantage point.((NUFORC:  Sighting occurred at the time of an airlaunch of a Pegasus missile from an aircraft located approximately 70 miles to the southwest of Monterey, CA.))"

Other aircraft, with normal lights on wings and underbelly could be seen in the sky. The white strobe was brilliant; definitely not an aircraft I am familiar with. I used binoculars to get a better look. The craft seemed to be a dull white color, similar in shape to a flying wing (large and rounded in the front and narrowing to a thin edge towards the back). It was north of town, then moved to the southeast, near the area of the Capital City Airport in New Cumberland."

SHE ALSO SAW IT.IN APRIL OF 1974,IT WAS 11:00 P.M., I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS STILL IN SCHOOL AND THAT WAS MY CURFEW WITH MY PARENTS. WE WERE ABOUT 2 BLOCKS FROM MY HOME AND STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN. I LOOKED OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW OF THE CAR (I WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND MY FRIEND WAS DRIVING), I SAW A DISC SHAPED CRAFT WITH A DOME ON TOP. THE CRAFT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET IN THE AIR HOVERING OVER A TREE TOP AND MAYBE 100 FEET FROM US. THE DOME HAD BRIGHT LIGHTS OF RED BLUE YELLOW GREEN AND WHITE FLASHING AROUND AND AROUND THE DOME. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE SILVER METALLIC. I TOLD MY FRIEND TO LOOK AND SHE SAW IT TOO.  I OPENED THE CAR DOOR AND SO DID SHE, SO WE WERE BOTH STANDING OUTSIDE THE CAR WATCHING IT. THERE WERE OTHER CARS ON THE STREET THAT WE HAD TO STOP FOR, BUT IT SEEMED LIKE NO ONE ELSE NOTICED IT BUT US. BUT IT WAS SO BRIGHT AND COLORFUL, LIKE A CARNIVAL RIDE LIT UP AT NIGHT. THE CRAFT MADE NO SOUND AT ALL. IT FINALLY JUST ROSE UP HIGHER AND DRIFTED SIDEWAYS TILL WE COULDN&apos;T SEE IT ANYMORE.THE ODD THING IS THAT WE DIDN&apos;T TALK ABOUT IT AND I TOLD NO ONE AND I DON&apos;T THINK SHE DID EITHER. IN 1976 I SAW THIS FRIEND AGAIN AND I SAID &quot;DID WE SEE WHAT I THOUGHT WE DID?&quot; SHE SAID &quot;YES, WE DID&quot; AND THAT IS ALL WE SAID ABOUT IT. I DIDN&apos;T EVEN HAVE TO MENTION THAT IT WAS A UFO TO HER, SHE AUTOMATICALLY KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THREE MORE SIGHTINGS IN THAT GENERAL AREA, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN YEARS APART AND ALL THE CRAFT ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.

We were approimately 5 miles on interstate I-20 (west bound) out of fort jackson looking toward the city of Columbia. I noticed an object in the air that I could not identify. (I am a licensed Pilot) I attempted to look at it further to identify the object as I do often to practice (scanning technique) for flying. The object was cone shaped with what looked like a flare on the top 1/5 of the object. Silverer in color and seemed to be vibrating (car was stable so this was ruled out)Car = Nissan Maxima. It was also near dust so an aircraft should have had it&apos;s lights on. I do know there was helicopter activity in the fort jackson area due to an over flight of an apache attack helicopter earily at the RC Field (gave us a little scare). But this object did not look like a helicopter. The object did not appear to have any kind of velocity. We passed the object, it was on the drivers side I was in the passenger seat, I leaned over to see the object from the back seats and it was gone. The other witness is a RC Pilot and grew up with airplanes his father was a light bird in the army who flies to this day.

19981205,19981210,"Glendale, AZ",other,60 secs,"Object appeared from behind mesa, ascended at about a 70 degree angle, taking maybe a minute to ascend 8-10,000 ft, passing into cloud.  Object resembled  typical comet with rounded head and long vaporous trail.My wife and I finally had our first UFO experience while visiting relatives in Phoenix last weekend. The event happened about 6:15 PM just at dusk as we turned off I-17 and drove west on Happy Valley Road on the extreme northern edge of Phoenix.   The sky was partially overcast but clear to the west. I first spotted what I thought was a comet just above one of the local mesas.  I don&apos;t know its name, but it forms the northern rim of the little valley just north of Thunderbird Park. The object had a rounded head similar to photos of comets and as it rose from behind the mesa its &quot;tail&quot; also appeared.  The tail flaired out slightly as a comet might and even appeared to have a stream of particles &quot;glittering&quot; inside it. Being just at dusk, it was difficult to judge size and distance, but from where the object disappeared into the cloud (lighting it brightly as it passed through) it&apos;d guess it was between 10-20 miles away.  From our perspective the object was about the size of my thumb extended at arms length. It took about a minute to reach what I&apos;d guess is an altitude of 8-10,000 feet before disappearing into the cloud.  It ascended at about a 70 degree angle.  It appeared a  whitish blue color to me and was brightest at the &quot;head.&quot; I cannot explain what it is we saw.

All three of them witnessed it (this is a friend posting this for the mother).  The object was metallic and silvery, and on one side it was spherical, and the back(?) side was flat and in the shape of a diamond.  The object was rotating on an axis that went through the center of the diamond side.  The rate of rotation was estimated at 1 revolution per 45 to 60 seconds.  Initially the object was moving away from their vehicle.  It went a distance away, and then the direction of its rotation changed, and began to move back towards them.  Soon there- after, the son (age 4) became very upset by its coming to them, and then the object just disappeared...no sound or anything.  On the flat diamond side of the object there was a black (amorphous) pattern around its center.  In the center of this side was a steady blue light. The total viewing time was about 5 minutes. After the object was gone, all three individuals went back inside the house and in separate rooms drew what they thought they saw.  The drawings agreed with each other. The father was disbelieving, and disheartedly, the mother ended up throwing the sketches away.  The 8 yr. old daughter still remembers seeing the object, but doesn&apos;t think much about it. The mother still thinks often about it.  There area at the time used to have a lot of air traffic, but there was none at the time.

At the time we were both high school students and dismissed it as something that was strange and interesting, but probably explainable.

She took me out to watch them...I saw 35 in total over 6 mo. I was taken aboard twice, once conciously. They said &quot;we always welcome you&quot; as I went in. I was taken out of my body once and taken aboard also. Since then, I have had many dreams of them....Now,  am a well paid professional, and this is the first time I have discussed this outside of my family. I am very paranoid that this is a govt site. Im taking a chance, I have had many experiences with them.First event: My girlfriend took me to see them. A large triangular object that flew over our head..It was huge and only a few hundred yards above. It was totally silent...I only saw &quot;running lights&quot; along the edges and triangular shapes along the bottom of the ship. Afterwards, I saw many circular globular objects that were gold in color, that flew perpindicular to the other craft. My girlfriend at the time was connected to them and always knew when they were around. This was 1981 She took me to the desert soon after,  and told me I would be taken aboard consciously...not unconsciously. We camped there. I saw appproximately 17 UFO&apos;s fly over this place. They were landing on the other side of the mountains, We were in a van...they came about midnight. A fog descended around our Van, and I looked out the window and saw aliens walking,,,I totally panicked..I was begging to go asleep.... The next thing I know, I was awake the next mornig, My girlfriends&apos; first words were &quot;did you enjoy yourself last nite&quot; I remember the dream though. They floated me aboard, and as I was going in they said &quot; we always welcome you&quot; I was in a dream state...and in a small room...I was thinking to myself...&quot;.they cant keep me here&quot; so I walked out the door and around the perimiter of the ship which had windows all about. there was no one there... I kept thinking that when I came in it was such a small ship, but once inside, this ship was huge...I came to the bridge, and saw two chairs, and lights all around. Then I went to another room with a large crystaline object with tubes coming out indifferent directionss. someone said this was the propulsion device. Then, I found myself in front of a screen of sorts, with a female alien next to me. On the screen, were objects and symbols that were flying by. I asked her &quot;why are you showing me this, I dont know what it means&quot; She said &quot;you will need it later&quot; I asked her is there going to be nuclear war, and she said &quot;no, we will prevent it&quot; Remember, this is 1981. And I saw myself watching  medical procedures...they were taking people from campsites and impregnating women, and mixing the husbands sperm with theirs...creating pregnancies. I  left her a year later and have not seen a UFO since....that was 1982. whatever they wanted  with me,, they must have accomplished. I have kept this a secret beyond my family fo 15 yeas I have other experiences, but I am so afraid that this is a govt site....I am a well paid medical professional, with a family and a nice house.

19990202,19990301,"Sierra Vista, AZ",unknown,7-10 minutes,"Saw what I thought were 2 military planes flying in formation--both had anber/yellow light. Ones light was solid and others was flashing.I was driving around the parking lot of The community college here when I saw 2 lights in the distance to the NW.  Being in close proximity to a military installation (Ft.Huachuca) that seems to be constantly practicing night aerial maneuvers, I thought this was merely two planes or helicopters flying in formation, one a little bit in front of the other.  However, as I continued to watch, the craft in the rear seemed to be getting closer to the lead craft (the one whose light wasn&apos;t flashing). At this point I parked my car and watched because I had never seen maneuvers like this before. It was as if one was chasing the other. The flashing (not really flashing like a strobe but rather like turning a very bright light off and on slowly and seeing the bulb fade as it cools)craft continued to get closer to the other one until the lights almost seemed as one. Then the flashing light was gone and only the constantly lit craft could be seen. While this was happening the 2 lights were traveling in a counter-clockwise direction from northwest to west and ended up directly over the Fort here. I still thought at this time that I was looking at 2 planes or helicopters and one just blacked out all its lights--they seem to do that a lot around here. When the light that was still visible got directly over the fort it ended its circular direction of travel and headed due-east torwards where I was parked.  It was not traveling very fast and I could still only see the one solid light.  As it got closer I again saw the flashing/pulsing light along with several more. I was amazed at the absence of sound as it approached. From the silence and the odd light clusters I could now see I thought perhaps this was one of the unmanned aerial vehicles they test here or maybe a balloon/blimp of some sort.  It wasn&apos;t. It was not flying very high and (luckily) passed directly over me and the entire campus here(there were several people in the parking lot and milling around the campus but I don&apos;t know if anyone else was paying attention).  As it passed I was amazed at its size and the silence (a faint rumbling/humming almost like a jet very very far away could be heard). I could not make out a shape because it was dark but, I could clearly see an unusually high amount of lights on its underbelly. Their were several small almost incandescent-like amberish lights clustered about what I&apos;ll call the nose section. The mid section only had a few lights grouped in pairs of two close to the nose, and then the rest of the mid- section was dark and very long. Towards the back, or tail-end, was the flashing light I saw earlier with a few other non-flashing lights.  Looking at the arrangement of all these lights reminded me of a stingray-like fish with a large head/body, and a long skinny tail with a point but I can&apos;t really say what shape it was only what the light configuration reminded me of. What I originally thought was one plane chasing or just gaining on the other was really the lights on the front of this thing and the flashing light on its tail. As it turned it created the illusion of one going faster and closing the gap on the other. After seeing this I still wasn&apos;t sure that it just wasn&apos;t a military excursion umtil about 5 minutes after it passed over me. It was at this time that I saw several small planes and/or helicopters flying at very low altitudes over the Fort. They seemed to be spaced out pretty far and just circling small areas as if they were looking for something or waiting for something. One large commercial-like jet could also be seen but it wasn&apos;t circling, it and two helicopters headed in the same direction as the craft did and all three passed directly over me as well as if they were following but not necessarily chasing whatever I had originally seen. These planes and helicopters around and directly over the Fort for at least an hour."

The size of the lights were very small and circled one another in a counter clockwise direction.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky.  I cannot estimate an altitude, however, I feel that they were fairly close to the ground; less than 2000 feet?  There was no sound eminating from the objects.

There was a very subtle cloud scatter of very ligyt nature but even with the clouds visibilty was about 90 percent. The object was deep orange in color and almost had a transparrent look to it. there were no blinking lights or strobes and the object made no sound at all.after we veiiewed it for 15 seconds or so..one of the men ran inside to some of the others whom had remained at the party a little later.Several more people came out and witnessed the object for the 20 seconds or so, but by that time it was quite out of range for the human eye to see. from the direction it came from...it had to have passed over a very busy Meadowlands Horce race track the was still in session at the time.

My granddaughter and I came out and the 3 of us thought it looked like a spinning disc that may have been up to a mile wide above the thin cloud cover. There appeared to be 4 individual lights evenly spaced that were moving in a circular pattern one time around then moved toward the center and appeared to cross over each other then back out to the perimeter and circled around again in a repeating pattern. We watched for about 5 minutes then went back inside.When my daughter checked again around 8:30pm they were gone. Had it been a grand opening it would have been still going on. We were not going to report this, but I recieved an E-mail from caus.org about Dec.7 or 8 in which a very similar sighting occured in S.Carolina on Dec.5.

I looked up at the stars and a bright white light appeared high in the sky. It slowly began moving to the left and at the same time dimmed to a faint yellow. The light became so dim that I could barely make it out. It came to a stop then it suddenly reappeared as a sharp point of white light. The light began rotating around in a circle a yellow light then appeared opposite of the white. As  both lights were spinning clockwise a blue light turned on giving the impression of a multicolored ring. the glowing ring then quickly rose up towards the stars and dissappeared.

Christchurch, New Zealand. I love astronomy and often have a good look at the Stars on a clear night. I&apos;m not a fanatic about religion or UFO&apos;s and never thought I&apos;d see anything like it. My girlfriend witnessed it briefly, after I woke her up quickly. There I was lying in bed at 4:30am awake, but feeling content. As usual spotting a satellite here and there in the sky. Sometimes looking out the window behind my pillow, sometimes not. -------------------------------------------------- Then I saw a flash of bright white light. as bright as one of the brightest stars. Although, it was more like a pulse. There was no sound. It seemed very high up. But it moved really fast ! 3 pulses, each 2 seconds apart, while moving fast in a straight direction. Then a pause of about 3-4 seconds and two more bright white pulses going in a slightly different direction. ====================================================== Not a satellite... Satellites move much slower, and reflect constant orange light. And move in a straight line. Not a plane... No sound at all, moving too fast, and no red or green tail lights, wing lights or head lights etc. It was traveling almost at the speed of a meteorite or object (like a falling star) entering the atmosphere. Traveling from one side of my large window view to the other, in the space of 10 - 11 seconds. But, it was a pulse like a spot light, quickly pulsing in different directions. Not a window reflection... There was nothing electrical plugged in or switched on in our bedroom. I could almost see it when it wasn&apos;t &quot;pulsing&quot;. Black and much larger than any satelite I&apos;ve ever seen. I yelled at ((Name deleted)) to wake up, not taking my eye off the sighting. she woke up in time to see the last pulse. She said &quot;wow a bright flash ! &quot; ==================================================== That&apos;s all. I felt like running outside, but I was stuck staring in the direction of the last visible pulse. Talked with ((Name deleted)) about it for 20 - 30 minutes. Then she fell asleep about 45 minutes before I did. I have no conclusions. Just, that it was the most unusual thing I&apos;ve ever seen in 20 - 23 years of night sky watching. And happened exactly like I say here. Faithfully. ((Name deleted)).     ( age 33 ) P.S.  this is true. I would never ever make up a story like this.

My mother came in late one evening about 11:30 and told me she saw a UFO. She went out to put the horse in the barn, and she saw a bright flash from behind the trees to the east, which made her think of shooting stars. So she looked up to see if she could see any more. She noticed something moving in the big dipper, and initially thought it was a meteor, or satellite, until she realized there were 4 groups of either 2 or 4 starlike lights, in a rhombus formation, with 1 group in front, 2 on each side, and one trailing.              :         :        :          : Each one &apos;waggled&apos; or yawed a bit in mid-flight, and then carried on until she lost sight of them behind the trees to the east, roughly where she saw the flash (the flash was like a flare that descended and dimmed, but she could not see the source for the trees). There was no noise. It was travelling at a pretty good clip, faster than a typical airplne, slower than a meteor. If it was a plane/jet, there would have been sound and colored/ blinking lights. Left no trail. Very clear sky. The whole thing she estimated to be the size of a dime at arm&apos;s lenght, or smaller. Each group of lights was as bright as a moderately dim star, no brighter than one of the big dipper stars. Whole time from flash until the craft disappeared behind trees was probably 15 to 20 secs max. The fir trees to the east are tall, and obscure the sky up to about 45 deg.

I&apos;m now 46.  My father was an NCO in the U.S. Army stationed at the NATO base in Baumholder, and I was his dependent. I&apos;m sure this story is of little use to you save as a curiosity at this point, but I&apos;ve never written it down or reported it to anyone prior to this. This was a very clear, bright day.  There were not haze or clouds. I was between classes after lunch. A friend and I were looking out the class window over the town of Baumholder. I observed a rather bright object coming towards the school.  It was curving in from what must have been the NNW heading towards the SW.  Because of its arc I was able to see at different times its port and starboard sides as well as it&apos;s bottom. There was no way to gauge altitude, so I couldn&apos;t tell you what its size was.  Likewise, couldn&apos;t estimate speed, although it seemed to be in no hurry. We thought at first that it was an airplane.  We began to joke about the Russians (remember where I was, and that it was 1962). As it came closer, nearly overhead the school, I began to realize that it was not a plane and that I had never seen anything like it before.  We gradualy became silent with out joking. It had no wings, empenage, or markings.  It made no vapor trail and had no exhaust.  I saw nothing to suggest an engine, cockpit, or windows. I&apos;d seen a lot of planes and helicopters in my young life (Army brat).  It was not a plane or helicopter.  Neither was it a blimp, balloon, kite, gyrocopter, or droud. It made no noise that I could hear.  It seemed quite graceful.  It looked like nothing so much as a flying florescent light.  It was long, but cut off very cleanly and abruptly on both of its ends.  It&apos;s lines were exceptionaly well-defined.  It seemed seamless. It did not seem metallic.  It did not seem to reflect the sun.  It had a very curious dull, off-white, glow to it, not bright, but very steady and uniform. It looked as if someone had taken a cookie-cutter and stamped out neatly a portion of the sky. I lost sight of it when it eventually flew beyond the vantage of my window. I can attest that I have never seen anything like this since, and I&apos;ve looked.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We observed the objects facing SW from Sedona to the right of a crescent moon that evening. We watched incredulously for approx. 45 min. while the two objects would alternately brighten and dim- one at a time! The lower of the two objects would dim-out and become a small cloud- only to return a few minutes later. We joked that perhaps they were UFO&apos;s who were &quot;playing star&quot;. We took 3 photos and at the exact moment the camera flashed we each saw thousands of little beams or particles (like the old Asteriods screen-savers). The photos DID NOT develop when we returned home to Sacramento. These three exposures were in the middle of a known good roll of film (everything else obviously developed) and we&apos;re attempting to have the film company try again developing. We were quite surprised 2 nights later when we sighted these 2 objects again after leaving Boynton Canyon at about the same time in the evening. Once again we observed the objects for about 45 minutes before leaving the area to return to Sacramento. A few hours later we were too tired to continue and spent the night in Laughlin, NV. While there we seemed to be drawn to what was the UFO Congress event by sheer synchronicity so we spent another day there. We didn&apos;t think our experience unusual as we had both experienced strange energies the past 4 days and had spiritual experiences while at the Sedona vortexes. I heard Peter Davenport and Roger Leir on Art Bell the other night so I faxed the report to Art and he read it on-the-air. Somehow, neither of us seem the least bit surprised about the sighting you had described there. My girlfriend is an admissions counselor at UC Davis and these were her first UFO experiences.

I kept looking and saw two objects, both stationery, emitting blue flashes and occasionally a red flash.  I kept watching and noticed some movement in a back and forth direction, first to the east, and then back to the west.  After further observation,  I saw some very erratic movement by these two objects.  The object on the left moved in a southerly direction and then an easterly direction.  The object on the right moved first  northerly, and then began a circular motion.  During this circular motion it would make occasional very fast darts to the east and then back. These objects were very high in the sky.  The one on the left was as bright as a star, the one on the right somewhat dimmer.  These objects were way to high to be any kind of helicopter or other aircraft that I am familiar with.

Could not make out a shape but object was at least 2 or 3 footballs fields in size.  It moved very slowly from east to west by southwest.  After several minutes, I saw and heard two fighter jets roar past in same direction.  This pattern was repeated on at least 2 or 3 other nights sometime between 11pm and 2am.This happened sometime in November in Moca, Puerto Rico.  I came up from New York on vacation and was staying with an uncle on route 110, close to the town square.  It was cloudy and happened between 11pm and 2am.  I would see bright, colored lights pulsing above the clouds.  The object(s) moved in a west to southwest direction.  It moved very slowly.  I was facing south and saw the lights from the east as they passed overhead to west.  It took about 30 -60 seconds for it to pass and seemed immense because the different colors would pulse sporadically over a wide area as it moved west.  Several minutes afterward, 2 fighter jets would roar by in the same direction.  This went on for 2 or 3 nights.  I found out that this had been documented in November of 1997.  A friend lent me a book about sightings in Puerto Rico.  In there, to my relief, I saw a reference to the sightings.  It helped to reaffirm what I saw.

My sisters and I saw an immense object hovering very close to our back yard.I remember this incident so vividly.  It was a clear, hot summer day around 5 or 6pm in Citrus Heights, when my sisters and I were socializing in our back yard.  I was 17 and my sisters 14 and 19.  Out of nowhere, a VERY LARGE saucer (50 ft or so)descended and was partially over our back yard--at the southeast corner approximately 70 feet away.  This saucer was a medium gray metallic color and had bright white lights that traveled in a circular motion around the perimeter--it was so immense and so close!  We couldn&apos;t see the top of the saucer because we were basically looking up at this object.  At first, we thought that it could be a military aircraft, but it was eerily silent, especially since it was stationary and hovering so close to us for some time.  Living in Sacramento for 16 years with four military airbases close by, I have seen every possible military aircraft that you can imagine--this was not an aircraft!  My sisters and I were hysterical while scrambling to get our polaroid camera; the picture  we attempted  to take came out blurred (strangely, it was still light outside and usually does not get dark until 8 or so during the summers in Sacramento).  We watched as the saucer slowly ascended and headed south.  Why am I reporting this story so late in life?  First, I didn&apos;t think anyone would believe me even though I have two sisters who could corroborate my story.  Second, there was a program on last night about UFOs (2/17/99) that compelled me to investigate after seeing an interview of an Ohio policeman who saw a saucer and described that it was so close but made no noise.  This was the first time I have heard a witness recount their experience which was somewhat similar to mine.  Finally, when a person experiences something of this magnitude, its disturbing; when there are so many people who have experienced this, but no real answers, it is extremely disconcerting.  I am not a &quot;spiritual&quot; person but a discerning individual who comprehends by facts. I felt the need to share my experiene in furthering the research of UFOs.  I want to know what I saw that day. My sisters and I are college educated, well read, successful and very normal people.  I am a vice president of a large high tech firm based out of Philadelphia and have been an executive in the high tech field since graduating from a university at the age of 21."

All we could do after this was look at each other in disbelief...we never heard anything on the news the next day or after that until a month or two later some people had spotted some strange object over Lake Erie.

The object had four lights, one on each point and one in the center. The lights were red and blue as the object came toward me and while receding were white. None of the lights were blinking. The object also made little noise.  It sounded more like wind rustling through trees than anything else. And the object was traveling very, very fast.

I can remember grabbing my bed and trying to hold on because it felt like I was being absorbed into the light. The next thing I remember I was lying on a bed or table. The feel and look of the table was cold and had a gray porcelan look to it. It did not have legs but the base came from the floor. I was covered with a thin silver blanket it did not feel as if were made from cloth. There were several beings standing beside the table I believe 2 on one side and 3 on the other. On the side with 3 one stood by my head and tried to calm me as the others performed the procedures. He seemed to communicate to me telepathically I do not remember him speaking to me directly. I&apos;m not sure of the color but they were medium hieght. With two elongated eyes and a slit for a mouth.  He informed me that I would not remember this, that I would not be harmed and they would try not to hurt me. I remember this light above my head, it started at my head and slowly and extremely painfully moved down my body. It felt like I was being rolled by a rolling pin. When it got to my feet it stopped I was in alot of pain. I remember feeling like I was going tp puke as I was being told that they were going to make one more pass back up to my head. At that point I began pleading to be let go that it was to painful I could not take it. The being at my head then said something to the being that I took to be in charge thay seemed to have a little heated arguement. He turned to me and told me that I had years earlier ask them to come and that I would not resist. Then I remembered yelling into the sky years earlier with a friend that I wanted to meet and would be willing to be examined by a UFO. Now that they were doing it he said I was whining about it. A few more words were exchanged with his boss and the light began its trip back up. The one comforting me said &quot;We are sorry if we harmed you and scared you&quot; I lost it. I remember feeling  the beam place me in my bed and as I looked up the light left my room. I was scared ((word deleted)) I ran to my parents room crying and then I went to some of the windows in the house to look outside. My parents dismissed it. A few days later on the news a UFO was reported to have been seen in a city close to where I live. I have told only a few people but we joke about it. However I am tired of joking about it because it did happen. I remember it and I have tried to avoid reading or watching anything that might embellish my abduction. I trie! d to be calm and remember as much as I could because I knew no one would believe me. I think they put me back before they had finished. I was 21 or 22 years old.

I noticed what appeared to be two planets VERY close together in the sky at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, one directly above the other above the other, about a finger nail&apos;s width at arms length apart.  Top light was bright and white, bottom was less bright and orange.I noticed these objects from a second story bedroom window at approximately 1945 on Feb 23 1999.  I had a clear, unobstructed view, the sky was clear and the moon was about a quarter full, fairly high in the sky, with a large round but fairly dim halo around it, but the objects did not display this halo. I believed them to be a planetary conjunction at first, but was surprised that I had not heard about this occurrence ahead of time, because it was very unusual and dramatic, and hadn&apos;t noticed anything like this the night before.  The objects appeared to be stationary.  The top light was bright enough to cause a starburst pattern in my glasses, which frankly annoyed me because I wanted a better view and could not get one because of the distortion.  The bottom object appeared to be a planet, I assumed Mars due to the orange coloring, and the top object was what I thought might be Venus, except that it was substantially brighter than I recall seeing it.  Neither object flashed or twinkled in any way.  I watched for approximately five minutes and then returned to work on my computer. My wife arrived home at about 2015.  I asked her if she had seen these objects and she stated that she had, just prior to pulling into the driveway.  I went back to the window to get another look, and both objects were gone.  I went outside to see if they had somehow moved out of view, which seemed unlikely if they were planets, but could no longer see them.  While I was watching, I noticed what was probably an airliner with an unusually bright pattern of flashing lights traveling west to east.  Ordinarily, I am not able to see aircraft structure at night, but in this case there seemed to be a wide body visible even when the lights were not flashing.  I do not necessarily believe that this aircraft was related to the other two objects, but it was unusual enough to catch my attention. The following morning (today actually, 24 Feb 99) on my way to work, I turned on the radio expecting to hear about the objects of the previous night and was surprised to hear that at approximately 0630 there were wide spread reports of fireballs and bright lights seen in various locations in northern Michigan.  I did not witness these objects, although I was awake when they occurred.  State Police are saying that these objects were probably meteors.  No mention was made of the objects of the previous night."

As i drove the object did not seem to move in relation to the background terrain. I must have continued for 15 or twenty minutes before I stoped the car to get out and have a look at this thing. I stoped in the middle of nowhere on this desolate road and stared at this bright red light for few minutes when suddenly it began to slowly move about in the sky. First one direction and then another. I was with a friend and we both were in awe of whatever this was when the most extraordinary thing happened. Five jets began closing in on the object from seemingly out of nowhere. when they came to within about a moons distance from the object it just vanished into nothing. I returned to Las Vegas a few hours later and called Nellis Air Force Base to report the incident. They denied any knowledge of any sighting and said they knew nothing about any planes chasing anything. This I knew to be a lie, as no air force base could possibly be unaware of 5 jets chasing something within 50 to 100 miles of them. I have never been able to explain what this could have been and still have no idea. i"

In the far distance, over the nearby ocean and near, I would guess, to Block Island, RI, a very bright light, like a bright star, came up out of the ocean at a 45 degree angle; it continued to zig-zag at 45 degree angles upward for a few seconds, as if gaining speed to get out of the earth&apos;s gravity, then shop straight up and out of sight.  We both looked at each other, amazed. No one we told believed us; I am 50 now, so we were about 15 at the time. We just happened to be looking in the right direction at the right time. I would imagine on a nice summer night, others saw the same thing, particularly people on Block Island, a tourist resort.

The small one seemed to be going in and out of the valleys up and down the side of the mountain and darting around the large triangular shaped craft. The large craft turned and started moving north over the mountains and we lost sight of both of them. No lights were ever seen on the large one. It was kind of a purplish black glow. No sound from either of them. The smaller one went into a cloud and it looked like small lightning the way cloud lightning looks and reminded me of those things globes you run your hand around and the electricity follows your fingers around the globe. The lightning made no noise. We heard a faint rumbling sound a little time later. And heard aircraft about 30 minutes afterwards. Gary took pictures but don&apos;t know if they will come out said he got a shot of both of them around the radio towers together and a closer one of the smaller one as it went in the clouds and of the lightning."

I believe i was facing south east or east looking at the stars just below the moon when an object went from my right to the left, at level flight, no noise whatsoever, no lights of any kind traveling  above the speed of sound at a very low altitude ( a few hundred feet) above the trees in a residential area. I believe the ONLY reason I saw it, was because the moon was almost full and the object passed brtween me and the moon, the angle of the moon caused a reflection to shine off of the skin of the object. Same reflection as polished metal. The object left no trail to be seen (such as a shooting star) I&apos;ve seen shooting stars and all types of aircraft and this WAS NOT either one of them."

It was flying very low and I could see obvious framework on the front end in a protruding triangular-like shape with an &quot;elbow&quot; on the side where I was viewing.  Similiar to placing a cigar into a large triangle and the bottom of the triangle being horizontal so it would be a stand if it were to land.  There were 3 large port- hole windows (that I could see) which illuminated bright white light.  There was no noise coming from it or any vapor trail.  It moved at a steady pace and kept going in a Northerly direction til out of site.  It really drew my attention not only because it was low but you never see any aircraft flying in that direction over my house because of the circling pattern of all of the aircraft waiting to land at Lambert Field.  Have also seen a bright green light falling to earth but it burned out right above my privacy fence so maybe SOME of the reports of the bright green glowing fireballs are just meteor showers even tho I must say I have never seen bright aqua-green meteors before."

I still don&apos;t know what it was, but it scared me and I stopped my truck to look at it.  I don&apos;t know why I did this because I was so scared that I couldn&apos;t move.  It was above the field next to my truck.  It was a sphere that was glowing a blueish-pink and it was moving real slow.  I could hear this intense humming that I assume was coming from the object.  Then a beam came out of the bottom of it and it almost looked like it was searching for something.  The beam was just kind of combing the ground to the left and right below the object.  I decided to get out of my truck and look at it closer, but when I opened the door the beam went out and it stopped so I got back into my truck.  All of a sudden it just shot straight up into the sky and just kind of disappeared from the inside out.  When it disappeared my radio came on full blast and my windshield wipers turned on on high.  I was so scared that I drove the rest of the way home as fast as I possibly could and ended up sitting in my truck in the driveway for about 2 hours because I was scared to get out of my truck and go into the house.

Unfortunately, I was driving and it only caught my attention just before it went out of sight. It was heading downward, right to left at a 45 degree angle. The only characteristics that were different from a falling star were the color (bright green) and the time of day (sun up). Just last year, many citizens from St.George reported strange lights and contrails in the same location and direction of what I sighted today.  Those turned out to be missiles that were being tested over a test range which is near that same location. I&apos;m trying to seek a logical explanation for what I saw.

Thought it was airplane at first...until it started melting.Had just gotten home and was outside smoking a cigarette when I saw a light going across the sky.  I thought it was a plane.  It stopped all of a sudden and just stayed there.  All of a sudden it turned bright red and appeared to be on fire.  It started dripping like plastic would if heated.  I ran in and called 911 because I still thought it was an airplane.  The operator thought I was a crank call.  She put me on hold for about 2 minutes and got back online and asked me to tell her exactly what I was seeing.  I explained it to her and she told me that she had about 50 other calls coming in on the same thing.  My husband at the time was out video-taping it.  She asked me if she could have the fire department come over to look at the tape.  The fire chief arrived and watched the tape and shook his head and asked what we thought of ufo&apos;s.

Over the trees I saw a large craft hovering noiselessly. It had a gray &apos;hull&apos; with a large white glowing dome on the top. There appeared to be portholes around it. The glow was so bright it illuminated the trees underneath it. I should have stopped because we were passing by and my sister was in the car reading and did not look up until I  started yelling &apos;Did you see it?!? Did you see it?!?&apos; By that time, the saucer was obscured by the trees, but she did see the very bright light. I turned around as soon as I could to come back for a second look but it was gone. I know other people must have seen this. There was quite a bit of traffic on Route 2 at the time. Since then I have occaisionally snooped around on the net to see if anyone else reported a similar occurance or to see if Hanscon AFB is up to anything strange since Concord is quite close to it. I have yet to see anything but I know I am not crazy, and I KNOW what I saw was bizarre. I would like to provide photos of the area where I saw it and also to draw a picture of the saucer (I am an art school drop out)."
19990315,19990315,"Shelby Township, MI",light,3 hours (approx.),"A white light with a red light on the left and a green light on the right darting in the skyOk, this is what happened. First I have to say that I NEVER believed in any such thing as a UFO. Never - until last night. It was about 1:30 am and my husband and I were getting ready for bed. My husband decided to let the dog out to do its business before we went to bed. Thats when he saw a bright white light (similar to a star) in the sky. He began yelling for me to immediately come to his side. When I came he asked me to look up in the sky and tell him what I saw. I was in complete shock. There was a light flashing at approx. 1 second intervals with a red light on the left and a green light on the right. The red and green lights were also flashing but not in unison with the white light. My first thought was that it was a dying star, but why were there red and green lights? Then the object began to move in quick speeds, first moving vertically up and then vertically down. The speed of the light was simply amazing. It was not something humanly achievable. Then the light began moving at an angle (approx. 70 degrees NE) with quick speed and again resuming back to its original location. Anytime the light would resume back to its original location, the light would slightly oscilate until stability was reached.  At times the light was at a stand still and did not move. It appeared that the light was not in our atmosphere, but slightly above, hovering over it. Then the light began to move in arch like motion across the sky with great speed and again returning with great speed back to the original location. This was no airplane, helicopter, or any man-made craft. The speed of this light was very quick and swift. There are no airports near me, nor any lakes (this was not a reflection of any kind). I must also add that NO sounds were emitting from the light.  It was silent. The light maintained this pattern for approximately 3 hours. I would also like to add that I was not drunk, under the influence of anything, nor am I an insane person. I know what I saw - believe what you want."

19960223,19990227,"Poway, CA",light,11 minutes,"Saw 2 points of light moving slowly across sky then after 11 minutes, 1 of them streaked off towards the east and was gone in 10-12 seconds.I was taking a lunchtime walk around an industrial area in Poway, CA on 02/23/96. At approximately 12:40 pm, I was heading in a NNW direction on Stowe Road, 1/4 mile north of Scripps-Poway Pkwy.  I looked up into the sky and noticed a white point of light about 60 degrees above the northern horizon.  It was slowly moving toward the south.  The weather conditions at the time were as follows:  mostly clear skies, scattered cirrus clouds, temperature about 65 degrees, winds from the SSW (both at the surface and aloft), with wind speed about 10 mph at ground level.  By 12:43 pm, the object became stationary at a position about 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  It appeared to hover in that position until 12:45 pm, when another similar object &quot;blinked on&quot; just to the east of the first object.  At that moment, both objects began to move fairly slowly towards the west, with the first object pulling slightly away from the second.  Both objects appeared to pass under the cirrus clouds in the area.  At 12:49 pm, the first object changed direction towards the SW.  The second object continued to move toward the west.  The distance between the two objects continued to increase to the point where I could no longer keep both of them in a single field of view.  At 12:51 pm, the first object was approximately 50 degrees above the western horizon when it suddenly streaked across the sky from west to east and disappeared over the eastern horizon.  The elapsed time of this high-speed exit from the area was 10-12 seconds.  I immediately looked back to where the other object had been, but it was gone.  I did not see it leave. I have made the following conservative altitude and velocity estimates: 1.  Scattered cirrus clouds at approximately 25000 feet 2.  Both objects were below the cirrus clouds. 3.  Distance travelled by first object during high-speed exit from the area assuming altitude of 15000 feet = 25-75 miles 4.  Estimated velocity of first object during high-speed exit = 6000-18000 mph It is clear to me that these objects were not conventional airplanes, balloons, meteors, stars, etc.  They moved against the wind, hovered and displayed high-speed characteristics beyond anything that I&apos;ve ever seen or heard.  At no time did I hear any sound from either of the objects.  There was no sonic boom during the high-speed maneuver.  Both objects appeared as white points of light with no other details observed.  They were both clearly under intelligent control.  The sighting took place in an area where there were frequent flybys of Navy F-14 and F-18 fighters returning to Miramar from training exercises over the Pacific.  However, no military or civilian aircraft were seen in the immediate area over the entire duration of the sighting. I believe my estimates of altitude and velocity are conservative, my gut feeling is that these objects may have been at an altitude closer to 25000 feet and the velocity during the high-speed maneuver may have been more like 20000-25000 mph.

It left a contrial and moved across the sky at about the same speed as a passenger planeAt 6:15 on Wednesday, 3/24/99, I was taking out the garbage. The sun was still shining. I looked up and noticed, what I thought was a very strange looking aircraft. I have an Air Force Intelligence background and I have never seen a plane like this. I ran inside and got binoculars to get a better look. The UFO, jet or whatever it was, was flying at about the same speed as a passenger jet, but was much larger than a regular jet. The object was a very highly polished silver. The only way I can describe it is like a cylider with what appeared to be two smaller cylinders attached to it slightly below. It looked like the fuselage of a jet, without wings and the jet engines (much larger than normal)attached to the bottom with a small piece of connecting material. It appeared to have a small canopy at the front of the craft. I observed it for at least 5 minutes until is flew out of view. There was no sound at all. I think it may have been an experimental aircraft."

There was a time lapse involved between first sighting and take off.I was starting first grade, and remember this story well. Not knowing what i had seen, I described it to my classmates in full detail the next day, thereby I believe committing the encounter permanently to memory. I have not related this story to anyone else because, just telling my brothers about it, received so much skepticism that i allowed myself to just &apos;forget&apos; that it ever happened. I am now 28 years old, have a BS in Computer Engineering, and am a partner in a Computer Engineering Consulting firm. I feel that any public knowledge of what i am about to relate could be damaging to my credibility, and wish to keep this account anonymous as far as the public is concerned. But, i also feel i must finally relate this account to an authoritative source whom may be able to quell my concerns. In retrospect, I finally identified the time lapse that took place. This concerns me more than anything, taking into account my current state of mind. I feel that this encounter, as long ago as it was, may have changed my life significantly without even recognizing it, until now. It was late summer, 1975. My parents used to let one of my three brothers and i stay up an hour later than the rest once a week. We were all within a few years in age. That night, I was not the one, and was sent to bed at seven-thirty. It was just before twilight. The sun sets later this time of year (of course). The way the bed faced, i could see outside through two large(4&apos;x5&apos;) triple pane windows. I was almost asleep when something drew my attention outside. I opened my eyes to see what appeared to be a very large yellow-orange disk hovering above the trees. It was hard to say how far away it was. I stared at it. It made no noise, but again I was inside the house. The disk had two, relatively speaking, small bumps or turrets on the top and bottom. The sunset was beginning to turn the sky a pale red, pink color. The next thing i remember, it was pitch black outside. The disk degraded to a small round white light. At the time, i described it to my classmates as a &apos;headlight&apos; (as in a car headlight). The headlight zipped away at tremendous speed, and was out of sight within seconds. What i have written here constitutes the majority of the actual experience. If this information is helpful and/or in line with current theory and phenomena, and you feel that additional information would help, i will leave my contact information. In addition to what i have written here, I feel that i have much more to add, but do not wish to waste your time with something that can only be invalid from an informed perspective. I have not disclosed this information to any other source. If i do not receive a reply i will assume that your judgement of the facts is such that this account could only be false, or merely &apos;all in my mind&apos; as my brothers would say.

At the southwest corner of the valley, in the Santa Cruz range, sits Mt. Umnum.  Mt. Umnum was the sight of a very large and powerful US Air Force radar station. One clear cold autumn morning, I was sitting in my car, at the foot of Mt. Umnum, waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive, so we could begin our job of landscaping a new housing tract.  As the sun slowly began to ascend over the Hamilton range to the east, turning the sky above the still shadowy valley a bright blue, I noticed what appeared to be a morning star, or lingering planet above the fog enshrouded peak of Mt. Umnum.  As my gaze lingered upon the brightly shining object, I noticed that it appeared to be oscillating back and forth ever so slightly.   This immediately grabbed my attention, and as I now gazed intently at the object; it began to grow brighter, and appeared to get larger as it continued to oscillate ever so slightly. this process continued for about 2-3 minutes until the brightly shining object descended to the same altitude as the fog enshrouded radar station, and hovered there, still visible, about a half mile away from the station.  It hovered in this position for about 5 to 10 seconds, at which point it changed direction and headed directly for the radar station.  As it entered the fog bank, it literally burned a hole in the mist.  This hole lasted for several seconds before finally converging in on itself. This sighting leads me to believe that this particular fireball may have been of U.S. military origin, as the radar station was supposed to have a landing strip in it&apos;s proximity. The radar station has since been decommissioned."

The light was really a jet ..since the air field ONLY supports CARGO airplanes...then this would mean that what i saw was more then likely a &quot;Covert&quot; Aircraft that was not supposed to be here.2). Training Manuevers with the idiot pilot not following safety regs. And had his lights off... but then this would bring me to the first anwser and since this craft is not currently under support in this trainign enviromment the question remains what exactly were they (the military) doing endangerering the public..as every one knows that it&apos;s agaisnt FAA Regs. to fly ANY type of AIRCRAFT without running lights!! 3). What i saw was really something unknown ..(wouldnt hold my breath any time soon!!) as a small note ... i called the operations NCOIC and he informed me that he was not aware of anything being out of the ordinary....but concidering what i was describing no running lights, my familiarity with diffrent aircrafts etc, he informed me that he would notify the tower and see what was hoing on&hellip;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

19980801,19990108,"Lincoln, NE",light,3 minutes,"We saw streaks like tracers shoot out from a light in the sky.I was listening to a taped replay of Peter Davenport&apos;s appearance on the Art Bell Show on December 11th. In that show, Peter described (and played a tape of) several sightings of lights in the sky that were seen to apparently shoot out tracer-like light pulses. On about August 1 of last year, (I didn&apos;t record the date.) my wife and I were sitting on our front porch enjoying the evening, chatting and looking at the stars. I spotted a white light moving very high in the sky and remarked to my wife that I wondered if that was a very high aircraft or perhaps a satelite. There was no sound and, for that matter, I didn&apos;t expect any as it appeared quite distant even though it was moving across the sky fairly rapidly. We watched it for 2 to 3 minute during which time it progressed steadily moving approximately eastward. The direction and speed seemed to remain constant. The color and intensity of the light remained stead as well. Then, while we were watching, there appeared to be 3 or four streaks of light, very much tracer-like, extend out ahead of the light. The streaks were fainter than the light of object and extended directly in the direction of travel a distance corresponding to a distance that the object would have traversed in several seconds travel time. This occured twice. Both my wife and I were looking at the object and both of us saw the streaks. The two bursts of streaks occurred approximately 2-3 seconds apart. Shortly after the second burst, the object vanished as though the light were extinguished. The area of the sky that we were watching at that time had no obstructions or other fixed elements that could have come between the object and our line of sight. We watched the area closely for another minute or two, trying to see the object again or anything else, but nothing appeared. We saw nothing more that was out of the ordinary that evening.

When I looked up at approx 21:05, the object had vanished.When driving home from a cclass in the town of Eagar, AZ, I looked up to see a very bright light, almost exactly the same brightness as Jupiter, which was somewhat nearby. I slowed down to look at the object, and I saw that it was flashing and not moving perceptibly. However, it may have been moving toward me and I would not have known. I repeated this twice, each time noting that the light never moved. In the space of approx. fifteen minutes, I glanced from the object to the road and back every fifteen seconds on average. At approx 21:05, I looked up and observed the object again. I glanced down at the road and approx. five seconds later, I looked up and the light was gone. I slowed the car again and looked out of the windows in every direction, but could not find it. The light was approx 30 degrees elevation, and, perceptibly, two inches, when holding my finger at arm&apos;s length, above a ridge approx. eight miles ahead of me. Thhe direction of the sighting was almost exactly east."

After all this time I have tried to forget.  As of two years ago (including tonight) I see at least two/three bobbing bright lights that I know are related to what I saw as a child. My husband and I last saw them July 1998 until tonight.  They gradually disappear out of view as if they just vanish in an instant.About 7 p.m. I was walking from the frontroom into the kitchen area.  I noticed through the window (facing the West) a very bright light that I have continuously seen all through my life.  I didn&apos;t want to scare my children so I had my husband look into the night sky. There were two of them off into the West sky, one close to the other. They were turning around and around and the lights of the two were a bright white and then green sparkle shimmer.  They were constantly bobbing around which I assume is because of communication. We watched for a while and after about an hour they started to phase out of sight and eventually were gone. They always appear in that area and have since I&apos;ve been a child. My one child claimed to me that in the middle of the night he was awoken by bright lights by his window. I don&apos;t want him to be scared like what I have been all these years, so I told him it was just probably car lights coming off the road. This is something I&apos;ve held onto for many years now and I know it&apos;s not aircraft...it&apos;s UFO&apos;s."

To the north of our location is a small, city, airport.  I was watching small, priviate, planes taking off from the airport.  As I was watching the planes taking off I noticed four small, slivery aircrafts flying towards the West.  I kept watching them as they were flying in an unuasual manner.  I told my mother who could not see them, at first.  I waited until another plane was taking off. Just as the plane was to the left of where the crafts were I told her to look to the right of them.  She then saw them for herself.  I observed them for several minutes as they flew overhead at a very high altitude.  I hope these next dote show up as I would like them to .

19960703,19990218,"University Place, WA",fireball,30 seconds,"It was the fourth of july, actually the evening before.  I was driving down 67th avenue, going towards lakewood, when I saw this big fireball type object in the sky.  There were many cars on the road and they all slowed to about 5 mph gazing at the sky.  The object resembled a type of firework, yet much much much larger, about as big, lengthwise as two 747&apos;s, and as wide as two of the bodies.  the fireball was by and large all red and went down towards the ground very slowly.  At this point I thought it was a crashing plane or some new spectacular firework.  My view changed when the fireball suddenly began to rise again almost like a dragon during the celebration of the chinese new year.  A week later a person that I worked with explained that he had seen the same thing while working that evening and nobody believed him.  This is an extremely likel;y scenario because i had seen the object over fircrest golf club, where we both were employed at the time.  He said nobody else saw it because they were emptying the trash during the sighting, and during the summer months, the trash is done right around 10pm.  The sighting left me speechless, although I do doubt that it was an alien craft because it seemed to be ablaze, and totally unfit for life.((NUFORC:  A sighting somewhat reminiscent of this report was reported to us regarding an incident on 04JL98.  In the latter case, the report was accompanied by a video of the phenomenon.  In the latter case, the peculiar &quot;stream of fire&quot; turned out to be a helicopter with a type of sparkler, or spark generator, attached to it, and it was doing abrupt, aerobatic-style maneuvers.  It leaves the viewer with an impression of a cascade of sparks.  This explanation is only conjecture.))"

CLouds moving from SW to NE, but object and relatively  smaller round and white orbs zipping around the main disk. Main disk shimmered from the side and when it turned on its side you could see an inscribed dark inner circle. I had rand into the house and got a pair of 9X25 (5.6degrees) Nikon binoculars. The objects were not affected by the winds above which moved the sporatic clouds at pretty fast speeds. After some time, seeing how it appeared to be intent on staying around awhile I went to find a camera, but only my Nikon 35mm had film and this has no telephoto lens. However, upon blowing up the objects in Photoshop you can see the Saturn shape and its companion which resembles the &quot;X&quot; shape of those craft that Luke Skywalker flew in the final battle in the movie Star Wars. THese &quot;Xs&quot; seemed to have emitted from the craft, but I could be wrong. THey were hard to see and seemed to leave some kind of visual blur (not a contrail, but could be mistaken for one). I am a college educated professional of 38 years of age, who majored in geological engineering and my wife is a geologist too. I am an amateur astonomer with 10&quot; Newtonian and 8&quot; C-8 with computer and am familiar with the local sky. Often we see strange craft coming out of Edwards AFB nearby. Incidentally, the craft would have been just south of the Edwards AFB southern boundary. I can send a map to anyone interested. I am not mistaking this sighting for conventional or any kind of typical experimental aircraft. I am an aviation buff and have done consulting work for leading pioneering contractors in military aerospace. One more thing. I could see jetliners passing nearby and clearly below these objects. So I estimate that if the cumulus clouds peaked at 55,000 feet that the object was somewhere above this, maybe at 75,000 feet. Therefore, the main object must have been much larger than large airliner and the smaller orbs about the size of the airliner. Keep in mind I viewed with binoculars. I have 30 hours in flight training and my wife is a private pilot. I am sending you the photos by e-mail attachment. That e-mail will read &quot;VictorilleUFOs&quot; as will the attachments."

The object was white, no lights, and appeared kite like,  the absolute shape was not identifiable because it didn&apos;t appear symetrical. At the distance I was at, the object would have appeared about a half an inch in an outstretched hand. It went round and round the cone in a sort of strange floating motion. The movement had characteristics like paper falling with that rocking back and forth motion or side to side motion, except this object wasn&apos;t falling.

Just after sunset, there was a lot of air traffic as usual (I do this very often) and two high flying jets flying straight with long tails from southeast to northwest. These continued on their path for the full event. Just above the horizon at about 3 degrees, I noticed what I thought was another airplane with an orange reflective tail moving from northwest to the southeast. Looking at the map and from my previous experience, this craft was flying over Flower Mound and disappeared just north of DFW Airport. This one was very different from the other two. I got out my binoculars and followed it across the sky for about 15 minutes. It began zigzaging to the east and then back on course. During the zigzag, the tail got much larger and brighter. Then suddenly, during the last five minutes I saw it, a bright white light &quot;jumped&quot; in front of the tail (at least a few hundred feet or more) with the tail becoming much shorter. The light jumped in front of a rapidly dissipating tail at least 3-4 times and then it was just a light which suddenly disappeared.

I thought nothing of it until it started drifting slowly up then down then around but generally in the same spot. It began quickly flashing orange lights then dimmed into the darkness but quickly lit up again w/a bright white light. It continued w/this flashing pattern for the duration of the event. It never got any closer or further away until about 6 a.m. then it slowly lowered below the treeline out of sight. I woke my husband after watching it for the 1st min. or so.

Brillient Bright Green in color with sparkling long tail.I just heard you on the &quot;radio show&quot;, and would like to offer you &quot;My Experience&quot; with a most elegant sighting. I actually live in Central Washington State, but I was in California at the time visiting my Mother.  The date was specifically October 5th, 1998 and it was in the evening, about 8:00 PM California time, and it was dark. I was in the parking lot at my girlfriend saying good night when her little boy of 10 years old said &quot;Look at that!&quot; I turned and viewed one of the most elegant things I&apos;ve ever seen! With my wide span view between the trees I saw very long streak in the sky moving on a horizenal plane. It was moving similar to a shooting star, with an extremely long tail, and it was the most brilliant &quot;Green&quot; color I&apos;ve ever seen. The front was much larger and brighter than the trailing edge, and I noticed that it was moving slower that a shooting star, but still a a great speed. Surprisingly, it appeared very low in the sky. (About 20 to 30 degrees above the horizen.) It had a &quot;flat&quot; trajectory (no movement up or down) and the sight lasted at least more than 10 seconds in clear view. Along the trailing end, which I repeat was very long, there were tiny (but fine) speckles of white &quot;glitter&quot; like from the a ferry&apos;s wand. The actual tail of this thing appeared to be over 20 miles long. It was identical to the one the lady described when you played her voice recording on the radio show. I had a 90 degree clear view horizonally of this thing and it was simply remarkable. As my back was facing the ocean, I viewed this as it was moving from my left to my right side. This means I was facing a easterly direction. (with a little North added) I was actually in &quot;Dana Point&quot; California one block from the ocean, facing towards the approximate direction of San Antinio Peak which is located about 20 miles NE of Ontairo. (I&apos;ve done a lot of flying in this area.)  So this thing was coming from... a Northly direction, and going to a Southerly direction. Almost the opposite direction of the Lady&apos;s sighting. Now this lady I dicribed above just had her sighting tonight 12/18/98, while my &quot;identical&quot; sighting in California was on 10/5/98 . Over 2,000 miles of seperation!

My family and I had just stepped out of our car after parking at the curb in a residential area that we intended to canvas for the purpose of trick-or-treating. It was fully dark, and a completely clear evening with no clouds. As my wife was getting our two boys&apos; costumes in order, I looked up into the night sky. Immediately, I observed what appeared to be a moving area of the night sky directly above me, through which the stars were totally obscured. I could not estimate the shape or size of whatever caused this phenomenon. There was no sound. There were no lights that seemed to be associated with the cause of the hidden stars. The only suggestion of the object&apos;s shape and altitude was that the bottom of the object appeared to be convex because I could see groundlight from the homes around us reflected from its surface. There were no lights in the neighborhood brighter than a streetlight or a porchlight. Therefore, I surmised that a dark object must be fairly low in altitude to reflect dim lights in such a manner. It moved steadily, and if at low-altitude, slowly from the NE to the SW (generally in a line from El Jebel, CO towards Mt. Sopris, a 12,900 foot mountain that serves as a handy landmark for residents of the Valley). The sighting lasted for approximately 5 seconds. Although I pointed and yelled, &quot;Look!&quot; no other member of my family saw the object. Observer background: 37-year-old male. B.A. in Anthropology. At the time of the sighting I was a part-time real estate salesperson. My vision is good with eyeglass correction, and my hearing is normal. I was familiar with the neighborhood in which the sighting ocurred as I had lived there for a period of 6 months two years earlier. I revisited the exact spot in the daylight to determine if there were any overhead powerlines that might account for my impressions, but there were none. I had never seen anything like this before that time, and I have not seen anything like it since. I did not report the sighting because I regarded myself as a &quot;bad witness.&quot; I have read about the subject extensively, and I had heard a re-broadcast of Orson Well&apos;s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; earlier the same day. However, I must report that if I had had to describe what a UFO looked like earlier that same day, it would NOT have been as a silent, black object."

Was &quot;volunteered&quot; to join a Captain as investigator of UFOs.  Capt. handled off-base sightings (they were more fun) and I was stuck with military cases. This occurred at MacDill AFB, Tampa. About 9:30 p.m. one night in Aug. 1952 I received a call from the Base Operations officer (a Lt. Col.)  He was a little miffed to be re- porting to an enlisted man but such are the curiosities of the military. The Captain was out of town. The Lt. Col reported that a UFO was cruising over the base at 40,000 feet, 400 knots.  This was serious; we had A-bombs at MacDill. I de- termined there was no civil traffic within 300 miles. The object was being radar tracked by MacDill, the Navy, and Tampa civil. I de- termined there was a B-29 (ours) on a downwind leg to land. He had 5 hours fuel left. I ordered the pilot to up his gear and take a look-see. At midnight the Pilot reported that he had tried to close with the object. He was at 20,000 feet; the object at 40,000. Of course, the B-29 was woefully slow but as he turned toward the UFO his central fire control system radar-locked on the target, armed itself, and prepared to fire.  At that moment the UFO changed course and left the area at an estimated 4,000 knots. Next morning the pilot reported to my office.  He was a full Colonel, a command pilot with 27,000 hours in the air. One of the top men in SAC.  He gave me his preliminary report and said he would send his waist scanner, a M/Sgt., down to supply details. The whole crew saw it....a bright white oval light. A hard radar target. Since I had no orders to the contrary, I printed the story in the base newspaper and offered it to the Tampa newspaper. Believe it or not they turned it down, refusing to print it because the M/Sgt was black!  A.P.  found out and was furious. Sent a man out to get the datails. Another oddity.  Just before the Colonel came to my office I received a TWX from the Pentagon. From a general. It said: &quot;Any of our people who see flying saucers have holes in their heads.&quot;  That Colonel yelled &quot;b((deleted))t&quot; in the loudests and most authoritative tone I&apos;ve ever heard. Eventually the Captain wrote a report of the more than 1,800 sightings we handled. A large number (more than 280) were absolute un- knowns. That report stated that &quot;In our opinion we have no option but to conclude that we are under surveillance by intelligent life of extraterresrial origin,&quot;  I also signed that report. I remember the Captain said: This report will never see the light of day.&quot;  He was right. For the record I served three years in USAF, later worked as a reporter/city editor, and spent 7 years with NBC-TV. I was a reporter/producer of news documentaries and won six national awards including three Emmys.  I&apos;m not a kook. Yet. -((Name deleted))((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"

In July of 1996 my wife accompanied me to help check the doors, shortening my required walk.  Coming upon the last building my wife and I again met up at which time we noticed an unusual type of light reflecting on the pavement 50-100 yards in every direction.  The light closely resembled the light emitted from late model Lincoln headlights  (a new type of halogen bulb) and had sort of a purple tint.  In total amazement we both looked up to observe some sort of craft hovering in total silence  around 300 feet over our heads.  The craft had very bright white lights placed in a triangle and no other lighting.  The brightness did not seem to correspond to the level of light hitting the ground as if it were diffused on its way down.  The craft remained motionless until we could get to our apartment (approx. 1 block) in an attempt to get my binoculars.  We observed the craft the entire way to the apartment and actually began to feel uneasy about the ships presence. Unfortunately the ship was gone when we came out of the house with the binoculars and we were never able to observe the ship moving.

During its flight, it made numerous odd flight changes, including bouncing up and down like a ball. It also changed shapes, including separating into 3 individual lights. At one point it seemed to change into a mist like form, but was still illuminated and visible.While on a fishing trip at Heron lake in Northern New Mexico, I witnessed a strange light rise very quickly above what appeared to be the Taos area, in the East from where we were. The light was constantly changing colors from green to red to white to blue. I thought it was a military helicopter because they are always up in that part of the wood, but then it shot straight towards us, real fast like. We&apos;re talking 100 miles of ground between Taos and Heron, and that thing zipped it in thousands of a second. It stopped like almost over the lake, but must have been up around 8,000 feet or so. It continued to hover in place and change color for approx. 10 minutes or so. At this point I woke my daughter to see the UFO, cause it was almost 3am by this time and my fishing party was all bedded down for the night. We sat and watched and even tried to wake the others, but they dismissed me as being drunk or tired or something, which I was not. I continued to fish and to watch this THING, and we began to talk about it, when it started to change. It slowly seemed to vaporize. It turned into a cloud, but was still illuminated and was quite visible. It stayed in this form for about 5 minutes or so and then became one solid light again. At this point my daughter got scared and went back inside the camper, she&apos;s only 8yrs old, and this was something that really struck her as odd. I reeled in my fishing line and just sat there letting the fire die and watching alone when the thing started bouncing up and down at a very fast rate. It resembled a rubber ball, just bouncing up and down for at least 4 or 5 minutes and then stopped. Then it started to go from side to side, back and forth, at what seemed the same distance of travel each time for about the same duration of time as before. Now I was becoming scared, and was putting my gear away, when it stopped and then split into three separate lights, and formed a triangle and remained motionless for what seemed 15 minutes. I smothered the fire and sat in the door way of the camper and watched as it re-shaped into one solid light again. Now it was close to 3:30 am or so and when I got up to go inside, it shot off towards the West towards Dulce New Mexico, about another 40 miles or so. That was the last I saw of it, when it positioned over Taos before I went to bed.

It did not make any noise.It started going back up the hill hovered 600 to 900 feet above the hill then shot allmost              straight up in the sky.In less than a seconed it was the size of a small     looking star. We watched it move around in the sky for another 20 seconds or so then it came back down just as fast as it left. When my friend and I started walking toward it this time it came at us. We both froze, then it moved around again going up and down and moving at strang angles.Something an airplane could not do. The speed was very very fast. After watching it for another 45 seconds or more it shot back up in the sky. When this craft would shoot up in the sky and turn into a little spec,it would take a blink of an eye. We watched it standing still no bigger than a star then it starting moving across the sky heading south. It picked up speed then within 1 second it shot across the sky. I would say as far up as it was and my view point it traveled 75/100 miles in hundreths of a second. It was a clear night the moon was not out and there was a small airport near by. I rember during the day we would watch airplane turn and make there aproach to land .This was not some light in the sky are some kind of airplane."

I was alerted by my passenger mrs.bobbie sue cahhal. that there were some strange lights outside the left side of our vehicle. At that point I saw three crafts of some kind approaching. I was looking out my driver side window,which would be looking north west. I saw 3 craft with a steady red light on the left and a steady white  light on the right . I thought this was strange due to the fact that faa regulations require a strobe on all aircraft. I estimate the craft were around 300 ft and moving around 40-50 mph.as the craft went over head I pulled to the side of the road. It was a large moon and as myself and the passenger looked up we observed the triangle shaped craft fly to the north east. these craft made no sound .at that time I observed a small prop plane following these craft at a safe distance.I ((Name deleted)) saw the above craft and swear that the above statement is true and correct.2-12-99"

It was moving quite slowly, white and red lights flashing.  i then witnessed it to completely change directions, suddenly, headed back towards where it came.  two more craft then appeared, towards the north, with red lights, not flashing. they moved suspiciously together, then apart, moving to and from, not in straight lines, neither vertically or horizontally.  the first, seemingly larger craft then &quot;joined&quot; the two others, and they flew off slowly over the mountain.  for about an hour afterwards, i noticed a remarkable number of planes flying over the area, about 1 every 60 seconds.  the sighting of the craft lasted about 60 seconds before they flew out of sight.  just an ordinary evening stroll turned quite curious.  this was the first sighting of this type i have ever had."

It was hovering approximately 40 feet above the road in the northeast region of Knapp Road in SherburneWit. We watched it continue in that direction until it disappeared.  My grandparents told us that they heard a sound like someone was &quot;blowing into a bottle&quot; at the time we saw the object.  We did not hear anything because we were inside the car.  We heard strange &quot;howling&quot;/ &quot;air-movement&quot; sounds for the next few hours but it was not windy out.  Our family has witnessed two other sightings in the past two years, in the month of October.  Both times there were three yellow, oval/diamond shaped objects in the eastern sky around 9:30 pm and lasted for about three hours.  Each object moved separately and sporatically, but kept the same distance between themselves. They moved at very high speeds. We did not see them leave."

A mile further observed a 2nd separate, independent lite. The 2nd lite split and became two lites moving together, with no sound I could hear. The 1st lite remained constant. Pulled over and stopped again, and the 2nd lites turned and became three lites in a row with the  middle one flashing. It turned more and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape. Then the object moved behind the hill I was parked by. I continued to drive up the mtn, and observed the 2nd lite occasionally through the trees. I stopped a third time on top of the mountain when I could see the 2nd lites again. It made a deep rumbling sound and was in a diamond shape with a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. It moved to the south.At 19:15, while driving N on Hwy 70 at the Hwy 191 exit to Paradise, I observed a flashing white lite, brighter and bigger (maybe 6 times bigger than the surrounding stars), in the sky above Paradise. I looked at the digital clock in the car. About one mile further, I saw a 2nd lite NE of the 1st. At first I thought it might have been a reflection in the windows, so I pulled over, stopped  the engine, and rolled down the window. It was a dark clear cold nite. The 1st lite was still constant in the same place in the northern sky above Paradise. The 2nd lite split into two lites, fairly horizonal in the sky. There was no sound. I proceeded to drive NNE on Hwy 70, sighting both the 1st and 2nd lites the whole time, and turned W on Pentz Rd. Here, (4.8 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff) I pulled over a second time, turned off the engine, viewed the 1st lite in the same place in the sky, now left of my position, constantly flashing on and off. The 2nd lite seemed to turn and the left lite split into two, making three lites in a row with the middle one flashing. It continued to turn, while hovering in the same place, and I saw a fourth lite creating a diamond shape, with the middle flashing lite of the first three slightly ahead of the other two. It was now 19:25, I was parked facing WNW and was viewing the lites by ducking my head a little and looking out and up of the passenger side front windowshield to the N. I held up my hand, and the four lites, if they were at the outside corners of an object, would make the object about as long as my thumb (maybe 1.5 inches). The object then moved behind the little hill I was parked beside. I continued W on Pentz Rd, nearly driving off the road to keep the object in site! Pentz Rd then turns and heads NE, up the mtn. I lost sight of both the 1st and 2nd lites at times as the road climbs the mtn. On top of the mtn on Pentz Rd, (at 6.2 miles from the Hwy 191 cutoff on Hwy 70) I again sighted the 2nd object. I stopped the car (third time), turned off the engine, and rolled down the window. The car was facing N, and the object was in the sky to the W of me traveling in a S direct! ion. Now I could hear the wind in the trees and another deeper rumbling sound that seemed to be coming from the object. It was about three inches wide in the sky and there was a darker blackness between the lites which blocked out the stars behind it. I viewed it for perhaps three minutes before it went behind the trees. It was now 19:40  and I continued on my way home to Magalia. On Jan. 9th, my husband and I traveled the route again at the same time as the sightings on Jan. 8th, and took the mileage readings. Unfortunately, there was a pea-soup fog in the valley, so at the first two places I stopped we could not view  the sky."

It was moving in a strange way up and down and then up and down. I noticed them because I was looking at some strange contrails in the sky on my way home that night. They were very strange. The contrails were at night lit up by the full moon. They were also very wide, low to the horison, and crisscrossed in loops, mt least 4 or more that I could see. Then the contrails got very wide and stayed in the sky a longer time than usual. Then the clear sky became full of many small clouds. Just filled the sky. Where did they come from I don&apos;t know. When the moonlight hit them, they looked different, like water looks when it shines on water with oil in it."

Around 22:00 I noticed a quick streak that looked like a metor. It went from east to west. What caught my attention was that when it was directly overhaed it stopped.It was very small like a small star.I could see four other similar size objects in a circle like patten extending to the horizon It was similar to a clover exit ramp on the interstate. About seven minutes passed and two more lights appeared. One from the north and the other the south.They crossed the sky in less thn a second and stopped where the first light was directly overhead. The four that were doing thier circles joined sith the others. They the shot out in what looks like a super nova and dissapeared. There was no noise. I had my mother call Seymore Johnson AFB in Goldsboro to see if they had picked up anything on radar. She said the did not have any aircraft on radar. I do not know if they took a report or not.

Then another object identical to the first one approached it quickly, stopped on a dime just short of it, and then simultaneously they started up again fast, no acceleration, just up to speed immediately.

The light was seen while motoring west on U.S. highway 78 approximately 2 miles east of Stone Mountain Park, GA. This area is a densely populated suburb of Atlanta, GA. The local temperature was approximately 38 degrees F with clear cloudless skies and a brisk wind from the north. The light was approximately 20-25 degrees above the local horizon, was mostly circular and yellowish at its center fading to orange at its perimeter. It had no noticeable irregularities in shape, had no visible tail or contrail, was approximately 4-6 times the diameter and brightness of the brightest star, and was visible for approximately 15 seconds prior to its sudden and silent explosion. Upon exploding, the object split into two fiery fragments which rapidly descended toward the ground. Smoke was visible around the area of the original object and behind the descending fragments. The smoke appeared dark against the dusk sky and expanded in an irregular inverted triangular pattern. The two fragments descended southward toward a line of trees and disappeared from sight prior to reaching the horizon. This event was observed by one adult female and two adolescent male children. Many other motorist were traveling along the same route and appeared to slow down to observe the event."

It was an overcast evening, the ground was covered with snow and it was in a very well lit park at the edge of Carlton University campus. The park was deserted but there were cars driving directly under the object. The conclusion that my friend and I made was that it was undeniably extraterrestrial and could not possibly be an experimental craft or any other form of illusion ie: balloon.  When the object jumped from one location to another it was an approximate leap of 500 feet."

I was driving to work about 9:30 p.m. and saw what I took to be a CHP helicopter illuminating the freeway with a searchlight about 5 miles ahead. (This area is flat and the freeway lies in an almost straight line for miles.)  As I drove closer, I  realized the light was not circling the freeway but remainded absolutely motionless, and that instead of a searchlight, what I was seeing was radiated light coming from inside some type of large craft or object.  It was hovering about 1000 ft. above the freeway and as I drove almost directly under it, I could see it had a &quot;thimble&quot; shape (larger end up). I could view it clearly because of all the light that was coming from the large windows that surrounded it. I thought about stopping for a better look but didn&apos;t have a camera (naturally), and also thought to myself, &quot;Sure, get a real good look, like Travis Walton did,&quot;  so I kept going. I tried to watch it with my head out the window as I passed under it, but almost lost control of the car so I focused on driving and lost sight of it--nothing in the rear view mirror to indicate whether it was still there after I&apos;d passed.

While waiting to tee off on the 16th hole, our conversation was interrupted by the loud noise of airplane engines. We all looked up to see if the plane was in trouble.  It was a DC-9. The plane was about 5000 feet(guess) climbing and banking hard left to the ENE.  I was studying the silver ball, that the plane seemed to be trying to avoid, when my co-worker said, &quot;Hey!  There&apos;s a UFO!&quot;.  The object was perfectly round, bright silver, and its diameter was about 1/4 of the length of the fuselage of the aircraft.  The object was moving very slowly toward the nose of the plane.  The plane missed the ball by approximately half a mile and flew away safely.  None of us noted the carrier&apos;s name.  The ball did not follow. It changed direction to E, increased altitude.  We assured each other that we all saw it. We played on, checking it every few minutes.  It continued to move slowly to the E.

Well, it had started moving slowly toward me and when it passed over head I saw that there was a red light on it and I could hear it but it was a very low sound.  Not something that a plane would make I don&apos;t think.  So it might be my eyes deceiving me or it was indeed an unidentified flying object."

The field are well lighted and there were 12 possibly more witnesses. We were talking when someone motioned to look up at the sky toward the southwest.  There we could see a small bright light just below the cloud covered sky.  It was sort of a cigar shape and had a larger light fanning out from it toward the north.  At the tail end of the fanned out light was a blue-ish round light with what appeared to be a tail or streak of red behind it. It made no sound and never approached any closer. I estimate it was about an eighth to a quarter mile away from us. We at first thought it was a helicopter hovering a distance away then the small cigar light disappeard into the clouds yet the fanned light and blue streak remained to fade out slowly over a 5 minute period.  Moments later a real helicopter came into view but it was of a different shape and we could hear the noise of the propellers.

As I drove East on Highway 4, at the top of Willow Pass in Pittsburg, CA., at 7:20 PM. My attention was caught by a very bright green light flying next to me. My Corvette is very low, so it appeared to me (after looking at it) that the green fireball was less than a mile away from me to the North, and maybe 1000 feet high. My stereo was on, but I thought I heard a noise more than the wind rushing past my window. I was driving at about 85 mph, in the left lane, in traffic, so I know others saw it. I was able to look at the fireball for only a few seconds at a time, because I was driving. The Green fireball was not as bright as a welders arc, but had about the same sharp clarity with a lite green tint. It appeared kind of egg shaped overall, white in the middle, and a difficult to percieve tail of green flame. It was bright enough to where it was hard for me to see detail. Its size could be compared to a small pager (beeper) held at arms length. When my attention was first drawn to the bright clear green light, it was at the rear of my drivers side window.

A probe went to the ground from the belly.I left work that evening between 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm.  I walked out the main entrance that faces South and saw a low flying aircraft that looked like a 747 three times its size on a slow approach.  Concerned that a jet craft was in trouble and was attempting to land I went back into the building.  As it continued to approach I got oncerned that it was going to hit the building so I went back outside to the parking lot to get to my car.  I heard an extremely loud hum from the aircraft and relized at that time it was hovering about 300 feet in the air approxiamately 1/8 to 1/4 of a mile from my position.  The main body of the craft had approxiamately 8 to 10 portals which shinned red.  At each wings&apos; tip, which spanned an estimated 250 yards, where red shinning lights.  From the belly of the main craft appeared a probe which dissappeared into the trees.  Eventually the wing tip lights separated from the main craft&apos;s wings and one flew East and the other flew West. A few minutes later the main craft flew South West and dissappeared over the mountains.  The entire form of the craft(s) were vague -almost opaque.  The red portal lights were prominent.  It looked like a jet liner on approach in a fog, however, the evening was clear and most important was extremely windy.  Wind gusts in the mountain that day were clocked at 155 miles per hour.  Walsenburg, CO., our neighboring town to the East, made National news with winds gusting at 90 miles per hour.  The wing ends red lights which separated from the wings had no other form other than being a red light in the night sky much like a small Cessna 180.  Who in their right mind, military or other, would have been out flying the front range that evening in a wind storm I will not forget for a long time.  Four other individuals that evening witnessed strange aircraft activity about 7:00 pm in the evening.  One individual saw a bright white light North West of my sighting.  The other three individuals saw what appeared to be a very low flying jet hugh in size, one sa! w a probe from the belly with a red light at the end, the other two saw much smaller aircraft assisting the main aircraft at wing tips much like I&apos;ve describe above.  The craft(s) were flying North West of my sighting.  Your prompt response will be appreciated.((ADDENDUM FROM SECOND REPORT))747 type aircraft three times the size of a 747 with 8-10 portal windows which shinned red and a wing span that could fill 3/4s of a football fieldI continually get disconnected from the internet when I&apos;m in this part of the form attempting to enter a full description of what I saw.  I&apos;m timing out and can&apos;t seem to recover.  I will mail you a full description along with area maps as well as a drawing of the craft.  I will include the names and phone numbers of individuals to contact who had a similar siting that same evening as well as another very strange siting which occured Friday, January 29, 1999, which may be related.  If you have any questions please email me at ssc@rmi.net. Sincerely, Sharon M. Corsaut"
19981215,19981216,"Oroville, CA",light,20 minutes,"A pair of lights joined by another light. They separate back into pair and single.Three craft, which I first thought to be satellites, forming a close encounter over the Sacramento/Marysville area - 50 miles to the South.  As I watched it was apparent that two of these craft were flying together as a pair up from the south, and a third craft was approaching the encounter area from the West.  Clear skies, some very high clouds, good lighting, about a half hour after sunset. The craft pair was arranged so the larger of the two was always to the left of the smaller.  All three craft went through continual complex fast changing lighting arrays.  Their lights weren&apos;t synchronized.  Quite bright, brilliant colors, or a brite white light disc.  Sometimes the lights would double or form arrays of four, all flashing differently, sometimes with different intensities. This didn&apos;t appear to be the light signature of the satellites which are visible here every clear evening, and their movements implied airplane, but on an out of atmosphere scale, which meant that the lights in their fantastic array were very brilliant. The smaller craft almost always was two tightly bound points of scintillating lights.  Often times there were four.  Only rarely did it become a single point of light.  There did not seem to be an structure associated with the light arrays, yet they maintained an integral formation as if there were a structure.  It appeared several times that it was presenting a changing profile to the viewer as it moved around, that perhaps a cause of the observed relative movements of the lights. As they converged the solo craft from the west executed a turn to the north and began flying with the two coming from the south.  I then thought I was watching airplanes, but there never was a sound, and the scale of movement was wrong for an airplane.  The solo craft cruises around the pair who turn to the east.  There is movement between the pair, but it is subtle and their overall position remains exactly the same to this observer _througout_ their entire flight!  The solo light is, what one could almost call, animated, especially as the scale of this encounter became apparent.  The solo craft flew north above a cirrus changing vectors a few degress several times, at one point appearing to reverse course as it circled back over an area - they were complex very large scale manuevers in a patch of sky the size of my hand at arms length - never leaving a contrail or noise.  As it did these high speed manuevers, it reached its highest point as it turned westward at about 10:30 as my arm would point to it.  As it slowly went into the west glow I could see that it was still manuevering but it was so far away that distance only indicated that this light or group of lights was not an airplane and was way off planet as compared to the usual couple of dozen satellite crossings.  Eventually this brilliant cluster of glittering jewels was lost in the evening glow. As I caught up with the pair they had traveled across the sky in an enormous turn from the east to north over in the Reno area. That city is almost exactly East from this observer.  They traveled north 15-20 degrees then I saw that they were just slowly getting closer together in appearance which meant that they were now traveling to the Northeast and they maintained that till they faded into the night sky a hands width above the horizon.  At their highest in the East they seemed at about 10:00 in the sky as pointed to by my arm.  There was never a sound. The scale of these executed movements would seem to require high altitudes.  This was a very grand encounter, very majestic, and it would seem, when postulating actual physical craft, quite an extraordinary expression of speed and power. During this 20 minute dance the land and sky were very quiet.  No jets and no local noise at all, it was quiet.  Any sounds caused by these craft would have been audible, if they had been aircraft, as exampled by similarly placed jet flybys. This happened at 5:10 to 5:30 pm Pacific Standard Time on 15 December 1998."

19961106,19981214,"San Jose, IL",formation,3-4 minutes,"Coming home from voting in &quot;96&quot; my wife and I noticed 7-8 craft off to the west. Flying very erratically, almost looked like they were playing tag or dodge ball. (Not staying in formation) It lasted while we drove 5 miles, then one by one blinked out.These craft were far enough away that a dime held at arms length would cover them,individually, not their formation,  but they were quite visible in a clear, night-time, fall sky. They were orange in color and moved vertically and horizontally in an instant. I called the Springfield, IL airport to report it and they gave me a number to call, which I did and left a message. A few days later, my call was returned and I was asked what I&apos;d seen again. I told them and they told me that and hour or two after my report over 300 reports, identical to mine, came in from the Chicago area. They said that someone else would contact me shortly. But nobody ever did. About a week later, my wife, her sister, my brother-in-law and I were in Peoria, IL at a luau by the IL River. We were right in town along the river when we saw the same thing my wife and I saw election night. Only this time, the duration was 5-6 hours and we also saw them flying slow and low above us (Without lights) Unlighted they were silvery in color and we could see them in the glow from the lights of Peoria. There was absolutely no sound on either occurrance."

19981023,19981123,"Cave Creek ( N. Scottsdale border), AZ",light,20 min,"At least four bright objects hovered for several minutes, then randomly moved slowly up and down while becoming very intense when descending.  One object shot off at extreme speed.I am filing this report in behalf of my family as follows; Four white completely silent objects were seen northeast of 64th. St and Peak View Rd. Cave Creek, Az. at 6:40 P.M.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 20 minutes and was witnessed by 4 people ages 20,  (daughter)48(wife), 71(mother in law), and 72(father in law). The objects appeared approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and were initially spaced approximately 1 foot apart at arms length as they   moved about randomly in the same general area. The objects were at different altitudes initially then one object began to descend slowly. During descent the object became very bright (appeared to become larger).  The objects seemed to take turns descending and rising. While observing one object, another instantly appeared appeared next to it (seemed to come from knowhere). There were no other lights associated with each object (only one light source). One observer stated that when the objects lowered the light changed it shape to become somewhat pointed on the top and bottom and thicker in the middle. The same observer indicated that the size of the objects were about the same size as a standard household lightbulb at about 150 ft. distance. Another characteristic of the objects is that they would become dimmer when moving but becomming noticeably brighter when hovering or descending. Two of the observers reported that one of the objects shot off at an extreme speed almost too fast to follow at an approximate 30 degree angle upward and disappeared. No aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting. All observers are of sound mind and have stated that they have never seen anything as bizzare as this.  We all frequently see aircraft landing lights for all types of aircraft since we are north of Scottsdale airport, Deer Valley Airport, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airport but these objects were distinctly different not only in appearance but movement. This writer is a company Vice President, Aerospace Engineer, and licensed pilot and very experienced with many different types of military and commercial aircraft and aviation technology in general. I interviewed each observer to obtain as accurate an account as possible.  I personally missed the sighting by approximately 10 minutes when returning from work."
19941215,19981214,"El Toro, CA",light,3 mins,"Saw a light in the valley moving back and fourth directly over the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. It left straight up when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off.On my way into work around 5am pst on approx. 12/15/94, I drove over a hill on a main road from Aliso Viejo, CA into El Toro, CA and saw a light in the valley moving back and fourth directly over the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. The point at which I first saw this thing was just before I crested the rise, I was angled to the sky and could not yet see the valley ahead. What caught my attention was this very bright but quite small light that was moving from my left field of view to the right, then instantly left again. The stars were clear and bright that morning I remember and there were no clouds. I first thought it was a police helicopter looking for someone close-by, not an uncommon sight in Southern California. Then I got to the top of the slight incline and the valley spread out before me with all the city lights intact. Directly ahead and just to my right (approx 10 miles) on the valley floor is the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS).I know excacly where it is because I like to watch the jet fighters take-off in the late morning and afternoons. They NEVER take off in early am due to residential noise abatement ordinances. Anyway, this light was NOT a helicopter and was maneuvering directly over the MCAS. I pulled over and watched this thing clearly for a couple minutes. It was not at high altitude and my best guess would put it at 1000 ft. It moved too fast for a plane, from the distance I was to it, it had to be going VERY fast to cover the arc it was maneuvering in. I have seen the Air Force Thunderbirds and Navy Blue Angels at this Air Station Perform and they never covered as much ground so quickly as this thing did . It made many 90 and 180 degree turns and stayed over the base. After only about two minutes of watching this light I could see fighters taxiing on one of the the runways. The light-object left nearly straight up (@85 degree angle to my left) when two F/A-18 fighters left the runway on take-off. As I said, the fighters NEVER take-off in early am. I watched them go airborne! , they quickly turned and accelerated in the direction the light was a few moments before then slowed and continued @ north-west and out of sight. I stayed about another 15 minutes but they did not come back, either plane or UFO."
19780317,19990215,"Denver, CO",triangle,45 minutes,"Denver, Colorado, March 17, 1977, at around 7:30 pm. Two objects seen up close. One hovered over our home, the other flew over at just above treetop level.  A third was seen in the distance as a red light falling from one of the craft to the ground.My husband, myself, and our 2 sons, ages 2yrs, and 1 year old were moving into our new house on March 17th, 1977.  I remember the date clearly because it was my younger sons 1 year old birthday.  I was in the house unpacking with my 1 year old, and my husband and older son were outside getting things from the truck.  It was dark by this time, but we had the porch lights on.  This was in the sante fe area of Denver, Colorado, which is a fairly heavily populated area of Denver. At approximately 7:30 pm, my husband came running into the house, and yelling my name.  He was very agitated, and nearly speechless,and he just kept saying my name while dragging me out to the back side of the house. I would say no more than 30 seconds had past between him racing into the home, and he and I going back outside.  When I got out there he began to tell me what had happened to him.  He said he was bending down in the cab of the truck to retrieve a box when it lit up like someone had placed a powerful flashlight over his shoulder.  He looked over his shoulder and saw a craft hovering, with no sound, right at treetop level over our home.  It had ice cube shaped lights on it, which were flashing in a circular movement around the object.  The craft itself was spherical in shape.  As soon as he saw it, he raced in the house to get me.  My 2 year old was left outside by himself, and he has no memory of the event. By the time I came outside, the object was in the distance, and it looked like a very large, bright star to me.  I had jumped up on the cab of the truck for a better look, and began to search the sky.  As I looked up and behind me, I saw another craft that was very low to the ground flying right over my head.  It was higher than treetop level, but not by much.  This craft was triangular, had 3 very large amber colored lights on the bottom of it.  It was close enough that I was able to make out some of the mechanical lines of the craft on its bottom part.  There was no sound at all, and it just drifted past.  I watched it until I could not make it out anymore. The other craft (the first one spotted) had now appeared to stop and hover over the far mountains.  It was blinking, and then appeared to change shape and color.  It went from white, to gold, to pale red, and changing shapes.  It was too far away to tell the exact shapes, but it did not stay spherical.  Then a round, very bright red light seemed to drop from it, and float to the ground, leaving a trail as it did. The main craft then turned bright white and circular again, and moved off toward Boulder, CO. We watched it until we couldn&apos;t make it out anymore. Approximately 3 to 5 minutes later, a number of helicopters and planes we suspected were military buzzed around our home.  They searched the area for about 5 minutes, then moved off. There were several cars that had stopped by our home, gotten out of their cars and watched the crafts as well.  We talked with them, but did not get their names.  I have never reported this incident until now.  The main reason I am, is to see if your organization got any other reportings of this event."

Something caught the corner of my eye and i turned and saw three circular, blueish/white lights moving quickly through the sky approching the water, 2 or 300 yards away from me. I watched them moved very fast to the water and stop almost instanly. The floated there for around 15 minutes, staying perfectly still. Then, with no warning, a small ball, the size of a basketball maybe, it was too far away to tell. It hovered towards me at around 4-5 mph, and came to about 50 feet away from me, and then shot off towards the woods. Then as soon as the small ball dissapeared, so did the other three circles, moving extremely fast out in the same direction they came down. The next day i noticed my watch had stopped at 22:37 pm."

The weather was partly cloudy and I observed this light to be below the clouds.  I raised my flashlight towards this light and the light moved eastward stopped became bright then dim.  The light shot upward out of sight.  I went to this spot every night and this light made contact for the next two tuesdays.The light would become bright then dim.  I observed a car parked in the front parking lot this was during the forth attempt of contact.  A man was sitting in car I asked this man if I could help him he stated no.  He showed me a goverment I.D (name ((name deleted))) and said he is the O.S.I. watching a person in area and then another car arrived and they left.  I was moved to a different post.  I hope you regard this as the truth I have more to this to tell.

19981206,19981213,"Washington C.H., OH",fireball,NA,We spotted a green fireball flying over the city as we were coming home from a near by resturant. It looked similiar to a fire work of some kind. My girlfriend thought it was a shooting star. The object wasn&apos;t traveling at a very high altitude so I told her if it were a shooting star someone will have a big dent in there car. The object then began to fade away.

From the east, a C-130 was flying in low toward the west. I commented on this to my friend, and we then noticed a small, flickering light in the general vicinity of the C-130, hovering stationarily. It appeared simillar to a star, or perhaps Venus. However, the time was approxamitly 5:10, much too early for any star to be visible or Venus to be rising. The object would flash very brightly, then dim in a flickering manner, and then seem to disappear. After a few moments, the object reappeared dimly, increasing in brightness, near where it had previously been. While visible, the object did not appear to move. But during its disappearing acts, the object would reappear in a different  but close-by location. During the event, three or four more C-130&apos;s followed on the heels of the first we had originally seen. My friend later informed me that he had seen a Huey about fifteen minutes prior to the sighting event. My friend retrieved a video camera and a set of binoculars. He filmed the object for about four to five minutes. Unfortunatly, due to the distance of the object (perhaps several miles), the focus was unable to lock in, and we have only  30-60 frames of a resolved image. Thru the binoculars, I determined the object to be metallic and spherical, like a ball-bearing reflecting the light of the sun. But a sphere would reflect the sun&apos;s light evenly and consistantly. Go figure. Within two minutes after the last C-130 had flown in low (and pressumably landed at Kirtland AFB very close-by), the object blinked out for the last time and did not reappear."

It stopped overhead at about 1000 feet approx, 2 more lights detached themselves from the original lightand began to circle it. This made it clear that it was in no way a normal object, as the 2 lights stayed precisely opposite to each other as they rotated around. The 2 lights performed what i could only describe as an infinity symbol like maneuver before merging again with the original and taking off at very high speed on a reciprocal course (to the south) The lights were all white with no indication of beacons etc as per an aircraft.

Because I knew they were not suposed to  be there.So I figured they were just planes and went back to star gazing. A minute later, I would guess,I looked over the house and saw  one of the objects coming over the house, at a slow rate of speed. I had my telescope fixed on the Pleiades, I noticed the object was passing across the path of the Pleiades. Then I grabbed my 10x50 binoculars to get a better look at the object, once I got them up to my eyes I saw that there were three bright gold colored lights with one red slow flashing light in the center. As it continued moving slowly from the northeast to the southwest with the binoculrs I could clearly see it was triangular in shape,there were no stars visible through the objet.I took the binoculars away from my eyes again and I saw going in the same direction three other objects, only these I could distinctly tell were either planes or jets. Then I looked back in the direction of the triangular object and it was not to be seen anywhere. I have no idea what happened to it, it was just gone. I have never saw anything like this, I see planes and jets everyday and this was not what I witnessed tonight. As for the second object I mentioned I never saw it again, it never came over the house like the other, it must have took off in a different direction.All I can say is that what ever it was gave me a strange feeling and it was not a Airplane or a jet."

Let me say that I don&apos;t watch si-fi shows..well I have seen old Star Trek shows, but that was years ago.  I&apos;m someone that believes that if you can&apos;t prove it logically why talk about it.  In fact one show I really enjoy is Arthur C. Clarks show.  Anyway back to the dreams..I have seen several different kinds of spacecraft and they don&apos;t look like any thing thats been shown on tv.  I have also seen them with military aircraft that have been retrofitted.  I know they have been retrofitted because I know military aircraft designs that exist, (due to the fact I lived on a military airstrip in Colorado Springs (Peterson Airforce Base).  The planes are working with the spacecraft in going after us.  To tell you the truth, I&apos;m starting to feel very stupid telling you about this, but what the hell..I&apos;ve already started.  I relized in my dream that the military aircraft had some type of spray comming from them that made myself and the people around me sick..I can&apos;t really explain why..it just seemed that way in the dream. Last night I saw a new type of spacecrat,again, nothing like I have ever seen on tv.  The dreams are starting to bother me, do a lot of people have dreams about ufo&apos;s?  Are my dreams a result of to much tv? Like I said before, I&apos;m not someone who is a si-fi nut. I can&apos;t disclose my identification due to the fact that it could cause me problems.

19990106,19990108,"Lakeside, CA",flash,3:00 min.,"On Tuesday night at my job at the Barona indian reservation in Lakeside, Ca. another officer and I saw three white strobe-like craft racing across the sky in a zig-zag pattern; all were going faster than conventional known aircraft speeds. One went north, the second one went northwest, and the third headed west, during and after we saw military jets flying in the same airspace, one headed south and the other headed west. Earlier in the evening, and all evening there had been a noticeable increase in aircraft activity.While working as an outside security guard at the Barona indian reseervation on the night of the sixth of January I noticed earlier in the evening at around 6:30 p.m. shortly after I began my shift that there was increased aircraft activity in the airspace over that region of Southern California. There were military jets, heliocopters, and commuter planes. Later in the evening at 9:30 another guard that I was standing with saw the first white flashing strobe-like craft appear overhead traversing at a tremendous speed zig-zaging across the night sky; thats when he told me of it and I looked up startled at a white flashing craft zigzaging across the sky making pin-point moves seemingly defying the laws of movement, then at about 20 seconds into that another craft appeared but not overhead it was moving around up and down strait ahead north of us, then as suddenly as that had appeared a thrid one appeared just a little west of the second one. They all danced around the sky in strobelike fashion for around another minute, during which a military jet, with red and green lights on the wing tips, going at a fairly normal speed, which helped to compare speeds of the crafts, crossed the sky heading south. Then as suddenly as they had appeared the third one headed west, the second one headed northwest and the first one was still visible heading north and went out of range at around 9:34 p.m. Just as the first one was getting out of range we  saw another military jet heading south and then veering west. That was the first time I have ever witnessed such a craft going through space at such tremendous speeds, I would guess they must have been going in the thousands of miles per hour based on the time it took them to go from directly overhead to a point north of us in only around ten seconds time. This was much faster then conventional aircraft I have seen cross the same distance in time."
19771019,19990112,"Los Banos, Laguna (Philippines),",unknown,1 minute,"While satellite gazing at night, three objects moving in the upper atmosphere stopped completely for a second, then proceeded in different directions.I was watching (with no binoculars) satellites go by in the clear night sky as I sometimes did when I was 15 years old.  Being the gadget guy that I am, I was fascinated by how humans had put into orbit such crafts.  I usually would observe 5 to 7 satellites a night before retiring to bed.  Then at around 9:30 p.m., I observed 3 satellites that were closely and perfectly equidistant from each other.  The trio caught my special attention.  I thought I was so lucky to have been witnessing a rare coincidence.  They were moving with identical velocities from North to South.  One object led the other two.  Then, without warning, they all STOPPED for at least a full second!  The manner in which they stopped really surprised me because they did not slow down to a stop but simply stopped dead in their tracks.  Then they moved again immediately with the previous velocities, but in three different directions: the leader continued southward, one went 45 degrees to the left, while the third one went 45 degrees to the right.  It was an amazing sight.  I watched them all until they disappeared into the horizon.  Even at that time, I thought about what technology, if earthly, could do that... or from which country.  But to this date, over 21 years later, I know of absolutely no air or space craft technology that could do what those three objects did.  I am a man of science with a Ph.D. and so I always try to find answers to the way things work, especially those that catch my interest.  For this one: extra-terrestrial."

I saw one luminous green ball that started just under the clouds and fell like a falling star but much much closer.  It faded out in about 3 to 5 seconds, on this side of the horizon. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon, and about as bright.  It reminded me of a roman candle in reverse.I&apos;m a small business owner and was up late doing bookwork in front of my french doors when I saw this.  We had cloud cover last night and we live in a rural area so it was very dark out side and I checked to see if it could be a reflection of any kind. No way.  I&apos;m just curious about what it could have been. Are meteors this color?"
19981015,19990220,"Glenwood, AR",disk,few seconds,"I am a college student and a mother of a 5 and 2 year old. I had come home from a long day at school and discovered I had to run into town to pick up something to prepare for dinner. I got about a half a mile down the road and glanced up into the sky at my right and saw a bright shiney silver object suspended in the sky. Close enough I could tell it wasn&apos;t a plane or even shaped like one for that matter. It was shaped like a disk with a well rounded egg in the middle. I went home after going to the store and reported the event to my husband, and I was laughed at. So I summed it up to being delusional due to lack of sleep. It wasn&apos;t until a saw a special on tv last week on UFO&apos;S that I decided to tell someone. At that time they showed the exact same object as I saw, which in away convinced me I&apos;m not crazy. And ever since I witnessed the object hovering, strange things have been happening around my house electrical apliances coming on for no reason etc... E mail me if youre intrested in hearing more. I wouldn&apos;t swear this event happened in Oct. My life moves in semesters and all I know for sure is it was last semester.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))"

19750113,19990317,"Uxbridge, MA",light,5 - 10 mins.,"Was driving South on Route 146 through Uxbridge, MA (Approx. 5 miles N of the Rhode Island border.) I was alone. Observed a bright white light move rapidly from left to right, above and in front of me. (Could not judge size but appeared to be slightly larger than a plane would have been.) Approx. 10 - 20 seconds later, what I took to be the same object came back accross the highway in the opposite direction, only at much slower speed and was amber in color. I observed the object move slowly off to the left (to the NE) where it appeared to stop and &quot;hover&quot; in the sky. Object then suddenly changed to a bright red color. (As if someone had simply turned a light switch ..... it just changed color.) Lost sight of the object behind the tree line  as I continued South. No sound(s) were noticed.Not much to add from summary description above other than it was quite upseting. (Scared the &quot;hell&quot; out of me.) Somehow had the feeling the object knew i was observing it or that it was observing me. Didn&apos;t wait around to find out. Unfortunately traffic was very light at that late hour. I did not notice any other cars on the road during this time. As stated above the object appeared to be a bright white light, moving rapidly from left to right directly in front and above my location. given my direction of travel it seemed to be going from the NE to SW. My first thought was that it was a plane but was going much too fast. Only seconds later the light came back into my view over the tree line, now  going in the opposite direction (from SW to NE) only much slower than before.(Note, while briefly out of my sight the object appeared to have changed to an amber color.) As I proceeded along the highway for approx. anothr 2 - 3 miles I had the object in my sight off to the left. It seemed to stop completely, hover for several seconds, then changed to a red color very suddenly. I became quite frightned, never having seen anything like this. (And being alone on the highway late at night.) I got the hell out of there as fast as I could. I do not recall any sounds associated with the object. I did not think the object was a plane or helicopter. Light did not blink. Flight path seemed to be extremely straight ..... precise is probably a better description. No banking, bouncing, blowing in the wind, or sudden altitude changes, etc. Just a straight line .... first a bright light very fast from left to right. Then back the other way much slower .... now amber in color. Moving slowly, slowly slowly off to the left then stopping. Then BANG a change to red. It was, however, a long time ago. Incident is still quite clear in my mind though."
19990122,19990123,"Vancouver (Canada), BC",circle,2 seconds,"white circle one quarter size of full moon appeared NNW, sky, disappeared SSEsky, no trail.At 18:42 PST my mother let our two small dogs out into the back yard and was standing on back porch waiting for them to come back in.  She looked up at the sky and saw a white circle about the size of a small pea held at arm&apos;s length or one quarter size of a full moon.  She said it suddenly appeared in the North to Northwest sky and was visible for about 1.5 to 2 seconds as it sped toward the SSE sky and suddenly disappeared.  There was only the one object and the sky was partially obscured by a layer of cirrostratus cloud.  She called to me and I went out to look at the sky.  The object was gone by this time but I did note the cloud cover and that I was able to see a slightly fuller than crescent moon and some brighter stars through the thin cloud cover.  She said there was no trail behind the object and it didn&apos;t look like a fireball.  My mother is a retired store manager and I am a  librarian.  She informed me the following day that the new space station was apparently visible in the sky during the time she saw the object.  This brings up many questions. It moved from the NW horizon to the SE in under 2 seconds.  If it indeed was the space station she saw, is it capable of such speed?  Is it tumbling which would cause it to reflect the sun&apos;s light and then seem to disappear?   Is it&apos;s orbit in a NW to SE direction?   My mother feels that is what she saw--the new space station.  But I am not so sure.  About 2-3 minutes before she saw the object the was a loud rumble like a sonic boom.  It definitely was not thunder; the sky was basically clear and here on the west coast of British Columbia we get few thunderstorms mainly from April to early September.   Thank you for your time."

I rushed inside and told my family, got 2 pairs of binoculars and my family and I went out to observe. At that point the object was moving up/down and side to side for a distance of approximately 1-2 miles at each movement. My wife, son and daughter witnessed this with amazement for a period of about 10 minutes. Commercial traffic could be seen passing in close proximity of this object, however the object made no effort to &quot;track&quot; with the plane. I could clearly see that this object was moving by triangulating it with nearby stars in it&apos;s proximity. The object became stationary and was observed for approximately 30 more minutes noticably not maintaining horizontal alignment with nearby stars verifying it wasn&apos;t a star decending on horizon. The object seemed to pulse orange to white at higher intensities from time to time at intervals of approximately 5-10 seconds. Then suddenly the object disappeared as if to &quot;wink out&quot;. The following night I located the same cellestial bodies for verification of the objects location and indeed the object was not there!"

Just going for a ride one evening when we noticed a very bright light approching us from the east, we were traveling north. It got so bright that we stopped the truck, shut off the engine and got out to watch.  We saw a triangular thing with a bright headlight and red lights round the edges. It was so very close to us and it had no noise what so ever. It stayed above us for about 15 seconds and then with amazing speed, still silent, was gone in maybe 3 seconds.  My only thoughts were &quot;I&apos;m never going to see my children again.&quot;  I was scared.My husband and my friend didn&apos;t report it because we were afraid of ridicule.

19940210,19990312,"Lewiston (Near), ID",triangle,5 minutes,"Triangular craft hovering over bridge then moving downriver.In 1994 I was coming home from my job as a registered nurse.  I was driving on Idaho highway #3/12 near what is known as the Arrow Junction. I noticed lights about 1/2 mile ahead of me that appeared to be stationary and located on the side of the river valley.  The night was very overcast with no stars or moonlight visible.  I thought for a moment that someone must have installed new lighting on the outside of their house because there are many new homes in that area.  As I approached the bridge, however, I saw that the lights were moving down the river towards me.  The lights turned into a triangular shaped aircraft that was probably about 150-200 feet above the river&apos;s surface.  It was moving very slowly downriver, over the center of the water.  I assume that the craft was triangular because the lights that were shining down were in a triangular pattern like this: 0 &lt;--&quot;front&quot; of craft Lights---&gt;   0 0 0 0 0  &lt;--rotating beacons between these lights I think that there were only 5 lights on the craft, but I don&apos;t remember for sure.  There were two rotating beacons in between the last three lights.  This struck me as odd because most aircraft marker lights that I&apos;m aware of nowdays are strobe-type lights.  Another odd thing was that this really large aircraft seemed to be proceeding at a terribly slow rate of speed.  It seems to me that it must have had to have been a helicopter because the forward speed was so slow.  The lights were all white, even the rotating lights.  Since the sky was overcast and totally dark, I couldn&apos;t make out the actual form of the craft.  I always said that if I ever saw a &quot;UFO&quot; I would stop, get out, and watch it.  But this was so different than anything I&apos;ve ever seen before that I could not bring myself to stop and get out of my rig.  I do not have an estimate of the physical size of the craft although it was very big.  I used to be a paratrooper and was in Viet Nam so I am familiar with a lot of the military&apos;s aircraft and I can say that I haven&apos;t a clue as to what this thing was, other than it was big and slow.  The second witness referred to above was another nurse who was driving her car ahead of mine.  The Arrow Bridge is at the intersection that we both took to get home and when I talked to her the next evening at work she said she saw the aircraft and that it appeared to be hovering directly over the bridge when she turned to get on the highway that would take her home.  This correlates with what I saw because I could see her car ahead of mine, turning on the bridge about 1/2-3/4 mile ahead of me and the lights at that time were directly over the bridge and appeared to be stationary.  She had no other information to add about what the thing looked like.  The aircraft passed by me and I continued to the bridge, then made the same turn that the other nurse made and continued home. Additional: The lights had the same brilliance and color of airplane landing lights.  I don&apos;t remember any other unusual factors about the lights other than that they were very white and very bright."

As I looked up I noticed several aircraft before I viewed the source of the noise.Tha aircraft I observed first were a passenger jet heading West towards Love Field and a helicopter heading N/NW. As I looked  straight up I saw a military jet making a severe bank up into the sky following a sphere that was about 60 foot in diameter.The jet followed the object East to an altitude of at least 4000 feet(yes it was that low) Then the sphere was gone,into thin air.

One light was in the &quot;front corner&quot;. The object made no sound. It made a circling motion. The axis of this motion was close to one of the &quot;sides&quot; of the craft. After ca. 2 min it vanished either by turning off the lights or disapearing behind the clouds or both. ( the sky was semi clouded ).
