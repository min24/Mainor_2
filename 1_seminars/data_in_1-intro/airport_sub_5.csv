aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,Nigel Stacey,United Kingdom,2012-04-24,Not too bad it was easy to check-in. One thing I found strange was the baggage conveyer came out near the entrance to the airport. There are a few places to get a drink and a bite to eat. To get into Aberdeen the station is a bus or taxi journey away from the terminal itself. There are a couple of hotels close by but they are a bit pricey.

abidjan-airport,/airport-reviews/abidjan-airport,Abidjan Airport customer review,Pedro Gil,NA,2006-12-20,I frequently travel through this airport and would note a couple of problems in an otherwise nice facility. First I've arrived on another airline and been unable to get help in the transit lounge from Air I'voire even though they are my next flight. You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them. Second if you go through the passport desk they have plain clothed policemen without badges who demand your passport in the luggage area without identifying themselves.

Terminal 1: This is where all the other airlines (not low cost) flies out to and out from. Small considering its Abu Dhabi, where all the money is at. You are required to scan your luggage prior to check in and 'apparently' only passengers are allowed to go there, even if you're just there to buy flight tickets which is located inside. Only one small coffee shop before the immigration check for you to hang with your loved ones before you say goodbye. Inside the terminal past security, only few stores available, and all are tiny. Terminal 2: This is where the low costs airlines such as Rotana Jet flies in or out from. Terminal is tiny, looks like a ghost town with only one coffee shop that surprisingly has good food. Coming in to the terminal was another nightmare. I've flown in twice here and both times were jam packed. It's as if the queue is never ending. Terminal 3: This is where all the Etihad flights come in and out from. Much better than the other 2 terminals and you can actually check in at the counter with another person accompanying you. Shops inside the terminal passed immigration is better than Terminal 1, although still not as amazing as Dubai Terminal 3 or Doha airport. Still, not recommended for transit more than 3 hours. I had to give mix stars for this airport due to the different service quality that is displayed across different terminals.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Michael Schade,United Arab Emirates,2015-02-12,I am a frequent traveller and I have seen my share of dysfunctional airports but nothing compares to the AUH airport. It did not catch up with its growth over the past few years and passengers have to pay dearly for that shortcoming. It took me 2h from stepping into the building until I reached the gate. There are long queues everywhere check in passport control security and even toilets. Staff are stressed and grouchy. There are at peak hours no seats anywhere in or near the gates.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Andy Williams,United Kingdom,2014-11-12,I used AUH on my recent trip to the Philippines as a connection. On both legs I spent only 3 hours in the place. Arrived at Terminal 3 but was departing from Terminal 1 on my outbound leg. The airport website tells you it takes 20 minutes walk but it was more like 10 but I travel light and move fairly quick. Terminal 1 was chaos! It simply is not big enough to house the traffic in and out. Long queues and very little seating. It is also very expensive even for just a drink. Inbound leg both flights arrived and departed from Terminal 3 which is much better. Still the queues into the gates are too long. Had my passport and boarding pass checked twice in the space of 10 meters. All in this place still only gets an average rating.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,L Mellor,Sweden,2014-11-05,Last visited this airport in the 1980s. In a way I'll be sorry to see it go as its tiled doughnut satellites have stood the test of time architecturally speaking. Compare this with the monstrosity at Charles de Gaulle which seems to have aged in less than 10 years. The biggest problem in landing at the international airport is it take about 15 mins to taxi to/from the runway as the new airport terminal construction means that there are a series of contraflow taxi ways. I read a lot of complaints but I took a family of three young children through the terminal at 2:00am and nothing but praise for the staff and services.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Nabil Al Atassi,Czech Republic,2013-09-24,I have been using this airport for many years. Terminal 1 (old) used by most airlines is overloaded with poor services and only one poorly attended bathroom. Terminal 3 used exclusively by Etihad is a bit larger but again operating beyond its design capacity; with only three bathrooms and cheap cleaning contractor cleanliness is an issue mainly if you want to use the cabinets. Abu Dhabi is trying to imitate Dubai's success but apparently without success. Amongst the three major hubs in the area Dubai Doha (till the opening of new airport end of this year) and Abu Dhabi Dubai remains the best.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Philip Loveder,Australia,2012-09-16,Abu Dhabi Airport isn't the most appealing of the world's airports but does have some virtues. The duty free stores are well stocked and the upper level food hall adequate enough. However (and this has been pointed out in previous reviews ad nauseum) the air-conditioning is just far to cold for normal passenger comfort. Virtually everyone had blankets over them while waiting for flights! The flight information boards are quite inadequate and even flights scheduled less than an hour from departure may not make it to the board. Seating is limited outside the direct gate areas.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2012-06-06,Transfer from MAN to BKK. As a Silver member of an Etihad guest I can access the Al Reem lounge which is a big plus apart from duty free not a lot of things to do apart from free wifi. However as previous travellers note at peak times the security clearance for transit passengers can be very poor - I saw the longest line yet all the way back to T1 nearly on the way out but no queue at all for the return flight. Like a lot of other airports need to plan better for peak periods early morning early evening - if they do this it would get a lot better reviews.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,M Taylor,United Kingdom,2012-02-09,Through AUH to BAH. Arrived at a remote stand and bussed to Terminal. Clear signage made it easy to navigate along with plenty of Departure screens. As previously stated quite busy so seating can be a bit hit and miss but they can be found. However after 7 hours in the air a walk about was most welcome. Boarding through Gate 18 was bizarre a doorway that actually led to Gate 17 and 18. Even weirder was that two flights were through this door at the same time which led to confusion for passengers. Security was a drag with two flights passing through one metal detector and two x-ray machines. They got it sorted and we were bussed to another remote stand. Return was at night. Arrived at another remote stand and again a bus to the Terminal. I was travelling with an infant access to a stroller would have been advantageous at the gate. Upon arriving at Flight Transfer we found a fleet of strollers. Why position them here? A reasonably long walk down to Gate 34 (10 mins) with plenty of seating at the Gate in a clean and airy environment. Overall not a bad experience. Terminal 1 is rather dated but great for people watching and shopping. Terminal 3 is modern and bright but can involve a fair trek down to the Gates in the 30's. Be prepared is my advice. Roll with it as it can be busy and perhaps not follow the norm expected of some western airports.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2010-09-19,Transfer at AUH from LHR enroute to CMB and on return journey. Arrival at AUH Terminal 3 - this is the first time in many years I'd passed through Abu Dhabi and T3 was new to me. Fairly typical modern airport terminal - clean spacious lots of steel and glass. 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 for connecting flight - while still architecturally eye catching showing its age and feeling a bit sticky. 10 or so free internet terminals several of which weren't working. On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg). Once through security the route inevitably winds it's way through a huge shopping area before reaching the T3 departure gates. As is the case with T1 there were several free internet terminals. Plentiful seating at the gates themselves.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
abuja-airport,/airport-reviews/abuja-airport,Abuja Airport customer review,Mark Bickerton,NA,2009-05-24,The international terminal is nice and quite well organised but there is nothing much to do there. The domestic terminal is madness especially between 4pm and 7pm when many flights depart for Lagos.

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,G Davis,NA,2010-01-25,Arrivals into Kotoka are not bad. You clear immigration pretty quickly and they have a traditional baggage carousel where the bags come out. Lots of people hassle you for money once you get outside the airport but that is to be expected. Departures are another story. They say to arrive 2 to 3 hours ahead of your flight and that is no joke. It takes forever to go through all of the boarding pass and passport checks. There are too many to count. In addition there is only one x-ray security scanner at each of the two gates and so if you have two large planes leaving from the same gate as was the case for me you have some 600 people filing through the one security scanner area. It was complete mayhem as people who are late for their flights or who don't feel like standing in line just push right to the front of the line and no-one stops them. Once you are at the gate area there are no shops and only one very dirty restroom for 600 people. All passengers for all flights are crammed into the same gate area. I advise that you stay in the middle area of the airport where the shops are as long as possible before proceeding to the gate areas at eather end of the terminal. If you are offered a pass to the lounges Adinkra is in that middle area near the duty free shop and Akwaaba is at gate 1 just before the scanner. You will have to go around the long line waiting at the security scanner at gate 1 and you will see the lounge hidden in the back wall.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
addis-ababa-airport,/airport-reviews/addis-ababa-airport,Addis Ababa Airport customer review,C Williams,NA,2008-06-23,Addis Ababa's Bole Intl Airport is a new 5 gate terminal. On arrival immigration does take some time but you are dealt with in a courteous and professional manner. Although there are signs on the queue's - (Ethiopians Visitors Diplomats etc) you can use any queue. The visitor queue was quite long so we walked up to the diplomat queue and we were stamped in with no questions asked. Luggage collection & customs are swift although all bags are x-rayed by customs. The terminal is beautiful with Ethiopian marble all over the ground and a lot of cultural artefacts throughout the airport. Departures/check-in is fairly swift immigration is a quick stamp out. Note that you are security screened immediately upon entering the airport and before entering your gate. The duty free areas have a nice selection of Ethiopian artefacts.

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,H Davis,Australia,2014-09-30,Adelaide has a small airport without many shops. Certainly no massage or gym. Security is very relaxed - no guns and is a very pleasant place to sit and wait. The food expensive but not-so-great - but this is the case for most airports. However the primary function of such a building is to arrive and depart. Although a car ramp was built several years ago allowing passengers to be deposited 3 metres from the terminal this has been permanently disabled. Now taxis and domestic vehicles can only pass from over 30 metres away. Hilariously its been mentioned that this is to prevent terrorism but in my experience Adelaidians are not this paranoid self-aggrandising or stupid. If it were true I'm sure they would beef up their security in more sensible ways. More likely a structural issue that is taking too long to fix. Unfortunately due to the long an unavoidable walk to and from the terminal from any mode of transport - the airport fails in its basic function of arriving and departing with ease.,NA,NA,NA,2,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,Henry Tib,Australia,2013-11-01,"Drop off requires a walk across the new open air empty Plaza which is between the drop off and the terminal and can be a problem in avoiding inclement weather at the drop off and also in reaching the departure taxi rank. The terminal was obviously designed and built by an ""Engineer"" as the terminal is close to the ramp requires walking down a winding slope to board the aircraft.

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,2013-09-10,Great little airport well laid out and easy to navigate. It is bright and spacious and there is free wi-fi which is painfully slow. Arrivals is a bit of a let down with you being forced to go through an arrival duty free shop. There is only one baggage carousel for international flights which makes it a problem if a large aircraft lands let alone multiple long haul flights. Customs is slow with numerous people asking you the very same questions. Perhaps they should consider having more people man the immigration booths and less customs staff. They obviously have little to do in such a small airport so are overzealous. On return check-in facilities were good friendly staff. There were many shops in the departure area which is a communal area for both international and domestic departures. The actual immigration and customs for international flights is a small area which is hard to miss! One other drawback is the pick-up and drop-off area what a mess!

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,Henry Tib,NA,2006-05-24,"Had my first experience travelling on a regional airline from the new Adelaide terminal. It would seem that when they designed the new terminal they forgot about the regional air passengers. The departure ""gates"" for both the regional airlines are situated at the extreme end of the terminal requiring a fair walk although you can enjoy for part of the way a 50metre travelator ( though not sure it works) . When boarding you have to be escorted by the flight crew down a number of stairs to the exit for boarding. Regional air passengers returning to Adelaide airport again have to be escorted by the co-pilot to the terminal building through a concrete passageway then go through airport security and return to the upper level departure area through a door that is well away from the designated arrival area shown on the monitors to depart the terminal. nterstate passengers have to walk down two ramps to the aircraft and it would seem for speedier boarding passengers seated at the rear of the aircraft are directed to walk across the the tarmac to the rear steps of the aircraft.

There are lovely large windows with views over the tarmac runway and ranges in the distance (and if it's race day you can see the horses too). The cafe is good although a bit overpriced.

alghero-fertilia-airport,/airport-reviews/alghero-fertilia-airport,Alghero Fertilia Airport customer review,Harry Albright,NA,2006-01-27,A nice little airport actually in Fertilia rather than Alghero. It has been recently expanded and a new arrivals hall should be opening shortly. Arrivals are straightforward both Schengen and non-Schengen. There are two belts for luggage and then you are straight out to the arrivals hall. Car rental desks are opposite where you come out and there are a couple of cash machines as well as a bar and a few shops. At the bar you pay at the cash register then take the receipt to the bar. Apart from the car rentals there are taxis just outside arrivals although these are pricey (about 20 Euro to the centre of town). It's about 12km to Alghero. Another option is to turn right and cross the parking lot. About 100 metres away are bus stops with orange buses running to Alghero and other buses heading to Sassari and Cagliari. Buy tickets for the Alghero buses at the souvenir shop (about 70 cents) in the terminal. If this is closed ride the bus anyway. The driver will sometimes stop for you to buy tickets sometimes not. Departures is equally straightforward at the other end of the terminal from arrivals. Note though that there is absolutely nothing to do airside so don't go through too soon. Non-Schengen international flights (e.g. to the UK) all leave from gate 1 and you have to queue for passport checks before you are allowed in to the gate area. The immigration officers usually arrive about 30 minutes before the flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On arrivals I find it inadequate to have to walk down stairs after coming off the plane. I did not see an elevator available. The wait for the luggage is too long. I was told it was due to the luggage scanner being undersized for the traffic. One important deficiency is the absence of English signs; they are all in French and Arabic only.

almaty-airport,/airport-reviews/almaty-airport,Almaty Airport customer review,D Kim,Australia,2014-12-18,Almaty airport is a tiny and dilapidated building compared to most international airports. The international terminal is cramped when you are waiting for an overseas flight and sometimes you'll be lucky to even find a place to sit. As you are coming in passport control is fairly swift and quick and collection of luggage and exiting is fast as well. As you are coming out be prepared to be greeted by a horde of gypsy taxi drivers. Most of them will overcharge you if you don't speak Russian so if you don't feel comfortable there is an official taxi booth near the exit charging 3500 Tenge. If you do decide to utilize a gypsy taxi driver come to an agreed upon price before getting in a price of 1500 - 2000 Tenge is reasonable. When buying something from one of the shops at the airport if you don't speak Russian it's important to not agree to buy anything unless there is a price tag on it. Shop keepers routinely over-charge foreigners double and even triple the amount. Overall it is not a comfortable airport to be in especially if you are waiting for an overseas flight. Limit the amount of time you have to spend there to as little as possible.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Going out the departure hall has been rebuilt much better and quicker. Security still tight big queue to get through. The departure lounge has been rebuilt and access to the rooftop terrace removed. The lounge is much better than the original. As work is going on don't know if there are plans to restore access to the roof. Small snack bar with coffee and rolls at reasonable prices but duty free for local stuff is the same price as supermarkets and imported stuff is more expensive than UK supermarket prices.

Everything works at this airport the trains planes buses and shuttles. Shopping is very good. There is improvement/refurbishment going on airside to make it even better? The only negative was a very long walk after immigration to reach your gate I like the idea of security check near the boarding area as this reduces the massive bottleneck at the start of your journey.

As others have noted there is some walking required - but I don't understand people's insistence that when travelling 10000km they should not have to walk a single pace without some kind of mechanical assistance.

As an Asian would prefer to have Asian food available at the Airport but there seems no choice for this except for a sushi place which is very crowded at that time. The place looks like a mess due to the renovation and we have to walk quite far via a narrow and dark corridor to a more decent area for transit (the Holland Boulevard) to do some last minute duty free shopping.

Another important thing was plentiful and clean toilets. Signage was also a pig plus: clear and often. The building despite being huge Is nice and well kept. Boarding process was also ok. Security search was way too thorough but this is for our own sake.

Security was very fast think they even upscaled a bit for the expected traffic due to Christmas. Unfortunately there was no time left to grab a bite or do some Christmas shopping but airport has sufficient places for that. In the past I have experienced once or twice (in my case <5% of times traveled through the airport) 45 minute wait for the luggage which was too long don't know what happened there the other occasion customs took too long but apparently it was a sudden peak and it took some time to call some extra staff. These two occasions however are not representing the overall performance. The walking distance are normally fine you can be unlucky when you have a stopover and need to go from H peer to B that will take a good twenty minutes.

It may be big but it is never a real chore to walk from one point to another and in many trips through the airport I have perhaps fortunately not found myself seriously having to race from one flight to another. The shops the bars and restaurants are generally of a very high standard as are the lounges and staff are generally very pleasant. I have but one criticism and that is security for flights to the UK. On my outward journey last week security check for the leg to Helsinki was fair and thorough but just a common ordinary security check; on the return journey from Amsterdam to Aberdeen the security was oppressive and obtrusive. Some staff were thoroughly unpleasant process was slow and perhaps amusingly and reassuringly the captain was forced to go through the scanner three times before he was allowed to board the flight. Nevertheless I find it strange that flights to the UK should be so much more thoroughly checked than others. Are we a greater risk or at greater risk or is this just a reaction to our not being members of the common border agreement in the EU?

This September I departed from Schiphol four times. 3 times Schengen lounge and 1 time intercontinental. I have to say that Schiphol is becoming more and more outdated and is rapidly losing ground with major Asian competitors like HKG SIN and Seoul Incheon and Munich and Madrid in Europe. It's overcrowded congested not passenger friendly and the terminal buildings are getting old and claustrophobic. During peak times going through security on the Schengen side is like standing in line in Disney world with endless waiting cues. One time it took me over 40 minutes to pass security. For the first time I noticed how dirty it became especially the dining area above the Schengen departure hall. All tables were full of dirty plates left behind for several hours without cleaning. Food choice was also very poor. The staff tends to be arrogant and non service minded. I am also surprised how uninviting the immigration area is. A small dark corner when entering the Netherlands. Baggage claim is terrible small long wait and sometimes I feel as If I'm on a marketplace with no space at all to move. Usual wait lasts more then 30 minutes for baggage to unload and counting.

The one-terminal concept is a major selling point for this airport but the airport is too large for this concept to be viable. The last time I used Schiphol the planes landed on and took off from the Polderbarn runway and this added about 20 -30 minutes to the overall journey time. Both the incoming and return flights involved a lengthy trek to Gate E. Baggage handling was fine on this occasion but is not reliable.

AMS has a few construction projects it seems. Very long immigration queue due to only 3 checkpoints for non-EU passports and one EU passports counter open in a dark unwelcoming area. The few open counters are not enough at all when the flights from SQ Delta and CX are arriving at the same time (and many others)! I was through quickly as have EU passport but my friend had to wait nearly 30 minutes. Baggage delivered quickly. I love the great connectivity of AMS to trains bus taxi etc. On our return flight check-in very quick and no problem but again very very long queue for passport control there were two queues only for non EU passengers and one for EU passengers - my friend was waiting 45 minutes myself 30 minutes!

I was travelling to Manchester from Antalya along with hundreds of other people. Some people were travelling to different countries such as Holland Russia Germany. There simply is no queuing system. Everybody chooses anywhere where they can have their luggage and passports and tickets scanned. It doesn't matter where you are travelling to or what time you just pick your own check in point. This may sound ideal but believe me it isn't. If your flight it due in an hours time from check in then you will be very lucky to get on your flight. After checking In you then are scanned. Then you have to have your passport checked again. Believe me this was so traumatic!!! All nationalities were pushing and squeezing to get their passports checked. There were thousands of people some who only had ten minutes to get on their plane before take off. There must have been only 3 or 4 people to check all these thousands of people's passports. Travellers were becoming irate distressed and someone with a weak heart could easily have collapsed. There needs to be a much better system. I will never use this airport until I hear the system has improved. Somebody could have been very seriously hurt or even worse. Children were crying people were shouting at each other and the workers checking the passports were extremely stressed out.

Very full flight for the cricket so had to queue to ages to clear through immigration. Not helped by the fact that 2 young ladies didn’t know where their accommodation was (why are they so fussy about this?) and one inebriated passenger had lost his passport. Porters were very pushy and hard to get rid of. Departed on 3 Nov - a nightmare. Flights were very full and so there were long queues to check in not helped by the fact there are no self service machines. None of the ATMs at the airport or the nearby Bank of Antigua were working so we ended up having to borrow money off other passengers to pay our departure tax. Not sure what this tax is for given the woeful state of the airport. Again long queues for immigration – perhaps they were wary of our NZ passports? Very few shops not enough seats café inadequate.

I seen the airport evolve for the last thirty years into a very nice compact and efficient operation. Everything is laid out in a logical sequence. You arrive into a small check-in area as there are still less than a half dozen or so carriers that use it go through a quick and orderly screening area and up to the gates. There are various shops to include a regional Asturias gift shop stores transportation outlets and the such. Public areas are clean and not crowded by any means. There is the typical cafe with lots of room and reasonable pricing. We found taxis right outside the terminal along with two bays for ALSA busses running to both Oviedo and Gijon.

On arrival you must take a small shuttle bus to the domestic terminal and the ground transportation centre if you need a regional hotel or downtown shuttle van. Try getting 3 heavy suitcases on and off this small and crowded bus. I have never been to an airport with such an inconvenient and insufficient system. The airport should permit pick-ups at the international terminal! Otherwise I found Immigration and Customs to be fast and friendly compared to my last trip.

When arriving if you need to catch a regional shuttle (Groome Transportation) to another city such as Columbus Ga. or Macon Ga. you must first get on a small airport bus that takes you to ground transportation located in the domestic terminal. It is very inconvenient especially with several suitcases. I have never seen an airport with such a system. Regional shuttles should be permitted to pick up passengers at the international terminal. Also when exiting the international terminal there are no signs indicating how to get to downtown Atlanta or other areas. The signs only say I-75 North I-75 South and I-285. This is confusing.

First there is only one place to eat in the departure level outside the security check point. It is rather small and often crowded. Second the customs area is too small to handle all incoming flights. Customs officials are rude and bark orders to arriving passengers. Third to catch MARTA or regional shuttles you have to get on a shuttle bus to go to the domestic terminal and ground transportation. That means lugging your heavy luggage onto a shuttle bus.

ATL is easy to navigate and you do not have to go outside to change terminals. The down side of this airport is international arrivals as you are required to recheck and claim your luggage and go through a security checkpoint before exiting the airport.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,John Doe,United States,2011-01-14,"This airport has it's good and it's bad points. From the point of view of arriving at this airport it is mediocre at best. Once off the plane you frantically search for the baggage claim signs. This could be improved upon greatly. Once getting downstairs to the shuttles between concourses you are rushed to the baggage claim efficiently. The rental car facilities are well maintained and usually staffed. Leaving the rental car facility is simple then you enter and head directly into the hell that is baggage check-in. If you are fortunate carry-on you are in luck not much waiting. Typically we travel with odd engineering tools which can be a hassel to explain to TSA ""agents"" who apparently moonlight as Walmart employees. So a carry-on is usually in favor. When you approach the desk and I've only struggled with Delta check-in agents are often discourteous. Many stand around under signs which indicate that terminal is open and when you approach them they are quick to inform you to choose another line. The lines are long because only one person usually checks bags per every 25 people standing in line. Once through this heading for security is simple. There are many places to chop and eat both inside and outside security. The frustration here is their ""expert traveler"" security point. Located at the end of the hall quite often you get stragglers who miss the main security gate. I have no problem spending a few minutes in security if means I get home safely. My frustration is with those who are completely unprepared and think the world has to wait on them. Once through heading to your gate is simple - at the gate the shops and eateries throughout the concourses. But there isn't enough seating in the gate area for those on each plane. Often crowds and lines form into the main aisle putting you harms way of being run over with impatient shuttle (golf cart) drivers chauffeuring loads of elderly and morbidly obese people. Grab something to eat if there's room and if you have time to stand in line. Do some shopping or find a seat four gates away.

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,2012-09-10,Last used ten days ago when returning from Brisbane. I agree with parts of most of the latest reviews although from this first page you would think people are talking about two completely different airports! Yes it is a long walk to/from either Gates 14/15 (Virgin Australia or the A380s) and also those at the end of the main pier (9 10 etc) and I was surprised that there is no travelator in the main pier (possibly because the corridor is a bit too narrow to safely install one). However the entry through the carved Maori gate with accompanying music is far superior to any other airport I've ever seen. I too resent having to walk through the duty-free shops to reach Immigration but Smartgate makes up for that - kiosk and photo took no more than 60 seconds. MAF was no problem and I was outside 25 minutes after leaving the aircraft. Departure had also been easy - short queue to drop my bag as I had checked in on-line although again there is the long walk to the far gates.

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Adrian Jenkins,New Zealand,2012-09-06,Auckland Airport is my home airport and is usually a pleasure to pass through it. The check-in area is spacious and I've never waited too long to check-in. Upstairs and airside there are a wide range of shops. Yes - the prices are high in some eateries but that's common in many airports around the world. Sure the walk to/from the farthest gates is quite long but no worse than other big airports. Arriving it's lovely to have Maori music playing beside the big Maori carving gate. The path through to the immigration gates between the two duty-free stores is now much clearer than it used to be. As a New Zealand passport holder I can make use of the Smartgate system - so quick and easy. Auckland Airport does now have a hotel right beside the international terminal which is great for those people with early departures or with long layovers. Granted this is not a 'transit hotel' as such as you have to go through immigration but true 'transit hotels' are few and far between in airports around the world (Singapore & Dubai being two notable exceptions.). One major down point I will accept is that there is no train service to Auckland Airport. The Auckland Council is thinking about changing this but it could be some years away yet. There's also no direct road from the airport to the city. You have to connect between two motorways via city streets (with traffic lights).,NA,NA,NA,9,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,2010-10-10,Check-in very quick and painless as I had checked-in online. One great thing about Auckland is that because it has fewer international flights than most comparably sized cities elsewhere in the world there is not the major panic to get through Emigration and Security to make sure that you don't miss your flight. Result - a much smoother transition with staff who are generally smiling and friendly. As I live fairly close to the airport I don't normally bother eating there although prices don't appear too much worse than in the city (certainly not the eye-gouging 500-600% markup I saw in Russia). The only criticism I would make airside as I have before is that it's a very long walk to Gates 15 and 16 and that more than one short travelator would be welcomed by most. Returning was easy for me - although there were quite long queues at Immigration I was directed to the new SmartGate as I have an e-Passport. Through and done in under a minute - brilliant! Luggage was already waiting on the conveyor and I was through MAF screening and out in the concourse in just a few minutes.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points.

No open banking facilities in evidence which is poor. Return flight more problematic Check-in is on the first floor and escalator not working so had to carry cases upstairs to check-in area. There is then an initial document check before actual check-in - relatively slow. Passport Control was ok and completed quickly. Once in the Departures Area not much open at 02:00 in the morning.

Security can be very very slow if there are a few flights departing at around the same time (Christmas-time is usually a nightmare). It's then that you realise that queue-forming is not high on the agenda in this neck of the woods. The moral then becomes -""if you can't beat them....."". The toilets are poor. Not very clean and the toilet paper supplied (if at all) resembles rolled-up tree bark! Just what you need before a 6 hour flight - NOT!. Never any soap or anything to dry your hands on either. Duty Free is basic but some things are cheap compared to Europe.

However within a 2 hour timeframe both Virgin and Jetstar operate their 180-seaters into and out of the airport which causes it to almost reach breaking point. The departure lounge isn't in any way big enough to cater for a full flight and the ventilation leaves a bit to be desired. The ground crew from all airlines were friendly enough and the cafe wasn't too bad. However when comparing Ballina the second largest market out of Sydney to other regional airports like Albury Dubbo Newcastle and Canberra it really is sub-par.

bandar-seri-begawan-airport,/airport-reviews/bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Bandar Seri Begawan Airport customer review,Edmund Carew,NA,2007-08-08,A dreary airport that is showing its 33 year old age. Even the tropical fish tank lacked the illustrated number of species. Upon transiting between SIN and SYD with a five and a half hour stopover I paid $25 for an unexciting city tour. At 2000hrs passengers were called to the departure lounge for the 2105 BI flight to SYD. After placing our handcarry through the X-Ray machine transit passengers - about 15 to 20 - all had duty free liqour purchased at airports such as SIN and DXB confiscated. Many passengers repeatedly argued with the airport police and a so- called 'supervisor' to no avail. I spoke later with a senior staff member of Royal Brunei Airlines who claimed he had not heard of dutyfree liqour being confiscated but agreed that it was exempt from the February 2007 introduction at many airports of a '100ml individual one litre total' rule for handcarry liquids aerosols and gels. No RBA staff member offered to assist at Brunei Airport. The airline has since informed me that it is receiving many complaints from passengers and that those affected should write to it whereby claims will be forwarded to its Brunei head office for consideration for compensation. The arrogant Brunei Airport staff claimed that the liquor bottles would be broken : some wags interpreted this to mean the seals would be broken in private parties or that the liqour would be resold on the black market. One English couple lost an expensive bottle of Scotch and as usual many passengers were purchasing liqour as gifts for relatives and friends not for their personal consumption. Presumably this scam occurs with every flight that has transit passengers. It must net such officials a veritable mountain of spirits each year. Avoid this airport should you have purchased duty free liqour elsewhere. I did not observe whether cigarettes or perfumes were similarly confiscated.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

They don't stop at examining whether you have a visa for the country you are proceeding to. I was asked why I was flying out of Bangalore when I have taken most of my previous flights out of Chennai. Every passenger was being asked for the return ticket which is something that is never asked for in Chennai. I always buy one way tickets because my programme is variable and my departure airport is never fixed in advance. On a previous occasion when I was flying BLR-SIN on a one way ticket I was denied immigration clearance for a long time till I told them that I could open my computer and book a return ticket on the spot. I told them that nowadays even the entry airports at foreign countries don't ask for a return ticket. My explanations seemed to infuriate the officer who started raising his voice and it was only the timely intervention of a senior officer who had come to investigate why the queue was not moving that I finally got through immigration.

Over time people will forget about the old airport and will factor the distance to the new airport into their overall journey.

The city bus transfer is clearly signposted and very efficient with around 8 different routes into the city departing every 20mins or so. My journey to/from Indiranagar took just over an hour on all occasions. The airport itself is finally the first international standard airport in India (I haven't been to the new airport in HYD) with decent shops the Kingfisher bar cafes lots of immigration and security queus and clean tiolets! My personal overall experience was very positive. The only issue I could see was with the size of the international departure lounge. My BA 747 was full and the 350 passengers took up around half of the available seats in the international departure area. I imagine that at around midnight when AF LH TG SQ and KL all operate 777s or A330s that the departure area will be bursting at its seams.

There's even a 7-11 selling the usual fair for those wanting a cheap snack or drink.

This meant getting off and back on same flight. On arrival we headed to transit and came across airport staff holding a card with our flight number who directed us to a certain area except when we got to that area we got sent back the other way. Very annoying. Only two queues for security checks so took ages. When I showed boarding pass to staff they couldn't see where I was going and rudely asked ""where you going"" once passed security check and at gate further searching of hand luggage this resource would have been better used at having more security X-ray lines open.

Very large airport - lots of long walks even with the people movers. Arrival experience very good with luggage arriving almost as soon as we were at the baggage belts. Transit on 8th June was more problematic. We were given a sticker to wear when checking in at Koh Smui and at Bangkok were to follow signs showing the same symbol as our sticker. Only problem was that some of the signage is far from clear several staff who we asked were unsure one even directing us to the right gate but to where arrivals were processed when we eventually found the right route 300 people were kept locked out of the gate and had to stand or sit on the floor in a corridor.

I agree that sometimes delays going through immigration can be lengthy; so I travel into BKK business class and am fast tracked through the arrival procedures.

Queues for Passport/Immigration have become ridiculous. Earlier this year the queues zig-zagged out of the arrivals hall and down the ramp. Thought this was a one off issue having used the airport many times previously and never experienced any real problems. Not so. It is now the norm. Took in excess of 1 hour 30 mins in queues on both occasions just to get to the Immigration/Passport desk. Once at the desk all formalities completed in a couple of minutes. The reason for the huge queues is that very few Immigration desks are manned. Officers are employed to look at the queues and then disappear only to emerge minutes later to do the same again. eparting was so much faster. A real breeze. It appears that BKK is heavily promoting the paid for fast track arrivals coupon for THB850. I'll avoid BKK and go elsewhere rather than endure such nonsense again.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2013-11-12,I think reviews of this airport depend on arriving or departing. I've rarely had difficulties flying out of Bangkok although I do make sure I'm there well in advance of my flight times. This is a very busy airport and always seems crowded due in my opinion to the lack of seating which leads to people walking up and down the concourse while waiting for their gates to be confirmed the duty free is very expensive and most of the shops seem to offer the same range of goods. The choice of food is quite good although the eating area again tend to get very crowded as people linger long after they've finished their meals just to have somewhere to sit. As all my flights are with Qatar I know which gates are usually used I have a Qatar Privilege Club Silver card so I can check in at the business counter and usually get a fast track pass and invitation to one of the Thai business lounges. Perhaps I'm just lucky in the fact that Qatar seem to have very efficient ground staff it's a pity they can't organise the arrivals also.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

The airport is functional and if you are lucky like me immigration can be quite fast (less then 5 min on the last few occasions). However without access to a lounge you can't expect many amenities only bare bones seating areas. Other modern airports in the region such as SIN KUL HG and ICN are way ahead of BKK in terms of customer amenities.

Still relatively new as far as infrastructure goes and plenty of facilities to keep one distracted during a long wait. The building itself is rather monolithic and therefore lacks the bright and airy feel of terminals like HKG and the arrivals concourse can seem rather stark. My only two gripes with this airport are: air- conditioning. It never seems to be working properly and queuing at immigration outwards and inwards. Individual queues in front of each counter is a hopeless set-up. It is frustratingly slow to the point of desperation. I wonder why they haven't set up a single queue and have the first available counter call the next person in line. Also the officers at the counters processing Thai passports only when they have cleared their queues are happy to just sit and let the foreign passport queues swell.

Things must have moved on quite a bit since October because the airside waiting areas at the gates seemed adequate with four wide-bodies on the stands and no sign of overcrowding. Improvements could be made in the way that check-in queues are managed with handling agent staff positioned at the entry to the queues rather than down at the desk end. On the second occasion I used the airport the signage above the desks clashed with airline information displayed on the monitors above them and resulted in some annoyance among people in the wrong queues - hence the comment about need for agents at the tail end of a queue. The public address system could also be improved (they REALLY need a good sound engineer to sort out the audio). There also seems to be a problem with the way airlines access the PA system. It would be better if there was a single person making all the announcements. That would reduce the variation in announcement ""styles"" (some barely decipherable) and techniques (some too close to the microphone and some to far away) and would ensure that all announcements were aired. One last improvement would be the change of access to the business lounge so that it was from airside rather than landside. That would make it a much more relaxing place because users would already be through security and not have to judge when to join the security queue so that they would be on time for boarding. I suppose the down side of that would be that the lounge would need to be bigger to accommodate a greater number of users. Overall a fairly average airport experience that will improve once the building is completed.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,C Rogers,Ireland,2015-05-20,Have travelled extensively all over the world and this was the worst airport experience I've had. Completely out of control queues for passport control. No staff assisting with these passengers starting arguments with each other due to stress. Missed my flight due to these queues. First time in my life to miss a flight. Arrived in reasonable time. Feel it was due to poor staffing and organisation of airport that this happened. I am sure a lot of people missed flights today.

The business lounge was spacious and nice with plenty of seating. The biggest problem with this airport is the traffic to city centre. If you are flying low cost airlines there is a direct train (not as frequent and does feel like an airport express although for the price one shouldn't complain). However for all other airlines (if you are using the better and new terminal) you will have to get a free bus outside terminal 2 to terminal 1 and then a short walk to the train station.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,Eddie Buckle,NA,2009-09-23,I find Barcelona airport somewhat confusing. Coming in from Berlin we followed the sign from the gate for Schengen arrivals only to walk up to a locked door so it was back the other way to wave passports at somewhat bemused passport officers. Then you discover there are signs to three possible baggage delivery areas in Terminal 2 and have to peer at small screens to discover where yours will end up. Driving back to the airport we found ourselves going round in a circle after filling up the hire car - you get to a crossroads and have to guess and we guessed wrong. Once inside check-in was quick enough though there seem to be only very small departure screens to work out which desks you have to go to.

beauvais-airport,/airport-reviews/beauvais-airport,Beauvais Airport customer review,Mark Wadham,NA,2008-11-18,This once great little airport has outgrown itself. When there were just 2 or 3 flights a day this airport was a pleasure to use. The problem is that there are now many flights and further expansion is planned. This would be fine if the facilities were developed in parallel. I arrived one hour before my flight having checked-in online to find the car parks at near saturation point. A helpful attendant invited me to leave my car at the end of a row but outside a normal parking space. In the terminal there was a very long queue to go through passport control & security. This was because insufficient staff were on duty for the number of passengers. This is inexcusable as surely the authorities must know the number of passengers expected beforehand. it also represents a loss for the airport as many passengers - myself included no longer had time to visit the shops. Although at the airport one hour before the flight I only boarded 10 minutes before departure due to these inadequacies. The other major problem at this airport is access. If your destination/departure point is Paris there's no problem. If it's anywhere else there is virtually no other choice than to use a car and be subjected to the monopolistic practices of using the airport car parks. There is a bus to Beauvais but its infrequency is as good as to render it useless. This airport needs to invest fast in additional parking quicker security and larger departure lounges. The bus service to Beauvais needs to be increased to at least one bus per hour to allow the surrounding communities to benefit from what is after all Beauvais airport rather than Paris airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On the flight back check-in was fast (we arrived 90 minutes early and they had 2 lines open). Security was also fast. But then came a nightmare- they have 4 gates and there are no screens that tell you where your flight will be. They are all very close together so that in our cast there were about 400 people wondering where they have to line up. Shortly before boarding they tell you where to go but you are squeezed in all the time- very unpleasant and stupid because they could change that easily. Also the bard at the gates take advantage of the new security measures and sell a 05 l bottle of water at 3€. More than next to the Eiffel tower!

There was no problem with this so I suspect that it often happens. Given the huge size of this airport I cannot understand why planes are still parked away from the terminal and buses used to convey passengers with the inevitable free-for-all. For the return trip I was accompanied by a Chinese guide so the check-in procedure was very smooth. It took about five minutes so there was no sense in having to arrive three hours before departure.

They need bigger notice boards to say where your flights are checking in. A long way to go to the aircraft via a train which doesn't hold near enough people. Returning to Beijing is a absolute shambles. Clearing customs can take a long time as they don't have enough customs windows open and you can wait forever if 3-4 flights arrive at once.

Beijing Airport is a pleasant and modern airport albeit one that feels a bit like a huge empty cavern. Free WiFi is available. However you need to register in person at the Business Center or a few other airport locations to get a user ID and PIN code that you then need to submit via a rather user- unfriendly web page. Apart from the cumbersome activation procedure I have no complaints about the WiFi service. The staff are generally polite and efficient despite their limited command of English. However there need to be more dining options within T3; currently there is little else aside from a Chinese  Pizza Hut and a bunch of cafes.

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,G Davis,United States,2010-02-22,T3 - Lots of great shops and places to eat. The Air China Business Class lounge is the best lounge I have been in. There is a little hotel at gate E-10 (all the gates for international flights are the E gates in this terminal). It has mini rooms with no windows that you can rent by the hour or even overnight. Caution - when you arrive if you are connecting internationally and already have your boarding pass or want to go rest in the hotel do not follow the crowd down the escalator after customs. This leads you out of the terminal and to baggage claim via a train. If you do accidentally get to the train just take it to the main terminal and then don't get off. It will take you back to the E terminal where you will have to clear a new set of customs and security to get back into the gate area.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,M Bates,NA,2009-02-16,The new Beijing Capital Terminal 3 is architecturally fantastic especially from the air. The check-in area is huge and not too crowded and generally easy to navigate and I have always found the check-in process to be reasonably smooth whether for domestic or international flights. However things go downhill from there. Although the check-in area is huge all the passengers are congregated into one smallish area for access to the gates. Domestic passengers have it easy in that once through the security check the gates are right there in the same building as the ground side area. But as in the old terminals at this airport it seems like the airport authority likes to bus as many passengers as possible to remote stands which is simply ridiculous in a modern airport. It is even more ridiculous when you are on the bus looking at the airport with most of the gates unoccupied and all the planes parked a mile or so away on remote stands. I have travelled on domestic flights through this terminal eight times since it opened last year and only once have been to a proper gate. As for the international passengers all have to go down two escalators to a train that is often broken. You then get transported out to the furthest of the three buildings at the end of the dragon (the intermediate building is not in operation yet) where you then immediately go into the passport control and tiny queuing areas for security. Once through into the airside terminal be sure to have a jacket as it is always about 10C in that building. There are lots of glitzy shops to spend money in but almost nowhere to eat. For such a grand project there are so many small problems with this airport that could have been fixed with just a little thought. Regardless of this it is still 100 times better than the two other decrepit terminals at this airport.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

beirut-airport,/airport-reviews/beirut-airport,Beirut Airport customer review,N Vanian,NA,2008-01-24,Beirut International Airport is more than capable of handling the influx of visitors this summer. With the recent opening of the western wing of the airport it now has a total of 24 gates which means it can accommodate 24 planes at a time. The opening of this wing has increased to 40 the number of passport security counters. Obstacles in the air transport sector had been lifted in an effort to boost tourism and as of this year private charter airlines are allowed to operate from Beirut. The Lebanese government has licensed 11 Lebanese-based companies as passenger charter carriers. These new charters will work with Lebanese tour operators but will fly routes on which MEA does not operate. I am sure the industry can carry the weight of competition. A total of 45 airlines now operate out of the BIA the newest one from the Gulf including Oman Air. The fact that most visitors can buy a tourist visa on arrival at the airport is added incentive to travel to Lebanon.

Belfast International used to be a lovely airport a real pleasure to travel out of. These days however the feeling you get as you walk through the door is that they want to squeeze every penny they can out of you. For a start most of the seating has disappeared only to re appear in the food outlet area so now to sit down you either have to be at the airport first thing or buy overpriced food. Add to this a £1 charge to pick up or set down £1 for a trolley and £1 to use a smoking room. I found security to be ok not as friendly as Heathrow but certainly not as bad as Newark. I found that the servisair people were quite rude I stood at the servisair booth for 10 mins before one of them acknowledged me and asked me to wait.

belfast-airport,/airport-reviews/belfast-airport,Belfast Airport customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2011-09-29,Small changes (yet again) from my last trip through. There is a new food area called 'fed and watered’ where 'Rankins' used to be (nice but usual airport high prices). Also after leaving security you are deposited into the recently refurbished original food court area looks nicer but is still over-priced. My personal impression of security (see previous reviews) was a little better than usual on this trip but only just and from observing interaction with other travellers it's still poor. The term 'officious' in previous reviews reflects my experience of security well in general. The web site shows that the current round of investment has now finished so that unlike the last few years the airport probably won't change layout every couple of months. Finally I have neglected to mention before my experience on return. UK boarder control has been excellent and the baggage hits the carrousel very quickly.

Just a little this time although thankfully for the better overall. Check-in was a breeze despite there being a number or flights checking in at the same time. Security however was the usual story. The officials that check documents before entering the main security area are polite friendly and efficient. However after this the lines in the main security section despite being short were painfully slow. Only 1 male and 1 female member present at the scanners meaning that if anyone set off the detector the queue was held up for people of the same gender for some time with chaotic reorganising of the line to sort it out. Staff were also as abrupt and surly as ever. After this though the latest reconfiguration of the departure lounge was actually quite good.

belfast-airport,/airport-reviews/belfast-airport,Belfast Airport customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2010-10-17,Since my last trip earlier this year it has changed again. The long stay car park cost me about £25 for one week earlier this year - now £40. There is also now a £1 drop off fee for anyone getting a lift to the airport once you have turned off the main road in to the airport grounds it is a 1 way system and you are committed to driving through the system with no way of avoiding a charge of some description! Once inside the terminal the landside is the same as it has been since the changes started to be made. After the security check the airside has changed a lot. There is little space to relax now with far too much emphasis being placed on trying to ring money out of passengers though the retail outlets. Apart from a couple of rows of seating in the middle of the departure lounge all other space and seating has been given over to food and shop outlets. All in all travelling through Belfast International seems to become worse with each visit. There is no thought given to making it a nice experience travelling through and instead all changes are geared to shoehorning in more retail units. Since the start of redevelopment I've seen no changes that really the improve passenger experience.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
belfast-airport,/airport-reviews/belfast-airport,Belfast Airport customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2010-04-12,Security staff could learn how to provide their service with a little more friendliness. I've never found them rude as such but from time to time a little abrupt. As the airport is in transition from old to new it's hard to give a real opinion as the last few times I've been it's been different on each visit. On the plus side the new bits are clean and bright. On the minus they have lost the great charm of the old airport and the addition of the new shop units in the airside section (that until recently was landside) now cover what little window area there was. I like airports that let you see the planes taking off and landing. The viewing gallery has been gone for some time now sadly closed but still there. No real change to the function of the airport and the passengers ability to pass through that is genuinely noticeable so for me what is mainly cosmetic change may look more modern but it has lost as many points of charm as it has gained in modern appeal. The only real gripe that I think would be the same for most would be the quality of food and its price! Starbucks is the only reasonable place to go. Inbound the walk from baggage reclaim to the exit is a little anonymous by that I mean you walk along a few blank empty corridors that leave you wondering if you've taken a wrong turn! Not a bad airport but room for improvement and I think the planners need to recognise this place had a charm and it shouldn't be buried in a drive to have a bright white clinical looking new layout.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Had the flight departed on time then there should be just enough to keep most people entertained enough prior to boarding. Security staff were OK to pleasant enough in contrast to my last visit. Although oddly despite checking in online it took a while at the airline check in counter as they printed our parties boarding passes again as apparently security prefer the ""proper"" ones that the check in desk produces. The only gripe but it's a fairly big one was that on return we were practically thrown out of the terminal with a group of other passengers as despite our plane only touching down at 9.15 we had to be collected by bus from the plane though immigration collect our bags and be out of the terminal and off the property by 10.00! The lady who came out to shoo us all out wasn't really that polite about it either and with our party and 1 of the others having passengers in wheelchairs this process is a little more time consuming. On going outside to the drop off/pick up area to await our lift we were then told again (a little more friendly this time) by a man that we'd better be quick as there would soon be someone going passed to lock up the main entrance/exit gate! The lady had said they were closing at 10.00 and repeated that they aren't a 24hr operation that's fine but its not a reason to close the whole terminal and throw everyone out on the street so abruptly.",NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Security was pretty slow with only one lane open but when a queue started to form they opened another lane however only had one metal detector running which led to the inevitable bottleneck! Had a reasonable lunch in the bush mills bar with a light lunch for two coming to just under £20. As with all airports these days there is an acute lack of seating upstairs most of the seats seem to be within the 'harvest market' restaurant.

It took less than 20 minutes to travel from the Europa Bus Centre to being dropped outside the terminal building. The bus was clean near empty and the ticket only cost £2.20. On arrival the airport seemed very clean and was quiet. The terminal was also full of natural light which I thought was quite impressive.

Flew from and returned to the airport on a domestic flight. Security wasn't too bad. Duties were dispensed efficiently enough on a Sunday evening. Although as usual a little more smile and basic customer service wouldn't go amiss they were a far cry from the surly folks of the international airport. Once airside I was impressed by the improvements. What was once a small airport is now a small airport that feels a good deal bigger with facilities that punch above the weight of its small stature. Only problem is that from departures all flight board first through doors A B or C and then on to the gate number.

Put in its simplest format you've got the entrance hall departures lounge and arrivals/baggage so essentially 3 large halls all directly connected. Unlike the International airport (Aldergrove) it has a few skyways to allow you to walk to the plane without exposure to the elements. The range of shops is good to (for the airport size).

Arrival not too bad - luckily we were the only plane landing - but still took 15 mins for luggage. Departure currently a sham - as others say new drop off point a long walk from the terminal including crossing the main airport road. Into the terminal and prior to airside only a costa coffee - and many flights on this day check in opened only 60 mins prior to departure so a bit crowded and chaotic. Security queues painfully slow and airside overcrowded and uncomfortable. On ground level just a WHS small duty free and 2 cafes. Only 4 doors to gates and as budget airlines using airport watching the scum to get to plane reminds you of a third world airport. Only 2 small sets of toilets - the ladies was out of order at one and gents dirty. There is a cafe upstairs now that was a bit quieter - but very expensive - Â£1.75 for a small water.

A reasonable selection of Duty Free shops and cafe airside.

Arrival was ridiculously slow because of the passport scrutiny. Of course they've got to be checked but how slow? This is the EU! Once through there was no luggage delay. Departure check-in was the fastest anywhere. Food at 'Cindy's' was reasonably priced and a super-fresh salad was available late in the evening. The airport was spotless and being continuously cleaned while we were there. Security was quick but the real downer was the queue for passport checks. I couldn't believe this could be so slow but it became clear that any non-white had to have their passports scrutinised much more carefully and slowly. This looked like overt discrimination.

Pre Booked car park meant a short walk to check in hall check in was relatively painless  I was worried about the security queues but we went through in about 10 mins (Thursday midday) even the security operator mentioned about how quiet it was. It's like Manchester now as you have to fight your way through duty free but on the other side there's plenty of seats and shops/restaurants.

Birmingham is a lovely airport not small but not huge. Every thing you need is there and the shops in departures are normal not just high end over priced clothes and hand bags!

birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2010-08-17,Birmingham Airport seems to be going down the road of ripping customers off at every opportunity. Firstly you have to pay £1 just to drop someone off. They charge Â£3 per 15 minutes if you dare take more than 15 mins at the drop-off area. It used to be free but according to one of the police officers at the airport due to anti-terror measures the charges were brought in along with a new drop-off area. The airport luggage trollies cost £1 (you don't get your £1 back). The plastic bags cost £1 at the security point. Upon arrival at the airport baggage always takes about an hour to arrive in the baggage reclaim area and you are stung again for a £1 luggage trolley.

blackpool-airport,/airport-reviews/blackpool-airport,Blackpool Airport customer review,A Roberts,United Kingdom,2011-09-20,A basic and small airport which although advantageous at times is also its downfall. On the third time of flying out of here recently myself and my family were booked on one of the two flights scheduled to depart at the same time this showed how inadequate this airport is at handling more than one flight. The sole cafe in the departure was overwhelmed to a point where the lack of staff meant they could only offer bacon/sausage/egg barms instead of the other breakfast offerings such as a Full English. It is unacceptable that the facilities are not geared to cope with more than one flight. The second criticism is the car park. Spaces are effectively unmarked and in bad condition the overflow car park to the side of the terminal building is a large lawn with some tarmac for cars to drive along. The £10 Airport Development Fee - I am struggling to see how this could be justified there is little evidence of this having been spent since its implementation and little/no evidence of development plans with this money.

WiFi in the whole airport is free but very poor the cafes and restaurants don't have their own WiFi zones. There are no options to buy pre-paid SIM cards for the major operators at the airport.

At about 3pm when most of the flights to Europe are checking in the departure hall was so full it was almost impossible to move. When I checked in with Iberia they explained that I had already paid the airport tax on my ticket but I'd have to get an exemption stamp from the airport tax office. This meant another queue for at least 30 minutes; but if I was willing to pay the tax for a second time I could have done so immediately. This just seemed to be a way of extracting extra cash from people willing to pay not to stand in another long queue!

The latter was really bad when I travelled through a few weeks ago. I think they must be in the process of upgrading it, or building it altogether! Presently its like a DIY airport made out of Ikea flatpack. When you check in you have to take your bags round to a separate desk for them to be tagged and sent to the plane. This created a pretty chaotic and busy environment. The queue for security was long and merged with the queues for the bag drop area. Once through security there were more queues that snake round the shopping section whilst people wait to go through immigration and the boarding areas for the flights. This means that its impossible to look round the retail area and food areas. It was all so chaotic and such a muddle! I'd hate to think what it'll be like once peak season kicks in. As i said, i think they're in the process of constructing this terminal, which is called the 'billi' terminal, as it had a very temporary feel to it.

bournemouth-airport,/airport-reviews/bournemouth-airport,Bournemouth Airport customer review,L Joyce,United Kingdom,2014-07-27,I know that the security info for airports from the government must change on a daily basis however the people who work at Bournemouth International Airport clearly don't want their jobs if recent experience is anything to go by. I have had the experience of this by flying out of there twice in a month. Once to Ibiza in June with Ryannair and I have just got back from Corfu flying with Thomson. I remember the days of Bath Travel when flying from Bournemouth was such a luxury. Having an airport not ten minutes away from your home and with happy smiling people was such a novelty. Since it has been sold to Manchester Airports I have noticed a very big decline in Customer Service. Lets start with the airport itself. To pay £2.50 for half an hour drop off is just a rip off and encourages people to be dropped off at the road before the airport. In the grand scheme of things £2.50 is not a lot but when hardly any other airport in Britain does this it makes you feel that you are somehow being scammed. The toilets are fine but there is simply not enough of them especially when it comes to last minute. I do like the Duty Free shop and the WH Smith the cafe is also fine and very clean with a wide range of dishes. When I flew to Ibiza in June I had my trusty clear sandwich bag which I have used at Gatwick various terminals at Heathrow and Southampton. This wasn't an issue here. Fast forward three weeks later to last week where I was stopped and told that my clear bag was too big and I needed to buy one of their bags for £1. (Gatwick and Heathrow hand these bags out for free so yes another way for Bournemouth to make money out of you). When I tried to say that I had used it three weeks before and it was fine the security guy simply told me that the other person shouldn't have let me through. I get the feeling that it depends which jobsworth you have on that day. Now my real reason for deciding to complain is the fact that Bournemouth airport offers online check in. We had reserved seats for both flights but checked in anyway to print the boarding passes. 20 minutes later I have filled in all their questions online with our details etc however unlike the big airports they don't offer a 'bag drop which I wasn't aware of and isn't mentioned online and which also meant that we still had to queue for 40 minutes and then a further 20 minutes at the check in desk while the Check in Clerk weighed our bags hand luggage checked our passports and documents even though we had already printed out our boarding passes. All this was done without a word or a smile. I don't see the point in offering a 'check in online' service if you still have to go through the usual process. The airport is simply too small and the airlines cannot be bothered to provide enough staff I am afraid that this has turned me back to the biggies or even Southampton. The only advantage to this airport is that it is so close to home. I will happily travel the distance to Gatwick again.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

brasilia-airport,/airport-reviews/brasilia-airport,Brasilia Airport customer review,G Villela,NA,2009-04-08,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Seems the international arrival area is going through extensive renovation to ensure each arriving passenger has to pass through duty free upon arrival. Upon arrival on Monday I could not believe my eyes when we actually had to stand in line in front of the duty free area for approx. 30 minutes before being able to enter the actual immigration area. Fortunately I had an express card and eventually made it to the baggage claim within 1 hour but believe economy passengers would have easily spent 2-3 hours clearing immigration. Air conditioning was not sufficient and saw lots of tired families arriving with their children after a long trip from Europe/Asia/America. Immigration experience simple and fast as usual but the incompetence did not stop there. Had the pleasure of waiting another 30 minutes for my luggage as some clever mind decided to combine our QF flight from LA (B 747) and a SQ flight from Singapore (A 330) and the same luggage belt. As the majority of passengers were stuck in the immigration line no luggage was removed from the belt so lots of luggage was backed-up and could not get on to the belt. Needless to say that 2 other belts were not used at all while others just serviced single flights on small B 737 aircraft. First impression of a visitor arriving in a foreign country is always the airport so I feel very sorry that so many visitors on that day had such terrible experience arriving in Brisbane.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,Roger Stone,NA,2009-03-17,As a regular travelling through both the international and domestic terminals at Brisbane Airport I thought I would add my comments here. Compared to many airports throughout the world I have travelled through Brisbane Airport compares very favourably. Airbridges and steps to the aircraft tend to arrive quickly (unlike Heathrow for example) and immigration is mostly very efficient although I would recommend evening arrivals rather than early morning arrivals if you can plan it that way. Sitting next to passengers arriving from other countries I have noticed some confusion regarding transferring to the domestic terminal which is only about a kilometre or so away from the international terminal on the same airport and suburban trains are available for the transfer. However an odd problem I have noticed is that many in Australia seem to confuse the term 'terminal' with 'airport'. This means that you may be asked to transfer to the 'domestic airport' when arriving at the international terminal in Brisbane. Please do not be dismayed. This is in fact the 'domestic terminal' which is located on the same airport. There is no other airline-used 'domestic airport' in Brisbane separate from the main Brisbane Airport (as would be the case for example in Bangkok) The same issue applies in Sydney where the domestic and international terminals are located on the same airport despite what the confusing signs may tell you. The other main issue with Brisbane Airport is that although many flights now arrive from international destinations between 1030pm and 1am there are no trains into the city at all after about 7.30pm. The railway authorities do not seem to have realised this need. Otherwise both domestic and international terminals offer good shopping with airy walkways and plenty of parking and plenty of taxis are usually available.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Morgan Dye,United Kingdom,2015-06-15,"I last travelled through Bristol airport around eight or nine years ago and I remember it being pretty decent for an airport of its size. This time around I was disappointed. Firstly, the security check. If you've forgotten a small plastic bag for your carry on liquid items you are encouraged to pay out £1 for a bag - don't bother doing this! Once through there were staff handing them out for free. Not sure why they do this, Heathrow and most other airports seem to give the bags out for free. The security check itself was awful. The queue was unbelievable and crawled along at a snails pace. The low ceilinged queuing area was stiflingly hot and the whole thing was just bad. Compare this to my last flight from Heathrow when I zipped through in 10 mins, max. Once through, the facilities on offer aren't too bad, but the terminal building felt very dingy and closed off, there were no windows that offered views out onto the runway area. I'm sure there were last time I flew from here. The walk from the terminal building to the boarding gate for my flight was also epic. Admittedly, that isn't necessarily a problem unique to Bristol. Coming back, again the walk to immigration and baggage reclaim was a real epic, worse than going out. That said, bags came off quickly and the joy of a small airport is that you're out and on your way pretty quick. I've been told that Bristol is undergoing a bit of an upgrade, so be to be fair some of my gripes may be resolved in the future. If you're flying this summer though, prepare for some long and sweaty queuing at security.",Arrival and Departure,13-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,4,1,3,3,NA,3,1,0,NA,1
bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Mark Taylor,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,First the good news. Given this is a small airport averaging around half a dozen departures per hour you are unlikely to face a long queue on the runway for take off or for that matter to have to circle around for ages to land. Also the check in queues were not too bad albeit I flew during the off peak season. But that is about all there is good to say. The whole point of little airports is they should be easy to use very short walks from the plane to the exit. Instead it has been designed without airbridges so you usually need a bus to get to the plane. You will also face long walks with no moving walkways (mine on return was over 1/4 mile) along with going up and down stairs (again no escalators). Anyone with young children and pushchairs or elderly and infirm should take careful note. Access is horrendous as the airport is in the middle of nowhere without any sensible connection to the M4 or M5. Most people will either have to go through Bristol or across windy minor roads. The parking is basically in a dirty great big field poorly concreted and open to the elements so if it's raining you will get drenched. All this for parking prices on a par with LHR and Gatwick despite the airports rural location. Helpfully the short term car park is also sited in a dip so you face a big uphill lugging of your cases while the rain pelts you. If you want a trolley it's £2 per trolley non refundable. Even Gatwick and LHR don't do that! Generally I like small airports because what you lose in facilities you gain in ease of use and lower cost. But not here.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

The 18.15 departure to Istanbul. Check-in was very busy but the line moved quickly and the check-in agent was friendly. Passport control and security at terminal B (non Schengen) was very fast with friendly officers. The flight was boarded in zones and this was enforced. Passengers in an other boarding zone were not allowed to go to the plane until the passengers from the announced boarding zone were boarded. The return on the 25th of August at 21.35 was smooth. No lines at immigration and when we reached the luggage reclaim the bags were already coming to the carrousel. Clean airport with nice and friendly airport staff. At terminal B there were a lots of shops after passport control and before security. And after security there was also a bar and Duty Free shop.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Passport control not bad but as heading up stairs to get to security was faced with a sea of people coming down the stairs. Seems main security checkpoint was overloaded and they were directing people to use alternate at far end of A terminal. Had to walk to end of terminal where there was a mass of people queuing for 2 checkpoints. 45 minutes through then up to departures and back to the other end of the terminal to the gate.

In the international terminal is the Oasis self service restaurant I went to purchase a couple of drinks and I only had a couple of 100 Lei notes left the girl on the checkout went round other staff checking it was okay and not a forgery it was simply an unused note I was then asked to pay by card. I took the note back and changed it at a money exchange with no problem whatsoever and returned to pay for my drinks.

Seamless experience there. Leaving Budapest towards Bucharest with TAROM was a smooth experience as well the SkyPriority counters were completely free and we were checked in in a matter of minutes. As they were very strict with the FastTrack we chose for the standard lane as my wife has no Priority status and we did not want to separate there but the queue on this busy 8am was short and efficient and within a small 8-10 minutes we were security cleared. Another few steps in the terminal to the non-schengen departures which were deserted at the time of our departure. The boarding process via the bus (it was a small commuter plane) was less orderly there was a priority section in the bus but which was not enforced so the run to the plane was opened as soon as the bus opened it's doors.

There are two terminals. A is new clean and used by international airlines. B is old and (I believe) only used by some Aerolineas Argentinas flights. Arriving in terminal A I was outside having collected my bags in 30 minutes. Checking in opened 4 hours before the flight and I was through quickly. Departing it was all very organised and what appeared long queues at passport control and security went very quickly 5 minutes maximum. Some tips (partly covered already). On arrival best rates for exchange are at Banco Nacional. There is a desk in the luggage hall if this is closed then exit the arrivals channel completely and take two turns to the right. Much better rates than elsewhere. Taxis ignore all the spivs hanging around and go to Taxi Ezezia desk in the middle of the floor when you exit arrivals. 150 pesos to city centre including tolls. On departures there is very little once airside however there are several cafes landside including a McDonalds with an outside terrace. This is a good place to sit and watch events outside the terminal incessant hooting whistling etc which of course everyone ignores. I watched an amusing episode where two people cut each other up got out and hugged/chatted then cut each other up again trying to exit the drop off zone.

buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2010-08-26,Unlike other reviews I found EZE a fairly unpleasant experience. The boarding gate areas were almost always crammed and stressful places. The terminal seems to have very few good shops and poor information on arriving flights. In fact no information was available for arriving flights on any monitors I could find. I was looking to see how delayed my colleague's flight was on an arrivals monitor but cound not find one anywhere including the American Airlines- One World Admirals Club lounge (although the staff there were very helpful). Another reason for referring to arrivals monitors is to assess how honest the departures monitors are - eg: if the arriving aircraft from a certain airline is running many hours late it would be unlikely if its associated departing flight was on time. I found the general staff overly officious the business lounges incredibly small and crowded (don't use the Iberia One World Lounge - it reminded me of a very small regional airport lounge in Australia) and the restaurant and food outlets extremely limited.

I enjoy the fact that you can duty-free shop entering Argentina!

Taxi Ezeiza is always a safe bet for transport into the city a kiosk right in the center of the floor when you exit customs.

I love the fact that they have the friendly greeters in white Stetsons it certainly makes you feel you have arrived somewhere different also love the fact that they help people with mobility problems or young children by giving them a lift on the golf buggies from the airbridge to customs. This was brought into sharp contrast on arrival back at Manchester with the ludicrous up and down stairs long and winding walk you have to do on arrival. The customs guys were certainly abrupt but no more than I had experienced in other parts of Canada - in fact they only asked us 2 quick questions before letting us through - other groups of passengers seemed to get far more of a grilling. Baggage reclaim was really fast signage to rental cars was easy to follow and I'd say we were completely out of the airport within 1hr of landing which is not bad at all. Flying out was positive too - had heard rumours that the security staff could be quite rude but if anything they were a bit too friendly.

Departure again very easy as not many Virgin flights in and out of Canberra. Warning - Check gate number carefully as Qantas use seperate departure area from others and they are not connected! Why they dont connect them is beyond me as it would save money by not having to double up on security staff and shop staff! Bar/snack counter in Common user area doesn't open until one hour before flight so if you are early stay landside if you want to eat or drink!. Terminal clean and bright with good view of apron area.

Simply put the airport is not fit for purpose and the passenger experience is stressful and problematic when arriving.

cancun-airport,/airport-reviews/cancun-airport,Cancun Airport customer review,J Tung,United Kingdom,2014-12-04,Used terminal 3 in November. Fairly modern terminal but with very limited facilities. The departure experience was far better than arrival. The departure hall was modern and clean and queue to check in or bag drop was not too long. Security check took a while but that seems to be the norm nowadays. There was a decent duty free and some shops after security. Nothing too interesting. Also few restaurants near the duty free. I visited the lounge which was poor - very limited drink and food and the seating area is dated. Arrival experience on the other hand was bad. Immigration was efficient but the luggage wait was long. I waited at least an hour to reclaim my luggage. After the luggage claim everyone has to go through the customs - the queuing system is bad and again the facilities not able to cope which results in another hour of waiting.

Having arrived on a half full British Airways flight from London we were off the aircraft and through immigration within 20 minutes of landing. There was only a small immigration queue and passengers appeared to be processed relatively quickly and the immigration official was pleasant. Short wait for bags to arrive and we were through customs in less than 5 minutes - again the customs official was polite welcoming and helpful despite requesting an additional baggage search of the person that I was travelling with. My main criticism was after leaving the terminal building it was unclear where to go for onward connections using public transport. On the return journey the airport was extremely busy - long queue for check-in although the check-in agent and BA's ground handling team generally were pleasant and helpful. We were very grateful for a short and efficient security process. No BA lounge so used the TGI Fridays which again was very busy but decent food at an ok price as we had complementary BA vouchers. Decent range of shops and managed to find a postbox for my postcards despite being told by several airport employees that there was not one in the terminal. Boarding was crazy but thankfully I was entitled to use the priority line.

They were actually using X-Ray machines to screen every bag leaving the terminal. I have traveled extensively world-wide and know of no country that is doing this including the U.S. What could Mexican Authorities possibly think tourists are smuggling into Cancun on already screened Aircraft?

There is one small shop (outside the security check area) which doesn't help if you want to take those items through with you that are ordinarily banned. The security staff also apply an interesting interpretation on what is dangerous: we had a travel iron confiscated from our hand luggage as it could be used as a blunt instrument.

The main problem is the poor choice of flights but we managed to get a flight to Barcelona which almost fitted our needs. The airport's recent modernisation seems to be pretty good. Drop-off area was good and no charge (well done CWL). Check-in staff were fine security was no worse nor no better than most airports we use so all in all not bad. As part of the modernisation Cardiff seems to have followed the Bristol plan - enlarge the Duty Free shops at the expense of seating - not good. The catering is average but the prices are eye wateringly expensive over £2 for a cup of tea is such a rip-off. I thought the Welsh government owned this airport. They should stop such profiteering.

Prices at the bar and cafe were shocking (more expensive than Heathrow) but you don't have to buy. On our return we were off the plane and in the car within 20 minutes and that was after collecting bags which is pretty good in my experience. Other reviews moan about charges for Pick-up and Drop-off but most UK airports now do this and there is a free area if you wish to use it. It's a shame that there are not more flights but this might cause its own problems with congestion.

Picking them up late at night was less straightforward as they seemed to take ages coming through to the Arrivals area after the plane had landed even though none on their flight had hold luggage to collect. The delay was at passport control as three flights arrived within about 20 minutes of each other. By the time the girls came through the queue for car parking payment at one end of the arrivals area virtually joined the queue at the other end for the (one?) ticket validating machine.

The building itself is where the positives end. The facility is hopelessly inadequate. There are good dining options upstairs and they can be reached by an escalator at the very far south end of the terminal that is is you can make your way past the thronging check-in queues. Looking for the toilet? Back downstairs you go and through a labyrinthine corridor and you will find them but if they are not closed for cleaning they will be reduced to an unusable state. Once you make it past the interminable queue for the security check be sure to keep an eye on the one central FID. Announcements regarding delays or gate changes (for those flights lucky enough to be parked at a gate) simply do not exist. Seating and toilet facilities airside are extremely limited and you will almost certainly have to take a bus to your aircraft on a stand-off bay. If you are arriving be in no hurry to get to the baggage carousel; you will stare at it for what seems like an eternity before it starts to move and even then the delivery of luggage will be erratic.

As I have mentioned before it is excellent to arrive. Now departures is an entirely different matter you have to go through two security checks pay the departure tax which I think is pretty disgusting especially since they have increased it from PHP550 to PHP750 and the Cathay Pacific Lounge is pretty awful with extremely limited food and drinks and very dated. The duty free shops is expensive there is only one souvenir shop with some sort of food (admittedly I have never eaten there) a small smoking bar the washroom facilities are pretty basic too.

cebu-airport,/airport-reviews/cebu-airport,Cebu Airport customer review,Edmund Carew,NA,2008-06-16,Cebu is a more convenient and less hassled entry point to the Philippines than Manila. Taxi travel to and from Cebu's CBD is efficient aided by the two bridges in lieu of the former one connecting Mactan and Cebu islands. Provided one arrives on an airline like SilkAir that flies at off-peak times to Cebu immigration queues can be non-existent. However leaving can be a different story with a 20 minute queue to obtain entry to the checkin area and then a 25 minute wait in the mid afternoon through immigration. Cebu's beautiful resorts are popular with Koreans so make sure that the departure time of your flight does not coincide with flights to Seoul or Pusan - you will not be able to get to your gate in five minutes. The restricted entry to checkin is designed to stop hordes of well wishes from clogging checkin but it does add a delay not found in many other non- Filipino airports. There is a limited range of shops once through immigration and they do not stock basics like 'load' for a local cellphone - so come prepared with snacks if need be. It is possible once you have checked in to hand in your boarding pass and re-enter the 'outside world' but you do have to then queue to go through security to the checkin area so some may conclude it is not worth the hassle to bid a final goodbye to family friends or business associates.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Quite a long walk to Baggage Reclaim for the furthest gates but not unreasonable. Toilets clean and plentiful with both squat and regular options. For International Departures there are 2 main dining options before Check-in either KFC or local Chinese food. There are a few stores selling various local foods and some souvenirs. Check-In pretty good and Passport Control and Security all pretty smooth. No requirement to remove belts or laptops for security scanning but do enforce the 100ml liquid rules from Europe. In the International Departures no dining opportunities but a couple of coffee-shop options along with the usual array of Duty Free shops. Most departures are from one of the 11 airbridges.

chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Miller,United Kingdom,2015-05-02,I had the misfortune to fly home from Chennai airport just under two weeks ago. It must be the slowest airport in the world. I've been to India six times now so am well acquainted with the slowness of almost everything in the country. However one expects better of an airport especially one that's fairly new and modern-looking and no other Indian airport I've travelled flown home from has been as bad. The first queue was a long one but no longer than many other airport queues I've been in but unlike in most other airports it hardly moved the queue for immigration at Heathrow when I got home was just as long but constantly moving so didn't take too long. The Chennai queue was unbelievably slow. Then came the queues (plural) for security. I understand that they have good reason to take security seriously and I'm glad they do but they kept recalling bags to have another look at them and then someone would search them by hand. One young woman who was just in front of me had her handbag taken from her and put through three times and searched by hand twice - this really can only mean that the staff didn't do it correctly the first time unless it was the result of a malicious desire to make passengers miss their flights. My bag was put through the scanner twice and searched by hand. I saw this happening to other people too. This was on top of the body searches of course (which I know are necessary but do add more time to the process). This is without question the most inefficient airport I've ever used and I shall do my best never to have to use it again.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

Construction dirt and grime are seen on all white-painted columns and girders. The lounge is located on a higher floor and is accessible only by lift. An escalator would have moved people more conveniently. Anyway the lounge is pathetic compared to the lounges in the old terminal. There is no arrival immigration in the new terminal and passengers are forced to walk some 500 m to the immigration counters in the old terminal. The smelly toilets seem to have been transplanted from the old terminal and are maintained just as filthy.

Surely this is the lousiest and dirtiest 'new' terminal built in the recent past. The end product is a big disappointment for those of us who have been waiting for a new terminal for over several years. This is not an 'international' airport to feel proud about. The funniest part of this airport is that only the check-in is in the new terminal and then you are led in a 'smelly' pathway (without AC) that connects the old airport for boarding the flight. The (striking) AAI staff neither want to keep this terminal clean nor allow private interested parties to maintain this airport - too bad. If I were to rate this airport on a scale of 1-10 I would definitely rate it at '1' just because when you look at it from a distance (from the roadside) it looks swanky especially when the lights are on at night!,NA,NA,NA,1,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Luggage arrival may take a while (30 mins to 1 hour); Customs is quick and easy. Smoking permitted inside terminal - a nuisance. Duty free can be purchased upon arrival not much of a choice though. Basic stuff. Foreign exchange - Thomas Cook office within the secure area available. Free local phone call permitted from assistance booth near baggage collection area. Most staff speak good english and respond well. Long-distance / international calls can be placed from telephone booths (labeled ISD/STD) which are manned and you can get receipts. If you have someone to pick you up at the airport: Clear customs; Exit immediately after customs and wait there. You will turn left to exit the ""secure area"". Do not do this unless you have seen the people waiting to receive you. If you have do not have someone to pick you up: Clear customs; Exit and as you turn left you will see two private travel agencies within the secure area (one is Akbar travels and the other is Airport Express). Both of them are prepaid safe reliable. Akbar costs 350 rupees (less than 10 USD) (as of Aug 2008) to a ride anywhere in to Chennai city. Tip the person who rolls your luggage (about 20 to 30 rupees); and tip the driver about the same. Walk very closely to the person who takes your luggage to your car since you might get lost in the crowd outside. MAA International Departures: Arrive at least 3 to 4 hours prior to departure time. Must have a ticket / itinerary printed and in your hand with passport to get in to the airport. No other options allowed. Check-in queues are very long and slow. Elite status helps (depending on airline). No food for purchase prior to check-in. Passport control is usually quick (max 30 minutes with a 100 people in line). Duty free available. Overpriced food available prior to and after security check (for your handbags etc). The food is actually good in the mornings (between 6 to 9:30 AM) and after that its not that great. Make sure you have a luggage tag for your hand baggage - this is true for all Indian airports. They will make you leave the line and go and get one. Also make sure you have exactly one piece of hand baggage...no matter what it is.(so fit everything in to one bag). Did not use any lounges. MAA Local airport: NEed ticket with ID to enter airport. Some food available prior to check-in. All luggage is screened with X-ray machines similar to international airport. These queues are long. Otherwise its generally quick to get through to check luggage and clear security. Individual airlines may be slow depending on quality of service. After security check there is extremely overpriced stuff to eat. A coffee dispensing machine. Its pretty boring otherwise. Nothing to do except people-watch. Most airlines need you to take a bus to the plane. Watch for the gates being called out.

With mountains of luggage being taken off early from the conveyor belt just to make room for more flights. The entire terminal unnavigable with the amount of craziness that was going on.

We queued there for about 45 minutes before getting to a hall best described as a cattle market crammed with hundreds of visitors. People were taking photos of the unbelievable crowd. Only about 1/3 of passport desks were manned. It took 2 hours to get through the queue plus the 45 minutes in the corridor. Many people were missing connecting flights. When they asked staff what they should do they were rudely told 'stand in line there's nothing you can do you just have to catch the next one'. I guess for some that meant spending the night in the terminal. One parent tried to offer food to their bored child only to be ordered to 'put that food away- no food' because they were using sniffer dogs.

Before security things are a little better - you can at least get something to eat albeit at McDonalds. Arrivals: There's a long wait for bags however my destination has always been from Ireland where immigration is done before take-off so this mitigates that somewhat as we don't have to queue. There is a bar in arrivals (one might have considered putting the bar in departures?) and a shop but little else and the area is cramped with few seats.

Canadians do not require fingerprinting and photos yet we have to stand in the same line. The US residents cleared quickly but it took us 50 minutes. After that we grabbed our bags which were sitting on a non-revolving luggage carousel since we took so long and attempted to drop off our bags. All there was was United personnel yelling at people to move around to different spots and there was no queue. It shouldn't take 10 minutes to drop the bags off. Took the airport train to terminal 1. Not well thought out everything revolves around 1 escalator so people bunch up. Went through the United Priority security. Not sure why it was priority it took 20 minutes for TSA to scan 10 people. I'm sorry but it shouldn't take that long. We then had to do the run between terminal B and C. When we arrived at the gates the jetway was pulling away from the plane fortunately they put it back so we could get on. 2 hours should be sufficient. When we got to Calgary our bags and the bags of about 15 other passengers were missing.

It was my first time in Chicago and my considered impression is that O'Hare is a breathtakingly unfriendly place. From virtually the moment of disembarking where arriving and transiting passengers were prevented from leaving having to side-step high-fiving security types and obnoxious passport controls (please and thank you obviously never made it this far into the mid-West) navigating the terminals (gate M11 is in terminal 5 that's perfectly clear then) until the dingy airside international departure lounge with it's roped-shut kiosks and virtually complete lack of facilities... it was an abysmal experience.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The whole place is telling ""come here again"" but as to the functionality of the venue I have to say some unpleasant words. First cleanliness of toilets is a must not facultative. Second the fact that trolleys are not allowed at the transit train between terminals makes transiting painful for passengers with bags (especially for families). Third terminals 2 and 3 are not lit enough. In the evening arrivals areas on the ground level look gloomy. Terminal 1 is not well signposted. If you fly with United and your departure terminal is #2 you have to check-in at Terminal 1 and then go to Terminal 2 through a special passage for United domestic passengers. Stupid and terribly confusing for those who fly first time. I've spent some 20 minutes in Terminal 2 trying to find United check-in desks among ones of Northwest and Continental and then somehow guessed it should be at the Terminal 1. Food I ate at the outlet near the gate (Terminal 2 airside ) was iedible. Departing from Terminal 5 on British Airways was a difficult experience. Slow check-in and nothing to eat after security at 9pm but the terminal itself is nice roomy and convenient.

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,Mark Taylor,NA,2005-06-28,I'd suggest avoiding O'Hare if you are trying to connect from an international flight to a domestic one. No fast track for F/J class passengers no help whatsoever with flight connections. You just wait in the queue at immigration and take your chances. It's not even logical they had space at the US immigration channel so some uniform opened the barrier for people waiting behind me to go through. One guy tried to join this from near me- probably also had a connection- but aforementioned jobsworth shooed him back. I can handle the idea of needing extra security but if you US immigration can't find a way within this to accommodate the realities of an international hub then come clean and tell people not to try connecting at this or other US airports operating on this basis- which is many of them I believe. To their credit the airport and airline staff are pretty good at managing the situation and getting you on a later flight because they are well used to this farce and ashamed of it too. I know LHR immigration is bad but at least there's an effort to get people to their connection. If this is truly where US government/immigration has arrived at post 9/11 I'm afraid you've conceded a clear victory to the terrorists on this one.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
chongqing-jiangbei-airport,/airport-reviews/chongqing-jiangbei-airport,Chongqing Jiangbei Airport customer review,G A Bray,Australia,2012-12-23,Flew domestically into Chongqing on Sichuan Airlines and for some reason our aerobridge was at the small International Terminal 1. Requiring us to walk 100m around the edge of the terminal concourse and walk down stairs to a shuttle bus to carry Terminal 2 which being winter was bitterly cold especially with the doors opened while the bus waited for a full load. Once inside the proper domestic terminal it was pretty straight forward and standard routine. Once excellent feature was a lady handing out bi-lingual cards listing taxi fare prices to over a dozen destinations around the city to discourage touting and rip offs. For the return I found out the single domestic Terminal 2 is actually split into 3 separate halls A B and C. If you flight is leaving through hall C you can not enter via A or B security points. This also means you are technically shut off from the shops and facilities in the other sections too such as the McDonalds in hall A. However you are able to walk downstairs to the Arrivals level and use the transfer signage to direct you to the other areas making the segregation of the terminal areas pointless. Lastly with the security it was the only place I was asked to take my boots off beyond the X-Ray machine which all passengers were made to do. However with only one seat it meant a longer wait as you could not progress until the person in front had taken off their boots was examined and then re-laced them.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Clark has the makings of a good airport but attention to detail is sorely lacking. First of all there's free wifi - but only outside the airport (and maybe in Arrivals) airside you'll have to pay 800 pesos to use the VIP lounge. Airport tax as of 1 Feb is up to 600 pesos so don't spend all your local money! Then there's the bins - what bins? If you want a bin landside you'd better head to the restrooms. And while you're there bring your own toilet paper. There's no spray either. Airside (after you've paid your 600 pesos) there is toilet paper and some bins although they are few and far between. If you're downstairs where the ""cheap"" airlines leave from don't expect aircon or PA announcements. Upstairs there is aircon and PA but good luck hearing sufficiently to understand anything that's said in most announcements (Qatar Airways was the exception). So-called duty free stores are quite egregious here I saw packs of 6 beers with a normal retail value of 180-200 pesos priced at 500. News stand? Actually there was a small kiosk that at least sold a few magazines. Free drinking water? In your dreams. As for vegetarian food options - just head towards the exit keep going turn right and wait for the next jeepney back to town. Are there any good points?

Despite it being refurbished within the last decade or so it feels like it needs a bit of a touch up-and the constant use of that sickly blue colour everywhere doesn't necessarily help the situation. So yes it is a nice airport in regional NSW that serves its purpose and the needs of the people but I just get the feeling that with a bit of money put in (new floorings lick of paint open up the departure lounge a bit more provide wi-fi) it could be have a certain wow factor reserved for NSW regional airports like Newcastle Albury and Dubbo which have been thrust forward into the 21st Century.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Flying into the airport isn't too bad although the pick-up point for arrivals is now as big a shambles as the drop off zone for departing passengers. Departures is a different story. Apart from the scrum at the aforementioned drop off point the check in desks are partitioned off from the rest of the departure hall and you're not allowed to proceed to check in until instructed to do so. Fair enough but the amount of seating in the departure hall is completely inadequate for the number of passengers waiting for their check in desk to open. Also there is only one channel through the partition and when check in for a particular flight opens this is immediately mobbed by the waiting passengers with no attempt by the authorities at managing the process or – heaven forbid – organizing a queue. Once airside things do improve but since passengers have already gone through full security screening at a) entry to the departure hall and b) entry to the check in area why is there a need for a third security check at the gate itself? Still not a bad airport but the management ought to think about making the departures process less painful for passengers.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

There were several immigration desks open even though it was 3.30am and I was processed quickly and efficiently.

corfu-airport,/airport-reviews/corfu-airport,Corfu Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2014-05-10,Into and out of Corfu on late night flights before the main season started so we had no problems with crowds or queuing. Travelling with hand luggage only made things even easier. Passport control in either direction was very casual to say the least but security on departure seemed reasonably thorough without causing any serious holdups. We only bought a bottle of water airside as we know buying anything at Corfu airport can be expensive. Only one agent to handle boarding for our flight but she got us through the gate swiftly and efficiently.

corfu-airport,/airport-reviews/corfu-airport,Corfu Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-09-28,"Plenty of time to study Corfu Airport as we had a 6 hour delay for the return flight courtesy of easyJet. In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples? Overall a mixture of pluses and minuses but I would give it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the surprisingly positive impression we gained of the security staff.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

If you are in need of refreshment as we were there is no cafe just a long queue to a buffet counter where you are ripped off! We had to pay over 15 Euro for two small lukewarm barely drinkable coffees a miniscule tooth breaking baguette and a soft drink. This was virtually thrown at us by two disinterested girls who probably would not understand the meaning of common courtesy or customer satisfaction. Only a couple of the monitors mounted from the ceiling were working - others broken or switched off and nothing like enough of the hard metal seats to accommodate the crowd of people who were waiting for flights when we were there.

Amenities are on par with other large US hubs but security checks rarely take more than 15 mins of queuing. Customs/Immigration is probably the fastest I have experienced in the US and although int'l transfer passengers must exit the secure area and undergo an additional security check this is not really different from any other US airport. Gate-to-gate transfers can be quite a trek given the size of the airport but are quite simple if your gate is closer to a Skytrain entrance.

The decor was a bit bland but that's not the purpose of the facility. The real kicker was in the security clearance for the domestic leg. There was a mother with two small children--an infant in meltdown mode and a two year old who was doing his best after flying overnight. The gatekeeper was a sour looking woman who seemed most delighted by having the authority to say ""no"". The mom in all the confusion had not removed her shoes and was sent back to rectify this open challenge to the rules. She went through with the baby and Little Miss Sunshine noted that the boy had both shoes and a sweater on! Her response was two-fold first she prohibited mom from going back to help and responded to the child by telling him that mommy was going to leave him unless he played by the rules. There was not a person in line who was not ready to tackle her and beat her senseless but that is not the best approach these days. Finally a decidely non Latino TSA male came over squatted down and spoke at length to the child in Spanish. Big credits for his help. But overall it was ""security"" at its most absurd.

I arrived with £1000GBP of travellers cheques and had a 4 hour connection. I was unable to purchase any food or drink and the 1 restaurant that is there only accepts Syrian money. If you are lucky you can pay with euro pounds or dollars in hard cash. Otherwise you have to starve or die of first. There is a duty free shop that accepts visa and sells incredibly cheap cigarettes (I think they were $1USD a packet). However you won't be able to buy any food or drink to consume with your visa card unless you don't mind living off toblerone and whisky. Toilets didn't have any toilet paper in them. I was sitting on the seats and I left my girlfriend. When I returned she had moved because an older Syrian (I presume?) guy had started waving his stick at her and telling her to move. He had then requisitioned the whole seat and sat around 9 burkah wearing women on the seat opposite him.

Complete chaos on entering the airport queues completely ignored people pushing to the front with officials ignoring the fact passport control inefficient beyond words total lack of customer care or basic respect for other human beings. Leaving queues of people standing for up to 6 hours waiting for a totally disinterested official to grunt and gesture at you before begrudgingly stamping your passport allowing entry or exit. This time I thought Dammam would be a viable alternative to the Riyadh experience there cannot possibly be 2 airports in the same country that are so appallingly below any reasonable standard can there? Yes there can Dammam was actually a slightly worse experience than Riyadh! The passport control people are clones of their Riyadh counterparts total disinterest in anything other than their tea breaks socialising with their colleagues staring at their mobile phones and generally sitting around doing nothing for long periods before waving the next unfortunate traveller up to the desk. Please fill out an exit card before queuing I was told there were no cards available when I started and told to join the queue anyway. By the time I got to the front cards had actually appeared some way back in the passport control area (no one was told this). So I was then turned away and sent to the back of the queue again told to fill out an exit card. There must have been 20-30 people straight after me who had this experience. Basic levels of customer care are totally devoid here. In contrast I landed at Heathrow disembarked passport control and picked up my case in 35mins - a shining example of what an airport can do when run by intelligent efficient caring people - these places are two polar opposites!,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Arrival was painless. Immigration looks as if it will take forever at first but as soon as immigration staff realise it's going to be busy they open more desks and the queue soon clears. Customs scan every bag from every person as you leave. When returning you must have your checked luggage scanned before check in otherwise you cannot check the bag. Queues for check in weren't too bad but then I was 3 hours early for the KLM flight. Be prepared before going through security as although the queue looks long it moves fast and security staff get annoyed if they have to ask you to remove your belt watch etc but they are very pleasant if you are ready. The flight I was waiting for was leaving at 1:15am and there were a few international flights but the cafe was closed. The only place to buy refreshments was from a ""trolley"" however the coffee wasn't bad and wasn't too expensive but nothing to eat that was hot. There is one duty free shop with various items for sale (including washing powder?) and prices are okay.

Close second would be the Singapore Changi airport. Excellent modern building with very efficient security measures. I have read reviews here where people have criticized this airport for being too strict but this is for good measure and I think it cannot be ridiculed for it. I have experienced worse (stricter and longer) queues in Heathrow than the T3. The best in the world when it comes to the facilities for passengers with longer transit hours very reasonably priced (compared to it's counterparts in Europe Asia and North America).

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Saketh Rahm,United States,2014-02-20,Used DEL twice in the last week for international arrival and domestic departure. I still think this airport is great after 3 years. Lots of security checks but I would rather have that than be sorry later. Security staff not overtly friendly but their job isn't to be nice but thorough. I like the shopping which is pretty vast and found prices to be fair. Had a nice Indian lunch for Rs 200 ($ 3.50) which is significantly cheaper than a meal at any US or European airport. Boarding areas and bathrooms all clean. Arrival was also easy with 3 lanes reserved for business/first class passengers.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,D Gill,Canada,2014-01-25,DEL T3 is much better than what they had before. It is certainly more pleasant although the carpet color and design seems a bit too loud. The lines did seem a bit longer but nothing that one shouldn't expect. Airport seems to have more choices in terms of restaurants but unfortunately the prices are blatantly high. That is something that they should seriously look at. I think they are using international standards when it comes to pricing. Sadly that is not quite the same when it comes to customer service. I still found washrooms well below par and there were pigeons flying around inside the terminal. If you haven't used DEL before make sure you take the print out of your ticket with you otherwise you will not be allowed inside the terminal. Seems like DEL is the only airport to do that. Although I do understand that they only want to allow the passengers to get inside the terminal.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,In transit from LHR to BKK with Air India. Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge).

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Tapani Utunen,Finland,2013-03-18,Have travelled a few times through T3 and every time the experience has been quite good and hassle-free. This time arrived at 5.30 am from Helsinki and connected to an Air India domestic at 9 am. Bags were out quickly and immigration was a breeze then quickly upstairs to Air India departures with a security check on the way upstairs - we were at the Air India counter by 6.30 am and had plenty of time until AI departure that was on time. The same story on the way back to Helsinki: easy and hassle-free. Maybe this is due to the fact that Finnair lands in Delhi in the morning instead of midnight and takes off at 10.45 am when there is not that much international traffic at T3. Moreover there are some pleasant eateries and cafes there plus great views to the runways to do some plane spotting. Cannot understand some very negative feedback from fellow travellers about Delhi Int'l Airport. Sure Delhi cannot compete with Hong Kong Singapore Changi KLIA or Bangkok Suvarnabhumi but it's still modern bright rather functional and clean.

Domestic arrival hall is bit different no staff helping people with luggage still very smooth process. Both international and domestic departure process are similar with other international airports. Here are the downsides. Security is very very tight at Delhi airport. I can understand the reason why but surely these security staff could be more professional and friendly. They are just simply rude! Wifi is only for Indian mobile phone holders they could at least learn from Chinese airport to get temp password if you present your passport.

None of the air bridges were working in either old or new terminals. Domestic departures was through the old domestic arrivals area. Business lounges for both domestic and international flights were fenced off parts of the main concourses with no computers available. No alcohol was on display but I discovered that in the international lounge a waitress would bring you a glass of wine if you asked for one. Arriving from Australia was a dreadful experience because many flights arrive at the same time. There is no fast track. Travellers should note that you have to pay the visa charge a desk before immigration which is not immediately obvious.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,S Stevens,Australia,2014-05-26,We landed in the New Denpasar Airport early afternoon. We were bus transported to the terminal we then proceeded through the Visa on arrival passports check etc... The process was absolutely hassle free fast efficient and friendly. Every counter was manned and the lines were only four-five deep so it took no time and we were out at the taxi booth paying a fixed price for a Taxi to our Villa in Seminyak (au $10.00). After reading many very disturbing reviews about the airport departure process we decided to get to the airport early. We went to the airport by taxi and arrived 3 hours before our 11.30pm flight. We have travelled extensively around the world and been to many international airports and Bali airport was one of our better experiences. The booking in immigration passport check luggage checks all worked well with very little delay. The food prices in the airport were more expensive than on the streets of Kuta but that is typical of any airport. The shopping section cannot be avoided the walkway winds through the shops this not unusual in airports. Once we got to the departure lounge I found a lot of congestion many people were sitting on the floor. We had not been allocated a departure gate and the flight details board did not have the departure gate numbers listed for many of the flights this caused congestion. We simply walked past all the congestion to another group of departure lounges (plenty of empty seats) and we waited for the announcement telling us which was our departure lounge. The announcements were loud and clear. There were many spotlessly clean toilet blocks throughout the departure lounges in the airport. I strongly recommend once you get to the departure lounge area walk to the left past the congestion and you will find many empty departure lounges and empty toilet blocks. We look forward to going back to Bali and seeing the airport when it is completely finished.,NA,NA,NA,9,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,Ali Jacques,Australia,2014-04-21,"Generally speaking my views are identical to Mr Powell's review below. There were no ""aero bridges"" available for both my arrival flight or my Departure flight. The arrivals hall wad enormous spacious. I had arranged the VIP service through Garuda Orient Holidays so it took around 5 minutes to have my visa in my Passport. When my flight arrived from Brisbane there were already 2-3 International flights that had arrived before mine so was a rather long queue ahead but all Immigration counters were open and fully manned so the queue moved at a steady pace. All luggage came out at the one carousel what a mess. I waited around 10 minutes for my suitcase I was then whisked away to yet another long queue to have all luggage X-rayed. This process over you exit the arrivals hall into the mass of people from Hotels/Tour companies and the like waiting for arriving passengers. The traffic is non stop out of the Airport. Now the Departure information: You are dropped off at a ramp where you can get a trolley for your bags it's a short walk up to the first Security check where your bags are X-rayed takes a couple of minutes. Then if you decide to have your luggage plastic wrapped there are around 4-5 stations where this can be done. The ""check in areas"" are spacious plenty of signage areas A-E and the entire area is spotlessly clean. There are no restaurants/Cafes in the Check in areas a huge mistake as there were many passengers in need of a cup of coffee. After check in there was ample seating in the Departure/Check in areas whilst waiting. After check in you walk the short distance where you pay the IDR 200000 Departure tax (A$20.00). The waiting tine at this point was only a couple of minutes. Then more Security screening separate lines for both men and women moved quickly. Then we have the shopping Duty Free and a lot of high end makes Designer and beautifully displayed very impressive. They are set out whereby all passengers must pass by every single shop. There are a few restaurants as you pass by the endless shopping a little expensive but convenient. The Gate areas are well laid out but the carpet is somewhat worn. The Boarding gates they cannot get it ""right"" too many passengers running all over the place with the constant changes. The worst gate being Gate 10 where the majority of Aussie bound flights depart from and as in my case my Garuda Indonesia flight to Brisbane was scheduled to also depart from this gate along with 4 other flights on Virgin Australia Jetstar bound for Perth Adelaide and Melbourne. It was total chaos. Headed down the escalator to yet another holding area where all passengers on the four flights were jammed in like sardines with airport staff screaming out the flights to a lot of confused people never seen anything like it in my 40 years of traveling. The airport may be lovely when first observed but the organization of the Departure/Gate areas require urgent attention. My holiday in Bali was just wonderful but with the airport debacle at the end put a sour taste to my Bali experience.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-03-10,My review will be less inflammatory than others because I have the good fortune to only ever use Bali airport at off-peak times. So I'll acknowledge that it's a massive improvement over the old terminal. There's more space and it's much more comfortable and attractive. There were still hints that despite spending a lot of money on a new terminal they still didn't cater to the existing demand (immigration took 20 minutes and there was a relative lack of seating airside otherwise things moved quickly). There are definitely still problems - hopefully some are temporary - that people should be aware of. Most flights are using buses at the moment and the terminal entrance where they drop you has 2 big steps and no wheelchair ramp - I saw 3 staff struggling to get a disabled guy up them. We didn't get arrival cards on the plane and there is very little in the immigration hall to tell you that you need one or where to get one (there were piles on some - but not all - of the VOA counters) plus there was one single desk in the entire cavernous hall where you could fill them out. Signage is not finished (or it's intended to be terrible) and it can be hard to see how to get from arrivals to departures (with a new terminal they really should have catered for airside connections) or where the taxi booth is. There are rigorous security checks before AND after check-in - the first one seems like an afterthought since there isn't enough room to do it smoothly. There are no ATMs in departures so if you forgot the R150000 departure tax (I had miscounted and I ended up R500 short!) it's back down to arrivals and then through security again. And what is the stupid serpentine gauntlet of shops that you have to run to get to the gates? I wonder where this horrible trend started - I know Sydney's done it for decades (but mainly in arrivals). All up a massive improvement over the old terminal in off-peak times.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

My departing flight was at 1am so I made sure to reach the airport by 10pm. Check-in departure tax and Immigration were all quick - I sympathise with the reviewer that clocked check-in at 20 mins per person but maybe some airlines are better than others. The compulsory walk through the shopping area seems to have got longer funny although signs in the airport say it is ""smoking and tobacco free"" I distinctly remember seeing a tobacco section in the duty free shop. After the shopping area things start to show signs of stress; too few toilets with queues spilling out VIP lounges just fenced-off departure lounges; not enough seating people all over the floor. There are a few food stalls which look pretty temporary but prices are close to western airport prices.

We didn't have any real problems with VOA Immigration and Baggage collection. No doubt we were the only flight in at that time. On the way out of Bali - 2nd January it was another story. The first security screening was grossly inadequate. The queues were massive and as there appeared to be only 2 x-ray points it took forever. I pity the poor tourists in front of us who waited for approx. 45 minutes in the queue to be told they were in the international departures area not domestic. No signage of course. Once through the first security screening it was another long wait to check in. Purchase of the departure tax was quick but the next queue through immigration was very long and slow. There were more people collecting the departure tax than there were checking at immigration! The fact that we are now forced to walk through an enormous duty free ""hall"" is annoying. Whilst it appears most airports are doing this it would be nice to bypass them. There are no restaurants just a couple of cafes with a couple of tables each and a couple of ""hot dog stands"". There is little seating and plenty of people were sitting on the floor. You can't go to your departure gate to sit down because you don't know which one you are allocated to until it is announced. Once at the departure gate the duty free purchases were wheeled in on a flat bed trolley!!! We had to get on buses to board the plane. The first two buses delivered passengers and then didn't reappear with new passengers for an hour.

If departing there is a nice cafe on the first floor that few people know about. Alternatively sit away from the gates near to passport control- there are lots of seats there and its quiet.

Immigration queues are longer for Bangladeshis than foreigners as there are generally many more Bangladeshis. Once through there is a lovely Sheraton cafe on the first floor which everyone can access but its always very quiet and relaxing compared to the pretty tacky cafe on the ground floor. No real shops to speak of but to be honest thats a refreshing change these days. Arrivals - if you are at the back of the plane the queue at immigration will be long by the time you get there. If flying to Dhaka try to get a seat near the front of economy so you can get to the immigration before the crowds. Everyone is very friendly and the hall is spacious.

There seems to be plenty of toilet cleaners but the toilets are crowded not so clean and far too few in numbers. The business class lounge is the worst I have seen. The options for eating are severely limited Costas and one other similar place. Not very exciting for a delay of several hours. The single runway means every plane is going to be late. The runway just cannot handle the number of flights and then the terminal cannot handle the number of passengers. We waited one hour to land circled at 15000 feet and then later for the next flight sat on the tarmac all ready to go for 70 minutes before actually taking off. The staff are amiable but unhelpful. The transfer desk was overwhelmed trying to arrange the hordes of passengers who missed flights. The new airport or new terminal has been rumoured to be coming soon for the last couple of years.

Arrived at 2am and it felt like a ghost town. We were traveling in Business on Qatar and the Business lounge wasn't very good compared to other countries. It's very over rated and as a seasoned traveler I was very disappointed with the lack of 24 hour service I have had in Asian airports. The lounge already feels very worn and tattered and they only served tea and coffee and soggy sandwiches. If they are trying to compete with Dubai they have no chance in winning. Even compared to old European lounges it didn't strike me as anything too exciting.

On my return flight I'd used Q-miles to upgrade to business from Doha to Manchester as I was in transit for 8 hours the premier terminal is the place to be if you have 8 hours with nothing to be expect sit and wait for the next flight a fine choice of foods and top class staff there seem to be more of them since my last visit I just hope the HAMAD finally opens they'll have done something about the crowds and queues.

Main ground floor is mostly filled by large duty free shop. Problem with airport is buses from planes to/from terminal does give it the feel and look of a fancy bus station. Going to far side of runway from / to terminal takes ages (15 mins) on the bus and can stand on the bus waiting another 15 mins waiting for buses in front to let people board the plane before allowed off.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,A Stevenson,United Kingdom,2012-10-09,The original terminal which I used to pass through frequently in the 1990’s seems to have disappeared to be replaced with a larger more modern building which is only a temporary terminal pending opening of the new Doha Airport. There are no airbridges so passengers are bussed to and from the terminal. Many connecting flights have short transfer times (mine was 50 minutes) which considering the time needed to travel to and from the terminal makes for a rushed and somewhat stressful transfer experience. I had been given an orange and yellow trimmed ‘short transfer’ boarding pass on check in with instructions from Qatar Airways to make this visible on arrival at Doha and to follow instructions. As it turned out no one was interested and there were no ‘short transfer’ lanes open or anyone offering assistance. Fortunately it was easy enough to identify my departure gate which was only a short walk away. The terminal itself is rather basic and functional and still too small for the number of passengers using it but easy to navigate and seems to do its job effectively enough. I was also impressed that my bags made the connection but all in all not a particularly enjoyable experience.,NA,NA,NA,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Andrew Maile,Indonesia,2012-09-06,Travelled through this airport twice last month and overall impression was that it is below average. The biggest problem is that there are no airbridges onto the plane so in order to board the aircraft you go down an escalator into a very cramped 'holding area' with hardly any seats before boarding a bus for the very long journey out to the plane. Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge. The only positive was that there seemed to be a lot of Qatar Airways staff all around the terminal assisting passengers.

Compared to many other airports it is standard during peak hours you hardly can move freely in the airport. The duty free is small with limited items available. For such a transit terminal it is not entertaining/accommodating enough. The toilets need improvement but still adequate. No trolleys available so you need to carry all of your cabin luggage when shopping in the duty free and the queue of the payment point could be a nightmare.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2010-11-03,Similar to my previous review as little has changed for transit passengers security and immigration process quite quick but this could depend on how many flights are arriving at the same time. Ground floor always seems to be crowded duty free shop poorly set out I've never been able to purchase anything here due to the long queues much better to use the smaller duty free shop on the upper floor. Plenty of seating available upstairs and as the seats have armrests it stops the backpackers lying full length still not somewhere you'd want to spend a long time. If you have along stopover there is the Oryx lounge $40 for 6 hours but before you pay check there is a Melbourne flight due to leave within the next 8 hours the rudest most inconsiderate people I've come across for a long time.

When I arrived the queue for the baggage screening was short so was straight in checkin was fast immigration was not so fast and final security check was okay as the immigration lines were throttling the amount of people trying to get through. Once inside you go straight into the duty free area of which there were plenty of cigarettes but everything else seemed to be lacking for example the only decent champagne was a '98 Dom Perignon everything else was Moet or less. To be honest they did have everything you could want i.e. electronics Mont Blanc Hugo Boss etc but the range they had of each was limited and expensive compared to UK High Street prices. There were a few shops on the upper level but the main shopping was a large single shop on the lower level. Food was also limited no restaurants just 2 food courts at separate ends of the terminal both were very busy until gone midnight then they were almost deserted. Opposite the far food court was a small childrens play area. One thing you could find plenty of was toilets and smoking rooms however some of these are 'hidden' so most people crammed into the smaller easily accessible rooms whereas the larger rooms were empty. At the far end of the terminal were a mosque and next to it a quiet room. The quiet room has very comfy chairs but none were free so a few people were sleeping in the mosque despite the sign ""No sleeping in the mosque"". On a previous visit here I was with BA and had lounge access this makes the airport a much better place to be.

doncaster-sheffield-airport,/airport-reviews/doncaster-sheffield-airport,Doncaster Sheffield Airport customer review,C Stephenson,United Kingdom,2014-08-15,I've used the airport several times this year and on a Monday morning it's an incredibly quiet place. Generally it's not bad although we were locked into arrivals by mistake on one occasion. It's like a smaller version of Liverpool airport and suffers from the same atmosphere. Signs warning the approaching motorist of dire consequences should they not comply with a list of regulations serve as a welcome. Then one is charged to use the drop-off zone even though a few yards away you can park for free for 15 minutes. The 15-minute rule both here and in the drop-off zone adds a little extra inconvenience to the experience as it makes it difficult to be met by a partner with a car (they may be obliged to drive around the airport for a while if your plane is late). Then we are regaled inside the terminal by loud warnings about wheel-clamping. With about a dozen customers inside this seems less than helpful to the ambience.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The airport is small and basic but to be honest we checked in late to save boredom and everything was ok. The WHSmith could do with being a little bit bigger as it can get a little crowded the Wetherspoons restaurant is probably the best feature. Basic bathroom facilities but all fit for purpose. Would be nice to see the airport expand a little but I guess that comes with more flights. Overall it was a pleasant enough experience coupled with the fact it only took us 20 mins to get home after baggage collection on return. If you can fly out of Doncaster id say support it as much as possible. Another plus about Doncaster was parking right outside the terminal major plus after any flight. They have a play area for kids which a nice touch and thoughtful never seen one of these even in the best of airports so 10 points to them. Id say Doncaster is a clean stress free airport with decent staff and a basic selection of things to do.

This greatly varies to Terminal 3, where all the Emirates flight flies into (which is the posher terminal). Absolutely amazed at how bad the condition of the terminal is, considering this is a main hub for tourists and that this is Dubai. My flight from Muscat to Dubai was only 45-50 minutes long however the queue at the immigration? 1 hour 10 minutes - longer than my flight. The immigration was jam packed. Regardless the day or the time! I flew in on a Thursday afternoon (4pm): Packed. I flew in on a Monday morning (11am): Packed. I flew back in on Wednesday (12am): Packed. Oh and not to mention, it was boiling! I don't know if the staff noticed just how packed it was, but they certainly did not notice just how the amount of people equals to more body heat.

You seem to have to walk a very long way between gates particularly if you are moving from A gates to the far end of the B gates. If your incoming flight parks on a remote stand - as mine did - your transit time can be very long. On the plus side the Emirates lounges are good - if you get the time to enjoy them. No doubt the duty free shopping is also good - if you get the time to do any. I was disappointed by Emirates and the DXB experience just increased my disappointment.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,K Cornelius,Netherlands,2014-11-05,Arrived on A380 from Amsterdam over 2 hours late because of on the one hand late departure from AMS and on the other hand being put in a holding pattern for an hour. That would have left still one hour for my transit to Bangkok but I hadn't counted on being parked 25 minutes by bus away from the terminal building. Imagine 500 people to be bussed to the terminal. Even though I was in the second bus out by the time I passed security and could start looking for my connecting flight the gate was closed. Queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed transit desk followed.

After a long flight the last thing people want is to get on a bus - to me this cheapens the experience and is not a good look for a relatively new airport and b) I found the entire airport to be overly commercialised - just too many shops and I think there could have been a few more places for people to be seated.,NA,NA,NA,7,0,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Often these places are full with litter as the staff cannot keep pace with the plethora of visitors. In general too few places to sit kill time and even for airport standards over priced. And besides shopping for ostentatious items there's very little quality in terms of entertainment to be found at that airport. But it gets even worse when you enter Dubai.

Bag drop off consists of huge queues at peak times. Half the desks are empty and they prefer to have staff herding passengers around instead of checking them in. No other airport in the world finds it a normal process to have people working full time to pull people from the main queue for the closing flight queue as they know they will miss the flights. In T1 I used to just wait at the closing flight queue instead of waiting for nothing at the normal check in. Then generally if you are on a short haul you may have to walk to gates in T1 anyway. Once had our aircraft brought back to the ramp as they had departed minus 10 passengers due to delays in T2. Security has improved in timings in T2 and found that more organised now but watch out for Aer Lingus sharks monitoring the queue for oversized cabin baggage to send you downstairs again. Airside services are nice and if departing T2 terminal its a pleasant experience just painful to get there. Of course pre clearance for US flights is a great plus. For arrivals prepare to walk and if you arrive in business hours car hire consists of a mini bus to main yards 15 min away. So factor this in unless you go gold with the hire company.

dublin-airport,/airport-reviews/dublin-airport,Dublin Airport customer review,J Bailey,NA,2008-11-06,"It all depends on where you are going but it does not really matter because it is all bad. The airport is very badly connected which is a huge failing and is totally unacceptable. No direct metro or train and so is very inconvenient. Reasonable sort of distance from the city so that is ok. Parking is hideously expensive and so are taxis so that is not good. As you have no other choice of airport you screwed so buckle up and get on with it.. The place is a building site at the moment with new terminals springing up on top of old ones. Check in Hall is old and tired but works except at peak times when it is bedlam. Security is actually good pleasant and efficient - so top marks on that score. The airside is chaos - the ""mall"" just inside security is diminutive narrow and very lacklustre frankly bad. there are too many useless over priced retail outlets and not enough food options. If you travel from pier B it is close but the arrangements they have for US flights are cattle like. Do not go down until you absolutely have to. Pier C is fine though with insufficient seating. Pier A is quite distant and really dreadful in terms of facilities of any sort. Pier D is somewhere in France and is disappointing when you get there after such a long walk. Arrivals off the plane. Bad at the outset because except from Pier B you have miles to walk and in Pier D's case a couple of counties.

In the meantime if you suffer from claustrophobia give this airport a miss (if you can)? The queues for the gates cut through the bars and cafes of the departure lounge and the space between yourself and the obligatory seats is devoid of space. There are no piers so walking out onto the tarmac in all weathers is a chance you certainly have to take. Arrivals is chaotic where the number of automatic immigration scanners don't match the number of people with the new biometric passport so fast track doesn't exist. It was quicker to go via the immigration official. It would certainly appear that demand on this airport has certainly been outweighed by its size and content.

She then proceeded to search me for a whole 10 minutes after that she used the mobile machine on me and said I was fine to go. Why couldn't this over enthusiastic girl have used that first.

This is far from the first occurrence since the new security hall was opened but this now appears to becoming the norm at EDI during any busy time. Escalators were roped off with everyone being redirected to the stairs and lifts. Staff appeared to be doing their best and calling out for passengers on flights closing to come forward but some staff were clearly inexperienced and giving out wrong information - particularly the guy at the top of the stairs who told me that easyjet+ customers can no longer access fast-track which is just plain wrong. He maintained this even when I showed him the fast-track symbol on my boarding card.

On arrival two weeks ago check in took over 45 minutes and there was only 36 people in the queue. There were two staff at the desk but one spent most of the time on the phone. After this we went upstairs to security which is a joke. Only two lanes open with hundreds of people waiting in line. Staff are off hand and rude. New security halls are coming into service which is great but why is there a need to provide such bad service at the old ones? Security needs to be done properly however surely more lanes can be kept open to get the passengers through. We arrived at the airport more than two hours before the flight and only just got on the plane with no breakfast and having spent not a penny in the fancy shops because there was no time left. Returning was no better. The plane disembarked onto the concrete and we were left standing outside the building in the rain for 15 minutes because immigration didn't seem to have its act together and we therefore were not allowed inside the building.

Had checked in online and had only hand baggage. Went directly to security where we were forced to wait outside closed doors for five minutes. Edinburgh is transitioning to a new security hall. The passengers who have already been through security in the new hall have to cross at right angles the passengers who have yet to go through security in the old hall. Their solution is to close the doors to the old hall let the ""new hall"" passengers cross then close the doors to the new hall and let passengers pile into the old hall. We were told not to go to the new hall but wait there for the old hall. So we waited. On entry we found an enormous queue of passengers and only two security lanes (plus fast track) in operation. This was rush hour at Edinburgh airport. There was no calling of passengers forward for flights that were already boarding it was a case of hurry-up-and-wait (and no information). The passengers were shirty the security staff were harassed and rude. Bottom line - despite being an hour early for my flight and only needing to get through security I missed my plane. I wasn't the only one - three of us converged on the boarding gate at the same time. The only alternative flight was towards the end of the afternoon so my trip was cancelled. Edinburgh security used to be a dream (10-15 mins even during rush hour). Now it's a nightmare. There's no information on the website to let you know to be very early for your flight.

We had to stay on the plane for 1 hour doing nothing as customs was full up and there were no stairs available.

What a mess the Frankfurt airport system is. Landed on time after a great flight with 40 minutes to when our other flight to DFW was to take off, should be easy we thought! The jet bridges not used, so we had to climb down to the tarmac via stairs, then wait for buses to take us to terminal A. Bus took a while to get there, then we were ordered off with no explanation as to where we needed to go - we found someone who told us to follow signs to terminal Z. Followed signs which lead us to a train station, we boarded this and got off as indicated, then walked for 5 minutes only to find we needed to go back through security and passport control, all lines were long. By the time we got into the long line for security, our plane was already boarding, and there were a good 100 people ahead of us. After 10 minutes we managed to get someones attention and we were ushered towards security. What an attitude these security people have, have never been treated so badly in all flights I have taken. The passport control was not much better either. Next is the Duty Free maze, what a joke fighting your way through this lot trying to get out of there. We followed the signs to Terminal Z, our gate was 69(the last one) with over half a mile of walking to get to it. At the gate down at least eight flights of stairs to the bottom, only to find we are back out on the tarmac. The plane was parked at the cargo terminal on the other side of the airport.

Why passport control between and within Terminals? Evidently the concept of an internally secured passageway eludes management. Signage also seems to be a foreign concept. If you know there are multiple passengers with mobility problems or families with small children on a flight perhaps try a little harder to get to a Jetway instead of having them struggle down steps and onto a packed bus. 1960's Heathrow at it's worst. We did however find the notorious Tunnel possibly a filled in drainage ditch with just as much charm. My wife is slightly mobility challenged. This makes endless stairs/corridors difficult and puts a premium on functioning lifts. I dare say even fully fit individuals would not enjoy the experience.

And my experience has been confined to Terminal 1. On a recent trip it took two hours to go from Gate C13 to Gate A40. There was just one official checking passports at the immigration gate for entering the Schengen zone so loads of passengers were pushing in with varying degrees of politeness because of their earlier flights. On the other hand transferring from Gate A34 to B23 was very smooth with the moving walkway in the connecting tunnel being fully functional and hardly anyone at the passport control. However after passing through passport control so quickly I had to waste time checking the departure gate for my flight. The departure gate for my flight to Osaka was posted on the monitors at Gate A34 but not on the monitors just outside the passport control. So I was wondering if there had been a gate change. Finally boarding the flight by row numbers proved chaotic though this might have been due to Lufthansa. Transferring via Frankfurt is like being an out-patient in a very poor ill- equipped hospital.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,Peter Goldsbury,Japan,2009-11-23,I used this airport for the first time as a transit passenger. On the outward trip the flight landed at B gates and the trip to Amsterdam took off from B13. I had to pass through passport control and security check but was ushered through the section for Business Class passengers and so avoided much queuing. The relative absence of signs and the general layout seemed confusing especially compared with an airport like Osaka Kansai which I regularly use. On the return trip however the plane landed at one of the remoter gates in Terminal A. On the way I asked at the information desk in English and the lady kindly answered in very flawless German that I had to go through a tunnel. Since the shuttle was not operating the walk from this gate to B26 was easily as long as at Schiphol where I had just come from.

Huge distances to walk through featureless and dimly lit corridors. Large number of missing ceiling panels with wires and pipework hanging down just looks bad. Long wait at passport control and another long walk to the transit - to get to Terminal 1 and all the public transport options. It's all looking a bit tired and in need of maintenance at the moment - unusual for a German airport especially their primary international hub.

I was coming from SFO and enroute to ATH. I had about 3 hours in between and wanted to go into the terminal to buy something at the terminal supermarket. As we arrived in C I went into the LH lounge in C and then exited into Germany. As the ATH flight left from A my re-entry to claim my stuff in C required numerous explanations and checks only to find that in moving from C to A I had once again to exit (non-Schengen) and re-enter again. All in all I have three German stamps for a 3 hour visit - not bad for filling the passport.

The transfer between the two terminals was relatively easy. We had to clear the passport control as we had arrived from Canada. After that down some stairs and through the security scan again. Not sure why this was required as there was no other way to access this area other than from passport control. This could be a hindrance if your connection is too tight as it took us a little bit to get through this checkpoint. After clearing here we followed the signs and took the long tunnel to terminal A. On the way back we arrived at A36 and left from B44. We only had 35 minutes to make the transfer since our arriving flight was late. No problems as we didn't have to clear any security.

The balcony is on the second floor extremely close to the aeroplanes which offers great views of the runway too. It's a fairly quiet airport though so not many planes landing/taking off.

Terminal is quite large for a regional airport and of a modern design. Passport control seemed quick and efficient in all queues apart from mine I guess I was just unlucky in getting the fussiest immigration officer in Madeira I eventually hopped over the ropes to the next desk and was processed immediately. Bags arrived quickly and I reckon the whole process from disembarkation to clearing customs took no more than 15 minutes albeit the airport wasn't busy at the time. Departure - no major problems. Just two check-in desks open for my flight so a queue built up quickly and only one member of staff carrying out security / boarding card checks en-route to the airside area. Once airside plenty of retail opportunities but limited seating both in the terminal area and at the departure gates. Passport control has several automated e-passport lanes in addition to good old fashioned immigration officers. Toilets were clean. All in all the departure experience was quick and painless but this was on a quiet Saturday morning and apart from my half-full A319 there was only one other small turboprop aircraft on the apron.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,Harry Albright,NA,2006-12-10,"To help people avoid the problems that Jenny Eckersley encountered here are a few tips. First of all the signs are for Ferney (note the second ""e"") because that is the French town next to the airport. The only reason for using the French sector even if you are travelling on into France is to pick up a French rental car. In this case follow the ""Secteur Francais"" signs before passport control (do not go through Swiss passport control) and you will arrive at the French car rental desks. (You will need to ask a baggage handler to go and fetch any checked luggage from the Swiss side.) This does not apply if you are arriving from France as you will be in the French sector to begin with. Or if you aren't renting a French car exit through Switzerland where you will have the full range of transport options including trains to the main station and on to France. If you have rented a French car on leaving the airport follow the signs back to Geneva (it's hardly the airport's fault that the French authorities don't sign their roads very well) and cross back into Switzerland. You will go under the airport runway and link up with the Swiss autoroute that passes in front of the airport. Take this in the direction of Geneva (not Lausanne) and continue on the autotroute until you reach the Bardonnex customs post. From there you will link directly on to the A40. On the way back come off the A40 at Bardonnex and follow the autoroute to the airport. Follow the signs for ""secteur francais"" to return your car then go to the Swiss side to check in for flights to countries other than France. If in doubt ask the people at the rental desk for directions to your destination. As for walking miles to the B gates there are travellators. You actually have to walk very little at all. Walks to the gates at Heathrow or Gatwick are much more arduous. Geneva is actually one of the most compact best managed airports I have used. It is true that if you want to shop or eat stay landside as long as possible. Airside most of the facilities are in the main terminal so avoid going to the gates until as late as possible. They really are just pre- boarding holding areas (as they are in most airports).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

glasgow-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-airport,Glasgow Airport customer review,E Barr,NA,2008-02-12,"I regularly commute through Glasgow Airport and remain astounded at how consistently poor it can be despite some great staff. Yes the security incident last year was dreadful and people have coped admirably but this should not allow BAA / Ferrovial to gloss over the underlying issues with an airport that is ""overtrading"" until the extension is completed. Until this happens some simple things could be done to make our lives easier and some real bugbears exist. On International arrivals why is the moving walkway always closed for maintenance / switched-off as it was on January 25th? They do not however switch off the message ""you are approaching a moving walkway"" - actually it is not working - first impressions count and this is not good. Why does baggage always take around at least 30 mins to arrive as it did on February 2nd (as usual)? Most airports around the world are much faster than this and BAA have to take a hard look at itself on this one - are the baggage handlers understaffed? It certainly looks like it and if they are they have my sympathy what with the growth of the airport. I recently used the new SkyLounge and overall it was a pleasant experience with nice staff. On a recent ski holiday flight I was subject to the usual crowd of happy skiers all off on their break and Glasgow Airport was struggling to cope. There appeared to be a ""manager"" running around with a walkie-talkie telling check-in staff not to overload the baggage belts - whilst we were all standing there. I am not sure what good this did as in my case it just seemed to annoy the check-in staff all the more on what was clearly a day that they all dread (with some justification it seems). There are some highlights. The ""mature"" gentleman in the whisky area of the duty free shop is very knowledgeable and friendly and the Caffe Nero is very small but has great staff and coffee. All in all this place is saved by the generally good natured attitude of the staff despite some inconsistent management practices and general failure to recognise that people are not likely to accept this mess without having a voice. It's all very well expanding the retail side of an airport but the priority should be a ""back to basics"" campaign from the top down in terms of customer experience in simple things like check-in baggage and moving walkways.

glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,Paul Cox,United Kingdom,2014-09-19,Flew yesterday Prestwick to Dublin to catch connecting Aer Lingus flight to my home airport Southend. A really pleasant experience starting with the half-price train journey from Glasgow Central. Yes the terminal is a bit 1970's but it is clean and spacious. Food and coffee in departures were fine.

glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,J Bradley,NA,2009-01-06,Over the last couple of years the standards at Prestwick seem to have fallen to match those of the major no frills airline which supplies it with most of its business. From its shabby toilet facilities with cracked wash hand basins broken taps and peeling wall paint to the surly and rude security staff we encountered it provided a totally disappointing travel experience. On arrival at the airport we had to negotiate a ridiculously awkward pair of wooden swing doors at the entrance as none of the automatic doors appeared to be in working order. On to security who seemed genuinely annoyed that people were getting around the one small carry on bag rule by cramming hand bags etc into other bags or more ludicrously as the guy in front of me did by wearing three jackets. It is the only airport I have been through in the last 6 months which applies such a policy. The departure lounge was crammed with people and appears unable to cope with boarding more than one flight at a time. Their attempt to board three flights simultaneously when we were there descended into farce with people struggling to even reach the queue for their departure gate due to the crowds and confusion. My advice would be to stay landside as long as possible the dining and drinking area there is much more spacious and comfortable. In the years immediately following its revival Prestwick was a good airport and did what it did well. Whilst it may be content now to cater only to budget and seasonal charter airline business it should at least make an attempt to present itself as a reasonably comfortable place to spend a couple of hours rather than just a soul-less transit station,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,J Taylor,NA,2006-01-17,"Most of the comments are correct in that Prestwick only survives to the detriment of the west of Scotland because Ryanair use it. Ryanair insisted on calling it ""Glasgow"" although in typical Ryanair speak that city is 30 miles away. And being a 50's airport is sadly lacking in most modern passenger handling arrangements but thats Ryanair too. Their bucket seat operation deprives the true Glasgow Airport of the short haul international services which also offered through links to and from more distant areas not served direct from GLA. Examples Lufthansa Air France Sabena once operated giving links worlwide. They or another carrier still operate to other Scottish Airports. Edinburgh Airport illustrates the damage Prestwick and Ryanair operation is causing to the true expansion of international routes at Glasgow with a steady influx of short haul flights to Switzerland Germany Russia etc. As a consequence Edinburgh is now starting to attract some long haul international airlines Delta Continental plus long haul charter previously the role of Glasgow. With a population base of 2.3 million in the west and 0.8 in the east the west cannot operate successfully with two such mismatched airports.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

goa-airport,/airport-reviews/goa-airport,Goa Airport customer review,A Walker,NA,2010-08-19,It would seem things have improved here.

Visitors can enter with a visitor pass but have to remain in a small waiting area near the glass front of the airport. The staff are friendly and the security only took a couple of minutes. After security it was pretty much the boarding gate as others have said it's a small airport. Be warned there are no walkways to the planes and all connections are made by bus across the airfield. One concern I had was from the customs where there was a large sign advising passengers not to pay bribes if requested and to report any incidences by calling a number. Not the sort of thing I'm used to seeing but at least the authorities are starting to wake up and tackle corruption in India as it is about time someone did so.

However for international flights it is abysmal. In the mornings there are 4 international flights arriving within minutes of each other. 3 wide bodied dual aisle aircraft from Asian destinations and a smaller aircraft from NZ. The inbound duty free area is ridiculously small and acts more of a choke point for the long queues in immigration with people collecting duty free obstructing Australian passport holders from moving through. There are only 2 baggage carousels despite the 4 flights meaning that the baggage from my flight could not be unloaded onto the carousel as it was jam packed with bags from the slightly earlier Jetstar from Osaka. The Japanese owners of these bags could not collect them because they were stuck waiting for the single immigration official to clear them into Australia.

On the day we departed the queue for security occupied the majority of the check-in hall disrupting most of the check-in desks as it wound around the building. Having joined the queue to ensure that we made our flight we stood for 1.5 hours while people were rushed through to catch their flights. It appears the best solution at Grenoble is not to join the queue at all but to wait until they are rushing people through and get taken to the front and straight through security. The fun really started when we came to board. Having watched our luggage loaded to one aircraft at least we knew the plane we would be boarding! Wrong! Initially the wrong flight was called they called the flight 1 hour later. having questioned the staff at the departure gate they realised there take and called the correct flight number. As we walked to the plane across the tarmac we realised they were taking us to the wrong plane same airline.

Transit Immigration: there are a whole jumble of lines with an unclear demarcation between transit and non-transit flows and no clear signage. Queue jumping/cutting is rampant. Security screening: Transiting passengers are funnelled into a single line for security screening. Only one metal detector/x-ray machine. Terminal looks nice on first sight but that's about it. This was the coldest terminal I have ever encountered. Despite promises of a ""transit lounge"" in the China Southern Airlines Magazine there is actually no such lounge (at least in the international side). It is nigh impossible for non-china customers to get an Internet connection. Decent number of shops but not much variety. There are only 3 eateries. Bathrooms were scarce and filthy. To top it all off nearly all of the customer service personnel were very rude. All in all falls far short of expectations as a supposedly ""modern airport.""",NA,NA,NA,1,2,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
guangzhou-airport,/airport-reviews/guangzhou-airport,Guangzhou Airport customer review,Y Ren,Australia,2012-01-01,Hanoi-Guangzhou-Beijing. Landed from Hanoi it was easy to walk through immigration and customs. China Southern does not tag luggage through to Beijing so I had to pick up my luggage and check-in again in Guangzhou. Immigration was fast staff friendly and helpful. There are plenty of signs to direct transit passengers at CAN. Before immigration there is a counter for international-international transfer. After immigration and luggage pick up area there is a domestic transfer area so you don't have to go outside then upstairs to check-in. It was a relatively easy process. Domestic boarding process can be painful. There are A and B areas and you need to check your boarding carefully. Two areas have different security checking points. It took me another 30 minutes to go through the long queue and pass the security check. There are plenty of shops restaurants and cafes at CAN. Toilets are not that clean.

Only complaint: When our SQ flight landed from Singapore one of the Airport's health officials came onboard to measure the temperature of each and every passenger. (We were expecting to deplane and go past the more convenient thermal scanners as in other major airports). This led to an additional 45-minute wait inside the cabin for all passengers to be screened before anyone could leave the plane.

Pretty much everyone I dealt with spoke excellent English with no apparent problem with dealing with a non-Finnish speaker (not always the case on the Finnair flights). My layovers were long enough that I spent two nights in the airport and I was pleasantly surprised at how relatively comfortable this was. The airport had free wifi that had a strong signal (or whatever you call it) and was extremely easy to log onto. Also lots of electric outlets available to recharge devices. There were both brightly lit and diimmly lit areas for trying to settle in for the night to rest a bit and the ones close to the Terminal 2 entrances that I stayed by felt very safe and secure. At the far end of Terminal 2 (across from the new Starbuck's which was overpriced by US standards) is a more or less full service 24 hour grocery store. This was great for getting food and bottled water at something like one-third of the price that the regular airport kiosks charged and also great for loading up on food souvenirs like chocolate and licorice before flying out. Another thing I appreciated was that credit cards were welcome for even the smallest purchases. I was out of Euros on my way back to the states but my credit card was happily accepted for transactions as small as a postcard and postage stamp. Lines for security and passport control were 1-2 minutes in each case for me so that was fine too. Overall had a good impression of Finland and Vantaa and hope to return in the future for a more extended vacation.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Crowded large queues ridiculous method of booking in your luggage to be handed it back so you can take it to another queue to have it X-rayed. The staff seem unable to organise anything and end up arguing with each other. Making your way across the concourse is almost impossible with the queues reaching the back wall and totally blocking access. I really liked Crete but the departure experience would probably stop me visiting the country in the future. If the Airport is so busy they must be raking in the money but appear to have no interest in improving facilities.

heraklion-airport,/airport-reviews/heraklion-airport,Heraklion Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2007-10-29,"We must have passed through Heraklion airport at much the same time as your previous correspondent but our experience was much easier - perhaps things were quieter because of our late evening flights. We last used Heraklion 6 years ago and remembered little apart from the crowding - until we read the reference about the entertainment value of the bottom step from the duty free as we'd been entertained too! Obviously Heraklion has been redeveloped since then because there's much more space and no longer an irregular bottom step from the duty free. On arrival we too did have a long wait for our bags and I would agree that it was not easy to find which carousel was to be used. While I waited for the suitcase my wife went through to process our car rental pick-up and had it all sorted long before our bag came through. Leaving from Heraklion was far easier than departures we've had from other Greek airports. BA check-in opened early so that only took us about 10 minutes there was no queue at all for the separate baggage drop and there was plenty of seating in the pre-security departure area. We didn't even have to queue to go through security either time (more of that later!) though we're not sure how searching security actually was as the visible screen didn't seem to recive much attention. Lots of space in the departure lounge and much cleaning going on. We didn't try to buy anything as we tend to avoid airport food anyway so I can't comment on price or quality. The only problem that arose was when our flight was called - we were in the wrong depature lounge! We had to go back through security right through the check-in area through more security to find Gate 1 at the other end of the terminal building. We don't think we missed any signs or information but most other passengers for the flight seemed to be in the right place so we assume that it is something to do with ""Schengen"" which is a mystery to us who are more used to shorter journeys with low-cost airlines. By the time we reached the gate the buses to the plane were being loaded but we weren't the last by any means so perhaps we weren't the only ones in the wrong place.

This IBEX flight leaves quite early and I usually travel by taxi from Hiroshima. Check-in and security checks are always very smooth but an annoying problem with the IBEX flight to Narita is that the plane is too small to use the normal gates. So we use Gate A walk down the stairs and across the apron to board the plane. Umbrellas are supplied on rainy days. I would use Hiroshima Airport more frequently when travelling to central Tokyo but I think that the plane still cannot beat the Shinkansen for this distance (just over 900 kilometers). It is a pain to have to travel out to the airport 45 kilometers from Hiroshima undergo the check-in and security check board the flight and then have to travel from Haneda to central Tokyo.

Food-wise there are a couple of places (a Chinese place and a McDonalds) which while cheap for an airport are more than the same chains charge outside the airport in Hong Kong. The security queue's are almost always very fast (I have never queued for more than 5 mins even over CNY) but the immigration (arrival) queue can be a little frustrating and the bags don't always turn up very quickly (which I suppose is a comfort if you have to queue for immigration first it's not time wasted if your luggage still isn't ready). One tip travellers might be interested in knowing is that the shuttle train is not necessary - if you have time to kill and enjoy a stroll you can just walk past all the other gates to get to the other end of the train which travels underneath the main walkway. The main terminal is a 'Y' shape the train goes under the '|' part of the 'Y'. My gripes about this airport (my local airport) are that there aren't any relaxing places to have reasonably priced coffee it's a long way from Hong Kong proper and there is an annex which requires a bus to get to which is a frustration and not all that pleasant if you are unlucky enough to get relegated to one of those gates.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

It gets top scores but other than in comparison to other Asian airports I don't really understand why. It's not convenient to get to the Airport Express is only really suited for business men rather than locals and is also expensive (100$!). The busses are slow the airport is a long way from anywhere on an island. This is gripe number one because I often go to collect visitors so I make the trip far too often. My other gripes are that immigration is painful. I am resident but still need to queue up (albeit in the residents queue) which is better than most visitors - but still far too long especially on departure. The food/shop choices are poor. There is always an enormous queue for the food outlets none of which are any good (a basic sandwich shop would be nice) maybe McDonald's is the most popular (and cheapest). There is no cheap coffee either (except at McDonald's) and the shops are almost without exception fashion clothes watches etc. (all super expensive) which are useless for most people. Security is on the whole (surprisingly) sensible (that is not too strict on the >100ml liquids) and fast. It's clean and has a viewing deck (which costs money another sad point). Overall it's a shame this is my local airport given how far away it is from anyone and how pricey all the shops are.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,J Tung,United Kingdom,2012-06-06,Used to be a fan of this giant airport but the quality of the airport is declining over past few visits. Arrived on a Saturday afternoon flight with a transit to another Asian city. When I booked my ticket on Cathay Pacific they offer a connecting flight with 50 minute lay over. Normally this should be sufficient for an efficient airport but to be on the safe side I opted for another flight that gave me 2 hour lay over in Hong Kong. Once I left the airplane I went to the transit area immediately and was surprised to find a long queue. The security area was not under staffed but they just didn't work effectively. Despite the long queue there was only one line opened (with 8 members of the staff). It took me at least 40-50 minutes just to go through security and had to run all the way to the other end of the airport to catch another flight. This is very similar to the arrival experience where there is always a long queue. On my return journey I travelled from Kowloon to the airport. The Airport Express was still a very smooth journey and the departure experience was so much better than transit. However the airport is starting to show its age and has become less exciting. Expensive duty free limited choice unless if you would like to buy expensive designer clothes.,NA,NA,NA,5,1,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

If you arrive at a peak time - nightmare city. Long long queues to get through immigration up to 45 minutes is possible and most of my experience here is of this time length. It is big so you can expect a long walk if you arrive at the farthest gates to even get to the train to take you to immigration. Shopping and eating facilities could hardly be better though.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,Y Ren,Australia,2012-02-07,I voted couple of times for HKG for best airport before but I will not vote again from my last experience. Transit from SYD to PEK and PEK to BNE. Security staff are rude and unprofessional they all seem sick of their job and tired doing it. I had an hour between my flights from SYD to PEK. Getting off the plane I was stopped by airport staff who told me to wait for other transit passengers and then they will help me through security. A great service but after 25 minutes there is no sign they are going to take me anywhere. When I complained they told me I could go by myself - why make me wait?

We were parked on the apron with the rather surprising announcement that this would make it quicker to get through immigration. Immigration is not fast but not as bad as LHR is for a foreigner. Leaving the hall you are confronted with an overcrowded and confusing mess which is evidence that the terminal which used to be superb is now getting tired. Tried to take the bus to the hotel and the ticket office put me on the wrong bus.

No complaints about anything. Immigration is usually fast and easy especially if you carry a Hong Kong ID card. Connections to the city are frequent albeit slightly expensive via the AirTrain. If time is not an issue take the bus - it is 15-20 mins longer and costs less than half the price of the Air Train. Baggage is efficient and staff are quite helpful. On the few occasions where I could not locate a bag or needed to be moved to another flight because there was a delay or cancellation with my flight the airport staff were accommodating and helpful.

Sure the service is generally great and it's very clean and efficient but half the shops seem to be open only from 9 to 9! Signage could be improved in some areas as (for example) you get half-way to the coin-operated left-luggage lockers and the signs stop (they're on the bottom level of Terminal 2 at the bus station end of the building). Amongst my six uses I had a late night departure and an early arrival and just about everything other than the food outlets was closed. However immigration was quick (first time) but very slow (second and third times in) - baggage on the carousel each time but considering how long it takes to get from the planes all the way into this area that's not really surprising.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,C O'Hanlon,United Kingdom,2009-08-30,Arrived into Hong Kong from Heathrow on an Air New Zealand flight in the early evening. First impressions were good airport was spacious and everything was well signposted. We had to wait around 30 mins to clear immigration which was longer than I expected but still acceptable. Baggage was waiting on the carousel when we made it through to the baggage area and we were able to easily get a taxi from outside the terminal. On our flight out of HKG to SIN we checked in but didn't realise that the majority of shops / restaurants were through the security check point and spent about an hour wandering around the landside where facilities are limited. Airside there are numerous shopping and eating places and we made the most of a three hour delay by having a great meal and looking round the designer shops.

honiara-airport,/airport-reviews/honiara-airport,Honiara Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,2010-12-27,First time ever in Pacific Islands working for two months in Honiara. I had several trips to and from the airport collecting and dropping off our staff. K Joseph has summed up Henderson International extremely well. You walk from the plane to the terminal (it's less than 100 metres). Queue on arrival was not too bad and luggage was available fairly quickly. Plenty of trolleys but note that they are all kept by the baggage carousel. Be warned though that if you're bringing in any equipment for work (I had a couple of computer monitors with me) you will get stopped by Customs and charged a refundable import bond (only took ten minutes to get the refund when departing). If you need a trolley when departing the simplest thing is to walk straight through the open security door where you came out on arrival across the Customs area and grab a trolley - nobody will stop you (most of the time there's nobody there TO stop you!). Most departure days are nightmarish - the plane for Brisbane leaves at 3 pm and you really do need to be in the queue by 12. Although we had a couple of flights where it only took ten minutes to get people checked in the average was at least an hour an a half. The day we returned home it was over two hours. One advantage of the airport being only 15 minutes from the centre of town is that it's possible to check in really early and then go back to your office or hotel until after 2 pm. The only thing to make waiting at the airport bearable is the quality of the milkshakes - the best in town and at 30 SBD (about $5.50 NZ) it's no more expensive than anywhere else in Honiara. The toilets don't always flush and the taps on the hand-basins didn't work so use those facilities elsewhere if you can.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
honolulu-airport,/airport-reviews/honolulu-airport,Honolulu Airport customer review,Mike Villanueva,United States,2012-10-27,Aesthetically Honolulu Airport is a throwback to the 70s. For a place that is supposed to welcome people to a tropical paradise it is heavy and dark concrete architecture. There needs to be more wood greenery and updates to the fixtures. If you are taking Hawaiian Airlines to a connecting neighbor island flight be prepared to walk if you are in the far terminal where some mainland and international flights are parked. Its even a farther walk (or ride on the Wiki-wiki shuttle) if you're on Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Seattle parked at the far terminal and we had less than an hour to our connecting flight to Hilo. It was a mad dash with several co-passengers in tow scrambling for directions. Fortunately we made it in time. The airport is trying to make improvements and there are better dining options along with more shopping for people waiting at the gates for their flight. You may want to eat before coming to the airport as prices are steep.

honolulu-airport,/airport-reviews/honolulu-airport,Honolulu Airport customer review,Benjamin Pittman,New Zealand,2012-09-12,Although they are trying to improve the airport at least in a cosmetic sense it has to be once of the worst designs ever with marathon hikes to go anywhere and dark dingy areas which are truly hideous. Having come and gone through Honolulu some 12 times since early 2011 I can at least say that the immigration security and customs people are generally pleasant and polite this not always being the case in the US who generally have some of the rudest and surliest officials on earth!

Though small in size there is a lovely garden area in a V shape where one can walk and watch the planes dock and depart.

houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,/airport-reviews/houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport customer review,S Healey,United Kingdom,2015-04-14,Our BA flight into Houston arrived somewhat later than scheduled (around 7pm) and we arrived into Terminal E. Upon exiting the aircraft we had a reasonable length walk (about 10 minutes) to reach US immigration. Out of a possible 30 or so desks there were about six open for international passengers at that time of night. The immigration officer we saw was polite and processed us smoothly. We did not have to line up for very long before being processed but I did note that more people had joined a line once we had cleared immigration. It would I think take some considerable time to clear immigration here if there had been another international flight arriving. I saw the Global Entry kiosks before arriving at Immigration but I did not see anyone use these at the time I passed them. (As a UK citizen I am ineligible to use such a service). Baggage for our flight came off quite quickly. One thing I have now noticed is that when the customs form is handed in you now have to show your passport to them also. The taxi rank was not well sign-posted outside and the dispatcher had isolated himself in a glass box!. Once we had managed to communicate with this individual the taxi arrived soon afterwards. Used Terminal D for departures. Nothing much in the way of restaurants airside; would suggest people (particularly children) have something to eat if at all possible before arriving at this airport.

It turns into a completely wasted day. Management seems to not care about passenger flow. They torture you with long lines with 4 or 5 stations out of 80 (yes 80) open. The appearance of security is there so while they delay you anyone can walk off with your luggage because there is nothing to monitor it at the back end. No nexus pass to speed things up. No priority for connections or smooth connection process. Do not buy duty free perfume or liquor etc. You are a transit passenger but it will be confiscated or taxed because you pass through customs. In short I will limit myself to direct flights out of Canada now. Passing via United States is not an option.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The control of queues at immigration and security was appalling with one person processing a huge line of 'visitor' passports. The US citizen line seemed to disappear quite quickly especially when people were channelled into the visitor queues not a good impression for overseas visitors to the US or Texas. Airport staff were rude and unhelpful ignoring questions altogether and giving the wrong answers. The security line management was conducted inefficiently and staff barked condescending instructions in childish sing-song voices. Non-English speaking visitors must've been quite confused.

CO still seems to think that a 30 minute domestic to domestic flight connecting time is acceptable. However if one has to connect from the far reaches of Terminal E to Terminal A 30 minutes is simply not enough time - especially if one is deplaning from the back section of coach in a full 767-400 or 757-300 in Terminal E. There is an above ground people mover (the ""Terminal Link"") which works quite well; however it has not been extended yet all the way to Terminal A from the other terminals although this section is currently under construction. Other than that IAH is a large modern facility that works failrly well and now offers improved shopping and restaurants. Pappadeaux's restaurant in Terminal E is probably the best and there is also an elegant new wine bar in Terminal C that serves food as well.

hyderabad-airport,/airport-reviews/hyderabad-airport,Hyderabad Airport customer review,M Syed,United Kingdom,2010-06-18,Been through this airport a number of times and I find it the best in India. A nice landscaped and well signed access road takes you to the terminal with ample parking. The only drawback there are just 2 (1 each for domestic and international) entrance points and 2 exit points at dep and arrival levels for passengers and these get very crowded. The main terminal hall is airy well lit and smack clean. One doesnt feel congested with a good and organised number of check in counters. Very impressed to find a laptop and mobile charging kiosk in the checkin hall itself .The dep area has an array of different food joints duty free shops (overpriced) children play area small smoking room and also a prayer hall.

ibiza-airport,/airport-reviews/ibiza-airport,Ibiza Airport customer review,Ian Fraser,United Kingdom,2013-11-13,Made our annual visit to Ibiza in September. Some changes some good some bad. The good now a silent airport no plane announcement but the gates are now available on line 24hrs before and put on the boards 1 hour before departure verbal announcements happen if this changes. Plenty of seating in the departure areas and all together a pleasant airport to sit and wait for departure. The bad most arrivals are bussed to the terminal last year and previous it was a 75 yard straight to passport control now they have put in walkways and it is now about 600 yards to walk up and down for old people us not good especially when easy to adjust the straps and cut down the walking distance when little arrival traffic. Getting out similar this year now 3 funnels for customs which feed into each other creating one big bottle neck with those who are leaving it to the last minute trying to push through to the front have made what worked into a disaster.

I was dreading the return experience. However this time I noticed another transit and security facility only about 100m away that was hardly being used!

First a security check has been added after you leave the transfer desk if you are taking a transit flight. Second a number of foreign nationals can now purchase a visitor visa upon arrival at IST if they have a US UK Canadian or Schengen visa or a permanent residence card of those countries. The catch is that if you happen to arrive on flight from the US you can not purchase a visa from the booth closest to your flight.

Getting your VAT refund at the airport is a nightmare. You have to stand in a long line-up for Customs. After passing security the VAT refund kiosk is poorly marked. Out of 3 windows only one was open and the line-up was very long. As soon as I got my refund I noticed our flight was boarding and we had to race to the other end of the airport to catch it. When we first arrived in Istanbul we had arranged for transfers to our hotel. But the driver was nowhere to be found. After inquiring with other drivers one of them called our driver on his cell phone to come pick us up. Clearly I would avoid Istanbul Airport if you can.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

First time 4th of August from Brussels to Bangkok with transit in Istanbul. 25th August for return flight to Brussels. Both times the security lines moved quickly because all security lanes were in operation. 4th of August it was around 22.40 and there were lots of transfer passengers but on the return on 25th August around 16.30 it was much quieter. Both times the terminal and toilets were clean. Prices at the bar were very expensive. Lots of shopping opportunities with reasonable prices for Duty Free. Boarding for Ho Chi Minh via Bangkok at 00.40 was well organised in boarding zones. The 19.10 return to Brussels the gate agents did not announce that the flight was boarding. You could only see it when the waiting line began to move. One female gate agent was not friendly The planes for the return flights from Bangkok and to Brussels were parked at a remote stand.

The visa stamp was obtained pretty quickly then through passport control to get my bag on the way into the country. Coming home the airport was pretty efficient to going through security and passport control the only slow bit was the Austrian airlines check-in desks opening less than 2 hours before the flight. The only thing that let down the experience is the price of food and drink at the airport it is really expensive so you people have been warned I worked out the two pieces of cake and two cold drinks would have cost about £18 in English currency no thanks it's free on my flight.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Leaving was another story. We were flying to Tel Aviv and the recent tension between Turkey and Israel was obvious. There were checks and counter checks. Passport control was tediously long with officials on a go slow. They checked every page of our passports with no consideration for passengers boarding times. When we arrived at the gate with about 5 minutes to spare we were confronted by a sign saying that the gate number had been changed to the other end of the terminal. With travelators out of action the walk was extremely stressful. Rounding the corner to the gate we were confronted by another long line to pass through another x ray security check. Thankfully a man let us take his place at the head of the queue. In a lather of sweat we made it to the bus to take us to the plane it remained stationary for about another 10 minutes with no air conditioning before leaving the terminal.

Queues for Passport Control so long they went out into the passageway beyond the zig-zag lines of railings. 45 minutes later arrived in front of an Immigration officer and was processed promptly and courteously. The queue seems to be divided into three chunks; one for Turkish nationals and two for others. My section fed eight inspection desks. Only two were manned although the section for Turks had many more officers and small queues. I have found this to be a frequent experience and not a pleasant one.

The outer corridor and kerbside felt so crowded and messy that we just wanted to get a taxi as quickly as we could upon arrival. Similarly upon departure we quickly walked through these areas and headed straight away into the check-in hall which was fortunately accessible only to passengers. We traveled with an infant and we were disappointed to find out that a proper baby nursing/changing room was only available past check-in hall and before the immigration counters. Having gone through immigration we felt that backtracking was a hassle. Post immigration we found that the area did not have sufficient seating although the concourse was not particularly crowded and there were not that many flights departing at that time. We then stumbled upon a pay-per-use lounge called Mutiara Lounge. Entry was 80000Rp (approx. USD8) per person which we thought was cheap.

Instantly impressed by the extraordinarily friendly ground staff at the airport. Immigration and customs were very efficient and I did not expect actually a smile and a warm greeting from a custom officer which I met only in Japan. Generally the airport service is one of the best I have experienced and I think this is Japanese culture. Airport was spotlessly clean and janitors were always present in the airport to clean the terminal. Facilities in the terminal were fine but what impressed me the most was the Sky View observation building where I stayed for 2 hours for plane spotting. No wonder it was very famous for its beautiful scenery and the shops were great as well with kind staff. Return flight 8 days later to Hong Kong very early in the morning (9:10 flight). There were just a few people and the terminal was quiet. Relaxing music was played which made my stay in the departure lounge extremely comfortable. Still warm smile and greeting from check in and security check staff. The other airport in Osaka Osaka Itami International Airport is almost as good as Kansai Airport.

The whole experience very organised and clean and above all positive. Just a tip you cannot use a credit card to buy a railway ticket into Osaka it is cash only. Flying out of KXI to FRA was a very positive experience. International Departures are on the 4th level large Check-in groups A-G and then up an escalator to Security Checking. On International Flights the usual European Rules on liquids apply. Again very quickly processed down an escalator and into International Departures which is a long thin hall backing the piers with the usual selection of shops. There is free WiFi available.

I was especially put off by the woman at the information booth who spoke very poor English through a face mask making the whole exchange a rather surrealistic encounter.

kansas-city-airport,/airport-reviews/kansas-city-airport,Kansas City Airport customer review,F Martin,United States,2014-07-03,There are good things and bad things about the set up of this airport. The biggest plus is the small size which makes it easy to get to where you need to go without having to walk through long sections of stores restaurants lounges etc. However that's because they don't have those amenities except for a couple so if you are a seasoned traveler who expects those you're out of luck. There isn't any real connection to public transportation here (only buses in KC) so you have to take a taxi use a shuttle to your hotel or pay to park in the lot and take a shuttle to and from the lot to the airport. The bathrooms are generally clean and not busy. The waiting areas are small but I've never seen it too crowded either. Security is right there at the waiting area so there's little walking you need to do between entering the airport and getting to your gate. The airline availability here is not ideal but it's adequate to get by. Basically if you aren't expecting to spend much time at the airport it can be quite nice to breeze in run through security and sit down ready to board your flight. If you are used to the amenities of bigger airports expect to be disappointed. Although there is talk of a huge billion dollar plus expansion to be done at the airport but that all depends on whether the people here want their tax dollars to pay for it and so far the attitude has not been positive.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

For Nepal standards they do their best. Customs are always friendly especially if you can greet them in their native language! On arrival it goes always very quick if you have your visa already. Baggage claim can be a bit disorganised but most of the times you can leave the airport within half an hour after leaving the plane. On departure just make sure you are in time or even better make sure you are a little bit early. You'll be one of the first in line for a fast check in.

At Terminal B (the oldest one) everything was like usual but since the new Terminal D was recently open for operation number of passengers there somewhat reduced which means that things have become more efficient. I had no delays at security or passport control on both departures and arrivals. Bus service on departure was annoying (cold and windy weather) but on arrival they gave us a jet bridge to deplane. Didn't have hold bags so was off the airport 10 minutes after arrival. Talking about Terminal D (newly) opened I liked it in every aspect (bright airy plenty of seats lots of jet bridges so no bus rides any more) but it has absolutely no places to eat or buy anything. I realise that it just opened for regular flights and traffic is low but such basic needs as cup of coffee or snack must be respected.

Terminal F is rather small and there are not many things to do; food and drinks are on the expensive side (they have only got TJI Friday's and Costa Coffee).

The food and drinks is more expensive than outside airport but is typical of all airports and train stations-I have paid 5 euros for beer in Amsterdam and Prague Airport. The departure terminal has recently undergone upgrade and is looking better - they have also installed a glass smoking area just before the passport control exit barriers. My experiences of baggage reclaim support other comments - theres still much work to be done here. On entry also queues can be frustrating and slow.

Signage is poor it is a very old Soviet building that has had a cosmetic decoration yet is simply not big enough to handle extra traffic. The check in procedure is a joke only one belt shared with 6 check in desks passengers then have to leave by an exit door and go outside around the back to a second building housing the departure gates. The departure area is basically 1 room with a duty free shop no bigger than 15m m2 There is seating for only around 60 while when I was there more than 200 people crowded into the room. No facilities for refreshments and the plasma screens show no flight info just weather reports. Expect pandamonium as military police airline staff airport officials and heavies in black bomber jackets all seemingly want to control things with the result being chaos. Incoming passengers face piles of baggage passed directly from the tarmac through a door there is no reclaim hall-just a 6m corridor. This place makes Boryspil look like a palace. The only advantage is the 7 km from the centre of Kiev as opposed to KBP 33km. All the same be wary of taxi drivers asking for extortionate fees to unsuspecting arrivals- better to get a bus from just outside main entrance. There is an ATM machine to get some Hirivna.This airport is a long way towards being capable of the same standards offered by KBPand will be interesting to see if the lower fares offered by Wizz can actually benefit customers who expect more.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-10-31,KLIA feels like it used to be a top-notch airport but has fallen to neglectful bad habits. It's just not well kept and feels a little dirty and cheaply run. The shops are okay (standard big-Asia-airport shops) but still have a sort of tacky make-shift feel about them unlike Singapore or Hong Kong and more like some Manila terminals or SVO (Moscow). My biggest complaint about this airport which I didn't spend a very long time in is the immigration queues. I didn't have any luggage but the queue for immigration was very slow moving. This is partly due to the number of Chinese nationals trying to enter (on my flight from Hong Kong) - and it certainly slows things down a bit when immigration staff insist on checking return flight bookings for certain passports (and in some cases rejecting them - something I have never seen before - telling passengers to contact their airline for assistance after being denied entry initially!). As a British passport holder getting past the lady at immigration was very smooth but there simply weren't enough staff for it to be acceptable by today's standards for big airports - particularly if they insist on checking Chinese peoples itineraries. My other gripe is the lack of reasonable coffee in departures - the best you can find is a McCafe without paying silly money: there is no other major coffee chain inside the airport (that I could easily find and at 6am I was looking pretty hard!).,NA,NA,NA,5,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

While KLIA is all stainless steel and glass KLIA2 is more white paint and glass. It's set up for much better comfort than the old LCCT terminal but unfortunately it's just not ready yet - there are very few useful facilities for transit passengers at the moment food options in the transit area are limited to MacDonalds and Gloria Jeans no bar no massage almost no ATMs limited duty free there are a couple of lounges but one shuts long before the last flight and the other is very remote and has no showers. Long walks to and from the gates with few travelators. Wrongly the toilets are already smelly and I encountered a broken-in-half toilet seat.

To be fair the airline has its own terminal so this review relates to that one. The Air Asia terminal has no transit facilities - so you need to enter Malaysia and then exit via Immigration. So be sure you have a visa if you need one. You can only check in for your continuing flight about 2 hours before departure and there are few facilities available before you get to the departure gates (after immigration). There are very few chairs and the crowds are huge so don't expect to find a place to sit. The air conditioning hardly works and KL is a hot tropical city. Its less comfortable than most Greyhound bus stops in the US in fact its the worst air terminal I have ever had to go through. Availability of food or drink in the check-in area is very limited. Bathrooms are dirty and several facilities are broken. This is an awful terminal in almost every respect - so I won't go on and on.

First time flying AirAsia but probably the last time. It was nightmare. The whole terminal was chaotic. It felt and smelt like a fish market. Overcrowded disorganised and not enough signs. You need to go through scanning for your luggage first then check in counters. It was so disorganised. Nothing at waiting area not enough seats and dining options and very dirty. Then you will have a long march to the aircraft. Landing experience is not much better. First long march with no signs. Once you are outside the shed another chaotic parking and pick up experience.

The airbridges are not working either for arrivals or departures so short bus ride to an efficient immigration counter and then on to large (6 belts?) luggage area. Baggage out quickly on both occasions then a short walk through to taxi/coach area. Departures are a bit of a nightmare because of strict security and the fact there is little room landside/airside when more than two aircraft are due out.T he executive/business lounge(?) for BA Emirates etc is landside but you can check in at the lounge which saves the big hastle with luggage queues etc. Lounge is very poor - coffee/tea/soft drinks with veg/nonveg samosas only and the loos were without paper and awash - and this in an Executive Lounge! You are not called through until your incoming aircraft has landed and once through passport control (quick with 10 desks) you pass through further security to a small holding area with tiny snack shop  a duty free area and seating before boarding. Your duty free is delivered to you as you hand in your boarding passes when leaving. You wouldn't want to be stuck there with a delay.

To be fair the main terminal was far better than the low cost terminal as it was quieter and more spacious. The big lacking of this terminal was that the air conditioning did not seem to function properly causing the whole airport to be humid hot and uncomfortable. The departure hall was almost empty with very limited choices of shops and restaurants. My feeling was that this airport was simply under used and should definitely need more to- and-fro flights.

I have noticed huge improvements with this service as they now photocopy your passport getting your passport stamped at the visa place (which did ease up the whole transaction). I did notice however that there was no information with regards to the price for the visa. Last time I came, I paid 5kd but my boyfriend (on an American passport) didn't pay for any. I actually had to Google up the actual cost and turns out its only 3kd. Anyway the whole visa process was easy thankfully. 2) It was not notified to us that those who already have their passport stamped at the visa application area can just walk through the immigration without going through the queue as you already have your passport stamped. 3) Coming back to this airport and heading out to Abu Dhabi almost gave me a heart attack. This airport has a weird way of organising their check in counters as they would group some airlines in one gate/area (e.g. Omanair, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways would be in the same check in area). Passengers are required to stand out the airport and look at the direction to figure out which gate/area they need to go to check in. Anyway, as I entered the airport, I noticed there was a long line at the luggage check going out to area I needed to get my boarding pass. I have already checked in online and all I needed to do was get my boarding pass. I didn't even have any luggage to scan as I flew in the same day as I am heading back out. My flight was due to leave in 1.5 hours and I noticed that all those that queued up were ones that were flying with Emirates. Thankfully, the security guy at the luggage check allowed me to jump the queue (scan just my handbag) and proceed to the counter. 4) There are hardly any shops in here. Both before and after immigration. I'm happy to see the new coffee shops area at the end of the terminal which is usually less crowded and more peaceful.

Not impressed by the new lounge not relaxing and not value for money. Escaping the airport onto a brand new Monarch aircraft was a relief! Returning to Leeds 5 days later was a complete farce! We departed a very busy Barcelona some 20 minutes ahead of both Jet2 and Ryanair landed at Leeds and parked on a remote stand. Instead of taking us to the terminal by bus they made us use the dual use walkway. We then got held before the terminal in the freezing cold (not weatherproof tunnel) for 15 minutes as a Jet2 Boeing 757 was boarded on stand 9. In this time we watched 3 further flights land and park at the terminal and begin to disembark ahead of us. Including the Jet2 and Ryanair we left waiting in Barcelona! By the time we got inside the terminal over 200 passengers waited in line ahead of us with a recorded message playing ""Sorry for the delay due to large number of inbound flights"". After a relaxing 5 days away and a great service from Monarch this airport was a huge let down in the way it is organised and operated!

As I drive a ford transit sized vehicle I could not get under the barrier to the cars only drop off and so had to drop my customers off in the minibus drop off area and was totally shocked to find I had to pay £6 to get out. People were driving up to the barriers and finding that they now needed more coins than expected and were reversing out to get change.

The prices are the same at every airport and LBA is no different. I've never had to queue long at security at LBA either before or after the refurbishment's. This is in complete contrast to Manchester where the queues can be lengthy. Shops cafes and bars are what you would expect from an airport of this size. A short walk from the plane back into the terminal building is no hardship. Overall - an excellent airport. Will most happily fly from here again.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2012-05-16,This used to be a pleasant little airport. However in recent years it has been taken over by a company determined to squeeze every last penny out of customers. The drop-off area costs £2 simply to enter so many people simply take a chance and drop passengers off on the mini-roundabouts. There is no taxi rank so taxis bringing passengers to the airport cannot get a fare back to the city. The airport taxis are provided by Arrow cabs which are more expensive than local firms (for example £20 to my home instead of the local firm's fare of £10). If you live locally and are flying home take the number of a local cab firm with you and call them when you leave the plane. The taxi will be waiting for you when you exit the airport. Public transport is poor; there is no train service and the many flights arrive or leave outside the hours of the bus services. The terminal is cramped so it can be difficult for example to get through to the lavatories if you are carrying hand luggage. There are shops but the selection is not good and the cafes are crowded so you will not be served quickly. The only advantage of LBA is convenience if you live locally.

Now it's just another miserable big airport in miniature - all of the bad bits with none of the good bits. As other posters have noted the drop-off experience is ghastly and the £1 baggage trolley charge is crass. The former long stay car parking has suddenly been chopped in two. They made the half that's nearest the terminal into short stay. This bit is naturally deserted since LBA has almost zero business/short haul traffic. So you now walk miles across this empty car park before reaching the long stay somewhere near Horsforth. From here your long walk uphill back to the terminal is compounded by all the old entry doors being permanently locked since they now placed the main entrance at the far end of the terminal. Once inside of course they make you double back since security is back in the direction you came from. A good work out for such a tiny airport. Baggage handling can be lame. On my inbound flight when the bags emerged on the carousel they were from the wrong flight. Pax noted this staff did nothing. So staff were alerted who immediately went on the defensive and refused to help ""we don't know any more than you do"" etc. So we all stood and watched the same bags go round for maybe 20 minutes with no-one taking anything off. Because no bags were claimed there was no room to load any more of the right bags. So they just kept going round and round. Staff refused to take them off bizarrely insisting ""please remove your bag so we can make more space"". Hey they're the wrong bags we kept telling them. ""Don't get shirty with me it's not our fault"" etc. Meantime the other side of the curtain 4 baggage handlers sat around doing nothing with full carts that they could not load - stalemate. Eventually enterprising pax started pulling off the wrong bags manually to make the odd bit of space. At which point ground staff suddenly decide to confuse everyone by announcing ""if your bag has not arrived please come and fill in a form"". So now more mayhem as the pax try to ascertain ""did they not even load the bags at all?"" Reply - ""we don't know any more than you etc"" Meantime the odd correct bag suddenly starts appearing one at a time in the gaps created by the enterprising pax. An hour later eventually everyone got their bag one by one. By the way this was the only inbound flight in an otherwise deserted baggage hall. It really defies belief.

But immigration in Terminal 1 was inexcusable. We arrived at Immigration to find a long queue and were surprised to discover a single immigration officer serving all non-EU citizens. It seems that we arrived while officers were out to lunch. The wait took longer than we expected and we missed our flight. The following day we returned to the airport for our second attempt at departure. This time the non-EU citizen queue was empty with again one counter open. Once we walked up to the officer he informed us that he was not in service and proceeded to raise his voice in disgust when we told him that waiting hall signs were still directing non-EU citizens to his counter. After our stand-up scolding we followed his directions to the EU citizen line just in time to be chided by the new officer for coming to the wrong line.

TAP Air have 7 desks for flights all over Europe which were many as being an early flight. Once we had checked in we had to queue for security which took over an hour in humid conditions with no a/c. Seeing that the temperatures outside were 35c you would expect it. People queue-jumping all over place because they had turned up late and would miss there flight was the major issue.

To the airport's credit it has a new terminal and building is not complete but the co-ordination is a mess. Last time I passed through there was just one person checking all EU/EEA passports. Lots of turnstiles for those who have electronic passports but almost no-one did. You have to show your ticket just to get to the check-in area so non-traveling companions may not come with you...

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,I can only reiterate what I said in October: though it is far from perfect I much prefer Liverpool over Manchester as my choice of airport. I also wonder whether some customers expect to find First Class service at an airport which is served almost exclusively by low-cost carriers. The fact that bus transfers from the car parks are neither necessary nor provided is an advantage as far as I am concerned. Also I have never encountered any unpleasantness from any of the security staff during any of our many departures over the years. Last week the lady who attended to my wife and myself was both very friendly and helpful. Transit through the airport on both legs of our trip was as speedy as usual which was particularly helpful on the outward journey as we had been held up for at least 30 minutes in heavy traffic en route from North Shropshire.

I read the criticisms of both and find that while I agree with some of the things that are said about them both when it comes to choice I would always prefer Liverpool over Manchester because Liverpool is smaller and less crowded. I agree that it is looking tatty around the edges and that the management seems to be doing all it can to encourage spending even removing most of the seats near gates 12 and 3 where we used to wait happily away from all the commercial outlets for our flight to be called. However it has a big airy security area where we have never encountered any long queues whereas we have found security at Manchester both congested and claustrophobic. It has rarely taken us more than 30 minutes from one of the on site car parks to the departure lounge on our outward journey while on our most recent return journey we landed at 23.30 and exited from the car park at 23.50. At Manchester one is lucky to complete the same process in an hour unless you pay over the odds for the closest car parks.

The result: more seats available but hardly anyone using them because of the need to get up to find a screen. Also returning to a very wet and windy Liverpool yesterday really made us aware of how unwelcoming ""International Arrivals"" is.

It has rarely taken us travelling with hand luggage only more than 20 minutes from car park to departure lounge on the outward journey or from aircraft back to our car on the return journey. We have never experienced any unpleasantness from security staff: on our most recent transit my liquids bag was selected for testing but the lady who carried out the testing was extremely polite and even asked me first if I minded. Just as someone else has said earlier I regard the prime purpose of an airport as being to get me to or from my flight as quickly and painlessly as possible and LPL invariably succeeds on that basis.

Departure lounge seems bigger with more retail outlets and a bigger duty free shop. Staff I found to be very helpful and not rude at all as in some other reviews.

For me an airport's principal purpose is to facilitate my departure / arrival as painlessly as possible and LPL has largely done so each time I have used it this year. I have no problems with walking from the car park (instead of having to wait for a transfer bus as at some airports) and travelling hand luggage only have rarely spent more than half an hour getting from car park through to departure lounge. Passage through security has always been swift - but my wife and I are usually flying out first thing in the morning - and we have never encountered any lack of politeness perhaps because a smile and a ""Good morning"" from us creates a favourable ambience. Even when we had an item confiscated last week (a jar of jam - don't ask!) it was done in a perfectly pleasant way and demonstrated that the security staff were vigilant. I would agree that the carpeting throughout the terminal looks dowdy but I think that is due to an unfortunate choice of pattern / colour rather than actual dirtiness. Returning through LPL isn't the most exciting experience in the world especially if two flights arrive almost simultaneously but I have queued far longer at passport control in Spanish airports and had longer walks from plane to exit.

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Ed Smith,United Kingdom,2012-07-01,"I used Liverpool airport for the first time in a few years recently - I have to say the Departure experience has vastly improved - gone now is the terrible old slow security area that forced you to queue on the stairs or tried to blackmail you with a ""Priority Security Charge"" - the security area is now well staffed and you get through it quickly - plus the new route through departures takes you on a nice walk with good views across the airfield and the river. The departure area is well equipped with shops and cafes etc but still with plenty of waiting space and you don't have to walk far to the gates. I like the fact that they have a couple of bits of John Lennon memorabilia scattered about the place - I'd suggest that they acquire some more and turn it into a bit of a mini-museum - little things like that make a difference to an airport experience. Flying into the airport is still a bit rubbish though - you now have to walk along a long semi-exposed walkway through to the arrivals area which is fun when it's cold and wet - fine if you are travelling on your own but this must be an ordeal if you have young kids in tow. To be fair when I arrived baggage reclaim was quick as was passport control and I was in the arrivals area within about 10 mins of touchdown which really isn't bad. Parking fees are pretty steep at the airport - I'd suggest if you are getting collected the best thing would be for whoever is collecting you to wait in a side road and for you to phone them when you are about to go through customs then meet them in the ""drop off"" zone - you still only get 5 mins so you need to be quick (again probably not practical if you have kids in tow or have mobility problems).

Another thing to be careful of they stick to the clear plastic bag dimensions rigorously to make you buy theirs. There is an express queue through security if you want to use it basically its just side stepping the queue and following the crew channel but of course you pay extra for the privilege of nothing really just another money making racket.

It is particularly bad when one queue coming down the stairs has to merge with another queue entering at ground level.

Following the return landing though within 'spitting' distance of immigration passengers were loaded onto buses taken about 50 yards to a (wrong) door then presumably as a result of driver error transported around the block to another entrance marked 'international arrivals'. Here we all got soaked as passengers shuffled up the stairs along the long corridors and then got stuck in an enormous queue for passport control. And guess what they must love forcing people to balance their bodies and luggage on staircases because it's back down steps once more to immigration.

The main gripe still has to be the security processing which is the slowest I have ever encountered at any airport. There are now 6 scanners and all were in use but it still took half an hour to reach the head of the queue where I was then assigned to a smaller queue behind one of the scanners. I soon found out why people moved so slowly. Once in the small queue you have to wait to be called forward to put all metal items and bags in plastic containers. Bags cannot go through unless there is a container so you have to wait till one is available. Then I was astonished when the security staff scrutinised every plastic bag containing liquids to check its dimensions and routinely sent people back to buy a 'regulation sized' bag from a vending machine. A family of five in front of me were all sent back causing exasperation and further delays. Having placed my items in a tray I had to wait 5 minutes to go through the metal detector as two scanners have to use one detector and the staff just seem amazingly slow.

No wait at immigration somewhat longish wait for bags to arrive clean toilets shuttle buses were simple to find nice staff and ok cafes. On departure effective and polite security staff fast immigration no wait at check in. Nothing spectacular but just fine. Free wifi across the building is a huge plus!

The stress level of passengers are off the charts by the time they get through the most annoying queuing system on the planet and trying to placate them with candy as one would with children is absolutely idiotic if not insulting.

If I'd left it any later I'd have been queuing for Departures for more than the 55 minutes it took me and wouldn't even have had time for a quick snack. Clearly the airport is overwhelmed with the number of flights leaving on a Tuesday evening in January.

Most people seemed to be flying to European destinations and were bemused by the chaos.

You enter not via a door but by lift and if you are slow or handicapped and it's busy you could be there for evermore trying to get in assuming you're not run over in the rush.

The road layout on the exit to do this is poor and potentially dangerous. Baggage drop was a complete disgrace.

On return an unbelievable queue for immigration which stretched round several corridors and a shambolic effort to separate inward domestic passengers from international arrivals. Then 45minutes wait at the baggage reclaim - where surprise surprise the belt had broken down.

During that time I have seen it change from a pleasant and small airport used primarily by charter airlines into the nightmare that it is today. During the 1980's I would regularly leave a Scottish airport on time only to spend an hour or so circling over Gatwick due to congestion on the one runway. Departing from the airport today it is obvious that enormous sums of money have been invested into the shopping mall that you are faced with following the security bottle-neck. On arrival however it is a very different matter an assault course is the first welcome to the incoming passenger who is then faced with passport controls that operate in a building site that seems to have remained in the same state for about 10-years floors walls and ceilings all in a state of mess as is the baggage collection area that is designed to create a bottle-neck of passengers blocking the flow from many flights who are trying to find where their baggage will be dumped.

There were bottlenecks on the walk from the gate down to the shuttle trains which take people from the remote satellite terminals to the 'main' part of T5 which houses passport control/baggage reclaim as well as check-in/security on departure. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get on a train, because in many cases the shuttles would arrive from the previous stop (the C gates) already full. Was a bit stressful. At passport control, it was a 30-minute wait for non-EU nationals, expected as this was the morning rush. Immigration officer was courteous and polite (am a frequent visitor to the UK, so minimal questions asked). She endorsed (i.e. stamped) the wrong visa, and when I pointed out her error, she rectified her mistake with minimal fuss. Bags didn't take much time. Very convenient vending machines if you need to pick up a SIM card in the baggage claim hall-if not, there are several shops in the arrivals area selling UK SIM cards, plus WHSmith and a few other outlets. Signage to Heathrow Express clear, and in 20 minutes was in central London. Departure: Arrived on the HEX, and wanted to do VAT refund, but the office was on the other side of the terminal, and quite busy at that, so I ended up ditching-they should have a VAT refund office on either end of the large T5 check-in area. My flight left at 1pm, and there were quite a number of flights leaving, a mixture of European and intercontinental flights. Used self-service kiosks to print BPs, then waited for a good 30 minutes in the bag drop queue. Would be much more efficient to have a proper self check-in service, where passengers can print and stick their bag tags themselves. Although the queue to get into security was short, getting in line to go through the scanner, then waiting again for the bags to come out through the machine all ended up taking a good 15 minutes. By then, only had 70 minutes or so until departure. Bearing in mind that my flight left from Gate B35, which required another ride on the shuttle, only had 20-25 minutes to grab a bit and run. Despite arriving 3 hours in advance, with the all the walking and waiting, felt like I was cutting it close. Overall a mixed bag. I highly recommend anyone planning on doing a VAT refund to get there a good 4 hours before their flight (and of course, you need to be prepared to show them your purchases, so unless it's in your carry-on, you need to do this before checking in your bags).",Arrival and Departure,01-07-2015,Solo Leisure,7,2,5,5,4,4,4,NA,3,1

On return the corridor from the gate to the security/passport area is so narrow its a joke. That said everything is on one level and walking distances are short. Spoilt by the queue at the e-passport booths but made up somewhat by fast baggage delivery and a short walk to get outside for the buses to the car parks.

At our arrival there was a huge queue for visa and passport examination and that should be organised better. Five or six desks didn't work and that number that is present at terminal four just isn't enough for all those people there. Something else that I didn't like was some kind of form that you have to fill in while waiting there are no tables or desks when you can put a pen and form while filling it so you have to fill it in while standing and/or walking in the line. There is no sign that you need to fill that in there are just a few spots to take those forms (and to take them you have to step out of line).

Staff are obviously busy but their surly approach does not make for a comfortable time. Also the body scanner seemed completely out of kilter as it kept on alerting even though I was wearing cotton underclothes and cotton on top - no metal at all. They suggested that my glasses were the problem but they are plastic frames. The staff person on decided then to re-calibrate it but it was totally unnecessary to be exposed to that as there was no good reason for it.

Was excited to visit the new airport with high hopes it would be like T5 but what a great disappointment. The check in area was airy but not as grand as T5. It's clean and basic. There were only two cafes/bar before security - A Costa and a Weatherspoon. There is also a very tiny travel shop. When we entered the check in area it was empty - not many airlines have moved to T2. There was a very polite and friendly gentleman from the airport at the entrance to give you direction and guidance. I assume because it's not occupied solely by one airlines like T5 does the check in desks seem to be more ""traditional"" and less inviting. Most of the airlines are using self check in and bag tag printing service which might save time for some but not for all. Perhaps the airport was still new and not used by many airlines and we also arrived very early the check in was very smooth and fast. Security was also fast but it will be interesting to see what happens when all airlines move in. The check in agent warned us its a long walk to get to the gate. It turned out to be a reasonable walk just a lot of stairs/escalators going up and down. There are not many dining and shopping options in the terminal either. The signature restaurant was a big disappointment. Food was boring and plain. Shopping is also very weak. All in all it's a clean and new airport.

There was no help either to make the flight or to help us if we missed the flight there was no apology and there was no express queue available to people with short transit times. The staff in general were highly rude un-helpful and despite there being a lot of staff members they were standing around doing nothing.

I was connecting from a flight arriving at Terminal 3 to a domestic departure from Terminal 5. The bus transfer between the terminals was pain free and just involved a lot of walking. It was the Border controls and security that had me quite ashamed of what for some people is the only view they get of the UK. I moved through the EU passport border quite quickly but witnessed a large queue for the International passport border trapped with a very rude member of staff not explaining why they were there all of them getting visibly upset and all this staff member would do is tell them to be quiet and wait with no clear view of what they were waiting for. The border agency staff seemed stressed which isn't reassuring. Moving onto security well this was a shambles the staff were not explaining what some passengers should do and then being very rude if they went through the scanners with a belt on the bag scanners were incredibly slow with large build up of people waiting for the bag to come through the other side all the time the staff just seemed to stand there and do nothing looking incredibly bored like it was some kind of torture to be there.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,B Aldridge,United States,2014-06-04,Heathrow is in short a mess. Getting around is a confusing mishmash of walkways corridors escalators and busses. Signage is clear but the airport is nevertheless extremely difficult to navigate efficiently. I have never seen so many people racing through a terminal apparently trying to navigate the complicated layout numerous times to find where they should be. I am fortunate to usually travel business class so I can avoid the cavernous dirty hot noisy and smelly main waiting areas in favor of a private airline lounge. The terminals seem to be organized to generate sales at the stores and restaurants and not for passenger comfort or convenience. Immigration lines are very long and extremely slow which seems to be a problem at airports everywhere. For anyone changing to a domestic flight I would recommend at least 3 hours transit time. Several times baggage claim has been a single carousel serving many flights crowded with hundreds of people. The ensuing chaos makes for understandably frayed nerves and short tempers. Did I mention the airport is dirty? I have noticed on the London subway that the locals just leave trash everywhere but in trash cans and they do the same at Heathrow.

The facilities in T5 are good with several restaurants and a reasonably priced Wetherspoons bar (albeit the bar has a limited seating area for those purchasing drinks and not food). Its a bit bizarre that the smaller Wetherspoons bar in T5b has 4 times the seating. The free wifi is very slow and intermittent worked much better on outward than inward journey. The outbound transit was very quick and efficient. However offsetting this was the usual amount of time to exit/enter Heathrow on the plane - outbound delayed 50 minutes inbound by 30 minutes. Arriving at T5 transfers on 25 May was a disgrace - 1 officer having to deal with fasttrack EU and non EU nationals. No movement at all for 15 minutes. Staff co-ordinator realised eventually situation should be being resolved and eventually 2 more officials came out to assist.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,M Riley,United States,2014-04-22,Make sure to look at your boarding passes to determine whether or not you have luggage to claim (I think if you are flying the same airline both flights your luggage goes to your destination). When I landed at Heathrow we were not given any directions or instructions about what we were to do next. Being an inexperienced traveler I assumed that I needed to pick up luggage so I followed the signs toward baggage claim. After standing in line for at least 10 minutes I realized that my baggage had already been sent to the next flight. The annoying thing was that nobody mentioned this to me. After baggage claim I must have made a wrong turn and got completely lost. The layout of the airport can be very confusing and there seems to be a lack of signage in some areas. I asked several employees for help and no one could put me in the right direction. Trying to find my way through this airport was like running through an endless maze. By the time I reached the boarding gate I had just missed my flight by about 5 mins. I went to the counter to have them put me on the next flight. Told it was my fault and had to charge me $275. The return trip was much easier because I knew that I didn't have to pick up luggage and I was with a group of people so that made it easier. As soon as we got off the plane there was an information display listing terminals according to the airlines so it was simply a matter of following signs to the terminal and departure gate. How did I miss this on my first trip? Where was the information display or clear signs in the baggage area? I guess I simply took the longer confusing route. I suppose some terminals may be smaller or easier to navigate then others. There are some nice restaurants and shops and the flights were pleasant but I will still try to avoid this airport in the future after this awful experience.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

Having flown in on a BA flight from Geneva and departing to Manchester had to queue through the transit immigration desks rather than the electronic gates which took 20 minutes as only manned by 1 official despite there being 4 other channels! Then the joys of Heathrow security queuing for 15 minutes and then being told the equipment had broken and join the back of another queue for another 15 minute wait. I know security and immigration aren't the most interesting jobs around but some pretence at being human wouldn't go amiss as this is the first impression of the UK that most visitors get.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,J Marshall,United Kingdom,2014-03-28,I was very annoyed with the immigration controls this morning when arriving from Sydney via Singapore on a BA flight that arrived at 4.45 am. When we arrived at passport control there was not one single person to speak to. Many passengers were getting connecting flights and looked so confused. They were just left to read the electronic boards. Surely someone should have been on duty to help these passengers. Then as we approached the Passport control area several big flights had obviously come in at the same time but as we had electronic passports we thought we would be okay and would get through quickly. Wrong! UK and EU citizens were all herded into one area and it was not clear that the EPassport area was not available but we did finally see a small A4 sheet of paper which said that the epassport scanners were not operational until 5.30 am. It was 5.20 am so decided to stay in the long queue although some people started queuing for the epassport section. There were two female attendants to the right of this area and when I approached them to ask if I could go through with my epassport I was told quite sternly that I should join the large queue to my left. Then another official came on the scene and looked confused at the large queues and then proceeded to check the scanners and eventually invited people to use the escanners. However these did not appear to work properly because they were not giving any messages out. When one guy removed his passport because it didn't seem to be working the gates opened. This happened to a couple of people. Another member of staff joined the one guy on duty but they did not seem capable of helping people. I stood for ages with my passport in the scanner and eventually tried another one which eventually worked. My husband said that maybe the scanners need to warm up but surely the staff should know this and be on hand to help and advise. What an awful welcome for overseas visitors I was embarrassed because Terminal 5 is a super terminal but the staff need to be more helpful and welcoming to visitors. I flew through Sydney New Zealand Honk Kong and Singapore Airports and Heathrow was not up to the standard of these other airports which quite frankly is a disgrace and someone should be doing something about it.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,G Cleaver,United Kingdom,2014-03-03,I have to say that reading past reviews about terminal 5 relates to the inconsistent performance where one day can be a fantastic experience and the next a forgetful. On outward leg (LHR-IAD) with British Airways bag drop was very quick although the check-in lady could do with a smile. I'm impressed with the structure of this terminal with its wide open walkways and high ceilings very reminiscent of the Asian Airports. It also has the sense of freshness something that all the other 4 terminals lack. Security was a bit slow and took an age considering the number of people in the queue. One thing I must say was after security it was very very busy. Quite surprising considering the vastness of the terminal! Perhaps it was because of the holiday season. Very good range of shops and restaurants/cafes etc and good to see that duty-free isn't a rip off! Next came the walk to our gate which was in the 'B' section of the terminal which meant using the light rail system. Very long escalator trip down to the bottom where the train was located. Must've taken a good 2 minutes without walking. Train was punctual and quick. Disappointing though that if you have a gate located in the 'B' or 'C' section you are cut away from the main terminal which contains the best of shops. Only shop in the B area was a whsmiths. Nevertheless I liked the effort Heathrow have made to move away from the '10km' walk to the gate so to speak. Plane left on time and was overall a pleasant experience. Inward journey was from EWR back to terminal 5. Disappointed that we were not given an air bridge to leave our British Airways plane; somewhat strange considering that this is their hub which means they should have the best facilities for their passengers. Bus took us to the main complex which was near passport control. We were wary of the times we've had to wait in the past so 25 minutes seemed standard. Bag carousel was big and 'airy' and bags were there ready to be picked up. Heathrow connect service to terminal 4 was okay; somewhat tedious since there is no direct service so an interchange is required. Bus to car park was punctual but a bit small. Overall an impressive turn around from the horrible days of cramped airports and long marathon walks to the gate. Hats off to BAA and BA.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Its noticeable how the efforts are trying to be made by Heathrow as a whole to try and improve its status (terminal 5 being a prime example) but there is still room for improvement. Interior looks very dated. Transaero seem to have their check-in zone tucked away from the main area so its a bit of a task trying to locate it. When we arrived there was an ominous-looking queue and we had noticed that the delayed take-off kept on getting extended every 5 minutes! Turned out that our plane was still in Moscow because of the weather so there was a 6-hour delay at most. We were given £25 to spend each in the airport though which explained the queue. Security was surprisingly swift very friendly staff. Giraffe restaurant very good not too expensive. Waiting seats are very hard comparable to park benches. Free Wi-Fi and good range of plug sockets. Something striking is the very long distances to walk to gates. It was a good 10 minute walk even with travelators! On return taxi to gate was very swift and we left the plane quickly. Immigration is in desperate need of a review in terms of services. Very long queues insufficient tables for filling out details (for some reason we weren't given them on the plane). Very grateful to the assistant who led us to the front because of the children (we had already waited 40 minutes).

This terminal is awful. The food is all terribly expensive. The shops are so expensive that no one actually purchases anything from them. The two stores that passengers were buying anything at all are Boots and WH Smith because they have the least expensive items in all of the airport. Security is completely out of hand. Security is overwhelmed due to the number of passengers that travel through this airport. It is my thought that Security has a policy of confiscating items for twofold reasons you're tired and don't want to even bother questioning and that they want you to go purchase the item from one of the stores in the airport. There are few comfortable places to sit and in most cases not enough places to sit. Interesting that they can't have a quiet zone for adults.

T3 is good though it has decent shops/restaurants/bars and quite a lot of them. One thing that obviously needs improving though is the security check/x-ray.

The worst aspect for me was having my bag (laptop bag in my case) taken aside for a random second inspection but then seeing it left there for ages in a rack while staff laughed and chatted amongst themselves seemingly oblivious to the fact that we have flights to catch. At Australian airports such 2nd random searches are carried out promptly and courteously by another officer further on in the process and that's fine. However at Heathrow Terminal 1 I had my bag left in a side rack for ages with staff wandering off somewhere else for a chat and a laugh.

Nasty cramped dirty and poorly laid out waiting area for the departure gates at terminal 3 which has only wildly overpriced junk food available to eat. The approach to the check in counters from the underground must rank as some of the worst anywhere in the world with water leaking from behind a wall seeping across a filthy floor making it extremely slippery and dangerous. However the absolute worst aspect is the understaffed immigration queues. I know it's a constant complaint of those of us unfortunate enough to have to use this airport but management seriously has to start to listen. Clearly understaffed the few officials who are tasked with processing arrivals are obviously over stretched and are struggling to cope with what is being asked of them. I don't blame them for being snappy and irritable as the job they have been given is close to unmanageable but its an absolutely appalling way to welcome visitors to this country to make them stand in endless queues while only 3 or 4 counters out of an available 20 or so are staffed.

T5 both ways. I liked the new C gates concourse and the train system that seems to be efficient despite quite slow. Food and duty free selection is impressive. On departure no queues anywhere. On arrival it was a long immigration line for non-eu passport holders. Despite many wide bodies landing at the same time they only staffed 12 positions. As a result I had 1hr 15mins wait to reach border control. After immigration I picked up my bag (had already been on the belt) and got bus to the city.

Terminal Five clean bright and airy but seemed to be struggling with the number of passengers. Long wait at bag drops stressed out check-in staff long queues at security and food outlets very busy/crowded. Lack of seating at gate - myself and many other passengers were left standing for a long time as the flight was delayed. Great range of shops but a long walk down to A19/A20 if you are in a hurry! Both flights were delayed a considerable amount of time once boarded due to runway congestion - delighted to hear that mixed mode is going to be used on an introductory basis.

UK border control inwards a breeze through the EU passports line (queued for less than 5 mins after 0700 arrival on a Sat) and baggage already waiting at carousel. Reached the big bright arrivals hall in less than 30 mins after touchdown. At an airport like LHR such a feat is impressive. Whether departing or arriving T5 is always a pleasure. Easy transfer to T3 with the LHR express but T3 itself is another story. It is cramped and all thoroughfares are jammed with throngs of pax mostly with overloaded baggage trollies. Seating is an option only if you buy something at one of the food outlets. Queuing at security is efficient thanks to the staff who constantly keep watch and regularly re-distribute the queue. I never sit in the central seating area/food court. Too much like a shopping mall and always unpleasantly overcrowded and noisy. I always go through late enough to have my gate number posted on the FID's and head straight there and it's usually fairly painless.

Same situation in the security control - the staff were friendly enough but there were a few naive passengers who thought it was too much trouble to take off their jacket or insist they wanted to carry their own drink onto the plane. Apart from this the process was smooth. As usual once you are through the security T5 is a fantastic place. We had a meal at Wagamama - a very spacious restaurant very clean although the staff were grumpy and not efficient.

the product as a liquid, even though it is solid, on the grounds that it could be melted to a liquid. I pointed out that this was true of metal as well.

After 10 to 15 minutes you might be able to get off. Staffing at passport control is laughable well almost non-existent so this now takes 30-40 minutes.

Chaotic security with little control over disorganised queues. Sudden opening up of new lines so late comers get through those before them! Resulted in missed flight. Airlines not going to complain as its a rebooked flight. Strange how available the next day flight was-are seats held for this common occurrence? Airport long stay parking buses too infrequent. Inbound passport control slow but who is going to accept this point in today's security climate? On return took longer to get from plane to car than the flight from Naples.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,R Fry,United Kingdom,2013-09-25,It is a disgrace that the new owners of Stansted have managed to turn what was a well run pleasant to use airport into a nightmare. Until recently if you arrived by taxi or were dropped off by a friend it was outside the doors to the booking in desks. Now you have to pay to be dropped off at a ridiculously crowded area and push your cases up a steep ramp which is very unpleasant when you get to your 70s. And if the traffic queues are long you have to pay more for the pleasure of sitting in the queue to be dropped off. Coming back is just as bad controlling a trolley going down a steep ramp is very unpleasant and then you have the problem of locating your lift back home - a mobile phone is essential to find out where to go. After getting to the check in area for some reason or other the time to check in or drop your bags off takes a lot longer despite arriving 3 or more hours before take off. Then as has been mentioned by others there is the very long delays (almost an hour on our last trip) getting through security with rude staff constantly trying to push you through. Again a horrible experience when you are travelling with a family from 4 years old to the over 70s - alternatively of course you could pay (a rip off £35 in our case) to use the priority security gates. As has been mentioned in other posts coming back the queues for passport control are very long and the last thing you want to encounter after a long flight with very tired children. We won't be using Stansted again until they have made substantial improvements - despite being 40 miles further to Gatwick the time to get from home to the plane will be a lot less and much less stressful.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The experience itself is alright but there's no 'wow factor'. What Stansted really does need is a greater mix of airlines especially to long haul destinations such as New York or Dubai as there are currently no long haul flights from Stansted. Once services like these are introduced this will save many passengers having to use the busier congested airports like Heathrow and Gatwick. Furthermore we tend to travel to Romania frequently and it would be good to see carriers like Wizz Air introduce a Stansted-Bucharest service which would save us the hassle of using Luton airport. Clearly Stansted has a lot of potential to attract future long haul growth and new airlines besides Ryanair.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,R Hopkins,NA,2008-08-01,What can be said that hasn’t already been said? There’s always a worrying wait for the car park bus then a long journey. If you’ve not done it yet allow 40 minutes in case you’ve just missed a bus. Exit signs out of the car-park are inadequate even when it’s an airport you know. Outbound journey was delayed on 29.07 so there was a gate change and inevitable rush to join the new queue not popular with ‘first come first board’ airline passengers. The return journey was also delayed resulting in a half hour wait on the tarmac. If the passengers knew what time the rescheduled landing was it’s a bit worrying that Stansted didn’t and so did not have ground staff available. What if there had been an emergency? It can be no surprise to the airport authorities to find a plane has landed. Just hope it’s not two at once that are late which given that the delays were attributed to air traffic control seems pretty likely. Passport control is an utter insult with a scrum to join the queues while non EU citizens get through with little delay. There are no toilets in the area which is also a disgrace after delays. Avoid the toilets in the baggage area! The ladies’ toilet stank of urine and the cubicles are tiny even for a fairly small adult. Once through passport control without luggage it’s a matter of luck how long it takes to get to your car. Last night (31.7.08) it was a fairly typical one and quarter hours from landing to car longer than it took to drive the 60 miles home. Stansted expand?

For a first timer you will need to keep your wits about you. After collecting your bags you face a very very long trip to retrieve your car from the Long stay. Expect your wife and kids to wait a good 45 minutes for you to return. The problem is the pick up point is effectively outdoors and your companions may freeze to death waiting for you. But if they wait in the terminal how are you going to find each other once you return etc.? In practice you have to negotiate some confusing signage to find the 15 minute pick up zone amongst many similar zones. Choose the wrong one and you've got another lap to do. Once parked sprint as fast as you can to find your companions in the airport - the clock is ticking. Sprint back down again with all your trolleys then the next challenge is to find your car. Stansted offers you a number of exit points all designed identically and impossible to distinguish from each other. You will come out at the wrong one the coaches Zone XX eventually you find your car. Load up as fast as you can and sprint back to the ticket machine before the 15 minutes expires.

Connecting from domestic AA flight to International terminal (and vice versa) requires you to get outside and walk. It is not a long walk but can be confusing to folks who is not familiar with LAX.

We arrived from Las Vegas to connect to a flight to Europe and not knowing LAX at all were a bit surprised that there was no ongoing flight information for flights outside of Terminal 4. We looked in vain for an information desk of any kind in Terminal 4 and so found ourselves heading to Terminal 5 hoping to find one there. Was a little surprised that an airport of this size an importance relied on its passengers walking down claustrophobic tunnels between terminals with no transport or moving walkways but put this down to the redevelopment going on. Once in Terminal 5 it took another round of searching for an info desk (with our flight departure time getting ever closer) to eventually find one tucked away in a corner. The patronising attendant told us that we needed the Tom Bradley Terminal which was two terminals along and waved in the vague direction of a corridor which led who knows where. The corridor eventually led outside where we would have hoped to find a map or some form of signage to the terminal. Nothing of the kind could be seen. We ended up asking a shuttle bus attendant for directions after which we walked for 10 minutes to eventually find the right place. We are not stupid people and do not get overly stressed but it was a good job that we had a three hour connection time as anyone with a short interval between flights would have missed by a mile.

This is a good time to try and get your luggage sometimes the officials will let you through to get it sometimes not it's completely random just like everything else... expect anything as they change the procedures regularly and without informing anyone.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,J Warren,United Kingdom,2013-07-10,Having recently used this airport it is clearly evident that it is mainly geared towards low cost flights. The check in area is in desperate need of re-organisation (lots of confused passengers too few check in desks open and under staffed) results in huge crowds all confined in one small space with the other half of the check in hall being empty and unused. On a plus side going through security was quick and well organised. The departure lounge itself was alright with a good variety of (over priced) shops and restaurants. However the boarding system and gate area at Luton seriously needs to be improved; you are forced to shove for a place in the line and then be prepared to wait for a plane that hasn't even landed yet. Furthermore there is absolutely nowhere to sit down in the gate area which could be a problem for families with young children. Furthermore none of Luton's gates are fitted with jet bridges like Stansted so bring a coat with you in case it rains! On return we had to wait for over an hour for our suit case which is unacceptable. They kept stopping and restarting the conveyor (You'd think it would've just been easier to move the luggage onto a conveyor that actually worked properly!).

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Russell Edwards,United Kingdom,2012-05-31,As a frequent flyer all I can say is how embarrassing this airport is as gateway to our country. When you do finally get there after queuing on the roads to get near the airport you then find everything is set up to fleece the traveller out of their hard earned cash right from the drop off area through to the boarding gate. Staff are aggressive and moody gum chewing security personnel seem to be in abundance but its still painfully slow also usually chaotic and overcrowded. Now the new overflow security channels are open which issue forth to the old terminal area - so if you want to use the facilities in the main terminal its a 10 minute walk and don't even think about buying the fast track ticket for security (which went up 25% from £3 to £4 last week) as you will be turned away if they are sending you to the overflow security channels.

Sprinkler system activated and leaking water all over emergency doors in departures. Food outlets over-priced and food poor quality. Security queue an absolute disgrace in terms of amount of time you are expected to wait. I refuse to pay for the express service - you should not have to wait more than 15 minutes regardless of whether you pay extra. Many of us waited over 40 minutes in the normal security line.

The airport is tiny and is located in the residential area so landing there is a curious experience: you can see what people are doing within their houses just from your landing plane. Runway is short so 737 is a maximum size of aircraft that can land there. All facilities are outdated and primitive there is no any food outlet but everything worked fast. They don't have computerized check-in but my e-ticket was accepted with no question. You are off the airport in 3-5 minutes from disembarkation on domestic and 10 minutes on international flight. Certainly city like Lviv (1 mln population) deserves normal airport rather than this old shabby tip[ical soviet era provincial terminal but number of flights to Lviv is small (5-10 daily I beleive) so there is no inverstor for any project in this area. It is clean it has trolleybus link to the city center (25 mins ride) staff are polite and helping.

The cleaning machines were strangely comforting and while the airport doesn't have too many overnight dwellers it could do with a snack/coffee bar that is open all night. Everything else was fine it could just use either a lounge (I had heard of one but I think this was just airside) or some double layer entry points (to limit heat loss) or some heating just for the few months that Macau may need it. Perhaps the airport could work with some of the nearby hotels/casinos to accommodate transit passengers - that would make for a more memorable night than just freezing on an airport seat!

This includes trips up and down about 20 escalators for no good reason. It also includes a trip on an underground railway between immigration and baggage claim this is very disconcerting as the signage is not clear enough to explain that you will still get to your bags. After the train ride you still have to wait another 20 mins for your bags. 2) The signage is comedy - a down arrow actually means carry on rather than go down. This includes signs in front of the lifts - a down arrow means you actually need to go up! The gates are also lettered S R J and H. 3) The gate numbers are in the opposite order to what you expect with the lowest number gates often being the furthest away from you. 4) The airport is huge and you need to set off about 4 hours before boarding to allow for getting lost and working out what the signs mean! 5) All staff work at about the same speed as tectonic plate movements. Fast food is not fast food in Spain. 6) Check in was a joke. You can't use your online boarding pass without getting a ticket for your luggage from one of the automated tills but of course that wont read your passport so you have to go to a totally different set of desks instead! 7) The lady checking boarding passes was having a competition with herself to see how long she could take to check each document.

Also don't plan on shopping for anything practical a traveller might want - there are lots of shops selling expensive branded clothes and luxury products but it's difficult to find somewhere to buy a newspaper and there's nothing useful air-side like a chemist (it would be good to have a branch of Boots or something similar).,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I had to take two trains and go up several escalators before finding my gate only to learn the gate had been changed after I became concerned that there were no other passengers or ground staff at my gate 1/2 hour before the scheduled departure time. Nobody told me the gate had been changed and there were no messages showing the gate change. I had to ask a staff member at another gate. There was very little in the way of food available nearby and what was available was very expensive. Pay-as-you-go Wifi was very confusing if you were not fluent in Spanish and the information desk was largely unhelpful and unfriendly. To top it all off my check-in luggage was left outside in the rain and was sopping wet upon my arrival at Heathrow. This is by far the worst airport I've experienced in Europe.

malaga-airport,/airport-reviews/malaga-airport,Malaga Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2014-10-22,"Have been through Malaga several times since my last comments in 2011 and each time there seems to have been some change. This time we found the road exit and ingress were different: no longer does one pass the San Miguel factory but instead there is an almost direct link with the motorway system which is an improvement. Less helpful was the signage from the hire car return area to the terminal which was actually confusing and we had to wander backwards and forwards until we recognised somewhere familiar. Once in the terminal itself everything went fairly smoothly apart from finding the shortest route through the unavoidable ""duty free"" area. By careful studying of flights already boarding we were able to anticipate the likely gate area for our flight though we didn't go through passport control till we were sure having got it wrong on a previous transit!",NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1
malaga-airport,/airport-reviews/malaga-airport,Malaga Airport customer review,Ian Fraser,United Kingdom,2013-11-13,Have made a number of visit to Malaga this year as usual. Because of the completion of T3 has not been the best airport to visit but was hoping this year would be better in fact now worse. Fortunately Jet2 our carrier now has T3 booking desks from T1 and T2 previously however those with t1 or T2 desks have a long walk to the only customs in T3. On arrival last year we arrived T2 and went straight to the luggage belts in T2 this year arrived T2 and like 2011 had to walk through T3 and back to T2 luggage belts why I ask not good for us oldies. On departure things getting worse in October all the tables behind the x-ray machines have been removed which forces people to empty their trays of wallets etc whilst it is on the machines rollers still. This slow the passage of the bags etc to nearly a standstill we were moved to an x-ray machine with only 4 people in front of us with plastic trays but a full belt and a whole family of 4 trying to recover their items of the belt. 30 minutes later we got to put our trays through the machine. As I had to take my shoes and belt off I am trying to balance on one leg to get my shoes on whilst my partner stops our trays falling off. Once again they stop the belt and we delay for at least 5 minutes whilst we put shoes belts watches on as no where to put our trays. Having checked on line knew zone B but still a long walk to get there to find since May they have stripped out most of the seats near the boarding gates and now about 20 seats at each gate we arrived an hour before boarding all seats full just after our arrival. Seems airport operators want you to stay the retail area and not sit around the boarding gates not a good option in my mind.,NA,NA,NA,7,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

No hitches at all on arrival and this time we even found the official route up to departures level to meet our courtesy bus to the off-site car hire office. On our return trip queues at security were not too bad and we were through quite quickly. For some reason however no details were being released about gates for flights not even which zone until actual boarding began. In the end boarding for our flight to Liverpool was announced by loudspeaker before it even appeared on the screens and even though we were then quick to go through passport control for zone C  the flight was already boarding from the gate immediately adjacent.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
malaga-airport,/airport-reviews/malaga-airport,Malaga Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2011-07-25,Reading what I wrote a year ago I can't say that we found Malaga airport much better this time. It's big impressive and airy but there are still irritating niggles. On arrival we needed to go up to departures level to access our bus but couldn't find any way to do so apart from squeezing through barriers. We then unknowingly walked past the bus point because the signage was not displayed for passengers emerging from the terminal. We were glad that our car hire collection point was off-site as the area outside the airport was very congested. On our return we found Security somewhat disorganised. There was something of a melee to secure trays and at our security gate one harassed female agent seemed to be trying to do everything: call passengers through check the detector and frisk selected individuals whilst at the same time trying to call to a colleague to come and help. We found it very difficult to hear announcements made at the gates. This time we were departing from Area C and our flight to Liverpool was announced early: all we heard was something about Liverpool so we followed others who started moving to join a queue. Perhaps our next passage through the airport in Sep will be smoother as we will have a better idea of what to expect.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

malaga-airport,/airport-reviews/malaga-airport,Malaga Airport customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2011-01-14,On my recent trip to this airport (2nd in 3 years) I found it pretty good but hard to rate with full accuracy as it was having some work done. On arrival we were disembarked pretty quickly and efficiently and from there allowed through immigration controls just as happily. The only gripe on arrival was that (it might have been due to the work) the car rental offices were scattered to the 4 winds with no real signage to point you in the right direction so the relevant one was hard to find. The return journey was the same really. Descent queue times and friendly and efficient staff. There were 2 little niggles though. First the staff in some of the eating places could have been nicer. Their card machine wasn't working but they made no effort to tell people instead letting everyone queue and put in hot food orders only telling them after that they couldn't pay. That was just one cafe potentially having a bad day though. The other problem was that the gate we were directed to required going through a further security check point. Although it didn't make clear that you were going in the right direction. A large bunch of people then gathered at this point as no one wanted to go through in case it was the wrong gate (no signs at this point) and there would be difficulty getting back. This was not a section that appeared to be undergoing work and was just a case of unclear signage.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
malaga-airport,/airport-reviews/malaga-airport,Malaga Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2010-07-24,Couldn't really recognise AGP even though it was only early March that we last passed through because T3 has opened since then. I'd agree about the distances to be walked for departures. We had less far to walk on arrival but that might have been because we were transferred from the plane by bus rather than airbridge so taken almost directly to Arrivals. Roadworks right outside the airport rather undermine the otherwise impressive appearance of the terminal building: access to Departures seemed to take us virtually through a petrol station forecourt! Security busy but reasonably free flowing but in the departure area (pier B) it was very difficult to hear flight announcements especially those from the desks themselves because the gates are on busy thoroughfares with food bars around them so there is a great deal of noise going on. The fact that we had a late change of gate when the queues for our easyJet flight had already formed did not help matters.

Departing from Malaga was reasonably straightforward too. It took a while to find a parking space but then the signs towards and inside the terminal building were clear and we discovered that there was a separate security area for those who do not need to check in at the airport desks and that area was very quiet indeed. From what we could see the main security area was very busy but flowing fairly smoothly. We didn't visit any of the shops so can't comment on those but in the waiting area between security and the moving walkways up to the shops it was difficult to hear the flight announcements.

Our destination Corfu meant we had to fly from Manchester. Our transit in both directions was smoother than that of last July because we were travelling out of high season and at quieter times of day. We passed through security quite swiftly and were treated very amicably. The only downside on the outward journey was a longish wait in a hot and stuffy ground floor gate area until we were actually allowed onto the plane. On our return we were among the last off the plane but almost first to passport control because everyone else had taken a wrong turning en route to Arrivals as there seemed to be no signage at a crucial point along the way.

However the current security debacle in T3 is abysmal - on a recent short haul flight to Europe I arrived as I usually do 90 minutes before departure time and after baggage drop off I immediately found myself in an incredibly long security line that snaked around the building as far as the eye could see - asking a security guard how long it would take to clear he shrugged and responded ""about an hour"". I asked why it was so bad and he replied that they were down to two scanners due to refurbishment and it was the busiest time of year. You really do have to question why they have chosen to do this refurbishment at the busiest time of year when it would clearly cause maximum disruption. All the way through the awfully long and hot wait a lady was calling through passengers who were departing in less than 30 minutes (so it pays to be late clearly!) and a sense of barely controlled chaos pervaded the whole thing. When finally getting through the lines there wasn't time for any refreshments etc just a brisk walk to the gate and immediate boarding was all that time allowed - am surprised the retailers in T3 are not up in arms at the current state of the place!

Staff are offhand or surly and seem to have no sympathy to their customers' discomfort. The shops are OK but there's rarely time to part with any money.

She even suggested that my wife and I share a tray for the items which had to be sent through separately. Would we choose Manchester in future over Liverpool? Only if it was much cheaper. Everything took much longer at Manchester because of the crowds. Security area seemed more claustrophobic and there was hardly any room on the other side of the channels to re- pack one's bags.

My hand luggage was ""queried"" because a swimming mask and snorkel showed up as potentially a ""blade and some piping"". Can't the scanners tell metal from plastic? The contents of the whole bag had to be searched by hand and put through the scanners again. Meanwhile my jacket wallet passport etc. had gone down a different channel and was at risk of being taken while my bag was being ""examined"". By the time we were through this process the flight was on ""last call"" and had only 15 minutes before departure. So much for refreshments and shopping before boarding.

Staff are friendly and efficient and there's plenty of seating and a reasonable range of places to have a drink or something to eat in the departure lounge.

Confirmation of flight boarding gates are not announced until the flight is about ready to board so unlike almost every other airport I've ever used there is no option to just relax at the gate as you wait for your flight.

Apart from an overcrowded Starbucks that's it. There is nowhere else to sit. There isn't any seating on the walkway's to the gates.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,C Chapman,United States,2014-12-10,I have flown in and out of all 4 terminals in the last 6.5 months and it is one of the worst airports I have even been in. Terminal 1 - Korean and Asiana probably the smoothest terminal to go in and out of although the line to check in can take forever. Terminal 2- the most disappointing as this is PAL's international terminal. The WiFi is horrible the air conditioning barely acceptable and the taxi area getting in and out is crowded. Limited bathrooms in the departure area. Terminal 3 - Cebu Pacific this was bad as well when we departed there was no jetway normal in a lot places but in a thunderstorm not fun. Cebu gave us umbrellas which was nice but water everywhere. On return it took forever to get our baggage. Terminal 4 - all I can say is I've been in bus stations that are better than T4. There is no good way to get between terminals if you need to so I would advise against booking flights on multiple carriers making connection in Manila. The traffic and absolute unorganized chaos that is NAIA makes you want to pull your hair out.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Andy Williams,United Kingdom,2014-11-12,Terminal 1. I have just returned to the UK from Manila via Terminal 1 NAIA. I visit the Philippines 2-3 times a year and have done for several years. The last time I used this terminal was May 2014 and I honestly didn't think it could get any worse. How wrong I was! It's almost like the authorities set about doing everything they can to make it bad. On a plus side arriving at this place is not too bad. I always try to time my arrival for a Sunday afternoon which normally means immigration queues for foreigners are not to bad. Baggage reclaim slow as normal. The noise and chaos of the meeting area can be off putting for foreigners who have never been there before and I would suggest if you haven't got transport organised or are being met then walk out to the main road and get a normal passing taxi. Departing is a nightmare. The renovations continue which now means there is virtually no drop off area which causes traffic chaos. There is no clear signs to direct people. Once you have got past the initial security check just to enter the terminal the check in queues stretch from one side of the terminal to another and despite arriving over 4 hours before my flight it still took me 2 hours to check in. Terminal fee still exists so another queue followed then by another queue for immigration and then yet another security check with another queue. All in it took me 3 hours just to get from my taxi to duty free and this was at midnight when the place was quiet! Seating is still an issue as is places to get food or drinks. You can pay 650php to use the lounge upstairs which has a a smoking room constructed from plywood here is sadly probably the best seating in the house where you can enjoy a lukewarm beer and a smoke while listening to the airport announcements telling you that you are in a non-smoking airport! The departure gates are still not big enough and involve yet more queues. I unfortunately cannot avoid this place but if you can then do avoid. The aircon still doesn't work but that's the least of anyone's worries in this place!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

By far the worst of the terminals at NAIA (I have been there 6 times in the past 5 months) it's almost impossible to find anything positive to say about this terminal. At most times of the day it is overcrowded to the extent that it is hard to find anywhere to sit in the departure lounge even on the floor. The air conditioning is inadequate the facilities are minimal the queues often depressingly long and getting a taxi from the airport is extremely difficult. There are plenty of taxis around but those depositing departing passengers are not allowed to pick up passengers arriving.

Half of the immigration counters are open (approximately 10 are open and more younger personnel are visible). Snack bar and some shops are closed for renovation so there are fewer seats.

Return to NAIA Terminal 1 last March 10 Arrival hall is a sad story (It's dark and only few light bulbs are working). Immigration is a breeze they added many counters.

The big issue was that the pick up area was totally clogged up. I fly through this airport a lot and it's far from the best of airports but it usually functions. In this case drivers have bribed the traffic co-ordinators to park in the pick-up/drop off areas indefinitely whilst they waited for the people they were picking up. We had a pick up organised and it took over an hour for the driver to move the 200 meters to get into the pick up area.

mauritius-airport,/airport-reviews/mauritius-airport,Mauritius Airport customer review,Martin Brown,NA,2005-08-18,Interesting airport. The runway is big enough to take a 747-400 or an A340 but the terminal only has 4 gates. I arrived on 6th August on business and my baggage arrived very quickly and for those who really need a smoke there is a dedicated smoking area in baggage reclaim. The arrivals exit is looks inviting with palm trees etc. The queues at immigration are long but then how many people have just come off of that 747? They try to deal with you as quickly as they can. I was at the back of the queues as was last of off aircraft and was through in 20 minutes. Leaving is a different matter. You go through security before checkin. Security stick a security label on to say they have checked and you can go out and come back if you need that smoke as once inside there is NO SMOKING at all what-so-ever. I was told if we opened the bag we would need to go through security again. My bags have many pockets and the label was only across one? You need to go through security again before going into the main terminal which really doesn't make sense. There are not many shops inside. You can get coffee and food but it isn't cheap. Duty free had the usual array of jewellery alcohol tabacco etc at some good prices and in Euro's as well as Rupee's. I did find on a trip to the toilet that most people went in there for a smoke. The attendant standing outside knows this but ignores it so if you really need a ciggy before the 12 hour or so flight there is an 'opportunity'. That said the terminal was clean and most staff are friendly. Immigration can be stroppy. I had to fill out all of the details on the immigration form again as the carbon copy came out faint.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,Lea Bree,Australia,2015-07-13,"Departing is easy. Very easy. I have no problems with departures. Arrivals however is another story. We arrived along with so many others last Saturday morning. They had three booths open for citizens and four for international visitors. I tried the E passport but it didn't work for me so I joined the long line up. The man there at the E passport area was screaming at people so was not exactly approachable for help. I think he is well and truly jaded about his job there. After the long shuffle through passport control our bags were collected fast and thank goodness they have now barriers for people to walk through for customs rather than having people cut in line as was the case previously. So they have made an improvement. Having more friendly staff with E passports needs to be addressed, especially with those oldies like me that have never used this technology before. The last thing you want after a long haul overnight flight is to be yelled out for not doing it ""right"", without being told the right way to do it. Funny the biggest problems with Melbourne airport would and could be fixed for free yet they seem reluctant to address them. Odd. Would I recommend? Yes simply because it is small and easy to navigate.

Arrival into Melbourne on a Qantas A330 at the same time an Emirates A380 came in from Dubai was expecting immigration to take an hour or so but I was happy to be done in under fifteen minutes. Bags at the belt immediately after immigration and despite a small mix-up at quarantine I was on my way by Skybus to Melbourne forty minutes or so after deplaning. My outbound flight from Australia was also at Melbourne Airport and getting through the airport was very much a breeze. Hardly anyone at the airport in the middle of the afternoon when I arrived. Barely any time wasted checking in for my Emirates flight and immigration was particularly smooth and hassle free. Even picked up a nice little bottle of Mescal on the way to the gate with so much time to spare (2.5 hours). Free wifi was certainly useful. Plenty of plane spotting opportunities in the terminal as well.

Used by Tiger airlines the terminal is small and delays are constant that people wait by standing in between the rows of seats. The domestic terminals are always packed with people and the international arrivals is a source of national shame. The luggage takes forever and the lines through to customs often start near customs. The baggage staff are the worst in the country they are slower than laid back airports like Brisbane or Darwin. Once I had to pick up a senior from the airport. The plane was parked at the furthest gate. My passenger was the last to leave as she had mobility difficulties. We both walked slowly to the baggage carousel and once we got there it was another 35 minutes for the first piece of luggage to come out. Her bag came ten minutes later.

Arrived flying J class on Air China on Fri 2nd Aug. An absolute disgrace that it took 2 hours to be processed. Got through the Smart Gate in a couple of minutes. But the queue for aliens was huge and the delay on processing those pax was a major source of my ultimate slow progress. Got to carousel 4 to find it full of Malaysian Airlines bags. But the pax were still back in the immigration queue not present to pull their bags. So the conveyor belt bringing new bags just stopped. I asked baggage services for a handler to come and either put the unclaimed bags on the floor or rearrange them on the belt to fit more on. Refused to do either citing work practice rules. There are employees pulling the bags down in the basement why not up on the carousel too? Finally the MY bags were cleared and about 10 J class bags from my flight. But then no more. Eventually Y class bags and finally most of the J bags. A 90 minute wait. I contacted baggage services 3 times during this period. Walkie-talkie calls to the baggage room below described chaos down there. Then got into customs queue. It was approx 400 meters long snaking along 3 walls of the baggage hall. Two yes two customs officers were at the exit causing the backlog. Why not 10 officers? All in all an absolute disgrace. On leaving the airport it crossed my mind that in fact Melbourne Airport is a private monopoly and earns its highest income from the car park.

Unfortunately our experience of Melbourne Airport was pretty poor. On the positive side of things our baggage arrived on the conveyor belt promptly. However we were way over at Conveyor Belt 5 even though there were closer Conveyor Belts available. Exiting into the arrivals hall we followed the signs for Qantas domestic transfers. We quickly discovered that the travelator up to the Domestic departures level was not functioning and there was no marked alternative. In the end my father had to push our loaded trolley up this conveyor belt. Once we got up to Qantas departures there was no indication for where International Transfer passengers should go. Having finally sorted that out we went through security and struck the most rude abrupt security staff ever. They showed absolutely no patience for those people who take a little longer to get through security. We then had a long walk to our gate.

A collection of four or five gates serviced by toilets and a few overpriced drink and snack machines. Returning was an endurance test. On arrival one is greeted by a low-ceilinged shabby corridor and queues at immigration. My baggage was on carousel 5 which is the newer one but to get to it you have to cut through waiting throngs of passengers lining up afor the exit and waiting for baggage at carousels 3 and 4.

After a 10.5 hour flight from Paris my wife and I got to an arrivals hall that was absolutely jammed. We were marshalled around by nasty airport employees who had no problem screaming at people for not moving fast enough in the interminable queue. This was more like arriving in a backwater rather than in one of the primary gateways to the world's leading economy. Are we not welcome? After 90 minutes we got through amidst crying babies and numerous other distressed weary travelers. Once through passport control we collected our luggage which had been piled up with the rest of the flight's baggage in the middle of the claim area as the carrousels needed to be freed up for other arriving flights. Then we had to queue up for another 30 minutes to get through another control which consisted of an officer looking at our customs declaration and waiving us through. Add another 1.5 hours to deal with the inefficiency of the car hire company and we were on our way. From airport exit to airport exit close to 4 hours.

Transfer into Milan city centre is operated by two competing bus companies with rather the same prices. Allow at least 55min between Malpensa and the city easily more in rush-hour periods. Upon departure there are very few and small flight information screens making it difficult to locate the right check-in desks. It is even more difficult to find the gates as security checks take place at an intermediate floor between Arrivals and Departures floors! Security employees were efficient and friendly.

I started flying there when it was one runway and a quonset hut for a terminal. The airport operation is contracted out to a Canadian Airport Authority (Vancouver?). Current construction of a new building at the east end will alleviate most complaints (due 2006). Problem generally is the impatient intolerant pax - this airport is equivilant to a regional airport in size and traffic volume. To expect service levels to equal Heathrow or other non-american airports is unrealistic. If one is realistic & winds down to island time/speed it is a pleasant experience - people watching is VERY interesting here- I have seen more people make fools of themselves that at any other airport.. I have always found parking spots in the parking lot & it is an easy walk from their to the check-in counters. The current waiting lounge is indeed small but is more friendly that the vast majority of N American facilities. My favourite feature - you dont have to take a bus down the tarmac to even get to the plane or even walk miles to it. The main cause for consternation is from americans who have to go through extensive/excessive? security screening as imposed by their own govt. I have seen lines from AA etc out the door due to this. By now anyone bound for a american airport should have gotten accustomed to this and altered their check in times accordingly. Now that Air Jamaica is no longer Air Sandals indeed there have been changes but it is still a 'friendly' airline and they still represent the majority of check-in counters.

First of all any connection from one country to the US still requires going through Canadian customs and then going through security again and then US customs. So the process of transferring here is very time consuming. Secondly the airport makes the transfer process as vague and difficult as possible. We encountered a lot of difficulty in figuring out how to make the transfer in terms of either a) getting no information from posted signs about how to proceed and b) getting scolding contradictory information from airport staff about how to proceed through the airport from one flight to another. We were told by Information Services (we called for assistance in the baggage claim area) that we absolutely had to pick up our bags to go through customs then told by Air Canada baggage services that our bags had been sent on directly to Boston and we should proceed without them - then yelled at by the customs officer for not having our luggage with us. Clearly the airport staff in general needs to be far better trained in terms of providing assistance to travelers making connections through this airport.

Facilities are very limited - not what you would expect from an international airport. Basic utilities like WiFi and cell phones don't even work well. Parking fees are outrageous it's pure extortion.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
montreal-trudeau-airport,/airport-reviews/montreal-trudeau-airport,Montréal Airport customer review,A Bernier,United Arab Emirates,2011-11-25,A lot could still be improved at Trudeau but having to work with a 1960 built terminal they have done a great job in improving the experience. The 3 concourses and the aeroquay are pleasant and have a reasonable choice of shops food and drinks. The separate security checks for international transborder (US) and domestic flights divide the flow and makes for usually shorter queues. The international arrival hall and access to baggage belts are user-friendly and the space is beautiful. Trudeau is a decent airport and overall going through either upon departure or arrival is an easy quick process.

I was only connecting here from Easyjet to domestic and from domestic to Easyjet. I had given myself 3 hours to do this in each direction but could have easily done it with less. Obviously had to recheck in on to the domestic flight but that was quick and simple and easy to find. Security was quick but the departure hall for domestic flights was very crowded so it's probably best to wait in the public area until nearer the flight. It only took me 30 minutes from leaving the Easyjet flight to go through immigration check-in and clear security. On the return trip it was just as efficient with no lines anywhere. In the international departures area it was less crowded. The prices in the coffee bars were very high - be warned.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
moscow-domodedovo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-domodedovo-airport,Moscow Domodedovo Airport customer review,G Cleaver,United Kingdom,2013-05-12,I've been to this airport several times now. Memories of past experiences with post-soviet airports are all too clear. They've made the effort its evident but its still no where near the standards of 'world hubs'. If there's one thing that's hit me over the years at this airport its the sheer over-crowding probably because everyone's moved from Sheremtyevo. Anyway they still have the annoying scheme of scanning the baggage before you even enter the building. Im all up for security but surely this is crossing the line. Its a job weaving your way through the terminal with heavy baggage endless numbers of people explainable by the fact we were travelling in the winter season back to London. No electronic check-in scheme so there was a long queue. Surprisingly clean airport still with the aroma of cigarettes but the interior looks modern enough. Immigration very swift security was average. Busy busy busy is all I can say afterwards. There's the lack of those wide open walking areas or rest areas with huge ceilings that you get in 5-star airports in Asia. We found it hard to find anywhere to eat although when we did it was ridiculously expensive! Lack of seats duty-free shops also very expensive. There's no doubt that Moscow has made great strides since the Soviet and Post-soviet era but its still miles off the 5-star spectrum.

Then there is the passport control. Only two clerks serving for about 150 passengers. Plus the queue is horrendous. You start lining up and then a whole rush of people start coming and start pushing in. Passport control isn't put in a proper place. It's at a weird angle so the queue goes all over the place. Speaking of all over the place- the baggage area is nearly the same. We had to wait for around 15 minutes for our baggage.

The airport itself remains very well organised clean and easy to navigate through. Two serious minuses. Most of the airlines haven't heard about line management. It causes situations like the one I was in. My flight was about to leave in 55 minutes. Despite being checked in online i should stay in regular line because they don't have bag drop-off desks. When having being in the line for about 20 minutes (the queue was about 35 people) I've decided to take a look at the other side of the isle of desks and found there three working check-in desks with nobody lining up.

Forget the comments about it being excellent by ""Russian"" standards - it compares very well with other airports. First experience was arriving from BKK on Thai Airways - plenty of staff available at immigration and no hassle (all complete and through to baggage claim within five minutes of joining the queue). Baggage took 30 minutes then out into the concourse. It was much less crowded than Don Muang and much better laid out. After changing some money and escaping the taxi touts I got the express train to Paveletsky - highly recommended even if some grizzle about the lack of air-conditioning. Make sure that you walk all the way to the front of the train so that you have less distance to walk when you reach the city. Next use was arriving domestically from St Petersburg - no problems and baggage waiting when we got to the conveyor. Stayed overnight at Airport Hotel (noisy and overpriced for what it provides) then back to the airport for an early flight to Kazan. Security - only 5 minutes. I returned 10 days later - no problems again. Last time was when flying back to BKK - check-in only took 15 minutes despite a full load including a big tour group of Thais and easy progress through Customs and Security. Then came the only drama I had at this airport - there is no currency exchange facility airside! Helpful security staff sympathised with my predicament (I had lots of roubles still in my pocket) but wouldn't let me back into the main concourse to return to the bank.

The airport seemed relatively modern but still lags far behind other hubs I've flown through like Frankfurt and Heathrow (which isn't saying much). Transit times seem to vary depending on time of day and which terminal you land in. Terminals D, E, and F all form an interconnected transit area. On our first stop over in Moscow we arrived at Terminal F and found ourselves funneled through a tiny transfer area that had one attendant serving multiple arriving flights. While we we arrived near the front of the line, I could see some people easily waiting 40+ minutes to pass through transit passport control and security. On the way back, we landed in Terminal D and things seemed to be better staffed and far less busy. My main complaint with the airport is the absolute lack of space. All three terminals are packed with very expensive duty free stores, squeezing out room for seating, food options, and bathrooms. The toilets at the airport were probably the dirtiest I have seen in any airport, and are stained with cigarette ash marks. In terminal D the duty free shops leave so little room in the corridors that it is a struggle to pass between crowds of people queuing for their flight. Terminal D also gets very hot during the daytime. The airport staff didn't seem very friendly or interested in customer service. They mostly bark commands at passengers.

Seating: there is virtually none on the first floor. Architects did not allow for the numerous (and terribly overpriced) duty-free shops that have been added since. That left a very narrow passage almost completely devoid of any facilities except for a couple of bathrooms and some broken currency exchange machines. You can go to the second floor - there aren't any seats there either but at least there aren't any duty free shops so you can camp out on the floor. For that reason the second-floor gallery looks like a refugee camp. Transfer times: you are forced to have your passport and boarding pass checked before being allowed to proceed to your gate. No line there as such just a crowd of desperate passengers and a lone staff member who tends to take long breaks. If you're desperate and your flight is leaving soon push your way to the counter. Boarding areas are actually enclosed and guarded and you are not allowed into that area - which is unfortunate because they have seats there - until shortly before the flight. They do not announce flights so make sure to make regular runs between departures/arrivals board and the gate to makes sure you're still departing from that gate - ask the staff.

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,Andy Williams,Spain,2011-07-29,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport is essentially split into 3 main terminals - D E and F. Each one is completely different in terms of age facilities and experience. Getting between the terminals was once a chore but all three are now linked making transfers between terminals fairly painless. On my recent visit I arrived in terminal E and had to transfer through to terminal F and found the process to have been made far more complicated than it should have been by the inadequate transfer desk which requires you to pass through a single internal passport control and security desk - given the number of flights bottlenecks can be a real issue. I found the staff at the transfer desk were helpful but very abrupt. Matters were confused by the fact that there were additional staff approaching and assisting those in the queue making the desk and it's staff redundant - but without informing anyone waiting that there was no need to queue if you already held a boarding card and that irrespective of this the desk cannot issue boarding cards to those without them(???). Terminal F is the older of the terminals and has the look and feel of an authentic soviet era airport - complete with coffee stained formica partitions 1970's furniture and a very odd arrangement of kiosks that give it the feeling of an indoor market with narrow winding passages between them. Food and refreshments are VERY expensive (around $10 for a not very good coffee). The terminal is a smoking terminal with 'smoking zones' consisting of ashtrays placed around the terminal but not segregated from non smokers in any way. There is no air conditioning in this terminal and while it was a fairly chilly morning when I arrived inside it felt stuffy. There is good free wifi access in this terminal. Terminal E is much newer though equally puzzling. It is a much more spacious terminal perhaps too spacious as there appeared to be a LOT of empty space with no seating which I found strange. Generally these areas were filled with passengers sleeping. The eating options here appear much more modern but equally as expensive. The terminal is much more open with glass walls segregated smoking zones and air conditioning. There was no working wifi in this terminal when I visited. Terminal D is newer still and much more like the modern terminals you may be used to (think heathrow T5 Singapore HK etc) and is a much nicer experience. I found it a breeze to walk through to terminal D from E to use the free wifi.

This needs to be explained here to fellow travelers who need to get to from or via this place safely and on time. The airport now consists of the three buildings. The first building consists of the terminals DEF and Aeroexpress train station. All these form a single building. They are connected between themselves both land side and airside. Terminals B and C are around 5 km from this place are close to each other with no connection between buildings. The gentleman whose report below tells that he was charged by taxi driver a horrible sum of money for the ride between D and F doesn't tell that in fact he had been driven between the two doors of the same building. The different story is the rest of the airport. Aeroflot now has own and codeshared flights operating from terminals C D E F. The terminals B and C are distant and not connected anyhow to the main D/E/F/Rail building. There is no organized transportation for transit passengers to and from B or C. It is your own risk to get to and from there. The only landside options are city bus light shuttle bus and taxi. City bus can be very crowded and cost 1USD light bus is infrequent and costs 2 usd and taxi are the horrible scam after which you will be lucky just to be overcharged. The standard taxi rate between main D/e/f/rail building and buildings C or B is usd 20. Don't pay more! Ask your friends to pick you up. If you go on connecting codeshared flight sold by Aeroflot and arriving in terminal C you're still not eligible for any free airside transportation between terminals just because it doesn't exist. Don't believe if they tell you it does. When Aeroflot tell you that they are responsible for your ""transportation"" only between terminals D/E/F it means that you don't actually leave the building and you ""transport"" yourself by walk. The only exception to the rule is airside ""train to plane"" service which carries passengers arriving to the airport by train. You can clear security at terminal E and then you are transported airside to the terminals C and B for free. Then after disembarkation from the bus you go landside and then again clear security for your departing flight at terminal B or C. The service is confusing infrequent and only works one way. Only actually departing passengers with tickets documents and boarding passes can go. No opposite direction!

Outbound arrived to the airport by train coming to /terminal E. Transfer to terminal C was done by intercity type coach running every 30 minutes around the whole airport including its most remote places. Absence of tunnels under runways located between terminals E/D/F on one side and B/C on another side makes this ride 25 minutes long so should you need to arrive by train and to leave from terminals B or C allow some 60 extra minutes for this transfer. At terminal C security search was a breeze check in was done online immigration lines long but managed to catch my plane as the terminal is really small. Again free wifi but airside facilities are very poor with nothing to do uninspiring duty free and overpriced food options of very average quality.

On arrival from Tokyo Narita the plane was not parked at a gate. As we left the plane I saw someone waiting with a board with my name on it and I was ushered into a car. We drove in silence around the airport arrived at some unmarked gates and I was led into a hotel lounge and told to sit down and relax. There was a bar and food was also available. An immigration officer requested my passport and later came over and returned it to me. My luggage tag was requested and eventually luggage appeared. Friends who were meeting me appeared and we drove into Moscow. This lounge was full of people and I was told that there were four such VIP lounges in the airport. The return trip was equally surreal. Mercedes is the preferred transportation vehicle and we duly arrived at the double doors. This time there was a short walk to the hotel lounge. My e-ticket was somewhere in my luggage but it was never requested. I was told that with this way of passing through the airport one did not need a ticket. A little while later another vehicle took me to the gate. A stern official gave me my boarding pass and wished me a good flight - and I found that had been upgraded.

At least the AeroExpress from the city is a big plus but despite what is advertised the free bus transfer works only one way - it's provided by the airport so travels inside the security perimeter to the domestic terminals. Of course when you arrive on a domestic flight you end up outside the terminal and therefore outside the secure area so you have to get the marshrutki shuttle (60 roubles) back to the AeroExpress terminal. Security and check-in for my first flight was very quck and easy and I thought that perhaps things had improved in the last four years. That impression was very quickly ruined by my second visit - baggage took 40 minutes to arrive causing me to miss check-in for my connecting flight. AviaNova staff moved mountains to get me on the plane but it meant going through security 3 times with all the rigmarole of shoes off and on even though the security staff had already seen me go through the next scanner 10 metres away and then out of their own secure zone!

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,G Cleaver,New Zealand,2010-04-06,We were leaving from Moscow to Auckland via Hong Kong and our only choice was Sheremetyevo. This airport is a real shambles. We arrived at around 7:30pm local time to check into our flight. Staff are impatient and have no idea what they are really doing. The whole airport looks more like a cave and I look forward to when the new terminal will open. Passport control is the next marathon. Warning - block your ears when the officer stamps your passport. His/ her aim is too scare you with the loud bang on the passport. After passing control we had some time to look about in the airport. This is boring. Seriously half of the shops are not even open and cafes sell food at rip-off prices. After a while our flight was boarding. Security check is a pain. There is one x-ray for two gates and while our flight was boarding another flight was boarding in the other gate so this meant queues. Big ones. So big that we nearly missed our flight. So when we board our flight is cancelled because a dodgy Ilyushin can't get it's engines to work properly. This meant that everyone had to get off and wait till another plane was available. The airport gave us coupons to buy food with but in the whole of the airport two only two cafes/restaurants we're open. So we had to wait till the plane fed us. Staff didn't tell us anything at all so we used newspapers laid them on the floor and went to sleep.3 hours later the grumpy staff finally announced that there was a plane available and everyone boarded.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Going there to visit relatives I step out of the plane into a brown colored air terminal that has clearly not been updated since Soviet times. I walk to Customs that takes an hour to get to and staff rude unhelpful and know no english. Fortunately the man behind me knew Russian and English so he translated and for reasons I don't know they ask me where I was born. I reply Bandar-Gaz Iran and they pull me aside (even though I came with a US passport) start searching me and take me to the Chief (the only one who knew English apparently) and start asking me ridiculous questions such as my home town my alma mater my affiliations where I got my tickets have I served in any military my university major what countries have I visited in the last six months. When I answer all these questions they deliberate a little longer and check my name on several computers. Finally they let me go after an hour. When I get out I find my family in a mess of people whom security gives no effort to control (they worry about finding terrorists more like people from Iran).

Both times we went through the airport the security screening process for transit passengers was a nightmare. Even though we were already checked in for our connecting flight and had boarding passes we were required to exchange them for new boarding passes at the Jet Airways counter just adjacent to the security screening point. The lines were very disorganized people crowding and pushing and all staff involved both at the airlines counters and the security point were extremely slow - moving at a snails pace.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,S Sankar,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,Flew on BA to London with young family on the 2.30am departure. Flown the route countless times but first time from the new terminal. Aside from the ubiquitous queue and paperwork check to get into the terminal this airport is one of the best in the world. The terminal building is simply stunning both from the outside and inside. The ceiling and columns are mind blowing. BA Silver status enabled sofa check-in whereby all paperwork is carried out whilst seated away from the crowds on a quiet sofa. This then led to a separate business class security check (the staff assisted us so we could keep the children asleep) and immigration. Upon entering the duty free area it is like any of the top airports in the world with an impressive variety of shops restaurants bars boutiques and bars - all neatly laid out. The signage and announcements are very clear and precise - it sounds like they hired the same lady who announces in Heathrow T5. What set the airport apart was the stunning Indian art work - great to see India showcasing indigenous art and culture and adding a personal touch when compared to the many bland and functional airports around the world. The GVK lounge is shared and has more than enough comfy seats a wide variety of local and imported alcohol as well as Indian and international food. The walk to the gate was smooth - our kids didn't wake up at all through the whole airport experience - testimony to what a smooth experience departing from Mumbai is today.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Rishad Patell,India,2014-10-13,Flew out/into T2 in the last week on Malaysia Airlines. The check in area of the terminal is quite lovely. Check in quite long but that is due to MH taking so long with each passenger. Immigration queues are short and quick. Nice polite staff. Eating options are quite nice but not much else to do- the airport is new so I expect things will be added. The waiting areas near the gates have adequate seating however the lighting seems a bit dull. The arrivals section is also quite well laid out however expect a long walk from the gates to the immigration. Also the travelators seem to be oddly placed and the carpeting seems unnecessary here. Immigration counters were fast and efficient. Baggage carousel area is well laid out as well as is the area for taxi's and transport.

Check in desks are inadequate for both airlines during peak hours as are the security check counters. Recently on a non peak hour flight to Jodhpur at 12pm there was no place to sit so obviously it is working over capacity.

Immigration was quick with a very friendly officer and our bags were out too quickly - it took us some time to admire the new terminal building with pieces of Indian art that is so different from Delhi IGI or Chennai Anna International. Departure was a similar story: some queues were there but moved relatively quickly friendly check-in (TK) very friendly officers that even joked with us at security with the usual stamps here and there and finally a quick cup of coffee close to the gate before boarding. True: there are mosquitoes in T2 and not all shops are operational yet but all we needed for departure was relatively prompt & pleasant and we enjoyed the huge improvement that has taken place in Mumbai. When they shift all domestic flights to T2 towards the end of 2014 we won't hesitate to use BOM again for our travels to India. Delhi IGI is better at present from international to domestic if you continue domestic with Air India.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Saketh Rahm,United States,2014-02-24,I had the opportunity to use the new T2 international departures terminal and it is fantastic and as previously written a quantum leap above the previous decrepit airport. Road to the terminal is well maintained and elevated with 4 entrances for the security checks to get into the terminal. They have a separate Business and First class check in zone for all airlines which was nice and not crowded. Very high ceilings make for a feeling of a large facility. Security was a breeze with officers saying please and thank you (Clearly some training took place). Facility spotlessly clean with excellent lighting. Tons of shops though not completely open due to recent facility opening. Food outstanding and very well priced and boarding gates large with two entrances for each plane making for a quick boarding-deboarding process. I liked the Indian mural art work which was superb.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Vineet Bapat,Canada,2014-02-19,My wife and I had the pleasure of boarding our flight at the new Terminal 2 at 1 am on Feb 13. Having arrived at and departed from Mumbai's international and domestic terminals several times over the past two decades I can honestly say that the new Terminal 2 represents a quantum leap in (for the most part) vastly improving the passenger experience. This includes the new elevated access ramp to the terminal from the Western Express Highway. The terminal building itself is an architectural wonder. There is lots of glass all owing expansive views of the airport. Spacious seating / waiting areas with clear flight boarding announcement. Slightly secluded seating areas with relaxing arm chairs and modular sofa type seating configurations. Numerous bistros and coffee shops in a shopping mall type of a layout. Interesting and original retail outlets. As this was the first day of operations several stores were not yet open or had goods displayed but were not available for shopping. Nevertheless the store managers invited us to have a look around. Likewise the duty free shops were still stocking up with only a few items for sale. Washrooms were very clean and well distributed throughout the terminal. One aspect that could be improved is the still cumbersome process of passport and visa checks for outbound passengers which seems to be largely bureaucratic and unnecessary. There was a long snaking line for this checkpoint before proceeding to the airside retail food and gate area which was tiresome and resulted in us feeling a bit too exhausted to fully explore the various stores and eateries. I hope the airport authorities eliminate or at least streamline this procedure.,NA,NA,NA,9,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Immigration and security lines were manageable though the immigration lines can be handled more efficiently by providing proper directions to passengers! Good dining (though overpriced) options available at international gates and sufficient seating arrangements at the gates. Return was a different story altogether.

Being asked to open a see-through bag and then stand there as a guy went through my CD wallet and looked at every CD was just overkill especially when they were boarding the plane.

There was one more screening of baggage before we dropped them off and a security check before boarding the inter-terminal transfer coach. Security staff were rude and unconcerned. Once at the domestic terminal there was one more security check.

No queue at immigration bags turned up fairly quickly and customs wasn't a problem though bags are screened incredibly often. Our transfer to the domestic terminal was quite smooth as well though the bus does go on a tour of the airport facility. The domestic terminal was remarkably clean and facilities were fine given that it was early hours of the morning. We had to change some sterling to INRs but that too went okay and we had no trouble with the exchange desk. Our only problem came at security in the domestic terminal where my husband's bag was retained. He was carrying our personal camera equipment and his diabetic medication. Our cameras were removed and the bag re-scanned. The security officer came over with the bag asked if he used insulin and immediately stamped the bag as cleared.

Once you have made it through all the people to get inside you have to get your luggage scanned and security taped before check-in will take it. They tell most people this after queuing at the check-in desk (not useful). The international departure concourse for the most part looked like it is falling apart despite renovation (though the internal departure concourse in another terminal was newly designed and looked good).

On both occasions my experience was fine. Fast immigration fast and efficient security lots of shops and eateries perfectly clean toilets and bright airy T2. T1 which I also used is older but still a fine place to arrive at. Overall place and connection to the city is lovely. The only minus was that my all flights were served from apron and on departure getting to the bus incurred 4 very steep flights downstairs which wasn't a trouble for me but certainly was for passengers with children or for elder people.

You couldn't buy much at their one shop apart from overpriced perfumes and alcohol you can't even smell the perfumes in their shop as no testers on display. Nothing to do there to pass the time when you have a delay which I have to add this airport has lots of delays as its a military airport and closes at 9pm and doesnt have flights between 12 and 3pm.

muscat-seeb-airport,/airport-reviews/muscat-seeb-airport,Muscat Seeb Airport customer review,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,2015-06-17,"I am at this airport almost every other weekend and this will be my first review with them. 1) Check in is a breeze. Especially if you're flying with Omanair, they have a specific area just for that airline with many counters open for it. The only thing is, I just absolutely am disgusted with some of the staff where they would constantly question whether I need a visa to UAE with my passport and then question me back on ""are you sure?"" and ""really?"". 2 weeks ago, the guy at the check in counter said ""how do you know you don't need visa? When was the last time you were at UAE?"" (if he had properly check my passport that he was holding, he would have noticed that I have at least 10 UAE stamps in my passport, one which was dated 2 weeks before that). 2) Not many shops to be honest. Not the sort of airport you want to be at for more than 3 hours. 3) Did not like the other gate for low costs airlines such as Rotana or flydubai. That place is packed and crowded and super unorganised. I have honestly paid more to fly with Omanair just to avoid boarding through that gate. 4) Arrival at the airport is ok at times. Sometimes its super crowded, sometimes it's excellent. The immigration counter could do with some more counters during the busy time cause I remember when it took over an hour just for the queue. 5) Taxi from the airport to your destination is absolutely expensive. Where I am staying at, is only 10 minutes drive, yet it costs OMR8 (and same price to where another place that is 30 minutes is). 6) When the airport is full, it really is full. The cars are unorganised and everyone looked lost. I know they are building a new airport to support the high amount of tourists coming into the country, so I really am looking forward to that.",Arrival and Departure,14-06-2015,Solo Leisure,6,2,2,2,NA,3,1,3,NA,0

No piers so all transfers are by bus to the terminal building. Those in the know sprint to the Travelex Bureau de Change to pay their 6 Riyals to buy a visa before queuing for Passport Control. Those who don't understand the system will find the queue for the Visa Payment grows very long. In reality it moves relatively quickly. Passport is simple no forms to be completed and then into Baggage Reclaim. Bags were already waiting then through the scanner at Customs for the bags and into Arrivals. This was busy but not so you were not sure what was going on. No unhelpful offers of carrying bags or things like that. The main car park is directly across from the Arrivals Hall.

The main concourse was very very busy and in the heat was an experience. Departure can be a bit hectic with the majority of flights being operated late at night. The front of the terminal was a bit of a scrum. Be wary of the porters on the initial security check. Check in was not too bad. Security again was no different than anywhere else as was immigration.

nadi-airport,/airport-reviews/nadi-airport,Nadi Airport customer review,B Williams,Australia,2013-03-12,Arrived in Nadi at about 4pm on a Boeing 737-800 operated by Virgin Australia. The airport had not changed much since the last time I had been there (5 years ago) - still old. Disembarkation was a little slower than average. Immigration and Customs were surprisingly quick albeit laissez-faire and the bags were ready almost immediately. A fresh supply of taxis were also awaiting at the terminal. Arrived for check-in at 12pm about 2.5 hours prior to departure. My return flight was on a 80-90% full Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800. For such a small capacity plane the line seemed huge. Nadi seems to separate its check in desks by airline and flight. So Virgin Australia had about 9 desks - 3 each for the Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane flights. As the Melbourne and Brisbane flights had not started check in this meant that only 3 desks for VA were open while the check in staff at the other desks had a nice chat. The line barely seemed to move at all - the same people stayed at some one of the desks for over an hour! I ended up getting through check in 90 minutes prior to departure: that's an hour wait for a small plane. Virgin Australia generally closes check in 90 minutes prior to departure but when I turned around the line was still very large. This is totally unacceptable. Getting through customs is fairly straight forward. Then you arrive in a large room with boarding gates off to the sides. There seem to be a lot of people in a small space. The terminal is not clean and the food options are not very good at all (albeit better than VA's offering).,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,S Heath,United Kingdom,2011-09-22,It's not up to the standards of superhubs and could do with a new international terminal. Basically its straight out of the 1960s so not that well laid out. The two main problems are having to queue outside to get past the first security check and having to queue twice more for a long check-in and two more security scans at the gate. It really needs a layout change - so you can be scanned just once on entering the secure passenger only area. Duty free shops well they sell the same as elsewhere in the world just without hi power arc lighting and glossy shelves. I agree the main problem is the lack of seating and the fact it feels a bit cramped. I've always managed to get a seat and try to arrive not too early but with enough time to get through all the checks.

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,O Bennett,NA,2009-11-20,Arrived at NBO on night of 1 November to depart for London only to find the airport in semi- darkness. It took 90 minutes to dispose of my bag having already checked in on-line and queuing for the business class counter. Next to this line was one headed 'Fast Bag Drop' which was pretty ironic since that queue was barely moving at all. Just as I handed my passport at the immigration desk all the lights went out and this supposedly the leading airport in East Africa was plunged into complete darkness. Once the lights partially came on again I tried to proceed to the BA lounge only to find the stairs leading to it in such darkness that it was impossible to see anything at all. So went to the gate to sit on the floor like so many given the limited seating. On returning to NBO on 14 November I was interested to see that - as others have said - the immigration queue for those without visas proceeded faster than for those holding visas. But it didn't matter given the wait for luggage that was going - slowly - through a single xray machine with a resultant long delay even for baggage labelled 'priority'.

Terrible arrogant unhelpful staff even in the poor shops and no decent food or drink available.

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,J Moore,NA,2009-09-14,It is interesting reading the comments of passengers passing through Jomo Kennatta airport the most talked of item is the lack of seating which is true the story I heard was that the chairs were removed after the attack on Nairobi with bombs so all the chairs were removed so that nothing could be left there. I have been visiting Kenya since 1970 and in that time the only thing that has vastly improved at both Nairobi and Mombasa airports is the toilets they were for years truly a no go area at times needing far more than flip flops to even approach but now someone has really sorted that problem out and I have found the loos' to be better than most of the public ones in the UK and I would like to congratulate them on that also the shops are very modern but seats would be better appreciated. The airport is supposed to be being upgraded with another floor being added but this seems to be taking a long time. The best tip I would give to anyone who knows they will need to spend more than 3 hours at JK is to sign up for priority pass this will give you access to the lounges at airports across the world including Kenya where you will have at least a comfortable place to sit and drinks and food are included so when you think how much you can fork out for food and drink at an airport this doesn't seem like an extravagant option. Lounges in 'modern' countries are of a high standard with food to match but places like Kenya are not quite on a par sandwiches being the most common item for eats but they usually have at least one pc with internet connection and toilets with no queues and you can come and go as you please. My usual wait at Nairobi has been 8+ hours and part of that is in the check in area as my flight usually arrives 3 to 4 hours before check in opens and there is nothing in that area to aid your wait at all. Always make sure you have filled out a departure form before heading for check in they love their forms I think they all end up in the waste bin as I really can't see anyone wanting to file them but what do I know.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,D Shah,NA,2008-09-08,Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is in dire need of a face-lift. As I approached the airport staff upon disembarking from the plane the lights along the corridor were glum and a sombre mood existed in terms of passenger variety especially with the lack of proper seating signs and most importantly modesty and flare with which airports are supposed to define a country. Security is quite good but the luggage conveyors need to be quickly fed and this suggests to me that there is a boardroom feud amongst luggage handlers or something similar as to which a huge air of discontent lies with this airport's workers. To my knowledge this airport generates more than 2.5million passengers annually and it has a vital geographic location which serves African routes very well. Surely improve the airport in terms of appeal and efficiency.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There are different terminal and loads of shops which is good but you always get the smell of the smoking people outside into the terminals because of the wind and I found it very unpleasant.

Just a couple of steps and you're outside the building and basically in the middle of the town. There's a selection of car rentals in the arrival hall but it takes ages to actually get the keys and papers if there are more than two people in the queue. Getting to the car eventually is another interesting experience as the AVIS/SIxt/Hertz etc parking area is located far away from the airport and there are no directions whatsoever where to go. It turned out there's a small shuttle van (also without any discernable signs or labels) commuting between arrival hall and the various parking lots. The drivers don't speak English (or any other language but Italian for that matter) and cannot tell you where you're supposed to find your car. On departure you may find the checkin quite crowded but once through it leads to a light and open lounge area with a number of shops and some fast food restaurants (Burgerking Autogrill).

Got off the plane and went through immigration and security really smoothly and quickly and all the officials were friendly and efficient it was definitely a good experience with no queuing at all. One of them even gave us good advice on certain places to visit which wouldn't cost too much. Part of JFK's airtrain shuttle was suspended for maintenance but still we did their bus transfer to Jamaica station then on to a little train that was working and then on to the subway and in to Manhattan in just over an hour - a good start to a great holiday.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
new-york-jfk-airport,/airport-reviews/new-york-jfk-airport,New York JFK Airport customer review,W Jackson,United States,2013-06-24,Our original itinerary for our trip home from Germany provided only a 1.5 hr window of time to go through customs (first time) retrieve our luggage go through customs a second time and try to find the place to check the luggage for the continuing flight. Then our plane was delayed due to weather conditions causing us to miss our connection to Atlanta. There was mass confusion as hundreds of passengers tried to find an agent to help with rechecking baggage and finding a connection. The agent that we were finally able to access seemed totally incompetent spending countless minutes on the phone instead of the computer. He finally informed us that we would have to spend the night in NYC to catch a 6.20am flight. We later discovered that we had already been automatically rescheduled to a new flight that was to leave at 8.15pm - information that the Delta agent should have given to us. We can't believe how an agent for Delta could be so totally out-of-the-information loop resulting in our two families incurring over $200 each of overnight costs and having to move all our luggage with two small children to an area hotel. This is not the first time we've had trouble at JFK Airport; all in our travel group have concluded that we will never travel again through JFK unless there is no alternative.

We rented a car at Newark and after proceeding through the immigration we took the convenient skytrain which brought us directly to the rental agencies. On return I arrived with UA from Montreal at terminal A and I have been warned that 1.5 hours connection time to my flight to Europe from terminal B could be tight! The immigration to US from Canada takes place in Canada therefore I arrived as a domestic passenger. Before leaving terminal A I saw signs regarding an inter-terminal-buss. I was directed to gate A28. Quickly I found out that terminal B is served (on request) and took the bus. 5 minutes later I sat in front of the departure gate to my European flight. The whole transfer from arrival gate in terminal A to departure gate in terminal B took me 15 minutes at the most without any security check no queues.

I (and I'm sure many of the other reviewers) have entered more than one other country as a foreigner (as well as the US through other airports) and so will have a fair idea of what to expect from immigration control officials. I witnessed an incident of an officer being unduly rude to a fellow traveller in a similar way to an incident in a previous review so this must not be all that isolated or unusual. Waiting times for baggage and to go through other security areas could also be improved. I was not there at a particularly busy period and yet waiting times were significantly longer than one would expect from an airport of this size. Further signage and direction finding must be improved. There were several information points around the airport that would have probably been helpful if there had been anyone at them.

A lady in front of me walked up to staff member after the previous person cleared the desk.

The whole airport needs a rethink in terms of staff attitude towards passengers together with more signage. The TSA agent on arrival was quite pleasant and we were on our way into Manhattan within 40 minutes of arrival. Our luggage was already on the carousel. For departures BA's check in area is located in the basement area of Terminal B; the signage by the roadside indicating where this is indicated is very small and needs to be made a lot bigger. In Terminal B there is small food court with a McDs. There is also a Chilis Too which is located nearer to the security checkpoint. Again there are no signs to indicate the existance of Chilis Too. TSA people on departure were slow and officious to the nth degree.

LBA flights are godsend for Northerners trying to get to Cornwall Scilly Isles etc. Usually a tiny airport like this is an antidote to the usual experience - refreshing 100% relaxation enjoy the views. Well that's not quite the case here. There are two major irritations. Security is the most zealous I've encountered anywhere bar none. Been here twice both times called in to have main suitcase rifled through. A lot of elderly holidaymakers who are not used to taking off shoes belts and so on - this can create very slow moving lines at security - answer why not PUT UP SOME SIGNS to advise them of this while we all fester in the queue? Once they finished with me then they go through my 4 year old's bag of toys vaguely peering at them shaking them etc. how depressing. Second problem is the compulsory £5 departure tax paid for via some hastily re-jigged car par ticket machines. Again security don't let you through without your voucher but so many pax fail to realise this till it's too late - heaven knows this must produce some conflict with beered-up travellers in the height of summer! Because there are so few check-in desks they only open check-in 45 mins before departure time so DON'T go arriving early or you'll have to sit with your luggage which can get awkward given lack of space landside. Well there you go don't mean to moan this airport provides a great little service. Just be ready - there are no views nothing to see nothing to do nowhere comfy to wait tedious security confusing one- off charges. Finally once airside a great looking cafe/bar which I have never seen open. Staff delightful considering. It's worth it but for now the experience is a chore.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The complaint - our Bombardier aircraft Air France from Bordeaux parked within about 150 metres of the arrival terminal but the bus went on what seemed a tour of the airport passing the door where we eventually entered carried on for several minutes only to turn around and come back in the other direction. The reason - the exit door is only on one side of the vehicle! To be aware of: the shuttle bus between terminals leaves Terminal 1 then goes out of the airport only to re-enter and go via the car-parks.

We had purchased a small (12 cm across) very fragile ceramic plate on our trip. We carefully packed this plate in our carry-on luggage. During a hand inspection at security the inspector demanded that this plate be placed in our checked luggage since it could be used as a weapon (she motioned how you could hit someone over the head with it). Believe me it seemed an incredible concept that you could injure someone with this small thin incredibly fragile plate. Yet the inspector persisted and we anxiously placed the plate in our checked luggage. The amazing thing was that in the duty free store in international departures (long last the final inspection) the place is selling huge strong appearing ceramics which one really could use to cause damage.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Departure Lounge isn't particularly well appointed nor comfortable with only one member of staff to look after the Newsagency Cafe and Duty Free Shop.

oakland-airport,/airport-reviews/oakland-airport,Oakland Airport customer review,M Moore,NA,2004-11-28,I spent four years in Oakland before moving out of California recently and did most of my domestic travel out of OAK. Oakland offers several advantages over SFO. Its East Bay location makes it easy to get into San Francisco assuming traffic on the Bay Bridge isn't at a standstill. There are fewer fog-related delays and cancellations at OAK than SFO. Airfares tend to be a bit lower at OAK as well. In terms of size the Oakland Airport is manageable and reasonably convenient; you can be off the plane and out the front door in a matter of minutes. If you time your arrival and departure well it's a snap to get in and out. The biggest problem is that the other seven or eight million people in the Bay Area have also figured these things out. Fly at a peak time and the traffic jams on the access road can be daunting. Ditto the queues at the security checkpoints. There is ostensibly a BART station but the shuttle bus gets stuck in the same traffic jams which sort of defeats the purpose of using mass transit. (The new direct rail shuttle over to the main BART line will remedy this situation when it's built.) And the facilities themselves are on the tattered side. Renovation is underway but I'd like to see a better range of dining options and cleaner restrooms. Decent carpet and more electrical outlets for laptops and cell phone recharging would be great too. Overall I enjoy the experience of being in SFO more now that I don't live in the region -- vastly better food plus the convenience of the Airtrain and the on-site BART station the cleanliness and more comfortable facilities give it an edge over Oakland. I'm willing to risk weather-related delays and longer security lines for these amenities. Most of the time anyway.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The domestic part comprises a large spacious terminal with all the amenities a modern airport should have: air bridges restaurants shopping transport to the city etc. The international terminal however is a small depressing structure with one food court and very limited shopping. Access to the international departure counters in a tiny hall is only granted less than 2 hours before flight departure often resulting in long lines and crowded conditions. Access to the departure gates is also controlled by strict staff and only allowed a set period before the scheduled departure; if you are 1 minute early you will be turned away!

I spoke to one woman who had already been standing in line for an hour. It was a weekend arrival but again only 6 desks were open out of the 30 or so in total they have there. Our flight was the second of the three to arrive that day from the UK and by the time this flight had started to line up a couple more desks had opened. The blame for that lies with the CBP so this is out of the hands of the airport management. Baggage was again placed on the floor of the carousels for people to find once immigration formalities were completed.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,G McGowan,United States,2010-08-26,Orlando International is very similar in layout to Tampa in that it has a landside terminal with several airsides that are connected by overhead trams with one exception: whereas in Tampa security is on the airside after exiting the trams in Orlando it is landside before boarding. Still open lines were ample and even color coded for beginners intermediates and experts. I was in the expert line and cleared security in under 10 minutes. The main terminal is stocked with shops restaurants and even a Hyatt hotel. On the airside there was a Burger King Nathan's Hot Dogs Outback Steakhouse Starbucks a deli and a couple of snack bars however there was not adequate seating at the restaurants themselves. There are coffee tables and chairs in the center atrium of the airside however they are all bolted to the floor. So if you plan to eat before you fly I would advise arriving at the airport early enough to check out the dining options pre-security. I noticed restrooms were inadequate particularly when multiple flights were arriving and they were rather dirty. When arriving at MCO remember that baggage claim is on level 2 and ground transportation (rental car & Disney shuttles and taxis) are on level 1. Long term parking at the airport can be paid by Sunpass however it is expensive. There is ample off-airport parking nearby for as little as $4-5 a day so shop around.

Aer Lingus flights depart from gate 28 and this departure area is not particularly pleasant. The range of shops cafes and bars is limited and in stark contrast to landside is quite expensive. Two glasses of average wine came to just under $20 for example. Very annoyingly only one set of restrooms in this area were working leading to queues! This is wholly unacceptable.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,We've used this airport a few times. It's not perfect but certainly not bad. It's important to note though that my experience of the airport is based on departures and arrivals out of peak times. Therefore it is possible that although I can only report short or minor delays at baggage reclaim and immigration control perhaps these delays would be scaled up at busier times. I've found that on our most recent trip that the airport was well enough sign- posted and there were easily enough food and shopping outlets to keep us and our 20 month old toddler happy especially as the departure pier we were at had a dedicated children's play area. We like Majorca for family holidays and with it being a small island where Palma is the only airport you are not going to be picking any others to get there. All in all I think it's a decent airport but a re-design of departures that means that you don't have to go through a secondary security process would be good that way you could avail of more of the facilities on offer rather than just the albeit decent facilities post secondary security for non-Schengen flights.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,D Rose,United Kingdom,2013-09-25,Terrible experience. On arrival at Majorca's airport (around 1am) from Gatwick the entire plane's luggage was nowhere to be seen for an hour and a half. When the bags did start coming round it still was very slow. During this time another flight arrived (from outside the UK) and miraculously they all had their luggage within 20 minutes. On our return we were checking in with a member of staff who was clearly incompetent. We were waiting for over an hour to do this and we were halfway down the queue who knows how long the people at the back took. At one point this member of staff threatened to walk off picking up her handbag and gesturing. Why this happened no one could understand. Upon getting onto the plane (straight from check-in due to the massive delays) there was no air- conditioning for half an hour. It became very hot and everyone had sweat dripping down their foreheads we complained to the cabin crew who promptly informed us this was due to Palma airport's engineering department since the ground power unit (or something like that) was out of action. Genuinely my continued disappointment with this airport in several key areas may well keep me from going to what is otherwise a fantastic holiday destination.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

We were quickly off the plane and into busses to get to the terminal. The queue for passports to be checked took around half an hour in sweltering heat. The time was not all the fault of the narrow corridor and small number of desks but wa snot helped by passengers from several arriving flights being disorganised not having passports ready etc. Baggage waiting in the hall. Returned on 25th for an evening flight home. Long queue again not helped by disorganised passengers soon sorted by staff opening more desks.

Had already waited 45 minutes in line - Got hold of Thomson rep. and suggested as the next check in hand a smallish queue and two check in desks that she moved our queue over. She would not allow that. We were then sent over to the other side of the check in hall and made to join the end of a queue so people on later flights were checked in before us I got very cross and had a few harsh words with the Thomsons rep who would not allow us to go in front. We were the last to be checked in and therefore my husband and I could not sit together. This process had taken one hour and 20 minutes rushed upstairs to the queue for the security got through that joined to queue for passport check eventually got to the gate - no time to get a drink and no time to visit the toilet plane was boarding. There is a need to go back to designated check in desks for each flight.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2012-01-23,PMI in January is very different from how it is during high season. Vast areas are deserted and many of the outlets are closed. That all made for comparatively painless transits on a long weekend break. We still had long walks as easyJet flights were assigned to the far most end of area C but there were no queues at all for security. The only hold-up was at passport control on arrival: the control booth was beside our arrival gate and although there were two officers on duty they had to share one passport reader between them so it took 20 minutes or so for the passengers on our flight to be processed.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

We hired a car that was picked up and left back at the airport and was done with ease. Signage was generally good and helpful and the range of shops was pretty good with a fair mix in the price range. Only hiccup was on arrival when the sign showed our baggage was to arrive on carousel 3 and it wasn't until a passenger from another flight came down to inform us that our luggage was in fact coming out on 7. No staff noticed or addressed the issue. 20 mins later when our assisted travel companions arrived the helpers brought them to carrousel 3 as even after that time no staff had noticed the error.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2010-10-10,"It's ironic that my last posting on PMI should have referred to wheelchair passengers because on this latest transit my wife had temporarily joined their ranks. The PMI pages on the AENA website were a useful guide to what type of assistance we could expect but when we actually landed at Palma my wife needed to stretch her legs after 2 hours of sitting and so we walked slowly from the gate instead of waiting for one of the 7 wheelchairs which would have been needed for our particular flight. For our return journey we did use the PRM facilities which didn't work quite as smoothly as those at LPL. None of the special call points around the airport seemed to be operative so we had to report to the information desk in the centre of the check-in area for assistance to be summoned. We then had a wait of perhaps 15 minutes before assistance arrived a form was filled in (with copy attached to the wheelchair) and we were then taken to the special security area for PRM passengers. There appeared to be a relay system after security but we were allowed to make our own way to the gate rather than wait for the next available ""pusher"". And yes we did have the gate number long before it appeared on the screens for everyone else. A delay to our flight resulted in a Belfast flight being allocated to our gate and more wheelchair handlers arrived ready to assist PRM passengers onto that flight so we quickly had to explain that we weren't going to Belfast! One of the handlers was good enough to ring through to ask for the new gate for the LPL flight and even to wheel my wife to it. When eventually our flight was called PRM passengers were the first to board with more handlers to wheel them along the airbridge to the door of the plane. Unfortunately my wife's ""pusher"" talked loudly on his mobile phone most of the time leaving only one hand free to steer the chair and failing to avoid the bumps! The only time when he came off his mobile phone was when he saw an associate some 20 yards away down the airbridge and had a shouted conversation with him. My wife was glad to board the plane! So though PMI has a clearly defined system for PRM passengers its operation was not as smooth or efficient as we had hoped though no one was actually unhelpful. We didn't see any of the motorised buggies which used to transport PRM passengers so efficiently in the past but perhaps they are reserved for passengers being taken to the more distant gates as on this occasion we flew into and out of area A. As for PMI itself it was less busy than we've seen it on some occasions and there were few queues....but then we bypassed the main security area.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2010-01-26,I know my name already appears several times for comments on PMI but a January transit provided a completely different experience from any of our previous visits. It was pretty quiet when we arrived on a Saturday morning after a long taxi round to area D though there was a queue at passport control as 2 flights ex-UK arrived almost simultaneously. Departing on a Tuesday morning though was positively eerie: the place was almost deserted and at security there were just 4 staff and 2 of us! I've never seen an airport so quiet. Yet even with only 3 flights departing during our 2 hours there we still had to wait a while before our gate number appeared on the screens. I can't understand the reluctance of airports to announce the designated gate well in advance because the staff who take wheelchair passengers to their departure points always seem to know which gate long before the number is displayed on the screens. Despite checking in online I even had to go to an easyJet desk (also deserted apart from the staff) simply to find out which area (D again) to head for after security.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-11-05,Surprised to find how busy Palma was midweek halfway through October (not even UK half term week). Both inward and outward flights involved bus transfers from/to remotish stands and through area A which was fairly crowded. We were told on our return flight that one runway was closed so perhaps all flights were concentrated to just part of the airport. The result was shorter walks but busier concourses. Perfunctory passport control on arrival long queues at security on departure though the queues did move reasonably quickly. Even so some people had to queue-jump presumably to avoid missing their flights. Also there were lots of flight calls for named passengers who had failed to board on time. PMI is a very big and busy airport and you need to allow for this if you want to reach your gate on schedule.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-04-08,Back at PMI again but as this was early April it was noticeably quieter than on our previous transits. Easyjet flights seem to be using area C again after being in area A for a while so it meant we were back to the extra long cross-airport hikes. No delays at passports in either direction and quite swiftly through security on the return journey. We didn't have to take our watches off this time but there were notices advising that certain types of footwear would have to be removed e.g. ladies full length boots. The only minor hiccup was that our return flight to Liverpool seemed to be omitted from some of the screens which could have been difficult for passengers who had checked in online. Quite a few of the food outlets were not yet open but otherwise the airport seemed to be functioning efficiently.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,NA,2008-09-11,"Much of what I said last year still applies to Palma in some cases even more so. My wife and I were on our own this time and travelling with hand luggage only yet both transits took approximately an hour. The chief problem on arrival was the passage through passport control: we joined a queue that stretched halfway along a main bridge/concourse and shuffled forwards slowly only to discover that the other equally large queue to our left had to filter into our queue at the end as there was only one man checking passports! Had he actually been doing any more than merely glancing at them it would have taken even longer still. Given the cursory nature of the check I did wonder what was the point of any check at all. (There was none at all on our departure in contrast to our experience last year.) The hold-up on the return journey was through security where the queues stretched back from a double and very long set of ""chicanes"" into the main concourse. Again it proved the case that the twin queues filtered into one (because of building alterations going on?) so transit through security took over half an hour. Security is still fairly strict with watches having to be removed but there are plenty of staff who seemed both efficient and pleasant. Even so transit at the height of the season (this was September) must be a nightmare. The metal detectors through which one has to pass also seem to go off fairly frequently: I set it off and the only possible reason was my spectacles which have never been a problem before. These delays apart Palma still seems to function fairly well: plenty of seats in the gate areas loads of shops etc (if you want them) though they don't seem particularly cheap and loos at regular intervals. You do have to walk long distances though and watch out for the electric ""buggies"" used to transport the less mobile. It was noticeable that there were frequent ""last calls"" for missing passengers so anyone departing from Palma needs to be aware of how long it can take from check-in to departure gate. Also if you do need to check in and have luggage the desks are on one floor and departures are on the floor above but the indoor route from the car park accesses the upper floor with limited lift availability to the floor below.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Everything seems to work well but there could be more lifts because access from car parking/car hire collection or return to check-in usually involves going up or down one floor with a laden trolley. Transfer of less mobile passengers is usually efficient but on our return journey from Palma to Liverpool yesterday the two elderly and less mobile members of our party were deposited at the wrong location and I had to start searching for them! Luckily I found them fairly quickly but it could have been a real problem. Security is thorough and slow moving: even wrist watches have to be removed. Passport control en route to departure gates was also slow yesterday: two queues 50 yards or more in length gradually combining into one with just one man to inspect the passports. All in all you need to allow plenty of time to make your way from check-in to departure gate: 30 -45 minutes at least.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I checked with the person collecting him that he would be taken to the gate - 04 and was assured he would. As it happened we walked to the gate only to find that he wasn't there. I brought this to the attention of the clerks at the gate desk and was told ""he will be here"". They called the flight everyone started getting on the bus - and he still hadn't arrived. Then we saw him staggering down a flight of stairs totally unaware of where he was going and sit in the nearest available seat (at the opposite end of the hall). I informed the despatcher at the gate desk and she said ""but buggies can't travel down stairs""!!

I traveled with my 2 year old son last month arrived to terminal 2E from Taipei via Hong Kong and was transferring to a flight for Algiers. At CDG they refused to return the stroller to me at the Jetway citing regulations. Because the arriving flight was late I had to run carrying my son and backpack for a continuous 30 minutes to make the other flight in terminal 2F. Additionally when going through security there were numerous non-French speaking passengers in the queue and I was ashamed to witness how the airport staff were cracking jokes and making inappropriate comments in French on the appearances of some passengers.

Arrival was smooth place was quiet and luggage came through quickly. Finding the bus to our on-airport hotel was tricky due to poor signage and walk seemed endless. Arrivals area for meeting the family was dark low ceilings and depressing - makes a poor impression on someone coming to Paris for the first time - took family 70 minutes to come through - almost as long as the flight - waiting for luggage. Check-in for departure was smooth but arriving at the passport control line an hour before our 18.05 flight it took us 45 minutes to work our way through the line and security.

The airport bus could not drop us at 2A due to construction so dropped us on the other side of the airport requiring us to heist our luggage. The path was extremely poorly marked. Terminal 2A is dark looks as though it is 40 or even 50 years old lengthy lines at some airline check-in spots. Had a pleasant quick check-in at BA had a short line for security (business class) but the check-in area was extremely warm and the security area even warmer.

Check-in was a breeze allowing people who have checked in online to proceed straight to a bag drop counter.

penang-airport,/airport-reviews/penang-airport,Penang Airport customer review,Xuess Wee,NA,2005-04-20,When the aircraft touched down on the airport my first impression was that the airport was very OLD. There is only one runway and one small terminal to cater to international and domestic flights. Once the aircraft is docked at the terminal the passengers used the aerobridge (all flights regardless of international and domestic) to enter the terminal. The terminal is split into two sections which are the international and domestic sections. The state of the restrooms are very appalling. There are some small cafeteria and duty-free shops when one moves along the terminal but most of the items sold there are not too appealing. If you wish to purchase some items found in Penang only the airport is a good place to buy as they are stocked up with many authentic Malaysian goodies. The third level is where the airline lounges are. As I flew SIA and MAS in first and business class before I got the chance to use the lounges. The MAS lounge is beautiful and one should try it. It is situated looking towards the runway so you can see the different aircrafts when landing or take- off. The SIA lounge is a little dark and quiet but is still a good place to rest. On my return flight check-in was average. The staff were not grumpy but also not outstanding. There is only a small area to check-in.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,M Burgess,New Zealand,2015-04-16,What a fiasco. No easy public transport connections - took us two hours from just outside CBD to Int'l using train/public bus/inter airport bus. Qantas check-in not open - hunted for immigration forms from other airline counters to fill out in advance. The hunt for public conveniences involved a long walk to the other side of Arrivals. When we spotted a desk being opened we were informed to return in half an hour and go upstairs to buy a coffee in the meantime. As we had business class tickets we hardly wanted to buy a coffee when we could get one in the Qantas Lounge. To kill time we humped our suitcases up the escalators and back to visit Duty-Free. Why paper immigration forms are needed to be completed is a mystery with electronic passports and e-visitor visas? At Security one of us had to get 'double' scanned on the passport they emptied our bags unravelled our umbrella - OK a forgotten water bottle is easy to miss we needed it to keep going during the 'wait' for check-in to open - and then left us to re-pack everything. The electric toothbrush was nearly confiscated due to them thinking it was a screwdriver. Inadvertently I left my mini screwdriver in my glasses case to tighten my loose glasses screws not acceptable apparently and had to wave goodbye to it. When we eventually reached the Lounge for that long awaited cup of coffee was heaving with alternative airline pax and nearly all the seats gone!

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,Ian Morris,Australia,2014-10-13,Having had the misfortune to travel through Terminal 1 six times in the past year I think it is fair to say that this ranks amongst the poorest airports in the world especially for one in a so called developed country. Aside from the basic design flaws inherent in the original plans for the international terminal opened in 1986 which never helped the situation the current refurbishment's and extensions which seem to be as far from completion as they were when they were started 2 years ago are not addressing the basic issues that the terminal faces and seem to be making walking distances even worse. The basic problem is of course that when first built it never adopted the almost universal idea for airports of arrivals on the ground floor and departures on the first floor. Everything is on the ground floor then you go upstairs to immigration and security before going upstairs again to get to the woefully inadequate departure gates before having to walk down two floors via stairs to get to the airbridge to the plane. All the rebuilding ever since has not done much to correct the fundamental issues inherent in the design with Terminal 1. Facilities for the departing passenger are poor they are shockingly overpriced as far as the stores are concerned (although most are currently closed due to the refurbishment) they are cramped and illogically laid out. There remain serious issues with the lack of space in the departure gates but departing the airport is way easier than arriving! Arriving passengers now have to traipse to the back of the duty free store to get to immigration whist being bombarded by staff touting for business. After you get through immigration you usually get accosted without any warning by biosecurity officers who check your inbound passenger card for a preliminary check. Then you go downstairs to the baggage claim area where you have to miraculously work out which carousel your luggage will arrive on. Is it that hard to put an information screen on the immigration level to tell you this? If you have the unfortunate situation of your luggage arriving on carousel 3 then prepare your packed lunch - its a long walk! Then prepare to wait - a long time! There are only 5 international gates - why does it take so long for luggage to make it to the carousels? After arriving at Gate 5 last time I was in the baggage claim area in 8 minutes - then waited for just over 20 minutes for my bags. Once the luggage finally arrives you walk all the way back to the other end of the baggage claim area to go through biosecurity. Lots of staff but very few seem to be doing anything. You walk out of biosecurity into the arrivals hall - which is now smaller and narrower than before even though it is supposed to have been extended! Most of the extension seems to have been for more hire car desks. If you are unfamiliar with the airport good luck following all the virtually non-existent clear signage! If you are after a taxi well its now a nice long walk but at least it is undercover if you happen to be heading to the pick up lane or the car park you will get wet if it is raining or get sunburnt if it is hot and sunny. This is by far the worst designed airport you could ever find in a supposedly developed country.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

However the departure lounge is a disgrace there is no room to line up at the gates very limited food choices and the airline announcements echoing through the building destroy any chance of sleep or work. To make matters worse last time I was there about 30 minutes after clearing immigration and security a loud siren rang through the terminal telling us to evacuate. The lack of instructions and tiny exit signs made for a very slow evacuation. We had a 1 hour connection in Bangkok and the flight left about 40 minutes late.

Our layovers have been for six to eight hours. This airport 'lounge' is not up to international standards. The cafeteria style layout is unsuitable and it is very hard to rest with the bright lighting and persistent noise level. The flight gates and air-bridges are straight out of the cafeteria without separate waiting areas. Moreover airline staff make very loud boarding announcements. which reverberate round the whole hall. Many of these involve passengers who have failed to show up for boarding. How they could get lost or bewildered in such a small space is beyond comprehension. It is hard to understand why passengers can't just read the electronic boards themselves.

The facilities are passable the cleanliness is OK but the queue experience has to be experienced to be believed. Much of the problem relates to the fact that airport facilities are federally governed. The customs and security queue length and sluggishness reflect this and passengers should expect to spend up to 2 hours or more to get in and out of the place.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,A Gerber,NA,2008-12-11,Perth domestic is way overdue for improvements in comparison to other Australian state capital airports. One dubious change I've noticed this year has been the relocation of the rental-car area to an open car-park some distance from the terminal. Prior to its relocation the rental cars were practically in front of the terminal. Now it is a fair walk (especially from the Qantas end of the terminal) to pick up one's car. Although I never mind a good walk the distance is too short to justify a shuttle bus but long enough that if one is weighed down with a lot of baggage and/or it is raining (much of the walk is uncovered) you will arrive a bit worse for wear and/or wet at the end of your trek. Bring your own umbrellas if rain is forecast.

Check-in and departure is not a problem on both sides of the airport. Security checks are okay too. Facilities for waiting passengers are rather dissapointing (stay outside as long as possible once inside it is rather sad what there is on offer especially domestic gates). The horror story is arriving at domestic side. After collecting your luggage you better have pre-organised a taxi or a pick-up. The queues at the taxi stand are long and you can easily spend 2 hours waiting.

If US Airways and the airport authorities want to make the place more appealing then they need to get customs and TSA sorted. Customs - 3rd time to the US and the longest wait by far. We all complete ESTA but then stand in a long queue with people who seem to have a library of documents that need to be checked. When we eventually get to a desk we breeze through. TSA - are they providing a service or do they think they run the show. They are amongst the rudest people I have encountered and need to be told so and told to sharpen up their act and their ""customer"" skills. It would also help if they didn't randomly bark out orders and could speak in a language that at least approximates to English. I couldn't wait to leave the place - felt and treated like a criminal from the moment we landed. What a welcome to the US. As for the airport - no real complaints - enjoyed the food court and some decent shops to occupy the layover time.

I've read other posts complaining about the size of the airport - well it is a US hub and it is big  but no different to London Schiphol etc. My only gripe is the poor signage (what are you supposed to do with your bags for the onward flight where do you go). This needs improvement. Was a bit taken aback to find the baggage dumped on the floor (after a long wait for customs) so had to wander about looking for cases - and there was a lot to get around.

pisa-airport,/airport-reviews/pisa-airport,Pisa Airport customer review,A Macdonald,NA,2008-09-08,I have to agree about the chaos at Pisa Airport - both arrivals and departures have been the worst airport experiences of my life. On arrival we had to wait in a queue for 40 minutes on the tarmac in baking hot temperatures to get to security. Then another 45 minute wait to get the shuttle bus to the car hire terminal then another 45 minute wait to get to the Hertz desk. On departure a week later we made it through check in no space in departure lounge so went straight to the gate then sat at the gate until an hour past our departure time with no word as to what was happening. Eventually a passenger who spoke Italian found out that the baggage handlers had gone on strike. After another half hour we were told there was a 4 and a half hour delay to our flight. The lack of communication as well as the airport being too small for the number of flights using it means I will think very carefully before using this airport in future.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Whilst the number of people in the terminal was comfortable around my flight times it wouldn't go astray for the owners to speed up on expanding the airport facilities as it was getting a bit on the crowded side as there is only one taxiway connecting the apron to the runway.

The airport of Pristina is very compact and small. It has a restaurant in the check-in area and some shops. In the departure area there is a duty-free shop small but has some good stuff in it. When arriving to Pristina we had to walk all the way to the arrival hall which in my opinion looks very old. Baggage took a long time to get to the baggage carousels and they were on the wrong carousel. They were on the carousel for a Swiss flight instead of where they should've been. Staff were very helpful helped us to take the bags down from the carousel and explained to us that there was a misunderstanding between the staff. But one bad thing is that they didn't bring baggage carts so we had to carry the baggage all the way to the car waiting for us but the walking distance to the parking is really short so frankly it was not a big deal. When departing there were enough baggage carts and the whole check-in process and everything worked pretty smoothly and fine. They're currently on the final phase of building the brand new terminal which can be seen from the runway.

It took less than 10 minutes from plane seat to arrivals hall. Return (only flight again) was a little bit worse. Quick check in and security control pleasant enough cafe and two shops with local produce and the best of all- the outdoors observation area at the top of the waiting hall. What spoiled the perfect arrival/departure? As per usual ""Europe's largest low cost airline"" started announcing boarding despite the arriving flight was not even near the Croatian airspace. Me and my partner decided against standing in the queue until at least arriving plane was in our sight but this was prevented by member of staff shouting at us (at the observation deck) that we should proceed through the boarding gate (reminder - inbound flight did not arrive for another 20 minutes).

This airport has no redeeming features both from an aesthetic and service point of view. I flew out of Riyadh on 18 September (start of the Eid break) and there were over 400 people wanting to get in to the secure area to have their passports checked by Saudi immigration. Everyone pushing and shoving (mostly men) with no regard for the welfare of women and children. The response of the Saudi guards was to close the small door that passengers entered irrespective of whether passengers had to catch flights. It took over two hours to make our way through immigration and airport security. As a result the flight left 45 minutes late.

I agree with many of the reviewers comments that the airport is overcrowded with far too little seating both before and after passport control. The food is limited and of pretty mediocre quality. Getting through security on arrival and departure is relatively pain free. Then we get to transport to and fro! I tend to use the local Cottral bus and the metro from Anagnina to Termini and on to Tiburtina to catch a local train but must stress that in rush hour the journey from Termini to Ciampino (and the other way) can take up to 2 hours as the buses from Anagnina to Ciampino are only every 40 minutes.

We arrived with what we thought was ample time to make a connection. Once we had our bags we proceeded to the connecting airline bag drop. We had already checked in on line. This turned out to be of no value time wise. The woman at the bag drop sat and chatted with a colleague while the queue grew. She did nothing. When she finally opened up her desk we had lost half an hour. She told us we were over weight on one bag. It had been underweight on the flight we had just come in on. We took out one jacked which made the difference. Then she told us we had to hurry, our departure gate was about to close. We rushed to our departure gate only to find our flight was actually delayed for an hour. When that gate opened, there were two people at two check in desks. These two chatted and laughed with a third who subsequently left. They carried on with their conversation while the crowd grew and fumed. There was no order, no lines. The guy, officious at best, started to take the 'fast track' passengers first. This took about 20 minutes before they began to accept the rest of the passengers. At the moment I am at Heathrow.

Well connected to public and road transport and easy to find your way around. We arrived too early for check-in so spent some time in the floor above the desks in T3. This area is roomy and spacious with good seating and several shops and cafes of high quality. Clean toilets which had been recently refurbished and the time passed quickly. No queuing for check-in and security was managed efficiently with a minimal wait. Passed straight through one of the automated gates for EU passports again with no delay. After T3 passport control there are many more shops to pass the time and good eating facilities (although avoid Venchi with it's exceptionally rude staff) not many seats though although you will find some near the 'H' gates at the far end and again in the 'G' area once you have transitioned via people mover. If your flight leaves from the 'G' gates it is a good idea to take the people mover about an hour before departure as there is more seating there and additional shops to explore.

After that easy experience what follows it is hysterically bad. Check-in in Terminal C at least is a horrendous experience due to the abysmal layout of the check in areas - I can only assume they were designed by someone who never uses airports or who has severe masochistic tendencies. For some reason the check in desks are split into ""zones"" - each zone occupies a square with an area of approximately 50 metres square with approximately 12 check in desks in the square 6 either side of the square - as a result of this the queues for each desk meet in the middle in a horrendous muddle of confusion. To add to this the passport/security line also runs through the middle of all of this! The result therefore is that you have something like 13 different queues in a very small area working in 3 different directions - most passengers with heavy luggage often with children running around and screaming. If like me you are trying to get to a check-in desk near the back of this area you will find that you literally have to elbow your way through a seething mass of grumpy humanity and baggage to get to it - and then trying to find the end of your own queue is another matter -in the end I had to shout out loudly for people going to my destination to identify themselves so that I could join the correct queue. Once through all this the passport/security line is reasonably fast when compared to many airports (10 mins) although I would say that the actual inspections are a little on the cursory side. Airside the airport is at least a little more spacious although the airport authorities have not deemed it necessary to fill this space with useful furniture such as adequate seating. Proceeding to the gate to board in plenty of time I was amazed to see that the gate was being used to board 3 other flights before mine - although my plane was sitting waiting on the tarmac we simply could not get to it as the gate was being used for these other flights - this tells me that this airport simply does not have adequate capacity to deal with the volume of flights going through it - and this was on a Wednesday early afternoon not exactly peak time.

san-diego-airport,/airport-reviews/san-diego-airport,San Diego Airport customer review,M Rogers,United States,2011-08-27,Like many airports that have expanded in fits and starts over the years SAN is broken up between 3 terminals terminals one and two and the commuter terminal for short flights to Los Angeles. Terminal one is a bit older and cramped especially if you go in the morning rush or fly on Southwest. Terminal two is a bit nicer but currently undergoing expansion construction until 2013-2014. Parking is via shuttle and you have several choices between private and operators associated with the airport.

The signage is plentiful which is a great help when locating the otherwise hidden baggage claim. The terminals (especially the new one that houses Virgin America and the International one) are very nice though the restaurants are fairly pricey. The staff are helpful but a little no- nonsense which can be irritating. Commuting is a breeze thanks to being located right off the highway and the metro. Customs is done without hassle. On the downside the process of checking in and getting through security can be abysmal at the wrong time the majority of flights are United and flights are often slightly delayed because of fog.

Terminal A is the more ""modern"" terminal but the problem is that all passengers have to go through two very narrow passages for security screening - at peak times the queue will extend out to the carpark. If you're flying Southwest or American you will have to endure this. Fortunately once you're through the security it's usually pretty easy - the gates are very close by if you're flying Southwest a bit of a walk if you're on AA. Food choices are limited to a Starbucks McDonalds and other fast food outlets. Terminal C is the older terminal that lacks airbridges and requires the passenger to walk out on the tarmac and go up some mobile stairs like in the old days. However at times processing can be faster. If you're on Alaska Airlines the security line is relatively short at the gate.

It is small to the extent it could kind of be a bus station. I arrived in Mexico through SLP but did not depart from this point thus my experience is based on arrivals only (However I could see almost the entire airport anyway). Upon arrival I was greeted with very friendly immigration officials. I left my information documents that I was given to fill out en-route on the plane I didn't realise until I got the counter and went to hand them over. The friendly official was extremely helpful and gave me replacements and helped me fill it in as I looked tired. My bags arrived very quickly through the small carrousel and I was able to pick them up and move to a customs check point. At this point you are randomly picked for checks. I was picked however I was dealt with by another very friendly and helpful official who made me feel very welcome to Mexico. Finally I took a taxi to my hotel. Once out of the control area there is an area with information and helpers on hand to get you a well priced taxi or bus into town.

santiago-de-chile-airport,/airport-reviews/santiago-de-chile-airport,Santiago De Chile Airport customer review,A Mackenzie,Canada,2011-12-09,I have been through this airport many times in the last few years. Overall I would it fair to good. Arriving international is usually ok as other travellers noted: if you hold a Canadian American Australian or Mexican passport you will have to pay the entry fee in a different line before proceeding to immigration. Lines are generally fast in the morning but can be slow in the afternoon. Immigration and customs officials are usually relaxed with the exception of plant/animal goods. If you are unfamiliar with Santiago I would recommend getting a taxi just before you exit the baggage claim area. Departing can be a little different. Depending on when you depart you can expect to wait. Check-in will be long in the early weekday morning and sometimes in the afternoon. If you are departing internationally you will again have to go through immigration. Again they are quick but it can take 20 min. If you are departing domestic security is lax but can be very long on weekday mornings due to high volume. International gate side has a decent selection of restaurants and shopping although expensive. Domestic side has a few stores and not as many places to eat. Overall the airport is clean and bright. Signage is good and easily visible. You can usually find quiet areas to relax if you have a long layover.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Terminal 3 in Guarulhos has transported the main International terminal from the 1950's to the current era. Fantastic improvement from 12 months ago. Upon arrival you are greeted by a wide arrival concourse with moving walkways rest rooms at regular intervals clear signage in both Portuguese and English high ceilings clean fresh look. Immigration took 4 minutes and most of that was talking to the immigration officer about the remarkable transformation. After that you are greeted by an unbelievably spacious luggage claim area. Bags still took a long time to arrive but this is normal for me. You also have a reduced immigration card to fill in. Certainly makes a difference after the long haul from Australia. Guarulhos Terminal 3 could be any modern airport in the world as compared to the run down shambles that used to greet you upon arrival. Absolutely no complaints at all.

sao-paulo-guarulhos-airport,/airport-reviews/sao-paulo-guarulhos-airport,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport customer review,M Robertson,United Kingdom,2013-01-08,Transited through GRU 3 times in 2.5 weeks Dec-Jan with connecting Domestic-International International- Domestic and Domestic-International. It is not clear on the connections process with no dedicated connections channels process. In connecting you need to leave the baggage claim area and if connecting International to Domestic you will need to collect your luggage (even if ticketed through and have boarding pass) and go to Connections Desks on the other side of the lifts as you come out of Domestic Baggage claims. If connecting Domestic to International you shouldn't need to (if you have your boarding pass and luggage through ticketed) so as you come out of Domestic arrivals go straight up to International Departures on 1st Floor. A better choice of eating and shopping landside with a 'pub' style bar that has more comfortable style seating and waiter service. Overall options are not great landside but far better than airside particularly Domestic. International airside more options than Domestic but not sufficient eating facilities for passengers at the times I was flying. Something to note are the potentially long queues you can have when departing Internationally. The security screening overall area isn't big enough for busy periods and you will be faced with a large queue if leaving in the evening but it does seems to move quite quickly and there are plenty of security screening scanners when through the queue. You should also be aware that departing immigration checks can be long depending on whether you are Brazilian or not and when you fly. As non- Brazilian I had experience of both time slots and when transiting the first time and leaving mid-evening for a flight to Buenos Aires I got caught in a queue of fellow Europeans returning home and had to wait nearly an hour to clear departure immigration. On the last transit I left on a late evening TAM flight back to Europe I found the non-Brazilian queue very quick whereas the queue for Brazilians was huge and slow. You need a minimum 2 hour connection time in GRU if connecting Domestic to International or reverse however it did appear there were TAM agents at the Domestic arrivals door to deal with passengers on flights departing imminently.,NA,NA,NA,4,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

GRU is not dirty just dingy and dark. It does have elevators!

I think the comments here are by and large fair. GRU is not somewhere you would choose to spend time but its not a bad place just struggling to cope with more people than it was built for and showing its age.

Arriving on a Lufthansa flight from Europe and connecting with an AC flight to Vancouver - a process that took 3 hours! Immigration Control was slow and as Canadian citizens we were not advised that we could use the Areas 5 and 6 reserved for US citizens until we were well into the lineup. Once dealt with by a very pleasant officer we had to go thru TSA inspection which took a while by more pleasant officers (did u know that there were regulation sized plastic bags for your liquids??? I sure didn't!) and then had to take 3 count 'em three trains to get to the North Satellite where our Jazz aircraft departed from!

The infrastructure is excellent, the hallways vast, the planes on time. Everything runs with great efficiency. But Seoul destroys the experience with a nightmarish transfer desk.

There is no special line for frequent travelers, business class, the elderly or small children. Everyone is throw into the cauldron and it is dreadful. This kind of senseless blockade increases consumer anxiety as they try desperately to make a connecting gate. They took all my luggage apart and made me repack for no good reason.

seville-airport,/airport-reviews/seville-airport,Seville Airport customer review,G Roberts,NA,2007-11-16,Compared to my other experiences of provincial Spanish airports Seville is indeed a breeze in many ways. Rebuilt for the 1992 Expo (along with much of Seville) the airport is spacious and well- functioning with a huge and airy departures hall. Arrivals is pretty spartan but baggage was delivered swiftly (even though several suitcases fell off the conveyor belt at the first ‘bend’). Taxis are plentiful and cost a fixed rate to the city centre (currently €24). Airport buses also run regularly to/from the city centre picking up in Nervion and Santa Justa station and cost a mere €2 – allow plenty of time on the return journey as traffic can be a nightmare. Beware also that the bus drops off at ground level and you will need to carry your luggage up two flights of stairs or wait ages for one of two lifts. Swift check-in with Ryanair more through luck than organisation. Security ng goods at usual inflated prices and plenty of (very hard!) seating to wait for your flight. Once through into the departure lounges there is soft seating but the only facilities here are toilets and vending machines. There is a quiet café seating area behind the non-functioning departures board (don’t worry there are also monitors that do work) which has good views of the runways to while away the hours.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

No orderly lines for immigration. Arrivals area was hot no air conditioning no fans even the air was still and hot. Very uncomfortable. A local music group was set up just inside the door in the arrivals area with the loudest music it was not the greeting many wanted. People standing in front and behind were commenting on the volume. Local Seychellois arriving pushed their way to the front ignoring foreign passengers and making fellow passengers feel unwelcome. When they were challenged their attitude was indifferent. Police and immigration officers just watched on and ignored this problem. Immigration processing time was extraordinarily slow. Random bag check was a faux pas. After being asked a series of questions and then being told to put bag through scanner I noted there was actually no one observing the monitor! Departing Seychelles was slightly easier. But again the processing time to get tickets and check bags was so slow. The bag check and line up area is open air.

Another military exercise causing vast delays or another VIP landing in PEK and creating havoc in the skies? Could not blame CZ airplane was there crew was there etc. After boarding on time we were asked to deplane and go back to the waiting hall. Just sit and wait - no announcements then suddenly I saw that my gate was boarding again without any notice or announcement. As many other reviewers say there is nothing to do in PVG - no decent food and far too expensive. Long walks to the end of the terminal while other gates are empty I think they want you to walk past all those shops with bored sales staff and overpriced items.

The maze you walk through following the international transfer arrows was easy enough. On the return transferring was a nightmare. My flight landed at 4.30am along with at least 3 other flights and when we arrived in the transfer hall there was again no one at the transfer desk. I didn't see a single staff member anywhere for a good hour. I bypassed the desk it and waited in security line which at that point was also unmanned. Everyone waiting was confused about where to go and what to do. We didn't see a single staff member until nearly 6am when they told us we needed to go to the transfer desk first and kicked us all out of line. At that point several other flights had landed and we found ourselves at the back of the line. Took 1.5 hours before I finally got to the desk where they looked at my ticket and passport than waved me through. With probably more than 6 planes worth of people waiting they only had one lane open in security? That added another 45 minutes of wait time. So that was over 3 hours just to transfer flights.

sharm-el-sheikh-airport,/airport-reviews/sharm-el-sheikh-airport,Sharm El Sheikh Airport customer review,Matthew McGrath,NA,2007-11-01,I think this airport is now a tale of two terminals. The new terminal which opened earlier this year (now called Terminal 1) is light and airy with plenty of space and is clean and well airconditioned. I used the terminal last week to fly internally to Luxor on Egyptair and everything was clean and tidy. BA and other scheduled airlines (as well as charter flights to Moscow) use the new terminal. On the other side of the coin I flew in and out of Sharm on Monarch and like other European charter airlines they come in and out of the old terminal (now called Terminal 2). On Sunday afternoon it was a bun fight with appallingly insufficient numbers of seats for the passengers hoping to depart no semblance of a non-smoking area toilets which were pretty foul and very limited catering facilities. Spent two hours sitting on the floor reading a book while waiting for the flight. The additional money to fly BA might be worth it to use the nice terminal and avoid pins and needles. Given that it is a tale of two terminals I would have to give the airport 3 stars as being half good and half ordinary.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The check in agent was friendly and the airport police stationed at the entrance of the departure hall was friendly too, it made me feel really welcomed. Being an aviation enthusiast, I decided to do some plane spotting airside. I headed down to Terminal 3, hoping to photograph a Qatar Airways A350. I set up my tripod, and start taking a few shots of it. A tourist was intrigued by my camera and tripod, hence we both started chatting. As the tourist left for his flight, a fellow police officer, I saw who was watching me the whole time, walked up to me and told me off that I could not spot there. He warned me rudely that my camera could be confiscated and I could be jailed. I asked him the reason why, and he told me he was not sure but still insisted I leave that place immediately. That ruined my mood in the departure hall. I headed back to Terminal 1 as there was not much at Terminal 3. Since Changi does not offer plane spotters like me to openly go into gates and spot planes, I decided to take photos of the screens at each gate. In the process, several gate officers rudely shouted at me not to take the contents inside the gate and I felt terrified each time they do. I gave up on plane spotting in the airside, sitting near my departure gate waiting for my gate to open. Being a passenger and a Singaporean departing out of my home airport, I was extremely disappointed with the service of the Airport police. Instead, I felt they could have done better by not being so harsh.

singapore-changi-airport,/airport-reviews/singapore-changi-airport,Singapore Changi Airport customer review,P Metcalf,Australia,2014-10-13,This airport was confusing as it displayed the best and worst of what an airport can be all in one! Arrived Terminal 2 toilets clean but mostly squat toilets! There was 1 western toilet in each block which was always full as no-one wanted to use the squat toilets I found this problem throughout the airport which was very surprising as I've traveled extensively in Asia and never seen this at an airport before. Passport control took over an hour by which time the baggage was left on carousel but no airline sign was on there so we had to ask. Airport looks great very impressive until we noticed the lack of basic seating. Most restaurants closed about 10pm so it was too late for us. They had 24 hour food courts which were great only problem is they didn't accept card. The cash machines nearby would only let us draw out 100SGD so didn't want to be left with all that money for a cheap meal. The airport lacked signposts and was hard to navigate we walked around to different terminals and others were having the same problem. They had wifi but it was different in each area so you had to request a code and find the information desk each time! Very inconvenient as sms codes didn't work. Had lots of problems speaking to staff in English which was surprising for a country where its the official language. I was very disappointed in this airport its like they are in a race to build more gimmicky things and are too concerned by the look of the airport to overlook basic things like restaurants accepting credit cards lack of seating and toilets fast passport control!

T3 is huge and as other comments suggest you have to be prepared to walk a fair bit although their are numerous moving walkways and you can ask for a buggy. That said the terminal is spacious and toilets are spotless and some even overlook the apron and one of the runways.

The Immigration staff were the friendliest I've encountered in a long while all smiles and welcomes which makes a nice change!

So often you find yourself walking for miles before you reach your gate - here it's up some stairs through security down some stairs and you're at the gate. Forget gate #98 - there are only about 6 gates. You're not made to walk past hundreds of shops - there are just three airside and the only ones you need in an airport; a cafe/restaurant a newsagent and duty free. The lounge is basic but does the job and given the nature of the airport and the fact that you do not need to spend long there it is sufficient. The speed of the queues is amazing - the best I've experienced anywhere. Arrivals are amazing the best coming home from Dublin took me 30 seconds from going into the terminal to coming out.

Various Check-in Desks on the right hand side which can get quite busy when a wave of flights depart within a few minutes of each other (eg 3 fights to UK within 1 hour). Security the usual arrangement then Passport Control and an escalator upstairs to the Departure Lounge. A bar/cafe at each end and a reasonable Duty Free. Boarding is done walking down stairs and across the tarmac to the waiting plane. Arrivals is again relatively easy with a walk across the tarmac Passport Control and Baggage Reclaim. In Arrivals there is the usual selection of banks and car rental companies and an Information Desk. Interestingly there is a spiral staircase at the left hand end of the building which leads up to a bar and restaurant which gives very good views of all the aircraft arriving/departing and the apron - this is for anyone to use and provides a good waiting spot.

Security is okay - if it is really busy they have up to three machines but usually only use one during the off-season. Duty free is limited to one general shop and one for perfumes there are two small bars (only one of which is open off-season) for drinks in the lounge and a restaurant/bar before security.

split-airport,/airport-reviews/split-airport,Split Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,NA,2006-07-23,Split Airport on a Saturday in mid-summer is obviously a different experience than reported by your previous correspondent. It is simply overstretched by the sheer volume of flights. Arriving wasn't too bad though we did have to queue for several minutes to get out of the baggage reclaim into the arrivals hall. Departing was awful. We had to queue to get into the terminal building itself and then join any check- in queue once we were inside as the only airline which seems to have a separate designated check-in desk is Easyjet. For all the others it is a free-for-all. It took us about 45 minutes to reach the head of our particular queue then we had to fight our way back through the queue behind us and across the hall to access Security and Departures. Security itself was fairly swift and efficient but upstairs in the Departures lounge itself there was more congestion with queues for everything including the loos (it took our daughter 20 minutes at least to pay a visit!). We were lucky: we managed to find two seats for the three of us to share while we waited for our flight to be called. From what we could see the airport itself could be as congenial as your other correspondent suggested but it is not really equipped for Saturday summer schedules. (There seem to be far fewer flights in the week - we stayed on an island across from the airport - so I'd advise prospective visitors to try to avoid flying into or out of Split at the weekend).,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Strange queues at entrances to terminals with security search done with no idea of what line management is. Check in desks in two terminals are located before (Terminal 1) and after Customs (Terminal 2) which makes confusing departure procedures even more painful. Secondary security search is done before passport control at Terminal 1 and after passport control at Terminal 2. Confusing again. The security search procedure is deliberately inefficient with lack of manned lanes. Passport control didn't delay me these times so I was lucky both going in and out.

Bus to terminal then straight outside. Note that the ordinary bus terminates at Moskovsky Prospekt Metro station - you also have to pay double (38 roubles instead of 19) if you have a suitcase (same on the Metro - 44 roubles instead of 22 and you get a different coloured token to operate the luggage gate). From what I could find out (but I may be wrong) there are no longer any buses from the airport right through to Moskovsky Railway Station. Outbound also easy - quick check-in unless you're using Aeroflot whose queues snake around the building. No-fuss security was quick (English-speaking security officers). Landside flight announcements are all made in English as well as Russian but airside I could only hear Russian. Landside has all the usual shops - news-stand gift shop cafes etc. Food prices are extortionate - 135 roubles for a croissant that costs 20 in any local bakery. Airside only has a bar gift shop (closed - my flight was 7.30 am) and news-stand. WiFi apparently available as plenty of people were using laptops. Be careful if your flight is from Gates 1 to 6 - these are in the satellite terminal in the middle of the tarmac so you have to go downstairs from the departure lounge use a travelator out to the satellite then upstairs into the gate area.

Thankfully a kind person guided me because I would not have found it myself. On the mini-bus you will have to pay an extra fare if you have a bag. From the outside Pulkovo 1 looks quite imposing - there are only a couple of doors and I saw no signage to identify where was arrivals and departures but by fluke I picked the right door. Inside is quite dimly lit. There are just a few check-in counters and all the destinations are in Russian so if you need to catch a flight here make sure you can read your destination (or at least your flight number) in Cyrillic. My flight had only one counter open but it was very efficient and although the queue was long I had my boarding pass in just 10 minutes or so.

The terminal building is impressive and always clean with abundant natural light. This is due to the fact that it is split into 5 levels but the bulk of the main terminal area is under one roof. Check-in is uniformly speedy and the staff are polite and efficient. Queues at security are manageable and the move from landside to airside is always smooth. The facility itself is compact and easy to navigate. The Red Baron Cafe landside is the best option for dining as it offers the best choice airside slightly limited but adequate for an airport of its size. A bus ride to your aircraft on stand-off bay is almost guaranteed but STR does this day in-day out so they do it well and everything is efficiently co-ordinated.

The black and yellow checked Expresso bus is a good option to get to nearby Reutlingen and surrounds and Expresso tickets are also valid for the Reutligen bus network. Luggage delivery is swift but beware trolleys are not free. If you need change for one there is a change machine just near the baggage services counter on which you will find a sign: 'Kein Kleingeld - Keine Information' 'No change No information' a nice comical touch.

There are only about 10 flights a day going to Sydney and Melbourne. It has recently been upgraded and expanded the gate area is much bigger and has food outlets and toilets. It opens up on to the runway and provides nice views. It's an easy airport to handle as it isn't too big to get lost in but isn't so small so as to feel cramped. The butterfly sanctuary between check-in and security (which must be walked through as it is on the pathway) is a lovely touch and provides a unique atmosphere. The ground staff are very friendly.

After clearing immigration and collecting my bags head to the customs with nothing to declare it was really a hassle-free experience. Departing from SYD to HKG with a 'fast track pass' which really didn't mean a thing. Staff at the immigration queue just direct passengers without that fast pass going to the fast pass area which I needed to follow behind those 'normal' passenger. I think they really should review on such policy. Immigration officers are friendly and the gate area is really congested.

Also at Sydney after leaving immigration to go to your gate duty free stores are so located that its impossible to get to the gate without going through a maze and then the gates are hard to find.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,C Tudehope,Australia,2011-04-03,Never had issues in the domestic terminals (T2 and T3). Both are very easy to use and get around with plenty of facilities and lounges to keep one busy should there be a flight delay (given how busy it gets there is potential for this to occur). In particular the food court in T2 (Virgin Blue Jetstar and regional NSW flights) has a great range of outlets with good views of planes moving around. For aircraft aficionados there are plenty of spots throughout this terminal for viewing planes taking off and landing. T3 is pleasant and is open throughout. It's easy to travel through yet doesn't have the same range of shops as T2. Staff are friendly and there is an interesting Qantas Heritage Museum located near Gate 14. Transfers between these terminals is easy through a subway that also goes to the railway station. T1 the international terminal has just been refurbished and is rather pleasant with a large range of shops to rival other airports worldwide. Going through customs etc. to leave the country is often a speedy process with queues minimal. However re-entering the country is a lot more difficult with queues for customs taking a while baggage taking its time to arrive on the carousel and immigration taking a while to screen everyone and their respective goods. I understand that they're trying to be scrupulous with who and what to allow in the country but surely there must be some way to speed up the process. A word of advice is to not arrive on a flight between 5am and 9am when most large long-haul aircraft arrive meaning particularly long queues for all arriving passengers. In general however it's an easy airport to use with all facilities that one could need.

There is the usual selection of rubbish repetitive shops with nothing exciting that I could find. The departure lounge is pretty dull there is very little to do and the food and shops won't excite anyone who regularly flies. Perhaps this airport has gone out of its way to make everything as standardised as possible compared to other big regional airports. The other gripe is that this airport is poorly connected to Taipei proper - road is still the only option although buses are frequent and take under an hour.

However the terminals are smart clean and I don't have too many complaints. Some suggestions. Some of the eateries in the food court could also have a presence airside. Like Singapore and its wonderful but more expensive sister airport Songshan (in Taipei itself) it makes use of interesting themes in some of the terminals alcoves about aviation in Taiwan nature of Taiwan relax zones etc which are a nice touch. Ironically it's Songshan that is connected by metro and not as yet Taoyuan - it seems to be taking an eternity to finish the metro link and the high speed rail is miles away and costs a fortune! That and the excruciatingly slow immigration are really the only two problems.

I tend to use the old terminal 1 and was very disappointed by the facilities. Arrived at the end of May this year the arrival hall was just day from being handed back from the renovation. The place is dirty dusty and has no soul. Its just like a temporary bus station. The immigration process was perhaps the best in the world. There was no queue and the immigration officers were extremely friendly and approachable. The luggage as usual didn't come out quick enough considering how empty the airport was. Then its a hassle to get to the taxi rank – again it had the feeling of a temporary bus station rather than an international airport at a capital city. Leaving the airport was another experience. I assume that the check-in area has been refurbished and the lighting was great. It might have difficulty dealing with large quantity of passenger though as the luggage belt at the check in area wasn't properly designed. After checking in I proceed to the immigration on the second floor. Again the wall and ceiling was covered by plastic for the renovation. Immigration and security again was no hassle. Once I passed the security I could feel the difference of a new airport – beautiful wall with art work nice duty free area with helpful staff a new small library plenty of plants on the wall and super deluxe toilets.

Do not entertain any ideas of ground staff honouring priority luggage tags or any priority boarding from elite members. Departing passengers keep an eye out for last minute gate changes. Double check luggage to make sure staff have tagged the destination correctly. This past trip I caught that they had indicated my bags be sent to SOF instead of SFO. Overall there have been improvements but you must still be wary.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2011-10-11,A poor airport but a remarkably painless experience. I flew out on a Monday afternoon with few other flights going which probably helped. After having to lug bags upstairs to departures there was a brief security check at the entrance. Check-in was slow but went fine and they took my bag. Note that you have to fill out the exit form before checking in. Then you present the exit form at customs along with your entry form. They amended something on my form and waved me through. Emigration was just as quick. Then one more security check and I was at the gate within 30 mins of arriving.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,D Wright,Australia,2011-10-03,I landed on a flight from Munich customs declaration forms completed thanks to aircraft personnel luggage arrived within the usual time (after about a 10 mins wait). Passport and customs formalities were quickly dealt with (I was at the front of the queue but my son was at the back and still did not have to wait long. There was a pro forma scan of incoming luggage but the official did not actually look at his monitor. Getting out of the airport took about 45 mins from landing and certainly no chaos dirt or grotty toilets. Getting a taxi was easy (airport staff seem to be assigned to getting visitors taxis and ensuring a reasonable charge). Returning home was the same except that we got there far too early. Going through customs and passport control was again simple no long queues. Departure lounge was shared with another flight but neither seemed to have many passengers and announcements were clear. There was also a small coffee bar and clean toilets. All in all no different to any other airport I have flown through.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Progress was slow but sure through immigration to bag pick up to customs. From getting off plane to exiting airport was about 45 minutes. Immigration queues divided into Uzbek citizens and all others. Interestingly it was the Uzbek queue that moved really slowly! Departed to LHR on September 14th on HY 201. Checking in going through immigration customs security and flight security was reasonably swift though the stone faced attitude of all the airport officials is clearly a hangover from when Uzbekistan was part of the USSR - sad as Uzbeks are generally warm friendly people. The small bar also operated with Soviet grimness serves no Uzbek beer nor anything to eat.

Make sure your are among the first off the plane and run do not walk to the passport control line. Make sure you have TWO copies of the customs form filled out completely. Then make sure you prevent people from cutting in front of you in the x-ray line after baggage claim. Still you may be delayed as the staff seem to wave locals on in front of you. Departure was crazy - gates are vaguely marked and flights are announced via a monitor. When the flight is announced you are herded into a cramped hallway with people from at least 3 other flights all waiting to board a bus. It was a pity since we could see our plane less than 300 yards away! We had to wait in the cramped hallway as airport staff screamed flight numbers and destinations and people squeezed past others to the bus.

tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,K Fridlington,United Kingdom,2009-11-05,It does take time to get into the country especially if a large tour group gets to the immigration check first. Local people get a kind of priority however the officials seem to be looking at reasons to stop as many as they can. Anyway remember to complete your arrival card fully and complete every section. The first control point examines your passport and visa you collect luggage and then go through a second check where they examine and stamp your arrival card. Leaving the country is similar again you need to complete another card to present to the security at passport control who ask about money. Again I was expecting the worse however we had no issues or problems it helps to smile and be polite. After the passport check there are very limited facilities the duty free shops only take euros dollars or UK pounds the prices are very expensive and the choices are limited.

tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,Mark Bickerton,NA,2006-02-11,Tashkent airport is quite modern in design but tries hard to retain a flavour of Soviet bureaucracy in its overall service. I have been asked for bribes by check-in staff at least three times and one time had to spend 10 mins trying to find a member of staff so I could check in (the desk said 'Check in Open'). When I located someone I was eventually told there was no seat for me (which means 'give me money and there will be') so I had to argue with him to get my confirmed seat. There is not much to do at this airport; the gate cafe is rubbish and only accepts US Dollars. If you are stuck there because of a delay try to get out of the airport and go to a nearby choykhana or shashlik place.

tbilisi-airport,/airport-reviews/tbilisi-airport,Tbilisi Airport customer review,J Quinto,Spain,2012-02-02,Tbilisi is a small airport with only three aerobridges. Arrival customs efficient enough but had to wait over 30 minutes for bags to come out. I arrived late in the evening (and departed very early in the morning) so I was not able to make use of the (newish) railway connection into the city. I arranged for airport-hotel transfer (expensive at 25 euros each way!) and thus avoided the waiting taxi drivers. Departure check-in was reasonably efficient but there was only one X-ray machine which slowed things considerably.

tbilisi-airport,/airport-reviews/tbilisi-airport,Tbilisi Airport customer review,A Jansen,NA,2006-05-23,"I found this one of the most revolting airports I have ever been. The facilities have changed little since soviet times and are just too small. In arrivals there was only one luggage-belt. Some thugs monopolized the trollies and demanded money from foreigners who wanted to use them. Unruly taxi drivers even pushed their way into the arrivals hall looking for prey (foreigners). Departure was even worse. The departure hall is much bigger and supposedly better organized but still we had a very unpleasant time there. First of all most flights seem to leave very early in the morning (around 5 AM) which is already inconvenient. Secondly the check-in of several flights at the same time causes a lot of confusion. Staff works extremely slow and broad shouldered types simply push their way up the lines while people behind you gladly try to push you aside. The guards in the hall are uninterested in this and do not take any action at all. After receiving our boarding pass we had to go upstairs. In spite of the sign ""passengers only"" the stairs were blocked by people saying goodbye to their loved ones. There were only 2 desks for foreign passports. Even here some unpleasant types tried to push themselves in front. People from western countries were treated politely but my wife who has a Moldovan passport and a valid residence permit for the Netherlands experienced real trouble. An extremely unfriendly female official grabbed her passport and without any explanation went into some office rudely ordering my wife to follow her. I went after her and found some officer holding my wife's passport. I demanded an explanation as well as their names and registration numbers. One good thing about Georgia's rose revolution is the fact that officials are in fact required to identify themselves when asked and that it is also possible to make a complaint against them. Luckily this helped without even looking into the passport he gave it back saying that there was "" no problem"" . I am sure that without this intervention they might have detained my wife for hours. I am deeply disappointed that officials at this airport show a smiling face to westerners while at the same time they apparently take pleasure in harrassing people from poor countries. After this intermezzo we had to go to the metal detector. There was only one working so again a huge queue had formed. This detector did not work at all - it went off for almost everybody but not for me even though I was carrying a pocket knife with me! Finally we had reached the "" departure lounge""  an extremely small area with a bar and one sad "" tax free shop"". I am a smoker myself but the fumes exhausted by visitors of the bar were even too much for me. There seemed to be no toilet at all however when looking really well (a small corridor behind the bar) you could find it. Even though Georgia produces wonderful souvenirs there was nothing except cigarettes and some alcoholic drinks in the taxfree sold by some unfriendly women spending their time chatting to each other and taking cigarette-breaks. There were 2 "" exit gates"" (not indicated by numbers). Departures were announced in unclear english (no monitors). Travellers had to walk down to ground level were busses were waiting to take them to the planes. Since these busses stand next to each other and several take-offs take place almost simultaneously this leads to confusion when people get into the wrong bus. We were really glad to have the ordeal behind us. A terrible place unworthy of this beautiful country!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Very basic very 70's and just not that great. It's not modern shopping facilities are limited and eating and drinking is minimal also it's very crowded at certain times (especially around midnight). I always wondered why Iran didn't put some money in airport improvements. Because as we all know an airport is the first and last thing visitors to the country usually see.

tel-aviv-airport,/airport-reviews/tel-aviv-airport,Tel Aviv Airport customer review,M Lee,Hong Kong,2013-11-29,"Arriving in to Tel Aviv (Ben Gurion) is relatively straight forward. The airport is fairly new and looks good. Departing is a whole different ball game and the time is spent mainly with the security checks so make sure you have plenty of time and I mean plenty of time. We arrived 3 hours prior to departure but it took us over 2 hours overall just to check in! Firstly queue to go through the ""interview"" i.e. why were you in Israel where are you going who were you with who packed your bag have you been given anything to carry on behalf of someone else etc etc. Wait time for us was approx 50 mins. Secondly queue for your bags go through a scan. Wait time for us was approx. 15 mins. Thirdly queue for your bag to be hand-searched. Wait time for us was approx 30 mins plus search time. Fourthly queue to check your bags in. Wait time for us was approx 30 mins. As much as security is of high importance the level of efficiency to move passengers was really poor e.g. ""interview"" staff would suddenly disappear leaving a long queue of people waiting around. Also don't think you can skip a security line either as you need all of the proper security bar codes before you can Check In. And the distance for all of the waiting around in - a mere 50m! Fifth queue for Immigration. This is where they really need some form of ""crowd control"" and manage their staff change overs. People were queuing in front of each individual Passport counter but when 2 of the staff left the remaining (long) queues became disorganised as they struggled to find another line to queue in for yet a different Immigration Officer. It would have been better if there had been a single queue and passengers directed to the next available counter. As for the rest of the airport well we really didn't experience much of it. Since Check In took so long we had to head straight to the Departure Gate. The only good thing - free wifi albeit for 30mins. There's one question in this survey that asks ""would you recommend this airport"" well since it's the only international airport into Israel then there's not much of an option except ""yes"".",NA,NA,NA,1,1,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

Firstly, its a long way out of the city. We used a fixed price taxi, which cost 15 Euro, but it will easily be 25 to 30 Euros from the city centre. On arrival we were met with a Departure Board, that only showed a handful of flights. We had to dodge lines to eventually find where we needed to check in. I am just thankful we arrived early. We stood for 30 minutes on what was a short line of people (clerk was simply slow), to find that we could only weigh the luggage and get the tags and that we had to drop off the suitcases at another part of the airport. No signs anywhere to show you where drop off was. The Terminal is small, and lines so long, we had to fight to through lines of people to find the bag drop. Once there, we had another 40 minute wait and a line that snaked around half the airport, just to drop off the bag. Crazy! Next another 30 minute queue to go through security. Rude staff and poor organisation sum up this experience. As we were flying to a non Schengen country, we had to use a small lounge on the other side of passport control, which was so full we had to stand.

As it is the check in area is separated totally from the rest of the airport requiring everyone to show ID to walk through a door to go through a customs area before actually checking in for the back end of the row of counter. Then you retrace your steps to access the immigration area before the typically cramped security screening which only had two of the four points on duty leading to a long wait in line.

Boarding is a funny procedure when they form two queues (priority and normal) that are of equal length but boarding begins simultaneously for both line and looks like entering subway station during peak hours. They board 747 within 6-8 minutes. Food facilities are plentiful landside but spreaded chaotically throughout the terminals. Airside there is almost nowhere to eat.

However senior immigration quickly ushered us (family of 4) to a special counter and bypassed several passengers. Toilets were clean with several baby changing facilities found. Not many shops found in the arrival hall. Baggage claims fast and efficient. Used Airport Limousine Bus to downtown Shinjuku where they have buses departing once every 15 mins. The only drawback was there were 3 different buses at 1 bus stop and it was difficult to establish the correct bus especially in winter. Departure using South Terminal. Done some last minute shopping at level 4 South Terminal. Tourists are recommended to do last min buys before immigrations; unlike in Hong Kong or Singapore Changi where there are plenty of shops after immigration. Immigration lines were long as there were a lot of flights departing at 5pm. However custom officers were efficient.

In the past  if you had a re-entry permit you could line up with the Japanese people at the immigration counter. That system was very good. However they changed the system recently. On my last trip from Vietnam there was 7 lines for Japanese 4 for tourists and 1 for immigrants (re-entry permit holders). As I was not aware of the new system my first reaction was to queue with the Japanese people but big mistake... I was sent to this huge line that was for the immigrants only. I have always loved Japan and unlike many foreigners I have never had any problems in Japan. But after queuing for a good hour and seeing that the only remaining line was ours I felt quite insulted. It was clear that Japanese were to be first second tourist and finally immigrants. A few people shouted while they were queuing as the situation was outrageous. All the counters were empty but they refused to let us go to the empty counters. Unfortunately for those who got angry they got told off like a ten-year old would be if he had been up to some very bad mischief. After 1h30 minutes we finally got through feeling angry rejected and misunderstood.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport is highly functional. Like many big international airports it takes quite a long walk from the arrival gate to the immigration check point. Despite the fact that new immigration procedures ( fingerprinting & photographing ) were implemented in November last year it does not slow down the arrival process. The airport staff are polite. Water bottles are allowed in after at the security check point if they are tested negative ( a special testing device at the security check point to test the content of the water). There are good selections of Japanese and Western restaurants in the departure hall.

Very efficient immigration very quick baggage service very helpful security staff. The airport doesnt look overcrowded I would even say the opposite: it's very calm and tranquil place. Very unusual for the airport of such a scale and passenger volume. Railway station is underground and easy to reach. Some security procedures may seem strange. For example arriving to the airport by bus or taxi you're stopped by the road police at the check point before the airport and asked for documents so don't put it to baggage which is not with you in the cabin of the bus. Otherwise you're asked to find you bag in the hold and present your passport which is actually checked not very thoroughly (mine was taken and looked at upside down). Some minuses of this airport: after 9pm nothing works there. No food outlets no cafes no bars are open. Buildings become deserted and even information desks are empty. However special telephones for information service are available and calls are responded. Terminal 1 layout is very confusing and not clearly mapped and signposted. I've spent good 20 minutes trying to find post office. Toilets landside were not clean and even more I noticed some insects there. Very unpleasant and strange for this airport. Airside food and duty free facilities are limited I found a single coffee outlet open and noon after security. It was overcrowded. All in all a good airport. Functional and comfortable.

toronto-city-centre-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-city-centre-airport,Toronto City Centre Airport customer review,L Morrow,Canada,2014-01-09,Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (YTZ) is located on an island near downtown Toronto. They service over 18 cities in Canada and the U.S. with connections to more than 80 international destinations. Billy Bishop is the hub for Porter Airlines. Unlike most other airports that service commercial airlines Billy Bishop imposes a 23.00 curfew for both take off and landing of traffic. If a flight is on route for landing and cannot land prior to 23.00 the flight will be diverted to another airport. Although this rule is known by the airline flights are not held back but simply fly passengers to the closest city. This happened to my young daughter on Jan 6 2014 during one of the coldest nights of the year. Unfortunately there was no communication to the public that the flight was diverted and my daughter was left without support. Her ride was waiting for her at Billy Bishop airport but with no agent even present we had no way of knowing her location. In this case she made her way via shuttle bus from the airport in Hamilton where the flight had been diverted to a downtown train station in Toronto (2AM) where she found a place to stay the night.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,D Routledge,Canada,2015-06-30,"A logistical nightmare. First we checked in using the awesome virtual checkin machines. This went great. It was quick and easy to do. Then we had to try and find the place to check our bags. Well that was a different story. We asked the lady who was supervising the check in machines and she just sort of pointed in a random direction and said ""over there"". Well over there turned out to be an area a quarter of a mile down the corridor which we found more by accident than because the signage was helpful. When we arrived in this area they were filtering people through by their flight times. The area was way too small to hold the number of people who were coming through. There was a lot of yelling and pushing by the staff. They kept announcing the flight times they were taking and when no one was coming to the front the only person who was filtering people through would wander away to yell the info to the end of the line. 90% of the time no one there was waiting for that time. So the line up just kept getting bigger and bigger. They managed to create a bottleneck that was just ridiculous. We waited in this area for over an hour and 20 minutes before they would let us check our bags and go through to customs. We arrived at the airport as instructed 3 hours before flight time. This should have given us enough time to check in, grab breakfast and relax before boarding. Instead we had to rush just to make our plane. I'm still not sure why they were filtering people through this remote area. When we finally got let through we had to walk back to basically where we started, another quarter mile. For anyone with mobility issues this would be cruel. When we got to the next area there was nobody there but there were about 500 hundred of us that got let through at the same time because almost everyone in the holding area was waiting for an 8:45 flight. So again we had a bottleneck that took forever to get through. When we finally finished we barely made the boarding of our flight. We were unable to grab food.

One was all the good things about airport terminal design and the second was all the bad things. Unfortunately they mixed up the two lists when they drew up the designs. I cannot fathom how such a new terminal built at such great expense can be so inefficient. The worst part is trying to pass through customs after collecting your baggage.

Fortunately I noticed my name on a card being held by representatives from the genuine company I had booked with. For departing flights eat before you set out for the airport. At check-in there is just one very small snack bar and shop (Panini and water just over EUR 4.00) and not a great deal of seating.

Next a check that the passport had been stamped by a guard all hand luggage scanned and downstairs to Baggage Reclaim where the cases came through quickly. Suitcases then scanned and we were in Arrivals. Money Changing was simple no forms to complete! Upon return for International Travel there is a Cafe and small Duty Free Shop and Gift Shop beyond Passport and Secuirty before the Departure Gates that only takes Hard Currency.

Horribly lacking in facilities (such as currency exchange booth on departure side – surely a necessity given you can't take rupees out of India). Mercifully the airport was quiet – I would hate to think what it would be like at busier times. Had to unnecessarily wait to have my luggage screened (‘too early’ even though it was in the allotted 3 hours prior to flight window) must have had my boarding pass checked 8 times no doubt by the official the officials boss and indeed their boss.

You can catch a local bus from town for 25kr unless it is a Sunday morning - then you can get the Flybussen for 55kr. Before security there is not much of interest - a few shops the 7-11 has similar price and range to stores in town. After security there is a Narvesen with almost identical food and prices to the 7-11 downstairs. There are also several other food outlets which are all very expensive. Toilets are clean enough but as far as I could tell there are only about 6 individual toilets so there can be a queue. When I visited in 2007 there were internet terminals costing 2kr per minute which I think it the most expensive I have ever seen; on my last visit in November 2008 these terminals were gone replaced by WiFi with a minimum charge of 59kr.

I understand that there aren't many flights departing at night but still. Also they had problems with bridge retracting that caused a 90 minute delay in departure (Chine Airlines to TPE).

vancouver-airport,/airport-reviews/vancouver-airport,Vancouver Airport customer review,Serge Grynkewich,Philippines,2012-09-10,My review focuses on two matters: Transit passenger handling at immigration and Staff knowledge of the airport and its facilities. I arrived in Vancouver at around 9pm to transit for a transpacific flight at around 2.45am the following morning. On the Air Canada flight I advised the steward that I was transiting and he advised me that I did not need to complete a customs and immigration form. On arrival the transit lane was closed and I was advised to proceed through the normal channel and to advise the immigration officer that I was transiting. I did so. The immigration officer (courteously) advised that I did need to complete the paperwork which I did. When I was called back to immigration it was by another officer who when I told her I was in transit gave me a pink card and told me the paperwork was not necessary. Someone in immigration is confused as am I. After all was done at immigration I proceeded to the lady who had directed me to immigration in the first place. She advised me to proceed up to the next level. When I asked her for the location of the Cathay Pacific business class lounge she advised me that it was upstairs but that I should proceed to gate 64. To make a long story short no one was at gate 64 as the flight was still 5 hours away. I asked several people including a janitor a Customs and Border Officer and a shop attendant where the lounge was. Only the shop attendant could direct me correctly. Amazingly the Customs and Border Officer - though very courteous - laughed as he told me that he was responsible for security but had never been there. Vancouver has a beautiful airport - as do most Canadian cities. However Canadian authorities should see to the education of those working in their airports.

vancouver-airport,/airport-reviews/vancouver-airport,Vancouver Airport customer review,M Doyle,Canada,2010-08-26,At first I was impressed to find the new Immigration kiosk system for Canadian residents. Just a few minutes and I was off to pick up my baggage. However after getting the bags as a passenger with a connecting flight to another Canadian city I experienced the most bizarre line-up to clear customs. In all my years of landing in Vancouver and connecting to another Canadian city I have never experienced such a horribly long line. In the past we walked out and deposited our checked bags fairly quickly. After which I assume they were security screened in the same manner that any baggage is. So why are we suddenly required to line up and wait while each passenger's bag is slowly screened? The more bizarre twist is that those people who are exiting the airport are expeditiously moved through customs and sent out into the country. Why are connecting passengers treated so differently? If for example a passenger brought an illegal item in their baggage they are able to exit and be let loose in Canada but if connecting to another city all their bags are searched and must be scanned in their presence? Why must a connecting passenger be present for screening when someone who checks in upstairs can simply drop off their bags? Simply because of this bottleneck due to an extremely illogical and inefficient system I will be trying to avoid this otherwise fine airport in the future. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I need is a pointless 2 hour wait in line to have my baggage screened!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

With reasonable space available to browse a number of outlets it soon became clear that the area was becoming very crowded and it appeared evident that passengers were having to queue for passport inspection in lines so long that they extended out to the retail area. Then followed a long wait with several anxious passengers worried about missing their departing flights. Once through passport control we were directed to Gates 21-26 where passengers were sat on the floor or left to stand because of overcrowding and lack of space. In order to try to clear space at Gate 21, passengers were boarded, in no particular order and by one member of staff checking boarding passes manually, onto a waiting bus to be taken to the aircraft. In very hot conditions and with no aircon, we were left for over 15 mins on the bus. Then after a slow drive to the plane the driver got out and again left the passengers on the hot bus before getting clearance to board.

The upstairs café is quite pleasant but not somewhere to visit in a hurry. Easyjet must hate this place as all the 'services' they need are done so badly. All the passengers were ready and waiting to board but everything is done at snail's pace. The security checks re-organised last year are worse than ever even at a quiet mid-March time.

Baggage drop was slow security utterly inefficient with staff making things worse by trying (unsuccessfully) to manage queues. The new security gates have caused chaos. We were in plenty of time there weren't many people passing through security but it took 20 mins. The upstairs cafe operates at snails pace with odd queue arrangements and poor display of pricing. Not surprisingly with such poor service customers choose not to clear their trays as requested. Our EasyJet flight was delayed because the baggage handlers couldn't get the luggage on in time to meet the departure slot. Why? The passengers were all at the gate in good time there was no sign of anyone arriving at the last minute and not much luggage actually going to the hold.

venice-marco-polo-airport,/airport-reviews/venice-marco-polo-airport,Venice Marco Polo Airport customer review,Leonardo Pavan,Italy,2014-01-29,This is a small but busy airport. The covered parking lot is very expensive so you might want to consider the uncovered ones. Check-in is all done by the SAVE personnel (it's the managing company of the airport) not the airlines so they tend to be rather strict with the weight allowances. In many cases I have experienced long lines at check-in and I believe that the check-in area is rather small and can get congested very quickly. Security has improved a lot recently (they have re-designed the check points) and it has become a lot faster. The shopping area is well presented and with a fairly wide choice of boutiques considering the size of the airport. Perhaps it is lacking of chairs. The upper floor also features a smoking room which perhaps is not kept super tidy. The Marco Polo Lounge is OK but not the best of the lounges: access is the same as every other lounge (scanning of the boarding pass) the food offerings are not particularly thrilling (most of the time some cold pizzas some stale sandwiches and some broken up cookies) beverages selection is rather wide instead and it is self service; there is complimentary wifi in the lounge even though the signage indicates that you have to pay; the upkeep of the lounge is OK.

Luggage arrived quickly and passed through the airport with ease. Departing from the same airport was altogether different. Baggage drop queues exceeded 90 minutes due mainly to the fact that there were 2 sometimes 3 ladies checking in everyone. The same ladies continually left their posts to search for passengers as they appear to be without a PA system. No Air con no queue management no order! My colleague expected to pay for his excess luggage as he had 4kg excess. he didnt get charged or even queried whilst a guy beside me travelled with his large family who's cases fluctuated by .5 kilo over / under. He was subjected to unpacking / repacking several cases to get them dot on. Ridiculous unhelpful and time wasting Security fluctauted greatly from passenger to passenger with some walking through with hand luggage unscanned whilst others where nearly strip searched! Info screens show little or no information and announcements landisde are non existent whilst they were ok airside. Airside had one duty free shop one little kiosk type shop and a bar all of which closed quite early. Once called to the boarding gate all hell broke loose as there is literally no room to stand whilst queuing to board. We went down an escalator to the gate only to land on other passengers as there wasn't the room to get off safely! The place was crammed packed full and very hot.

venice-treviso-airport,/airport-reviews/venice-treviso-airport,Venice Treviso Airport customer review,R Hopkins,NA,2008-08-01,The airport is modern with a large check-in area. The bus transfer to Venice is straightforward. Buy tickets at ground floor level to the right of arrivals. The restaurant is busy hot and noisy but good value with freshly cooked pizza and pasta available. Security was somewhat slow (20 mins.) and ignored an obvious queue jumper who appeared from nowhere dived under the queue barrier then presented himself ahead of others who had been waiting. This really should have been noticed as a security concern not just the queue jumping. The security screening seemed over-sensitive which slowed things down. There are few facilities once through security so it’s a bit of a gamble to leave it as late as possible. Leave going down to the gate until the flight is in. The gate area is inadequate particularly given that passengers were allowed through when a delay was expected.

verona-airport,/airport-reviews/verona-airport,Verona Airport customer review,David Allen,NA,2008-06-26,Apart from the marked overcrowding in the check-in and departure areas noted by other reviewers Verona airport is also noted for very slow delivery of luggage from incoming planes to the baggage reclaim areas. On a very recent trip they also failed miserably to get all the luggage onto our outgoing flight in time for its scheduled departure. In consequence we lost the departure slot and were delayed for a further hour and a quarter all cooped up on the plane before the flight was re- routed and able to get away. The return trip check-in contributed to this because only two desks were initially available for the passengers on our A300 and the queues extended outside the terminal building. This experience has certainly put us off flying via Verona again.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I wasn't overly happy with the airport before its extension but at least it had a ""soul"". When the airport management announced 10 years ago that a new terminal and a new concourse would finally be built I was really ""thrilled"" because it meant that Vienna Airport would catch up with other hubs worldwide. I hoped that all the knowledge about airport design would be taken into consideration leading to a state of the art aviation facility. The result is a mess! The architectural design (black and white) makes it a very dull place. You need to go one level down to reach the restrooms hard for people with slightly reduced mobility. The flooring of the concourse couldn't be less beautiful (linoleum) signage is horrible - what do people with impaired vision do? Food has become very expensive. On the positive side security was fast building is very clean. The new train station is very nice it is now very easy to reach the terminal. Unfortunately they do not display local trains (route S7) going to Vienna which are very cheap. I can only conclude that Vienna Airport wants you to take their expensive City Airport Train (CAT) which is useless unless you need to go to Wien-Mitte.

It worked just fine when there were two flights to London and one to Paris every day. Then they built the ""mid-field terminals"". Now there are so many international flights that immigration and customs on arrival can take hours and here's a real kicker-there are two separate immigration and customs areas. If you are ending your journey at Washington you go to the main terminal if you are making a connection you stay in the mid-field arrival terminal. If the guy sorting luggage at your origin put your bags in the wrong container you could wait for hours for your bag to show up at the correct customs terminal.

On return it is totally a different story: the inefficient mobile lounges are still being used passport control was slow (and this was just with one international flight) and your luggage is still being taken off the carousel which makes you first search the carousel and then the floor. The lame explanation I got from the porter was ""the carousel has to be cleaned for the next flight"" but there was no next flight. Dulles is the only airport I have been too which does this. Even arriving at JFK Terminal Four is more efficient than this.",NA,NA,NA,7,3,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,J Lloyd,Singapore,2012-08-07,The layout of the airport is absurd and it takes forever to get anywhere. Immigration is not clearly marked and the service of border officials isn't terribly good. Food options are ok but the airport is very uncomfortable for any long layover/delay. The location of the airport is pretty inconvenient and car transfers are like to be caught up in the beltway traffic. When flying to the DC area I usually just fly to Phi Int Airport or BWI.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,G Meyer,United States,2012-02-06,One of my least favourite airports. This airport has expanded haphazardly over the course of several decades and is poorly designed and laid out. Amazingly the new Aerotrain which shuttles you from the main terminal building to the satellite terminals is no faster than the painfully slow so-called mobile lounges that used to be the sole means of transport between terminals. I always have to allow 45 minutes or more to travel from the drop-off/check-in area to the gate. Several times when arriving on a late night flight I've had to wait 20 minutes or more for the next Aerotrain. Security lines are the longest I've seen primarily because half the security lanes are normally closed similar situation with customs - never enough personnel to man the available counters and as a result lines are commonly 45 minute or more. While Dulles suffers from some irreparable design flaws it would be much better if airport management would simply ensure that they make better use of the facilities they do have - by having more customs and security personnel on hand and by running the Aerotrain at reasonable intervals at all hours to speed transit through the airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

The signage is plentiful the train system is quick and comes often and generally the place is clean. Check-in is no hassle. In short the place is navigable and gets the job done. However a lot of stairs must be climbed to get anywhere from any of the terminals making a trip even to the baggage claim very annoying.

However it is a rare pleasure to be able to park mere yards from the terminal! Mind you at 8Euro a day it is far from cheap. Yet the automated pay machines do not accept 50Euro notes or Laser debit cards. Staff are very friendly and the small size of the building is makes a pleasant change from most other airports. At present catering is limited to drinks and snacks. Beware of one outrageous thing: each passenger is required to pay a fee of 5Euro at check-in to fund the future development of the airport. Nowhere during the booking process is this mentioned. Furthermore when other busineses plan expansions there is no requirement for current customers to pay upfront.

There a lots of porters who wear flourescent jerseys to assist travellers with transferring baggage to taxis etc which they do for a couple of dollars - quite reasonable. Don't be put off by it some also speak english. IF you want to make a call these porters have mobiles so you can make local calls for a dollar a minute. The information desk don't let you use their phone. The return trip was very good as well. You will be asked to open your bags if they contain jewellery. You have to show your customs slip from when you arrived or your government registered shop reciept which says you have paid the taxes. Immigration is easy you then have to pass through the gate.

On the way in those passengers in the know bunched up at the door of the aircraft and ran for the entrance hall. Those (like me) who hadn't a clue about what was coming walked normally and were confronted with chaos. I know the Russians are paranoid about security but this was ridiculous took over 3 hours to clear a 737 load; fortunately we were the only aircraft on the ground at the time. The fire truck took about 5 minutes just to start lucky (there were no fires). The baggage hall was interesting all baggage arrived on a tip-truck which backed up to a slide (and you guessed it) up-ended the tray and baggage into the room (no carousel). Customs Hall is something else one over eager passenger put his head around the door before he was called; flashing lights and sirens erupted. You didn't need to speak Russian to get the gist of what he was told. Fortunately I had a Company courier waiting for me outside with a name board. On the way out similar system. this time however the flight was delayed due to heavy snow. No information given by staff no flight info boards all passengers JUST WAITED. In my case it was about 8 hours; this must be a fairly common occurrence in January as the same courier was with me and refused to leave until the aircaft was actually on the ground (most impressed).

The price tags of items at Zurich Airport Duty Free Shop are marked below the actual price you will pay at the cashier. I wonder if anyone regulates those shops since a lot of people end up paying surprisingly more (up to 40% ) than the advertised price. Next time you are there making a purchase pay attention to the price you are charged and you will see. If one complains about it the employee just shows you a sign stating that only the CHF prices are valid. Like I am supposed to read every little disclaimer when doing some quick shopping before boarding my flight? So why post the prices also in Euro and Pounds then?

Terminal A (the larger and newer of the 2 terminals) has been remodeled to add more windows and light and the dark filthy carpeting has been replaced. They still haven't bothered to install moving walkways despite the very long distances between the terminal entrance/exit and the farthest gates however and the narrow corridors and lack of floor space cause major crowding problems during peak times. Food and beverage options are very basic with overpriced and bad food. Terminal B is set for a major renovation. They will finally add jetways and build a new facility that brings it into the 21st Century.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,S Dissanayeke,United Kingdom,2014-09-01,Never have I been to an airport where there is such a lack of common human decency. I was travelling with a group that included my mother who had a large leg ulcer my heavily pregnant sister and a 22 month old toddler. Security was like being led into a cattle pen with no divisions for crowd control until half way through. Reaching the scanners took around half an hour. Once we made it to the scanners my mother sister baby and brother in law were all 'randomly' picked for frisking delaying us even further. A 20 minute walk to the boarding gate was difficult for both my mother and sister and despite asking for help for my mother three times it was refused as we hadn't booked assistance 24 hours early and were helpfully told that we would miss the flight! Which we did! Then we were told to return to security so another long walk back except this was not where we had to go! My exhausted heavily pregnant sister then tried to buy some water before we continued wandering round the airport trying to find the right place to be but the cashier refused to sell it because she had accidentally brought the wrong boarding pass into the shop! A kind woman behind her in the queue took pity and bought it for her. A security officer about to go on his tea break then sees my mother and realising that she is in distress and helped us by leading us to the right place to reclaim our baggage. Here was the only decent person we met working at this airport. We picked up our baggage and then went to Ryanair customer services where my mother and sister found some seats to sit down and rest. We had been at the airport since 5.00 and it was now 8.00 so they had been on their feet for three hours. However they were then approached by a member of staff and told that they couldn't sit in those seats as they were for people needing special assistance! Several seats were empty so they hadn't been preventing others from having a seat. At this point no one wanted to fly from this dreadful airport and we booked Eurostar tickets and left. Just leaving the environment to Stansted improved everyone's mood. What a horrible nasty place to be.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

You are basically waiting for a prior international departure to clear the next holding room. Once the prior international flight has departed you then proceed through immigration and security.

My wife and I recently flew from the airport at Saturday lunchtime a very busy period in summer. We paid £29.99 for 8 day's parking in the long stay admittedly a promotional offer but open to anyone. We were through security in 3 or 4 mins (about six or seven security stations open) and found strolling to the far end of the western walkway no problem at all and we are both in our late sixties. Before that we enjoyed an inexpensive lunch and wine (admittedly again on promotional offers open to anyone) at one of the eateries. We returned a week later on a Saturday at teatime and were one of six international flights 150-seat plus sized aircraft to have landed in a twenty minute period. Everyone to whom we spoke was polite which is our usual experience at Bristol (with the very occasional exception down the years) perhaps because we are always polite to them and try to co-operate with all requests. We were driving out of the car park within thirty minutes of our landing wheels touching the runway.

tontouta-airport,/airport-reviews/tontouta-airport,Tontouta Airport customer review,Matthew Bohun,NA,2004-08-09,"Tontouta is a fairly basic international airport. There are no skybridges so on arrival you will descend the stairs and cross the tarmac to the single terminal and vice versa on departure. Customs and immigration are fairly straightforward although a little bit of French will help. The airport is a long way from Noumea so it is best to arrange a transfer with your hotel this will cost XPF2500 (EUR 21.57) payable to the driver in cash. I did not see any ATMs in the arrivals area so it would be as well to buy some francs before you arrive. New Caledonia Tourism also has links to a number of transport companies that provide airport transfers. The airport is a smoking zone and many passengers take advantage of this. When you depart your hotel should recommend you leave for the airport three hours before your scheduled flight. Again it will be a XPF 2500 (cash) bus fare to the airport. There is no additional departure tax as it will have been collected by the airline when they ticketed your flight. At the airport you will need to fill in the departure card before you approach the customs area and there are no pens anywhere. Customs and security are uneventful. Just through security you can turn to the left and go up the stairs to the two airline lounges - Air Calin and Air France. Air Calin's Hibiscus Lounge is very small and basic whilst the Air France's Salon looks much larger and has nice tub style leather chairs. I was flying Qantas and they use the Air Calin lounge. There is one duty free store airside on the left after the stairs to the lounges. There is really only one gate area although there are a number of ""gates"" - doors to the tarmac. At the far end of the departure area you go up the stairs to the public bar and cafe. The boarding procedure is very relaxed and does not take that long.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport is getting much busier and it can only be hoped that the internal changes make a positive difference. Our big gripe is that gate numbers are now given only 30 minutes or so before the flight departs - there can be no reason other than airport management trying to keep people in the departure lounge to encourage them to spend more money. Stop it! It certainly has the opposite effect on us and suspect it does on others too. This also serves to make the departure lounge very crowded noisy and hot (small wonder tempers are frayed).

Had we been 10 minutes later we would have got stuck at this stage ourselves. Unfortunately we weren't so lucky on our return last night! We were dismayed to reach the passport control hall to find a very long queue of people and only three officials dealing with those with EU passports. Thanks to the lack of officials and chaotic organisation which allowed for significant queue jumping it took 40 minutes for us to get through passport control.

kansas-city-airport,/airport-reviews/kansas-city-airport,Kansas City Airport customer review,David Johnson,NA,2004-11-23,Kansas City International is an example of an airport that has the passenger in mind. This airport is the easiest to navigate out of any major airport in the country. With the recent renovations now done passengers will be greeted to a more friendly atmosphere and amenities that we have come to expect. The airport has virtually no wait times at security checkpoints and the drive to the gate feature is still truly remarkable. You can be dropped at the curb and be about 30 feet from your gate area. This is something that other airports fail to do. The biggest downside (to many) is the lack of amenities beyond security checkpoints. In most gate holding areas there are no restaurants gift shops and restrooms. To use any of these you must exit the sterile area and go through security once again after visiting them. This makes most passengers connecting at this airport angry. However the city has announced that restrooms will be built in the gate holding areas apparently this is the biggest complaint they have seen in recent years. To tell the truth I prefer the gift shops and restaurants outside the sterile area. Those living in KC have come to expect the lowest airfares in the nation. To have these inside the gate areas would create the opportunity for a airline to create a hub here and drive prices northward. This is why this airport is truly remarkable. It continues to attempt to discourage hubs and drive prices down with low-fare airlines offerings.

keflavik-airport,/airport-reviews/keflavik-airport,Keflavik Airport customer review,L D Cross,Canada,2015-05-11,We approached Keflavik International Airport as we landed Icelandair cabin crew announced for the first and only time that all arriving passengers must go through security screening before immigration and checked baggage pickup. We had all gone through airport security before boarding this overnight flight in Toronto but no matter. Do it again before entering the country. No liquids allowed. None of the other prohibited things either. So we exited the aircraft stomped down two flights of metal stairs and lined up in a cold hallway for 25 minutes slowly moving forward before even getting to the back-and-forth cattle pens in front of the scanners for another 20 minutes. Our flight crew walked past smiling at us. Carry-on bags and all other personal items into the bins and thru the x-ray scanner then walk through the metal detector to meet the guy with the hand wand device you know the routine. But why? We were not connecting we were staying in-country. When I asked why this incoming security the first response was 'I don't know. We are told to do it.' I have landed in London Paris Lisbon Madrid Frankfurt and Rome and never been subjected to this type of incoming security. The screening of incoming passengers convinced me this would be the first last and only time I ever visit Iceland. I attended my conference and left with the normal exit security. Our Icelandair flight boarded from Gate 25 which contained three (3) seats and a pale strip-wood floor on which most people sat. Keflavik touts itself as the best airport in Europe. Best at what is not stated certainly not hospitality to arriving visitors. However not only is there duty free shopping at the departure area of the terminal but also at arrivals - probably so you can restock what you had to throw out at incoming security.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Departures however are dreadful. For sure do not arrive more than 2-3 hours before your flight because there is simply no place to sit in the check-in area and no place to eat or relax. Check In will typically open 3 hours before your departure time. Immigration and Security are reasonably efficient but the Departures Area is cold and noisy with uncomfortable seating very poor eating and drinking places poor Duty Free in selection and price and not a single Flight Info Screen in the Departures Hall.

Honestly, my 7-hour layover in the airport led me to think that Schiphol is not the airport as it may have been a decade ago. Holland Boulevard is under renovation (and doesn't look nice anymore), so are the museum and the library, extremely overcrowded at McDonald's and at a Starbucks, and there is no place other than at the gates where one can sit and recharge electronics (outlets are extremely limited and some don't even work), internet access is okay but slow and needs renewal every hour. Finally, the lounges are pretty much overcrowded. Schiphol looks like it had better days in the early 2000s and the early 90s. Probably my most memorable experience there was the voice ""mind your step"" at the end of every walkway. Unfortunately, this place is like falling apart for when Amsterdam had rain, parts of the airport ceiling were dripping water, this aging airport needs more than what the current renovation project is working on. And as always, too much traffic (travellers are from all parts of the world), since this airport is a major European hub, yet I doubt that the airport can tolerate this much. If you want a quick layover, this airport might do good (ditch the restaurants unless you have a lot of patience) unless you haven't seen the airport before, but a long one is not worth it at all.",Transit,26-07-2015,Solo Leisure,5,1,3,3,NA,4,4,3,NA,0

As I was checking in with SQ business class I thought that arriving 2 hrs before the flight would be more than sufficient time - but I needed nearly all of that time to get through the queues for departure. Long queues at the entry doors to the terminal for documentation checks with no concept of ""queuing"" for many people. An even longer queue for the security/carry on baggage x-ray. Disorganised and not able to cope with the volume of departing passengers. Once in the transit/departure area this seemed to have been recently upgraded with reasonable shops and facilities. The only Star Alliance lounge was Lufthansa and again this was too small to cope with the number of passengers.

I'm not sure I agree as I found the airport to be as efficient as on previous occasions – quick immigration clearance despite long queues and on the MTR into town about 30 mins after landing. However the airport seems to be heading the way of British airports and is becoming a shopping centre first and an airport second. The upper level airside used to have lots of comfy seats but these have now been removed to make way for even more ""shopping opportunities” and restaurants – yet there is still plenty of unused space which could be used for seats! It seems that the only way to get a seat without buying something is to head straight for the gates where there is lots of seating (and better views of the runways). My other complaint is that there is still hardly anywhere to buy bottled drinks etc. airside – there are several branches of Relay towards the gates but they have a poor range of products compared to their European stores. Is it really too much to ask to have a few branches of 7-11 or OK at HKG?

The terminal is usually very crowded and can feel cramped and long lines at the check-in desks and customs are common; it is the second busiest airport in Thailand. There is a huge lack of seating around the departure lounge; I have almost never sat down waiting for a flight. Signs are okay apart from some confusing ones; there was one where the sign indicating the location of a single gate had 2 arrows pointing in opposite directions. Staff are quite friendly but all the procedures at the airport are inefficient but at least the security checks at the entrance are nowhere near as long as some I have encountered elsewhere. Dining and shopping options seem decent but again nothing special as with the environment of the airport - rather dim but fairly clean. Phuket Int'l Airport isn't horrible but pretty much average in every respect.

We went to baggage reclaim. Followed the signage to the relevant belt and waited. Eventually cases started to trickle out now about 45 minutes from landing time but not ours. Asked a passing worker how long it should take and were told about half an hour but maybe check for other Spanish origin flights. There weren't any but as our concern and indeed panic rose we began walking the length of the hall checking every belt where eventually we found one case on the belt for a flight from Abuja Nigeria. After nearly an hour we were about to go to baggage enquiries office when the last case appeared on its own again on the Abuja flight belt. You have to ask what kind of system manages to misplace not one but two cases so very far from correct. This terminal appears still not to have fixed its problems.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Our line ran out of bins an agent was heading toward us with a trolley of bins but then stopped to visit with a few colleagues. Then as she approached she told us they were for another line! None for us. Our agent finally slowly walked back to get some for us stopped to visit then stopped half way and went on break. Finally the agent replacing her told us to come forward and reach to get them. Then everyone had the wrong liquids bag and had to transfer into a bag provided by security. We were told to leave hiking boots on they would not set off alarm yes they did so boots back to scanner and I was x-rayed and wanded. Wondering if employees are into a work slow down as this is the worst we have ever experienced at Heathrow but it is never pleasant getting through their security. Also the agents were very rude and caustic in their comments. That said T5 is not nearly as bad but T3 i awful! Also all electronics must be removed from bags and must be our of their covers in T3.

We only use it because we're only 10mins away. They've moved the free pickup and drop off point from adjacent to the terminal to 1/4 mile away down a steep hill so they can now charge for the former one. If you want to get through security in less than half an hour you have to pay extra for that too. They've taken out seats in the departure area to turn the space into a shopping mall so you have to stand waiting for your flight to be called. You then have to walk up to 1/4 mile to a gate with no escaltors/travelators and then stand for around 20mins in an area where there are 20 seats for aircraft carrying upwards of 150 passengers.

Ground staff did take some time to check us in but were friendly and immigration was fast and efficient. However the main problem with this airport are the facilities and cleanliness. There are no major international food stalls such as Mcdonalds KFC etc. There is only one small food stall area which offers a limited menu.

maputo-airport,/airport-reviews/maputo-airport,Maputo Airport customer review,J Antenucci,Australia,2009-10-08,"A pretty basic airport but seems to function fine. At customs people needing visas need to line up in the ""visas"" line - if you line up anywhere else you'll just be told to go to the visa line. It's a bit confusing as the booth is slightly behind the others. Visas are US$25 cash there are no change facilities so be prepared. They take your money and passport and then walk over to an office near the baggage claim where the visas are processed. Everyone has to stand around and wait in front of the office until an immigration official walks out with a stack of passports and starts calling out names at which point they will give you back your passport with the visa inside. In the meantime you can collect your bags the carousel is literally 2 metres away. Plenty of taxis right out the front you can't miss them. Barclays ATM also just outside so easy to get local currency. Outbound the check-in is pretty straightforward though I would suggest getting there a bit early as it looks like it would get mad in a rush.

The arrivals area and baggage claim is a dump but the ticketing/check-in area and the departures area isn't bad. There's not much in the way of shopping or restaurants if you have time to kill and the seating areas are rather limited. The Qantas lounge is pretty decent and best of all it's a very short walk (just a couple of hundred feet) from the baggage claim to the taxi stand and about the same from the passenger drop-off area to the terminal entrance on arrival - though this makes the A$4 baggage cart rental fee a big rip-off.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,Miranda Walker,NA,2008-03-10,With regard to domestic terminal congestion - WAC (airport administrator) is aware of the problems and work has been continuing over the last year or so to improve things- this has included extra aircraft bays at the domestic terminal 2 (Virgin Skywest) and a new parking area to the north end which frees up taxiways etc during peak times. The problem with Perth was the 20-year plan did not anticipate the phenomenal increase in flights hence the congestion at peak times (5-8am & 3-7pm) I agree it's taken far too long to address the problems- a multi-storey car park seems the ideal solution - however it seems the airport is more interested in building commercial buildings. Have read reports of a planned spur line from Bayswater station on the Midland train line to the airport to (finally) link the airport to the rail network. If driving to the international airport during peak times avoid intersection of Leach Hwy & Roe Hwy - if coming from south on Roe better to go Abernethy Rd take a left at Grogan road- this takes you through the warehouse/back areas and eventually joins up with Horrie Miller Drive.

Airport looks old and is not very nice to be in. Luggage took a long time but after that was out quickly and got a taxi. Return arrived at a crowded terminal but the Swiss check-in desk was empty. Could use fast track security but even that was so slow and tedious. Ground staff unorganised when it comes to handling boarding as everybody was boarded at the same time together with three passengers in wheel chairs.

Taking off and landing offers spectacular views of Washington since the airport is located very near downtown d.c. There is even a metro station directly at the airport so there is no need for a taxi if you don't want to spend $20 for a ride. The one setback is that DCA is served only by regional U.S. carriers and Air Canada. If you travel long haul to D.C and have to switch planes try to switch to a flight into DCA - it is way better than flying to dull Dulles International Airport (IAD) about a one hour drive out of town.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport was undergoing considerable refurbishment and building work when I was there (March 2011) so there was lots of dust and scaffolding in the terminal.

What a disgrace of an airport to a country such as China. Terminal 3 is a modern building but transiting here is a nightmare at the best of times. Immigration staff stamp transit passengers' passports even if they're not entering China yet when I got off my flight from LHR a large Boeing 777-300ER at least another large aircraft arrived at the same time containing many transit passengers. Despite there being at least 400 passengers only TWO immigration counters were open. Luckily I didn't have a 1 hour connection time and wasn't one of the last passengers. Worse still there was no queue guidance systems such as 'snake' lines that have rapidly improved the situation at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. On top of that facilities aren't great and sign-posting for facilities like money changers are poor at the best of times. Also on my flight from SIN to LHR via PEK I had a 6 hour transit so I paid for lounge access but on the whole it was a waste of money with no western food save for tasteless sandwiches and biscuits. To sum up China's government really needs to improve this airport and make it more foreigner friendly if it is to improve its image.

The airport does not have wheelchair facilities when you enter the airport you have to get in first through all the checks inform the counter and then bring somebody outside with the wheelchair. All this while my MIL had to wait without assistance. We were asked to wait in line even though she was in a wheelchair. Thirdly I was charged for the wheelchair facility! I was informed that the aircraft would land remotely and we would have to climb stairs to which I said my mother in law could not climb stairs! Told we needed an ambu-lift which at other airports I have been given access to. Here in Mumbai I was informed I will be charged for this. My argument and discussion fell on deaf ears as employees showed no concern nor compassion towards anybody. I agreed I would make her climb the stairs but we needed at least 15 mins. It took more than an hour to clear immigration. Once we cleared immigration the wheelchair attendant vanished and never appeared again. I had to take her to the boarding gate myself!

sofia-airport,/airport-reviews/sofia-airport,Sofia Airport customer review,Ivan Ilieff,NA,2006-10-26,Being a Bulgarian native I fly into and out of SOF on a regular basis. The old building cannot possibly handle the increasing passenger traffic and the launch of the new shiny terminal is being posponed since November of 2005 until present day. SOF has the unfriendliest check-in staff in Europe and the United States (New York excluded). Make sure you check the weight of your luggage carefuly before leaving for the airport and distribute the luggage evenly in your bags. I was made to remove stuff out of my 55-pound suitcase and put it in my 35 pound one at the check-in desk in front of the entire line or else threatened with an excess luggage charge. Early mornings turn SOF's departure hall into a zoo since a few carriers (LH OS AZ BA) have flights departing between 6 and 8AM carrying primarily connecting passengers for long-haul flights out of the major hubs in Europe. The airlines usually send their planes to arrive in Sofia late on the previous evening so that they can depart early in the morning. On several occasions however due to technical problems at SOF (the explanation given when that actually happened to me was that the lighting system on the runway was out of commission) said planes never make it to SOF in the first place. So it is a good idea to check with your airline the night before your departure to ensure your plane had safely landed. Bar on the second floor (departure hall) is way too overpriced - they charge EUR3.50 for a beer with an average price in the city for the same brand of about EUR1. Security and passport control are usually smooth and once on the airside a visit to the duty free shop is a must since it still offers the lowest prices of tobacco and liquor in the world (A carton of Marlboros costs EUR 15.00!!!) Transfer to the planes is by bus and the boarding procedure is nonexistent since everyone is trying to cram on the plane at the same time. Bulgarians are very skilled in running and pushing people around so even if you are the last one to board the bus that is the first one to get off the bus and climb the stair onto the plane there is no guarantee that you won't be overrun by the crowd.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,A Lane,United States,2012-12-08,Most recent experience at T3 (MAN-LHR) was alright except for the security procedures of 'randomly' selecting passengers for a body scan and a shoe inspection. There are two separate lines that are separated by a glass wall. The first line one surrenders one's items (hand luggage jackets computers etc.) as usual for the x-ray scan. Then if one is unlucky one is instructed to step to the side to another line with a turnstile that turns green when it's okay to proceed to the body scan. Very slow official will then have you surrender your shoes to be x-rayed! And worse as in my experience there are 3 other officials to check one passenger. All the while the queue is growing and growing with other 'randomly' selected passengers. Worse is that one can see while waiting in that long queue through the glass wall in the first line that one's hand luggage and other items have already been scanned and are just waiting in the tray idling. If they are going to search people make sure that they have not 4 officials to do so but one and to speed it up. Otherwise T3 is a bit strange as once all of the craziness of the security checks are over one walks down a very long corridor to meet up with the departures lounge that doubles as shopping/eating areas. I just cannot understand UK security practices these days. I had hoped that Manchester would have been better than Heathrow. In general UK security checks make Paris CDG seem like a paradise as CDG used to years ago have similar security checks but have since stopped the unnecessary busy work sort of ridiculous harassing 'checks'.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
southampton-airport,/airport-reviews/southampton-airport,Southampton Airport customer review,David Blowers,NA,2009-04-08,"Southampton airport is fine but about 50% too small for purpose - the number of flights coming here now mean that a terminal extension (or even a new terminal) is essential.

Security can also be very busy and a real pain at peak times but the duty free is of good quality. My major gripe however is with the pick up/drop off. You can only drop off at the front of the terminal. On my last arrival a very rude employee (of Meteor Carparks) told me to ""move"" as the area was for drop offs only. His manner was close to being verbally abusive. When I pointed out to him that I could not contact the driver regarding this he told me the driver would get a fine.

bogota-airport,/airport-reviews/bogota-airport,Bogota Airport customer review,Harold Bush,NA,2008-04-11,I travelled to Bogotá from Miami (AA) and Madrid (IB). The airport has improved enormously and is being extended. Immigration is still slow on arrival but it is better. Nice that the officers now smile and welcome visitors to the country. On departure allow an extra 30 minutes if travelling in the early mornings or mid-afternoons. To avoid queuing on the day of travel to get exemption from paying the extra tax get the stamp on arrival at the desk located next to the toilet in the baggage hall (sadly very rarely there is someone there; very strange; even at 2-7 pm when most flights arrive from Europe and the Americas). You cannot take baggage trolleys outside the terminal but there are plenty of porters to help. Apparently this is a way to help them. No problem with that except that they are always in a hurry and will leave you for another customer if your baggage do not arrive quickly.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

As many of us book months in advance there is no excuse for not manning correctly to cope with demand. Jet2 check in was dreadful with multiple flights checking in. 50 minutes is not acceptable and supervisors were not even directing passengers.

Got through Philippine travel tax bag drop (checked in online via 5J) terminal fee (I don't mind paying this if the facility as good as T3) customs and immigration in less than 15 minutes! Shopping and eating choices inside is limited but I didn't expect to get airside that fast so I think it contributed to the sense of lack of activity airside. I allotted 45-60 minutes for landside activity and found myself airside so fast I didn't know how to bide the time. Ended up eating lunch at one of the restaurants.

yangon-airport,/airport-reviews/yangon-airport,Yangon Airport customer review,Bryan Chao,NA,2003-10-09,RGN is a small compact airport but it is not necessarily simple process to arrive. After having bus-hauled to the terminal from the plane immigration counters were the first to encounter. Most tourists had their visa (a colorful one which occupies entire page) stamped before arrival. Next proceeded to FEC (Foreign Exchange Certificate) exchange counter. Tourists are required to exchange $200 cash with FEC (value equivalent to US$). There were some chaos at the line. Some airport staffs escorted some passengers and cut straight to the counter and exchanged for the escorted then they could proceed to the baggage claim before non-escorted. Count your FEC before leaving the counter. I was given in $10 FEC coupons and 1 coupon short! By the time you get to the baggage claim mine was already on the floor. The claim hall was very airy with very high ceiling big contrast to the passport control area which was very cramped. Baggage carts were not well kept. Many of them did not go to there direction where you wanted to. Passed the customs with minimum questions and the customs officers checked my passport again! (?) The chaos began when you stepped out of the building. Porters tried to grab my baggage even there was someone picking me up. 3 porters helped me for my one luggage! They just tried to make some living. It was very unusual confusing chaotic and animating. Leaving was the same chaotic process. It seems there were more guests than travelers. Paid $10 airport fee before check-in. A local lady cut in the line as I was handing my $10 bill and the staff took care of line cutting lady first not very organized. It seemed the line-cutting was way of life at the airport. Waiting lounge was dated and had only hard plastic seating. Air conditioner was noisy and seemed it would break down in any minutes. Toilets were old some with broken toilet seats. A couple of TV sets running local program inaudibly. Restaurant was very unattractive. There was nothing to make waiting time go fast.

We were traveling back from Liberia Costa Rica and while the United Airlines staff on the plane was clear with instructions as to where to go wen we reached our gate once we got to immigration the problems were apparent. We were in line first for passport scanners for around 40 minutes then another wait for what looked to be 4 agents checking passports for hundreds of travelers in just the US citizens line. Then we headed in to get luggage and were in another completely disorganized winding line that blocked access to baggage. We got to our baggage and realized that the line we saw was only about one tenth of the actual line that wound back and forth with only the honest of other travelers to keep order. We saw airport agents whom we called out to to maintain order and they ignored people while they texted on their phones. With people trying to cut into lines that people had stood in for 1.5 hrs already missing connections there were near riot situations. We called out for security and finally airport police came and somewhat restored order while airport agents opened another line behind those of us who had been in line for hours missing flights and expedited them through not even checking passports. We missed our connections and there were no more flights for the rest of the night for us to get out. We got a room at our expense and will get out now 24 hours later.

The BA First Check-in is round the corner when you arrive -not the most obvious but at least a BA person walked you through the large queue at Security so you got straight through.

Free charging service is provided by a hub and are frequent around the airport but in demand and people are watching movies while charging etc so have a wander and find one that isn't too busy there are about 8 points to use at each charging station. If you are departing again for international flights the gate A01-A06 are downstairs it's a bit cramped shabby and dark down there worth not piling down until the last minute. Especially if you are anti-smoking as these gates are exposed to the smell of people coming and going to the smoking area located down there too. There is an improved drinking water supply now that provides hot warm and cold water free and fairly easy to access. I bought a plastic thermos with me on the flight and some sachets of cappuccino and hot chocolate which circumvented having to buy a drink at the restaurants or vending machines. With such expanses of glass it can get very cold so I borrowedâa blanket from the first flight and had that with me during transit. I've not seen any rats and I've been here all night. The 3 different loos I have used (to give a fair review) were all clean with standard maintenance. These are not like the new public toilets at London Gatwick. Many cubicles were in fault but the paper towels driers were all functioning and the surfaces were being cleaned frequently and well. The staff in the Duty Free were just about courteous though not helpful. Wanted to charge me for a plastic bag standard in high street shops but in international duty free this seems both inconvenient and rude. The cleaning staff and information team are polite not engaging in English but offering a nod smile or animated directions where they could.

It is one of the few airports offering the opportunity to do tax free shopping on arrival. Both arriving and leaving was a breeze (as we were still within Schengen area). Staff friendly and competent and in arrivals a lot of useful information material on Iceland and Reykjavik is available. When leaving we spent some time in a very pleasant atrium-like space where all shops and eateries are concentrated. I must say that with the devaluation of the kronur price levels were friendly for visitors from euro-countries so we did some shopping. Quality of the shops in our opinion was really good. Keep in mind that many Icelandic shops offer the possibility to get a refund of VAT (almost 25%!) . Ask for the special coupon when making a purchase. If the sum exceeds 5000 kr you must get it stamped by customs first. After this you will get the refund from the landsbanki office in the departures area. You can choose between a cash refund in kronur or a refund in euro/GBP/USD to your credit card (which may take some time). The only problem with the airport is transport to Reykjavik. Most visitors who are not being picked up will depend on the Flybuss. Even though this was adequate for us it got really full and was not too comfortable.

In the departure lounge was a small counter selling drinks and basic refreshments; it accepts only CUP Cuban pesos the national currency as opposed to the CUC convertible peso.

My domestic flight was late arriving (45 mins) and although I was told to identify myself to the ground staff which I did but to what avail I'm unsure. I had to transfer by bus from the domestic terminal to the international one which comprises of: 1) wait in a line for a transfer bus and have my bags screened (apparently I’d been fast-tracked and hadn't had to wait on a ticket to join this line). 2) Sat on the bus for 15 mins while it loaded the bus finally left the domestic terminal at midnight next flight left at 1am. 3) The bus then acts as a tour bus for the airport it seems having to wait for planes to pull out of gates etc. 4) Once the bus arrived at the international terminal we had to wait I had to go back through security and go to the check-in desk again. At this point it was 12.20 the check-in guy told me that I was too late for the flight but a bit of persuasion and pointing out that it was due to the issues at the airport/late flight meant that they fast tracked me through the system process was also quite smooth from that point but i realize that was due to the fact that I had no luggage to check and flying business class. 5) Once through security (jumped the queue due to kindness of other passengers) raced through the terminal to departure gate. 6)It was then another bus to board the airplane (past where I just gone 30 mins before).

guatemala-airport,/airport-reviews/guatemala-airport,Guatemala Airport customer review,V Morgan,NA,2009-02-18,"Guatemala City's airport has improved greatly from when I was younger. There are more check-in counters and more gates available. Everything clean and well-maintained. Bathrooms which used to be a gamble are now clean. The airport is small so everything is close together and easy to navigate. The new duty free and other boutiques are a welcome change from the ""mercado central"" feel the shopping area used to have. Customs and migration are simple and the staff are easy to deal with. The only issue I have with this airport is the security personnel. While I understand that all airports have slightly different security measures (Buenos Aires airport doesn't let you take water on the plane even if you bought it after the security checkpoint - ridiculous!) Guatemala's seem particularly arbitrary and not enforced in an even-handed manner. For example the rule is liquids must be in containers holding less than three ounces and in a plastic bag. I forgot the plastic bag detail this time around. After opening the bag and seeing its contents they insisted on the plastic bag. I didn't have one and unlike other airports they didn't offer one and couldn't tell me where to find one. Plus I was running to catch an AA flight (the time had been changed without informing passengers) so I couldn't conduct a search. I resigned myself to having to leave the two oils and cream behind. The security guy took the cream but not the oils as well as a deodorant which of course is technically a solid and should have been left with me. My lesson is learned: pack toiletries in their plastic bags and carry extras in case security is not placated. But I will never know exactly what version of TSA rules Guatemala uses. personnel could stand to be nicer as well. Even the security staff in Miami are nicer.",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Gulf Air employees at check-in have always been very nice and smiling. The duty-free is quite big but the price level is not interesting at all except for cigarettes.

Airport check in was quite fast in a big bright hall. Many signs showing directions to gates passport control toilets and all other necessary information. There are a lot of shops with souvenirs music CDs different beverages sweets olive oil and all the other food. Most of such shops have reasonable prices but some I found to be a bit expensive compared to the city. The airport is not overcrowded which helps a lot even in top of tourist season. Staff is pleasant and ready to help and explain anything you may ask. Luggage is easy to find and everything goes very quickly. You need just some minutes before you leave the airport when arriving Athens. The only obvious problem about this airport is the passport control - both in arrivals and departures. when arrived a huge crowd of people from different planes went into one small hall with few officers working there. If you have Greek passport - it is OK but for non EU citizen it was about 15 minutes of waiting. Same when departing though in departures there is much more space but again in many cabins only few officers were working.

The queues for E-passports went on and on and it took 45 minutes and for the non-E passports it took about 55. Needless to say not all the booths were manned and the attitude of the Border Control staff (or whatever they call themselves nowadays) was dismissive and downright rude. When I complained and said that this was unacceptable and that there should at least be separate queues for older people or families with children or those with claustrophobia three bored-looking immigration staff watching the endless queue at E-passoprt control one of them (whilst chewing gum) said 'Ave you gotta problem mate with this?' and the other said 'well it's busy aint it!' and looked at me as if to say how dare I complain.

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,R Koehler,United States,2014-10-22,"Our experience at this airport was very poor. Incredibly slow TSA screening line caused my entire family to miss our flight wait five hours and pay $375 to reschedule. Despite there being maybe 200 people in front of us (two wraps of line) the process took half an hour! Multiple TSA employees appeared to be standing around while only a single screening line operated. Nobody from TSA seemed to have the slightest concern that they were taking far too long and people were at risk of missing their flights. Is there any motivation or reward for TSA employee efficiency? We made the mistake of flying with Frontier airlines. These guys closed the boarding doors 10 minutes prior to departure (we checked our luggage at their counter nearly an hour before departure and that got on the plane just fine). And then happily got $375 to reschedule. As with the TSA what motivation do these people have to actually help passengers? Zero! There are very few power outlets in the terminal (A gates) to plug in phones / laptops. With so many people sitting around (stranded?) it would be nice to have more power outlets!

Then I was escorted with all my things back to terminal hall for inspection. All my things including underwear and so on were put on the table for scan with those big blue ""tooth brushes"" and they even x-rayed my training short. Staff at this point were calm and polite.

Then I was escorted away from hall leaving my cameras and some valuables almost unattended. In a room they searched all kind of possible weapons from my body.

The baggage took forever to come round and when it did it was all wet and slushy from the snow outside and several bags were damaged. Free WiFi so I could check e-mails etc while I was waiting for bags. When leaving check in staff weren't the nicest but did what they had to efficiently. The security checkpoint is in the middle of the airport between the check in hall and arrivals. The security check was quick but this was because they were very lax about everything many people went through with bottles of water and drinks and they were generally making the minimum of effort. Had to pass through passport control again which was quick. Upon arriving in Bulgaria we had docked at a jet way so walked off the plane and into the airport. When leaving our plane was parked at a remote stand so we went to a bus gate to be bussed to the aircraft.

This time we flew WOW and found the overall experience good. Check in started around 3.5 hours before our flight and didn't take long. They had more staff for one flight (7) than WOW did at KEF for 3 flight (5). Security did take longer than usual but still only took 15mins which is better than Stansted. The departure lounge is large however there is no view of the apron at the South Terminal as the one restaurant there was is now going under redevelopment. This is the one thing in the departure lounge that needs to be changed. The gate opened one hour before our flight before the plane arrived. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen. It took far longer than it should have and is probably why our flight was slightly late. On arrival we landed early and disembarkation got away quite quickly. Immigration took really quickly and the staff where friendly which was a good thing. Baggage got on the carrousel after a ten minute wait so probably took 25 mins from the plane to the carrousel and 35mins from us leaving the plane to getting in the car. Very good.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,J Coles,United Kingdom,2012-12-28,I was one of many that were held up at Customs for 90 minutes just before Christmas because of the queues and missed my connecting flight. Several international flights came in at once and there weren't enough staff to handle the volume of human traffic. As it happened another girl on my flight - a US citizen - got through quicker (because they had more staff on the US citizen side) - but she missed her connection because the baggage was delayed. I found out that I would have missed my flight anyway because of this. I don't understand why United allow a booking online for a connecting flight that can't be made. Anyway suffice to say I will not be using United again (the customer service was appalling) and will not be flying through DC.

There are two termini T1 is old and T2 is new and they are connected by skytrain and walkway. Airlines transit desks are good and the staff is friendly. If you are transiting between termini it's better to allow 2 hours or more. Children playground and Hello Kitty play area are available in T2. Although T1 is an old one it is acceptable.

We were also bussed to the building from a long way off. We just made our connecting flight. I agree that the airport is hectic. On our return flight we had a 3 hour layover. Having flown business class we fortunately did not experience the lack of seating and facilities that seems to be a problem; although the business class lounge is also very busy - we noticed that the food stations' quality and selection has deteriorated since last year. Even though we left the business class lounge well before time to get to our gate fighting our way against the streaming tide of shoppers to get to our gate. As a family of four it took concentration to stay together; we just held onto each others' belts and let my husband lead the way! However we still only arrived as they were doing 'last call'.

budapest-ferihegy-airport,/airport-reviews/budapest-ferihegy-airport,Budapest Ferihegy Airport customer review,W Karpowicz,Poland,2010-06-02,Arrival at Ferihegy is a bit deceiving. The direct train to the city is a joke the station lies in the vicinity of low-cost Terminal 1 while most of passengers arrive at Terminal 2 which is connected with T1 and the railway station by public road usually congested with urban traffic. At the remote railway stop there are no amenities for disabled passengers and no information at all. The real nightmare is the departure and transit. Taken into account incredible queues at check-in and then even longer queues at security check you should come to the airport well ahead the time the airlines suggest. Staff at security check is harsh and rude and hardly communicate in English. Due to the lack of space and insufficient number of gates in the Schengen terminal the crowds of passengers make it difficult to move not to say about places to seat.

The new parking structure attached to the main terminal is a great job done. The arrival portion is still messy specially outside the airport.

My flight from LAX (via Incheon) arrived about 11PM. Only 26 minutes passed between my plane reaching the T1 gate and me leaving the airport to get a taxi. In the middle of the week I used T2 to go to Bacolod for a few days. As far as time it was faster going thru lines than most airports that I have experienced in the U.S. My only major issue with T2 are the very hard metal seats. On departure I arrived at T1 four hours before my flight. It took me 1h 45m minutes from leaving my taxi to getting to the gate. However 45 of those minutes were spent waiting for Korean Air to open their ticket counter. The air conditioning at both T1 and T2 was functioning. Having to go through a minor security check if I wanted to leave the gate area to get something to eat or use the restroom and return was no issue. The biggest problem that I have overall with the airport is the age of the facilities and the lack of eateries and stores. But with the renovations I will give them the benefit of the doubt for now.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

It's just too big, heavily congested, and difficult to navigate. The terminals are so far apart, a transfer from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3 can take anything from 30 to 60 minutes depending on crowds and boarding gates. The arrivals hall to pass through customs took us 1 hour 50 minutes, that was on top of the 30 minute hike by foot and metro rail just to get there. I normally use the Emirates lounge facilities, however had the misfortune to use the public toilets inside the terminal, it was an absolute disgrace. I won't go into the details, but the floors looked like a herd of camels had relieved themselves on the floor. General airport cleanliness was below standard for such a new modern airport, but in fairness, given how many people utilise the airport facilities it would be a nightmare to try and keep clean.

The passenger terminal has a run-down appearance to it that is in need of updating. Carpeting and wall paneling do not seem to have been upgraded in a while. The terminal lacks jet bridges and the baggage claim conveyor is out of doors which I actually find quite pleasant when the weather is nice but awful during rainstorms. The food and shopping options were minimal though I did not get a chance to check their prices. On the positive side however: the airport is very conveniently located for much of Los Angeles and has convenient access to the freeways. Despite the dilapidated look of the terminal it is a lot less confusing and intimidating than LAX - finding my way through the place was easy. The view of the mountains and desert outside of my airplane window on approach to the airport was enjoyable.

You likely to have to walk through the rain to get on your plane or failing that you walk to a bus. Overhead walkways are almost non existent. When you return there's only 4 passport control desks so just pray your flight is the only arriving at any one time. There's an escalator to walk up at the shed like entrance to the airport when you land and this escalator has not worked since I've been in Leeds which was in the 1980s. I'm ashamed of what people must think when they come to Yorkshire or England for the first time and this is their experience of it. But it seems the airport is beholden to no-one to improve.

Departures are one big level up - only way as far as we could discover was to climb the stairs. Prepare yourself or try to see if your driver/ porter can help you but don't pay until you're up there. 2. The customs form with detailed declaration of how much money you've brought in and take out can frighten the life out of you if you can't prove every penny of expenditure.

yangon-airport,/airport-reviews/yangon-airport,Yangon Airport customer review,Hugo Duran,NA,2003-08-07,We flew to this airport from Bangkok. We were welcomed on the platform by friendly people and were ushered to a nondescript building and not to the glamorous terminal next to it. Later we heard that only the local government bobo’s had access to this site. We were guided into the standard arrival terminal and this one served for the customs to get the visa for entry. We were the first visiting group which got here under a new rule our visa instead at the embassy in Bangkok. Can you imagine a bare big place hardly any sitting facilities and toilets. We had to wait approximately about one hour before the next hurdle could be taken queuing-up in front of the passport control. Luckily our Burmese guide used some money in order get our luggage quick through without a check on valuables. We needed about 21/2 hours before we arrived “in the country”. The next encounter with this airport was a domestic flight to Mandalay for which we had to check-in very early in the morning. We arrived at the airport and it was still dark our driver dropped us outside the entrance gate and before we knew what was going on a lot of porters were fighting over our luggage. We were not allowed to carry our own stuff and had to follow the two guys which were chasing our suitcases through the crowd to the departure hall. Both porters stayed with us until after check and double-check all with printed-out passengers lists at the boarding counters. Finally they put our luggage on a transport lorry were tipped-of by us they gave us a big smile and vanished in the overcrowded place to pick-up a new load. We were ushered through customs why is a question because it was a domestic flight and arrived in a hardly lighted departure hall looking for a place to sit and wait for our plane to leave. We found a place but were chased away; we had to sit in the foreign lobby. This place was identical to the first one and was also crowded by a majority of locals. Both lounges were unkept dirty sitting facilities inadequate and the toilets as expected very unclean. Two weeks later at arrival from Heho on this airport we did encounter the same hectic. After leaving the plane we were waiting in the arrival hall for our luggage to appear but nothing came. The lorry with suitcases stayed outside and suddenly a guy stood in front of us and asked for our flight tickets. He told us that he needed them in order to be able to get our luggage of the lorry. He was double-checked by an officer that he had the right stuff and he brought us to our in advance chartered taxi which was parked outside the gate. This was heavy work two suitcases of approx 20 kg each and a weekender with this load he manoeuvred agile through the crowd. The last encounter with this airport was a few days later when we had to fly back to Bangkok. The same procedure with our luggage at arrival until the check-in counter here porters were not allowed to stay and had to get out the building. Than to our amazement at the international departure everything was electronic registered. We went through the customs very smoothly and arrived in the international departure lobby. There were 6 up to 7 small stores with the usual souvenirs and other expensive stuff. Further there was enough place to be seated but these were not well kept for Burmese standards relative clean the air-condition did not function well because it was sticky hot and the illumination level was rather low. Conclusion: This airport does not meet the international standards but it is quite an experience to have been there. We did mostly encounter friendly people and you have to be acquainted with the way of working and the hectic about the luggage. Apparently it is a play between the taxi drivers and the porters that they drop the passengers outside the gate so a next person can earn a living. We did encounter the same organisation at the domestic airport of Heho where we were dropped-off 500 meters insight of the main gate.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

One point though is that the immigration staff were extremely unfriendly and arrogant upon both our arrival and departure barking orders at us to hurry up and threatening us with fines if unable to do so (despite travelling with a 7-month-old and 2-year- old). An example doesn't confirm a rule but in this case the fact that there were two examples suggests to me that perhaps there is a general problem with the immigration staff.

At this point a lady from the Ministry of Health stops random passengers checking their Yellow Fever certificate. At the customs desk lines form for visa stamps this is extremely slow. Getting baggage out of the airport is also chaos as airport staff want to check baggage tags against passenger. Again not everyone is stopped. I wouldn't recommend a taxi there are a lot of touts. Departure is equally frustrating no clear signage so always confusion. Need to pay a departure tax. Then you go to a window in the departure hall and give the CFA to a woman who will stamp your ticket. After this you need to fill out a departure form and have your passport stamped. Once you arrive at your gate your hand-carry luggage is hand checked as are you. Then you can proceed to your flight. There are no announcements so make sure you know where you're going! Not the worst airport I've been to but difficult all the same.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,K Chen,United States,2011-01-04,We flew out of this airport two weeks ago. It was the most frustrating airport experience that we've ever had. They have the doors leading to the check-in area blocked so it created a huge bottle neck of people trying to get to the check-in and baggage drop off areas in Terminal 1. There was a nice gentlemen who looked to be a manger. He stepped in and helkped us and even let us skip in the first class line. If it weren't for him we would have missed our flight. We got there 3 hours early and got through security and to our gate right as our flight was boarding. Security was ok but once we passed there was a second security set up for Lufthansa which took a long time to get through and we were number 4 in the line. Once we got on the plane we had to de-board because security had somehow messed up. So we spent another hour or so driving in circles on a bus around the airport before being taken back to the airport and had to go back through security. They were nice and let us through early since we had two small kids. Then we had to go back to the bus and wait for everyone to show up. Then we were taken back to the plane. After waiting to have the plane de-iced we finally departed. We arrived at our destination 5 hours later than what the itinerary was set for. We got there just in time to secure our rental and call the hotel before our reservation had been cancelled.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,C Hellberg,United Kingdom,2009-09-21,Luton airport has the feel of an airport for cut-price airlines. Since it's so far out of the city and doesn't have a large volume of passengers trains are not very frequent and not fast (compared with LHR for example). The bus to the airport was also late going whenever they can wait till they get a full bus. The airport is strict with the 1 bag policy (meaning laptop bag counts as a bag as does a handbag I'm told). All other airports I've been to are more lenient on this policy. On the plus side security was quite brisk; they had a lot of people to process but had many scanner gates open and people were moving fast. Airside there are some food and goods shops to keep you busy before the flight.

Our flight arrived at about 1000pm and seemed to coincide with the arrival of several other flights - six or seven hundred passengers at immigration and about twelve desks but only four were being used that's about 150 passengers per desk after queing for over an hour the immigration official serving the queue that we were waiting in decided that he had had enough and cleared off - we were then told to join the back of one of other three queues. Another hour and a half wait and it was our turn my wife got processed but when it came to my turn the official decided that he was thirsty and was going for a drink. I tried telling the official that we were together but that fell on deaf ears and again we were told to join the back of one of the two remaining queues. Pandemonium broke loose airport security then stepped in and began screaming at passengers - almost immediately two more desks were opened but that just made matters worse. Never again.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,T Smitherman,Norway,2014-01-24,"If BA offers you a tight connection Heathrow will always be an awfully stressful experience. Keep in mind you will always land late because unless you arrive before 6am you will first circle London 2-3 times. Staff are overall very rude. Every aspect of your journey is handled by a different company. I travel with a disabled family member. If you begin your journey at Heathrow disability assistance drives you to a series of checkpoints where typically you will sit unable to leave with a supervisor who hardly speaks any English. Even if you start out 3-4 hours before your flight you might have no opportunity to shop or get some food. If you have a transfer through Heathrow disability assistance insists on driving you to a checkpoint near passport control where you will be stuck for some time while the assistance staff socialises with one another and inefficiently makes its future plans. Last time we flew through Heathrow was 9-10 months ago. We had a tight connection made still tighter by the aforementioned Heathrow slow flush cycle. Disability assistance came late then sat there for 10 minutes then drove to the checkpoint and sat for 15 minutes doing nothing. Luckily a BA tight connections assistant came by and checked out tickets for the connection we were already late to board so that it would not leave without us. She also gave us orange ""short connection"" passes and asked the disability assistance to hurry up but neither was to any avail. Then we walked the remaining distance to the gate which took another 10 minutes. We were met by about ten BA employees at the gate who were horrified at how long it took for us to be escorted through the airport on a tight connection. Learn my lesson - don't transfer through Heathrow unless you really have to but certainly never do it on a tight connection.",NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,Eric McPherson,United Kingdom,2014-03-26,What an awful place CDG is we tend to avoid it like the plague unless we have to. Booked a flight from the UK transferring in CDG only to find that the connecting flight was cancelled then it appeared to be delayed then it became a technical issue. Air France clearly could not make up their mind what was the problem but it was clear that they just pushed all passengers on the next flight so the delay (in the end they settled for a delay even the airport information signs changed from cancelled to delayed as otherwise they would had to come up with compensation payment of course) and accidentally the delay was rectified at the exact same time the next flight was meant to leave. Clearly there weren't 2 aircraft's waiting they just bumped us on the next one. We were stuck at the airport for six hours with a child oh dear what a disaster. Don't know what they were thinking when they designed the place but it's just such an awful place to waste your time. The design of the place is bland industrial soulless and boring and there is absolutely nothing to do but feel sorry for yourself having to spend time there. They have a handful of shops but many of these sell overpriced French design stuff which an average passenger can never afford. Staff in the shops make you feel awkward. Having these shops just sums up what this airport is about presumptuous style of substance. To make things worse the airport staff do not exactly understand the meaning of what good customer support is about. Some staff are rude and one just made us wait just to finish a chat with their colleagues with a queue waiting to speak to them. Again avoid the place.

hannover-airport,/airport-reviews/hannover-airport,Hannover Airport customer review,Alex Mackie,NA,2005-10-08,An unusual 'system' in my view. At Hannover you first clear your luggage with security before checking in. This is done in the middle of the terminal. You are then not supposed to leave this 'secure' area until you have checked your bags in. However this simply doesn't work and people are able to leave (eg to the toilets) with their hold luggage labelled as 'security checked' and then check in. Another novelty (to me anyway) is that you don't go airside until you actually enter the holding lounge for your gate. So each gate has it's own secondary security check & immigration desk. Worth not going airside until the last possible minute in my view. Other than that a pleasant enough location with a good observation deck.

papeete-airport,/airport-reviews/papeete-airport,Papeete Airport customer review,C Meyers,NA,2004-03-09,Papeete airport is a small airport and fairly straight forward. Arrival and immigration can be frustrating for anyone holding a passport other than a FP France or other EU country. The immigration line is divided into two lines: one for FP nationals France and EU countries. The other for USA Canada and others. We disembarked off an Air France 747 that was full (over 300 pax). My wife and I were the only Canadians on board with about 50 US citizens. Although there were over 250 pax in the FP France line they were processed much faster than the 52 pax in the other line. It was frustrating to watch a line 5 times larger go through faster. But that is the way they do things so we must respect the rules. Once through immigration it is to the baggage carousel. There is only one carousel and is fairly large so there is enough room for everyone to find a place to stand and wait for their bags. After collecting your bags there is a customs check. Agents have drug dogs sniffing and will randomly check bags. The process here was much shorter than at immigration. After you pass through customs you will be met by your tour operator. These people operate very efficiently and will get you on your way without much hassle. I had a connecting flight to Moorea. The Air Moorea terminal is housed in the building next to the main terminal. I could have walked there faster than waiting for the tour operator to drive us there. Oh well! The Check in area is small. Passports are checked when you first enter the terminal. Your baggage is screened through x-ray then you must get into line to check your bags with the airline. This process is not very efficient especially if there is more than one flight checking in. Security screening is efficient and the departure area has duty-free shops. The furniture is very comfortable and the gate areas do not seem that crowded. Overall not a bad airport.

All was well until we went through Security with our hand luggage. I told the official as I put my bag jacket and small bag containing a few items of cosmetics into the plastic tray that my bag contained insulin and other diabetic-related paraphernalia. My carry-on bag was diverted from the main conveyor without any explanation where it sat for more than 5 mins before a male staff member took it to a table and started to empty it out. When I politely asked what the problem was I was told that my plastic bag containing a few items of cosmetics was the 'wrong size' ( I have used this bag at Heathrow x 2 Miami Cork Dalaman and Luton) and was directed to a machine where I paid £1 for four bags. I transferred my liquids to the new bag and expected this to be the end of the matter. My mobile was inspected with a geiger like object as was my husband's i-pod. They were then taken to another machine and re-inspected. Nothing was found as there was nothing to find. After 15-20 mins the official indicated that I could re-pack my bag. I asked again politely what the problem had been. He then picked up my cosmetic bag rooted through it and pulled out my mascara - which he hadn't looked through previously. 'This' he said waving it under my nose. 'It should have been in the plastic bag'. So it took all that time and the emptying of the entire contents of my bag to tell me that.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,David Walsh,Ireland,2011-09-24,I flew to Istanbul on business in Sept 2011. Flight over from Ireland was good and Turkish Airlines were good. Returned to the airport on a Saturday morning at 6.05 for a 7.45 departure and then the nightmare began. I lined up along with hundreds of others in a common queue to check-in until I was eventually called out of the queue with the rest of my flight because time was getting short. I have never seen such chaos at a check-in desk. Staff did not seem to care and there was no sense of urgency. Next step was to go to the passport control line and this was another disaster with really long queues. I have never in all my time flying witnessed airport police so obviously arguing with ground staff in front of passengers in an airport but saw this happen twice in this airport. I then made my way directly to the departure gate only to be faced with another series of horrendous queues to get through the x-ray machines it was organised chaos. I heard my name being called with other passengers for our flight. I pleaded with an official to let me through to get to the plane but he refused point blank saying that I had time. I missed the flight and had to go back out into departures and fight my case with Turkish Airlines. Eventually they flew me to London and I had to buy a ticket myself to get back to Dublin.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Their claim to fame is that they have ranked number 1 three years in a row in customer satisfaction. If you dig into the statistics you'll find they participate in a survey of airports with less that 5 million passengers and those airports that do participate are few in number. It wouldn't be that hard to rank number 1. I think the service I have experienced there is far from world renowned and leaves a lot to be desired. Parking is terrible there is minimal shopping and food services other than fast food style. The airport including the runways have been under construction for many years creating constant delays.

Once inside security it is a beautiful airport with lots of shopping and reasonable food choice. Hard to hear announcements even though sitting at Gate.

cardiff-airport,/airport-reviews/cardiff-airport,Cardiff Airport customer review,Bob Alexander,NA,2008-04-29,We flew into Cardiff airport on Thursday 24th April intending to get public transport to central Cardiff. We missed the two buses that could have got us there (one direct and one via a rail connection) as they left the stand within a couple of minutes of each other and then we had to wait an hour for the next to arrive although one was scheduled to have arrived after about 45 minutes it did turn up but having dropped passengers off it drove away without picking up the waiting passengers. This was at 5pm so hardly an off-peak period!! We returned to the airport on Monday 28th April to fly to Malaga. It took us an hour to check in with bmibaby although there were only about a dozen people in the queue ahead of us. When we got to the desk we were a kilo overweight so we removed a bag of magazines from our suitcase and put it in our cabin bag which was almost empty. This put us below 20 kilos but the girl did not seem too happy at what we had done and insisted that we put the cabin bag in a measuring cradle even though it was a regulation size airline cabin bag. It fitted easily needless to say. Was she resentful at not being able to charge us excess baggage? We have travelled dozens of times all over the world with that bag and never been asked to prove its measurements before. Then it was the turn of the security check into departures. One desk open a large queue of people and further delays. We and others expressed our annoyance at the fact that there were 11 other security staff just hanging about chatting to each other. To add further insult to passengers some 'staff' who had been waiting to clear security were called forward and given priority over paying customers! The general facilities of the airport seem good but clearly there is a major management problem which causes problems for passengers and probably results in loss of revenue for airport shops/cafes etc. as passengers spend so much time in queues they have little time left for anything else.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

They gave a cursory look and then continued their conversations refusing to make eye contact or to give me any advice on how to record lost items.

The ideal times I think are from 6am to 9am and also 3pm to 9pm. I have travelled with Aer Lingus many times and their services are great with friendly staff. I really like travelling with Ryanair though because as long as you follow the rules you get a cheap flight and the staff aren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be everything is done with urgency and if you don't want any delays they are the best.

If you're upstairs in the eating / departure area it's very hot as the sun comes in through the glass roof.

Personnel wasn't particular friendly but nothing to complain about. Flying out I was lucky again as it was not a busy time but that was about the only upside. As one other reviewer already wrote: don't arrive on an empty stomach. Next to this advise one clear warning: avoid the Duty Free shops! The price tags at least on cosmetics are hefty. I had 4 people in front of me at security and it took about 20 minutes. I don't want to think about what it would be like if it had been a regular hour or even a busy day.

We landed 10 minutes early but had to wait on the tarmac for a 'bus which then took 35 minutes to get to Terminal 2G another wait for a 'bus there to go to Terminal 2E. Confusion on the 'bus as many people hadn't checked the display beside the exit door of 2G to see which 'bus stop they had to get off at (no notice to warn people of this). By the time we got to our gate (running from the 'bus) the gate was closed and the passengers had gone. Again for the Aberdeen flight you have to catch a 'bus to the aircraft so if the 'bus has gone that's it. To add insult to injury we were held responsible for missing the flight because the incoming flight was on time and the connection time was within the limits set by the airport.

Denmark thinks the entire world relies on online check-in - still unavailable to many. 7/11 is the only available option in Terminal 2. Staff highly regulated by the typically officious Danish Trade Unions who restrict hours and the petty Scandinavian obsession with ""Green"" policies means you cannot fly until after 5.30 in the morning.

hamad-doha-airport,/airport-reviews/hamad-doha-airport,Hamad  Doha Airport customer review,R Clarke,Saudi Arabia,2015-06-15,"It's new with lots of space and seating but truly the big problem here is if you are transferring/transiting as once off the plane you have big vast walkways on the way to transfer but then you turn a corner and are met with a huge bottleneck and mass of passengers as you have to go through a security screening check which is so crowded both early morning and late at night. This needs to be sorted or doing away with as if you come off a plane and will board another one why would you need to go through a fine security check once again. This really needs to be made more efficient as the security staff are arrogant, unhelpful and rude in the cases I observed as I waited to transfer through. They say there is a fast track but its not sign-posted and passengers were just overwhelming the security area anyway. Signing in this area is pretty poor. The gates C-20-29 are downstairs and its like a sauna down there with inadequate A/C overcrowding of passengers and huge queues just to use the one toilet area there which can not cope with the humanity that flows through there even with attendants trying their best. Badly designed sadly and you still have to use buses would you believe to get to your aircraft from these gates. So you build a huge airport and yet you still have to uses buses and crowded parts of this airport to board a plane. Truly not thought out for passengers sadly in these areas.

It was very disorganized with long lines and lots of waiting. I had 4 hours between flights and I barely made the connecting flight. I came off an international flight and then waited almost an hour in line just to have my passport checked. Then it took 2 hours to pick up my baggage and recheck it. The line was incredibly long. When one man asked the personnel if he could go ahead of the others because his flight was in 15 minutes the lady told him she didn't care but he'd have to ask the other passengers. Of course that led to chaos as he tried to manuever his way through the entire line asking permission from every person. And when other people saw that they wanted to do that too. And then the other passengers started getting irritated and wouldn't let anybody in front (and rightly so). The only part that wasn't chaos was agricultural customs and that's because there were about 3 people including me in this line. I would only fly through here again if i absolutely had to. The staff was ok no one was outright rude but there were too many irritated people and not enough space and no it wasn't Christmas or any other high-traffic season.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It was nice to walk to customs where you could see the rest of the airport. We had to go down stairs and it almost looked like we would enter Canada but then a left (not that easy to notice) led to an escalator up to US baggage claim for connecting flights. This was a long wait (about 30 minutes) but then through a passport control line (not bad) and security. International flights connect in the same passport control room with people flying from Canada to US but there are dedicated desks. The line (a maze) moved pretty fast and so did security. For US passport control there were few questions or hassles. After security you go down to the part of the airport for US flights - decent selection of food options.

kazan-airport,/airport-reviews/kazan-airport,Kazan Airport customer review,Barry Byrne,NA,2007-05-27,Kazan Airport has two terminals but T2 a square shaped building some 50m from T1 seems to be used mainly as a VIP facility. Terminal 1 is a small rectangular building with separate sections for international and domestic services. Most likely it is the international section you will encounter on the regular LH service from FRA that arrives / departs in the very early morning. To say that Kazan has few facilities for departing passengers is rather an understatement a preliminary baggage scan leads immediately to a few check in desks and a very short walk to immigration control and a further scan for hand baggage. In the small waiting area there are some hard seats in a small waiting room and a bar. The business lounge has a few soft seats a fish tank and a television. Drinks here even coffee are to be paid for nothing is free apparently. There are no shops banking or change facilities at departure. They bus you the 20m to the aircraft of course. On the plus side this very small facility is a pleasant change from the corridors of FRA but not a place to linger to arrive too early or any place to be delayed either. It is a reasonably long way from the city but linked by a good road so it does not take very long to travel to the city. At that hour of the morning the roads are empty also.

When that was done I looked for the baggage drop. Building was full and queues everywhere. Very difficult to find a queue for only the baggage drop. I made it at 06.45 and was looking for my gate. When I found the passport-control with it's queue-area I understood that we were in trouble. Queue continued out in the building and the end could not be seen. Amazed by the length all the way to check-in counters A. My wife was standing in the queue and I tried to get help. Approx 08.15 we were facing the fenced queue-area the passport-control was not fully staffed. With thousands of people queuing desperately they had not opened all counters. Missed our flights after being redirected 4 times to different counters we were told that we could buy new tickets if we wanted. In a rude way I was told it was my problem. After some discussion I got the choice to get a flight at 21.00 if I paid a penalty fee of 100 EUR.

warsaw-chopin-airport,/airport-reviews/warsaw-chopin-airport,Warsaw Chopin Airport customer review,Robert Szocik,NA,2009-06-13,I've flown to Warsaw Fryderyk Chopin many times in the past but this was my first time use of WAW T2 for both arrival and departure. The difference is incredible at least on departure. The new terminal is light well-ventilated and feels a little like a smaller version of LHR T5. The orange décor used throughout risks making the terminal feel like it's run by Easyjet but one gets used to it. Passing through passport control couldn't be quicker helped by the fact that the terminal has been divided into Schengen and non-Schengen areas by glass screens (passport control for the non-Schengen flights is about halfway along the terminal). Security clearance was quick efficient and friendly. T1 and T2 are linked together both landside and airside but one has to check-in at the appropriate terminal. Several airlines including LOT and BA now have long-overdue self check-in machines. T1 now looks increasingly tired and neglected with reduced facilities airside but retaining all its previous facilities landside. T2 however has few facilities landside but excellent facilities airside all the way from just after security to the far end of the terminal. Clearly this airport is finally making significant steps towards providing a quality service for passengers with improvements in customer service and politeness throughout. However it's not quite there yet. On arrival my and another passenger's bags were placed on the wrong belt without any warning which quickly stopped and hid our bags from view meaning that we waited for almost half an hour for our bags. On both arrival and departure there seemed to be plenty of free airbridges yet we were bussed both to and from the terminal as always seems to be the case at this airport.

While Stansted airport is in itself quite adequate the arrangements at arrival passport control are a national disgrace. Whomever installed and passed as fit for purpose the new electronic scanning system should be ashamed. The system simply does not work properly. In my experience not only has the queuing time been extended but when one eventually arrives at the scanning ""stalls"" the scene is chaotic. Some of the machines were seemingly out of order a ""sergeant major"" type was valiantly but not always successfully directing people to available stalls creating an atmosphere of near panic; once in the stalls many people including my wife and myself could not be successfully scanned. In my own case I'd all but given up after three scans and had called for assistance when the gate unexpectedly let me through. My wife was not so fortunate and the scanner failed entirely in its purpose causing yet more delay when she had to reverse out of the stall and go through a manual check point along with others who had experienced the same problem.

There is no 'Welcome to Ottawa' sign that I have seen and few photos of the region in the arrival area. The screens in the baggage arrea are mostly watched by those meeting pasengers. The seats in the arrival area are appalling - no backs and they mosty do not face the arriving escalator nor do they have a view of the arrival information screens. The few seats that do have backs have no view of the escalators or the flight information screens either. When waiting for a delayed flight that has a constantly changing arrival time it is very uncomfortable to sit on backless seats and anoying to have to get up and down to check the arrival time. I agree that the lack of washrooms in that area is bad- many folk wait til they arrive to avoid a queue on the plane and then there is a hike to get there if they can find the sign.The food outlets are disappointing- is there no room for one that is NOT a franchise in the hope we could buy some fresh and interesting food? I had family arrive on a 30 interntional flight at 11.30pm. They were delayed in customs for over 45 mins because they declared some cans of passionfruit! No one knew what it was and decided all luggage must be searched. These were middle aged people who had arrived from Australia via the US! Highly suspcious. A great welcome!

The lines and walks are long everywhere you go. Transiting from the primary terminal to the satellite is a pain. After several elevator rides and several ramps you traverse a crowded security checkpoint with the most impersonal agents I have experienced. Its then another train ride and one long walk through a long straight terminal to your gate unless you are lucky and have one of the near gates. Signage is inadequate in the satellite terminal as are seats. If its a busy time of the day many will be forced to sit on the floor or along a wall. They are also poor when it comes to announcements. I once had 2 completely unannounced gate changes in the matter of 30 minutes. The other terminals are dated looking but more functional. Its not all bad as its a decent looking airport and a good selection of restaurants and other services when you are waiting for a flight.

Arrived at Bradley and cleared immigration fairly quickly only to have to wait ages at the luggage belt and then queue again to get through customs. At least there were staff on hand to direct passengers to the shortest queues. All staff were courteous even when under pressure. We had a long connection so walked to terminal 7 for our flight to Denver. The TSA queue snaked all the way to the door and was so slow. The staff are very inefficient and it doesn't help that passengers are taking too many carry-on items. Terminal 7 is pretty grotty but we found some seats at the end of the concourse escaping from most of the crowds but not the awful muzak. Arrival back at terminal 7 was fine although it took a while to find out where to wait for the rental car shuttle. We didn't see the signs at first because they were high above our heads. Look up and you will see where to wait. Departure back to Australia was from Terminal 4 which was a far more pleasant experience.

Aircraft park a few hundred meters away in front of the old terminal so there is a short ride in the terminal bus to get to the terminal. Luggage arrives within a few minutes much better than in Warsaw. The green City Transit Authority buses to the city center stop just outside the new ""L"" line is the fastest option. Bus ticket costs 260 PLN and should be bought at the RUCH shop at the terminal exit and then validated immediately onboard the bus. The ""L"" bus goes to the main railway station with a few stops enroute but as in Warsaw the journey takes a long time in peak traffic.

Terminal 1 has an open airy feel to it and it manages to have a good range of shops and eating places without giving the impression that retail is more important than aviation.

I am a frequent flyer and regularly travel to airports across the world. I am disappointed to say that the customer service and facilities that I experienced at Split airport were the worst that I had encountered anywhere. I waited in the ""all flights boarding"" line for 30 mins only to be told once I reached the desk that I was ""too early"" to check my baggage for this flight. That is unheard of! There was no signs or members of staff advising people of this information. I then had to re-queue at a separate line for 30 mins to be greeted by a very unfriendly and stressed staff member. She did not give me a good experience and was experiencing severe operational difficulties with her team members. Whilst going through security I was pushed aside by a member of the ""poliza"" security personnel.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,A Sung,United States,2014-04-21,I returned home to Los Angeles today from Japan and was extremely embarrassed to see how rude and unwelcoming the staff were at LAX international airport. I've had the privilege of traveling to Korea Japan and China in which all staff members of these aforementioned airports were extremely welcoming and equally helpful to their own citizens as well as visitors like myself who did not speak a word of their language. I was appalled to witness such an immense contrast- customer service here in LAX is non-existent. The staff members were rude and demeaning. I was randomly chosen to go through customs baggage search along with about 20 others and was directed to wait in line B. There were many tourists there who obviously did not speak or understand English. The officer in charge of customs search in line B was demeaning and obnoxious to these visitors who did not speak a word of English screaming at them instead of providing clear instructions and assistance. It's a shame to come home to such uncultured ill-mannered staff here at LAX.,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The return journey was a different story! How are you supposed to get from Geneva Airport France to Geneva Airport Switzerland without finding yourself airside and having to ask passport control and customs to let you through the arrivals area and back out into the Swiss airport? There must be a way but obviously an awful lot of people don't find it because none of the airport staff batted an eyelid - they just looked bored and annoyed at our stupidity. So how do you do it?

Landed at 11.10pm on Monday 14th July and joined the queue for the biometric passports at passport control. There were only 5 scanning machines there which continuously broke down. The normal queue was moving twice as fast and ours consequently took well over an hour so by the time we got to the baggage hall our two suitcases were the only two left on the carousel.

We arrived from UK into Terminal 3 and were immediately corralled in a corridor because the customs hall was full. After about 30 mins a woman arrived and separated the Canadians from the 'foreigners' (as she so charmingly called us) and took them off and we were released about 20 mins later into a customs hall containing well over 1000 people in 2 great queues which took another 90 mins to clear. Welcome to Canada! On return we had to transfer from Terminal 1 to 3 and what an easy experience it was. Excellent signage travellators lifts a little train all done with the minimum of effort. Customs and security quickly and easily cleared and we were through into an excellent departure lounge with plenty of comfortable seating good quality food outlets decent shops and free Ipads everywhere (although this meant the wifi signal was rubbish!).

Had many stops and stamps to my passport and tickets but I can honestly tell you that I had no idea what I was getting stamped or checked. Still a fairly smooth process and lot's of walking involved. I felt like I walked the whole airport just to get to my next flight! Unlike many North American airports there are not a lot of opportunities to purchase snacks or water after security.

Like on the way out at Stansted no security questions were asked. Once through immigration and the security check all their is is a small duty free shop and a coffee shop. The amount of seating was reasonable but not sufficient for the Ryanair flights scheduled to leave within 45 mins of each of each other. The airport also seems to suffer from a lack of airside buses to transfer passengers to aircraft  but thankfully no delay to departure occured.

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-02-18,There are good points: the building is quite airy and there was adequate seating when we were there (though it could not have coped with many more passengers) there was a good choice of eating places mostly not the usual boring international fast food outlets. Getting to and from the centre took about 20 minutes by taxi at a reasonable price (we had pre-booked on arrival which I recommend if you can). However there is one huge downside which has coloured my experience - the absurd process of immigration and emigration. You fill in an immigration card on the flight and then queue to have it and your passport checked and stamped. In our case it took about 30 minutes just about acceptable. On leaving though you fill in another (identical) and form take it to your airline desk to be stamped if you only have hand luggage (as we did) you thus queue (15 minutes in our case) for a process that takes about 30 seconds. You then go to the embarkation area and queue again (5 minutes) to check that you have been to the airline desk. This allows you into the hallowed ground of the emigration area where you queue (about 40 minutes) to have the paperwork checked and a stamp in your passport. All over? Oh no there was another officer standing about 1 metre behind the desk you have just passed who randomly stopped people to check again (admittedly we were not stopped). So over an hour queuing to get a stamp to leave the country. Marrakech clearly needs and attracts many tourists and has much to offer if it wishes to continue increasing the number of visitors it has to find a more efficient way of processing them into and out of the country.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

Nothing at all is funny about security checks so these clowns should be sacked. The immigration official on duty was disinterested and frankly acted very inconvenienced that passengers had actually disturbed her from reading her novel. Terminal 2 is a disaster.

Virgin Blue passengers now get to use a baggage carousel (basically a long conveyor belt) however the baggage pickup area is very small and quickly became crowded even though my Virgin Blue flight wasn't very full. It was rainy when I arrived so I wasn't too keen on the lack of jetways but it did allow my flight to empty quite quickly as we had the use of two doors.

Why is the departure tax cost not included in the ticket like most other airports? Then its up to the airline to hand over the fees instead of passengers waiting in yet another unnecessary line. Its amazing that this airport was officially opened in August 2013 yet its still under construction and still has no proper air line loungers only a poorly fitted out premier lounge with stale food and uncleaned seats with staff who mainly just stand around rather than looking after the lounge.

My first time to Toronto and I received clear information on how to proceed from the gate to customs and immigration from the airline staff and the security officers (who were very helpful and friendly a marked and positive difference to their colleagues in the United States). The only brief confusion I had was about whether I had to pick up my baggage and re-check it or whether it would be sent all the way through. Airport personnel were friendly and cleared up my questions. As I had a very long layover (11 hours) I decided to take a bus and tram into downtown Toronto during my layover. The information booth staff was nice and recommended the bus and subway I should take gave me a map and wrote instructions on it and also pointed me to a Toronto Transit vendor for the appropriate passes. Upon returning to the airport security moved quickly the agents were once again friendly and I found my gate without delay. All in all I found the airport easy to navigate and the personnel friendly and helpful.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Francisco Pinyata,NA,2009-06-22,"Having gone through NAIA terminal 1 three times since my last review about a year ago I have noticed some minor changes with the whole airport experience there most of them positive. First upon arrival the lines were visibly shorter on all 3 trips through there once between 1pm-2pm and twice between 7pm-8pm. I do not know what changes they've made but on average the time spent on queues went down by half. Secondly the time it took for me to get my luggage from the time I stepped out of the aircraft also went down drastically. I was out of the airport with my bags about 20-30 minutes after getting out of the plane which is a huge leap of improvement from previous experiences there. Departing from NAIA 1 has become easier as well. Before you couldn't get inside the terminal if you do not have a hard copy of your e- ticket. During one of my trips out of there I told the security guard by the entrance that I only had the reference number for my flight. The security officer told me that the reference number was enough and that they have been granting ticketless passengers terminal access for some time. The number of security checks inside the airport have gone down from 3 checks to 2 - once before checking in and then again after immigrations. The terminal fee (which some of the other comments below have been incorrectly referring to as ""airport tax"") is still 750 pesos or about 15 US dollars. The duty free shop is still a no-no with overpriced merchandise that you'd better off buy onboard your flight. The smoking area is still one of the biggest setbacks with a non-existent ventilation system and a floor area no bigger than my bedroom. The good news is that you could go upstairs to the restaurant-cafe and puff away there without buying anything. But their coffee is not that bad so I'd recommend that. I'd also suggest you try the ham and cheese sandwich. On of the saddest parts of this airport is the boarding gate and not because of the fact that your vacation is over at that point. It's those cold steel seats painted white. And there never is enough of them. And it's not just insufficient by a couple of seats - it's more like nearly half of the passengers waiting for their flight are standing up. A must-fix for the airport operators.

In reference to the food if you think that the motorway service areas are expensive and poor quality try the airport. On returning on the inbound flight we arrived at 16.45 and it was the worst that I have ever experienced getting to customs the excuse given was that 3 aircraft's had arrived all within 20 minutes of one another. This begs the question what are they doing making a big thing of all the extra flights that we hear about when it is clear that they cannot cope with their existing flights. My advice would be forget this airport until they get their act together and put passengers interests first because this is not the case at the present time. Please Doncaster lets have more flights to give Leeds more competition.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

odessa-airport,/airport-reviews/odessa-airport,Odessa Airport customer review,A Adrian,Romania,2011-10-14,A small but quite functional airport. I used it for a flight to Kiev and back to Odessa. What I like about this airport is the fact that due to it's small size everything works fast here. Baggage claim wait time was practically zero although this airport is not equipped with a baggage belt. Instead the tourists have to pick up their luggage from the back of a small truck. Probably the airport taxes for this airport are very small and for this reason some very good flight deals can be found on flights from this airport. The toilets were decent. Beside of some basic cafe there was nothing working at 6 in the morning. A baggage wrapping service is also available on site for the price of 25 grn. Parking for longer periods also available right near the airport.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,Mark Crowther,United Kingdom,2015-04-27,I think Stansted is a good airport overall. There are improvements being done to the shops and cafe which are already making the experience more to the level expected. As much as I'd rather not have to walk through duty free I get it. The security heading out of the UK is much improved especially with the new multi-person conveyor belts. They have them in Edinburgh airport and it makes the process far quicker. However regarding Arrivals security its a mess - as with other reviews mine is s typical story. Landed at 12.05am on Sunday 26th April and on arrival at passport control the hall was completely full. As always to the left we could hear the e-passport gates siren going off as a failed scan happened and to the right the half full line for non-EU arrivals. For us EU and UK citizens it took 20 minutes just to get from the off-loading area of the shuttle train to the point of being in the queue. It then took just shy of an hour to get through security others were tweeting the same so it wasn't just my bad timing. Half way through one of the UK Border staff wandered off (break time?) and 3 gathered around a desk with an issue with a passenger. I overheard people talking about just pushing through and maybe if we all start jeering. If this took place anywhere else there'd be a near riot being an airport people are contained let's hope peoples frustration remains verbal. The double whammy for anyone trying to travel late at night is the Stansted Express train finishes at 12.30am so the 3 or 4 plane loads of passengers have no chance of using it. Good job the coaches are available. But be warned they are NOT family friendly and the queue to buy tickets is often long with just 2 staff to serve customers. Your option from there is a taxi from inside the airport. But be prepared to pay around £100 to get to central London. I travel through Stansted almost every week and the story is pretty much the same. A good airport well served with facilities outbound security and transport ruined by an atrocious arrivals security. a) Get more staff checking passports (set a time limit from arrival to processing and publish if you hit/miss it) b) increase EU/UK staff and reduce non-EU staff due to volume of arrivals c) let families through in a priority lane you then switch to other passengers no one will mind people already usher families with crying babies through anyway.,NA,NA,NA,5,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Arrived back 00.10 15 Sep 2013 got luggage slowly and finally got to long stay car park bus stop at 00.40 and had to wait 20 minutes in cold for bus having spoke to operator on intercom but got nowhere not even apology it does not take 20 minutes to drive around car park. 5 minutes later I was driving to exit barrier but could not get out as the barriers had their power turned off and would not accept ticket. Spoke to operator who switched them on put ticket in barrier did not lift and said I owed them £80 although I had a prepaid ticket with supposedly number plate recognition. Again had to speak to operator and had to fish out booking reference before the barrier was opened.

I wanted to see if I was the only one with this poor experience. I wasn't and Mr Davis's review sums it up - The security staff at the Belfast International Airport obviously mistake officiousness for efficiency and really seem to enjoy the little power they have. I travel a fair bit 50k flight miles a year and I find Dublin and London security staff generally friendly and good and equally the TSA have really upped their game not Belfast Intl. Even to the point of making me unpack my backpack after it had been through the machine and being asked why did I have so many electronic devices. They'd already been rude and inefficient throughout the process to myself and others. It was a toss-up for me between flying to Heathrow from Belfast to get a direct flight from there to get home and a 2 hour train ride to Dublin for a direct flight and clearing US immigration in Dublin. Belfast Intl airport security have made that choice easy for me its Dublin for me from now on. One customer you have chased away and travelling is hassle enough.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Terminal 1 has not got this problem but believe me it is very annoying arriving with a flight and picking up luggage with a lot of people around.

A once great airport for connections has been transformed into hell. Long walks along dingy dimly lit corridors many without travelators. Security checkpoints are a disgrace with mostly rude staff EUR1 charges for additional LAGs clear plastic bags and horrendous queues. The separate queues for premium passengers were closed on both legs of transiting this airport. After the landing we were met with closed doors something in which LHR used to specialise. Even with First Class tickets on the return leg everyone must go through the same security checkpoints again with no premium lanes and long queues already at 5.30am.It is a shame MUC does not have the number of connections as FRA as this is a much more civilised airport.

No need to shop around in all the different duty free stores as the airport operates a one price system and other than cigarettes and sprits prices are more expensive than UK duty free.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,C Hansen,NA,2010-02-09,I have transited many airports in Europe and the US and think that MCO is one of the easiest to get around. It is also one of the more pleasant to wait in as there are plenty of stores to browse and different eateries to select from. Plenty of seating and natural lighting too. What you have to know is that the airside gates are away from the main terminals connected by an elevated tram system. Because of this I would suggest you do any eating or shopping before going through security as the options airside are somewhat limited. Although there seems to be a Starbucks in all the airside gate areas so I'm happy. They have gotten much better with security the last 3 times I've been through (June October November 2009) I never had to wait more than 15 minutes to be screened. Arrivals both domestic and from international have not been a problem either. Passport and customs is pretty smooth and you can now choose if you want to take your bag with you on the tram after clearing customs or put it back on the belt and collect it in baggage claim. This is a wonderful option for those that just want to get out of the airport as quickly as possible after a long plane ride.

One thing I don't understand about this airport all the planes pull up right in front of the gates and 80% of the time we can walk directly to the plane but sometimes they insist on putting passengers into cattle service buses for a pointless and unpleasant 10m drive - weird and costly.,NA,NA,NA,4,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

I arrived at around 1:15 via an Emirates plane from Dubai on the 23rd of June. My passport was duly stamped I proceeded to customs. I am from Africa so I guess my colour called attention to me. The customs officers took me to a separate room where they emptied my bags read all my documents asked me all questions that could come to their mind stripped me made me pee in cap as they watched tested me for drugs without my permission and later gave me a form to sign (by force to say that I had consented to these tests). My experience at this airport has made me hate the French - that was my first encounter with these country.

We also found the lack of comfort and facilities once we had been through departure gates and security very disappointing. Specifically disabled people who turn up on time for a two hour check-in really do not appreciate having to stand for nearly an hour before being able to check in with no opportunity available to sit down. Even once we had checked in we were unable to go directly to the departure lounge because another flight had to be cleared out first. Then when we got to the departure lounge we were disconcerted to find that there was no direct access to airline lounges ( we were travelling business class) where we could have relaxed. In short we found these facilities would have been fine for a short- haul local airport but quite inadequate for a major international destination.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

TBIT is still under construction but there are signs of progress. Security staff were noticably courteous but the processes remain frustratingly pointless. In response to previous comments there various staff members shouting out stuff but only in a very general public announcement kind of way. In addition to failing to appreciate the futility of their role they also fail to understand that shouting in English is going to miss about 80% of the audience in TBIT. There is a pinch point for a particularly slow passport and boarding card check and I am glad we were in Fast Track.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,Maurice Bulmer,NA,2006-06-09,I have travelled via GVA for skiing in the March of each of the last 2 years arriving BA on Saturday mornings. I also use Calgary when skiing in Canada most years and have used other airports around the world for similar trips. None can compare with the abject chaos that is the luggage and ski collection process that reigns in Geneva. You would have thought they would have realised that many people arrive with skis on Winter weekends. Apparently not as the method used seems to be to dump them in piles on the floor and leave it to customers to identify and drag out their ski bags; which have not even been sorted by flight. Frankly it is a mess and compares incredibly poorly with Calgary in this respect. Another issue is the lack of seating in an overcrowded (Winter weekends again) airport resulting in people sitting wherever they can blocking the narrow gangways between high end shops selling over priced goods ranging from Rolex watches to caviar - but no seats to be had at the cramped self service restaurant!

Although a small and very old fashioned building it reminds you of flying in a bygone era when things were more relaxed. Slightly bigger than your average flying club!! On arrival we were straight through immigration I don't think they checked even one passport and onto the duty free shop (french brandy £6 a litre) whilst waiting your bags on the single carousel then straight out (no customs) over the border and away. On return they were checking in 2 flights and departures became very crowded but security were very pleasant (unlike Manchester) departures lounge is too small and ends up with passengers being put on buses and having to wait until they can board the planes.

Brand new white and pretty spacious for a small airport. Well connected by the local bus service and very near to Adelaide city centre. One design flaw when people walk to the terminal from the pick up and drop off area you are exposed to the elements save for some un-practical tilted canopies that offer no shelter. The airport should have made a completely covered walkway which will be useful during the wet winter and the blazing summer. The departure counters were not many hence queues were long the ground staff like any Australian airport disinterested not helpful and tend to find faults with baggage. Security was fussy for a small airport. The departure terminal is spacious but does not have many shops. Eateries include a hungry Jack and some cafes. Tried a noodle bar the fried noodle was unpalatable and very expensive by Asian standards. Other shops were not interesting. Immigration was OK and swift. Waiting areas feels spacious well lit and with a good view of the runway and part of the Adelaide skyline. Overall a very god airport by Australian standards.,NA,NA,NA,8,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

We did get off first but then was left in a crowd of 6 people all in wheelchairs with 2 people to push all of us. This has happened time after time whenever we travel with wheelchair access at Pearson and it is just ridiculous that they cannot hire the sufficient amount of porters to wheel all the passengers in a reasonable amount of time. When we were leaving for Trinidad they came so late with the wheelchairs to take us to the departure lounge that we had to board immediately and did not have time to eat anything.

Getting dropped off at the airport requires running the gauntlet of the security staff on the approach road - twice we had to stop and tell them we needed to drive to the airport to drop-off. Security seems a bit over the top - especially as they merely waved us on - didn't check the car ask to see my ticket etc... Checked in on-line so avoided the queues - amazed how many security staff are employed. Arrival back later that evening was very different. The airport is no longer allowing cars to pick-up from outside the terminal - instead cars now have to enter the unlit short stay car park down the road from the terminal building and wait for passengers to find them. Not so easy when its dark and raining. After leaving a very chaotic terminal building I had a difficult time trying to find my lift home. The car park being used is unpaved with mud and gravel underfoot - not sure how anyone would manage with a luggage trolley. It requires a walk along the airport road for a couple of hundred yards. Once I had found my lift (could only do this by means of a mobile phone and directions) it took about 10 minutes to exit the car park as cars were not following any type of one way system - reason - no arrows painted on the gravel.

The staff were very friendly - the woman on immigration was chatting with me welcoming me to Ecuador and wishing me an excellent holiday. Getting a taxi on the way out is easy. One word of advice: they check the tags on your luggage against your ticket on the way out to make sure that you have the right baggage they are not trying to take your bag away from you!

Inbound was the usual piece of cake only one person in front of me at immigration and they were processed in no time so hardly queued at all. The facilities at LCCT are better than KLIA. Lots of places to eat/drink catering to all tastes. The bus into Sentral is a steal at MYR 9.00 and the time taken isnt much more than the train. The new train service isn't quite what it seems as you are bussed to a station to get the service. Only downside was that my flight to BKK left from Y1. After checkin I went to the normal departure area are (T) and was told that Y gates are not located there but behind the domestic checkin. Sure enough there it was but entry to the area was closed. So time for a Big Mac after which I came back and it was still closed. This irritated a lot of people who had already checked in. And there is a large notice warning people that there are no toilets in the Y waiting area.

I needed to go to the domestic side to pick up a car. Well for a start you get terminal A and B (would it really kill someone to put 'Int' & 'Dom' after A & B? Anyhow I followed the car rental signs and took the lift though car rentals were listed on 2 seperate floors with no clue why. I went to the nearest one which seemed to be Europcar (sadly no the company I was using) so back in the lift.

To do this we had to travel to the other side of the airport check-in and then re pass through security. We were inside of the airport facility but still had to go through the process of the security check.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Klaus Wy,Germany,2015-05-31,"I use this airport every 2 weeks and have done for 2 years now. In the beginning I admired how they managed to handle such a volume of traffic in a relatively small space. But now IST airport is going downhill very fast as it cannot cope with the growth of Turkish Airlines. The terminals which were built to handle about 30 million passengers annually now have to deal with nearly 60 million people each year. Same goes for the just 2 runways. I can understand that the airport staff are becoming increasingly frustrated and at times rude. Airside: Once you have reached Istanbul airspace be prepared that it will take at least another 30 minutes until you land. 3 weeks ago it took almost an hour as the plane had to fly for a long time over the Black Sea until joining the 100 kilometres long queue of other planes on their way to the final approach. Once you have touched ground you are not there yet. Taxiing takes quite some time as taxiways are often blocked by other planes and in many cases you will be brought to the terminal by bus. Also regarding take-offs delays seem to increase. It happened 2 times last month that the plane I took was on waiting position 10 to reach the runway after a long wait until starting to taxi so another useless 45 minutes being spent on the tarmac. Terminals: The waiting time for immigration is never predictable and can be anything between 2 minutes or 2 hours. Emigration is a bit faster but it is always difficult to predict as well how long it will take you. Lately queues seem to have become longer in general. Security check is usually relatively quick. The international terminal is very crowded and the food options are quite costly compared to Turkish price levels but normal compared to the usual rip-off at airports. I used the domestic terminal only once. It looked quite run-down and it took 30 minutes until the luggage was delivered. Not a good one-time-impression. In both terminals the number of airbridges is by far not sufficient which means that you will be taken by bus to and from your plane in many cases. When the departure announcement shows gates 301 - 312 you will get the ""flair"" of a totally overcrowded coach station. Ground transportation: The metro to the city centre is quite cheap (215 TL with IstanbulKart - you can get it at the airport) and runs every 6 minutes (which is not enough though between 18h00 and 19h30). The Havatas buses to Taksim are a comfortable alternative but during rush hours it can take much longer to the city centre.",NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

It is dedicated to the ""Schengen"" flights in other words flights between European countries that have signed an agreement suppressing customs between them. If you are on foot or rental car you must take the internal railway in one of the other terminals. This looks very much like a small city airport where (if you are lucky) you walk to the plane (otherwise it's a bus sometimes for ridiculously small distances). The good thing is that the baggage check and safety control are most of the time very quick then you arrive in the single hall. Although there is a lot of seating and the rotation is quick (bigger planes here are A320s) it may be difficult to find a seat at certain times. Flights gates are normally given 20 minutes before boarding but quite often less so it can be a rush. Main concerns are the food : only one ""snack"" with insufficient seating where you can have some kind of fancy sandwiches and salads and I've never have one that was good even the very limited choice of cakes is bad. It's to the point that putting a McDonalds would be a huge improvement! And the fact that even in this configuration of smaller planes no passport control they managed to have 30 min delay in our flight to Florence !

If anything goes wrong with weather anywhere not just Frankfurt this airport seems to collapse - and there is total confusion and lines with no one managing them. This airport made me finally break down and stop checking bags. Even worse though is the security lines - the area has been redone and modernized with the result that there is more space but the security people work in slow motion! After observing them go through their routine several times I think they are trained to go through a drill which has more steps than at other airports - at an incredibly slow pace.

My family flew in and out on Delta's new direct flight to Punta Cana this past week (12/28 - 1/4). Departure was fine but it's pretty hard (without de-icing debacles) to screw up a departure. Our return was another matter. A de-icing debacle caused the flight to Punta that would return us to be delayed almost two hours. How difficult is it to manage a de-icing operation? Obviously at Greater Pittsburgh it is. Our flight to Pittsburgh was on it's way and accurately tracked by Delta and flight tracker. Greater Pittsburgh should fully have known not only that it was on it's way but when it would land (down to the minute). We land and of course the gate is not ready. We wait and finally pull up to a gate. Of course there is no staff to service the plane at the gate so we wait almost an hour. Finally we depart the plane. Anyone with a connecting flight missed their flight. We go to customs. Two desks were staffed. For almost an hour and a half it takes two desks to process the plane. Stamp the passports. We then go for our bags. And surprise surprise we wait again. Add another 30 minutes. We then have to re-check our bags for landside baggage claim.

Many annoying issues however: Air France flights depart from the French Sector which is hard to find - you have to look for a small sign displaying ""Destination France"". French Sector is basically a limited area at the very end of the building. Self-service check-in hassle-free but very long queues at security - no Fast Track for status passengers; only one lane open while other screeners just kept chatting with each other.

I truly have reasons to believe that these officers are making the problems worst by delaying everybody they can.

Zurich Airport used to be excellent - things were efficient and quick. In 10 minutes one got from check-in to the gates furthest away. In the year 2000 the airport was privatised in 2003 Terminal E was opened and Terminal B closed. Around that time the airport also received a ridiculous new name: ""Unique"". Unique indeed! Terminal E which I have to use on most of my flights turned Zurich Airport from one of the best to one of the worst airports. The architecture of the terminal is dreadful (a few things have been improved over the years) and the acoustics are bad and announcements sometimes hard to understand. But Unique achieved metropolitan status for Zurich - by building an airport train just like they have in New York London and Paris! The train doors open on one side only so when the airport is busy the people getting off and those getting on get into each others' way and especially their luggage does. Getting to the gates now takes 40 instead of 15 minutes. The gents' toilets in Terminal E are one floor up. I have on several occasions had to help elderly men who were struggling to get up the stairs with their trolleys (there is no lift). At no other airport have I ever encountered something as daft as this. There are other nonsensical features including ""information"" which routinely misdirects people not used to this airport. Airport staff pass on the many complaints from passengers but management never acts on this. Because of all these ""improvements"" those ten years ago the airport charge was massively increased. In summary: Unique Zurich Airport got a toy train most other things (including check-in and passport control) were made worse and travellers pay higher fees for what they neither needed nor wanted.

The way from the plane to the luggage reclaim area does not allow rolling all the way (bad for disabled people children and cabin luggage with wheels). You need to pay for a luggage trolley (this is commonplace in the US but I've never seen in any other EU airport). The arrival hall outside the secure area is too small for the incoming number of passengers especially in winter. There is a train link to Turin but it doesn't take you to the city centre - or anywhere useful for that matter. When departing there is no food and refreshment possibility after security checks. Before security you have a small food court but only the coffee bar seems open all day. The restaurants and the other joints are closed most of the day just in case you wanted more than a croissant for breakfast. There is a huge Alitalia/Skyteam lounge despite the fact Alitalia only flies to a handful of destinations from Turin. And if you have a Skyteam Gold or Platinum card you have to request lounge access when checking in. Presenting your card and boarding pass at the lounge won't get you anywhere: you have to go back to the check-in counter queue again and get the ""invitation"". Last but not least all signs of local identity have been erased as they want to present the airport only as ""Italian"" rather than Turin's and Piedmont's. The Piedmontese flag has been removed from the check- in/departure hall and the English/French/German/Piedmontese word ""Turin"" is almost everywhere replaced by the Italian one ""Torino"".

Easy connection outbound. Although it's not clear from the airport web-site the airport people-mover is inside security and the trains (at least in mid- afternoon) run frequently. It's not that easy to find but once you do it's quick to get to Terminal B. There's not a lot of seating there but a decent mix of places to eat. Returning from Mexico we landed at gate D-1 (regional jet gate). This was a very very long walk to immigration. Fortunately we landed just before the KL LH AF and BA so lines weren't long. Then you go downstairs to customs and back upstairs to go through security again for connections. Surprisingly TSA opened an additional line. I can imagine that line can get long so it's possible it could be faster to exit customs and just re-enter security along with passengers boarding in Houston. It took about 30 minutes from arrival gate to departure gate much of it walking. Overall a good return to the US.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,3,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Directional signage throughout the airport is difficult to find and not clear. When I departed my plane upon arriving in Kansas City I was unable to find my way out of the gate area. There was no sign directing me where to go. When arriving at the airport at the end of my trip the security signs directed passengers to choose the right or left line; however the agent was partial to taking people from the right line rather than alternating lines. The gate areas have very little seating unless you want to walk and sit at another gate. The corridors in the entire airport are narrow and make it difficult to move around as you are always in someone's way. The bathrooms are lacking all around and they are filthy. There is a very slim selection of food options so the lines are extremely long and the staff rude.

I arrived from Dublin with Aer Lingus so I was fortunate enough to skip the immigration queue (as we had pre-cleared US customs in Dublin). We were lead through the airport to a shabby looking baggage reclaim used for the T4 domestic flights and the bags came quickly and I was on the airtrain within 20 minutes of arriving at the gate (a feat that not even the much smaller Glasgow airport can accomplish half the time with domestic arrivals!). My return was a similarly painless procedure. Check in had short queues (although I had arrived ridiculously early) but you do have to haul your baggage from the check in area to a separate bag drop area with visible X-Ray scanners. Appeared to be a bit of a security nightmare and you simply had to leave your bag in a big pile and the security team put it into the scanner. There are plenty of shops before security. Sadly the prices are insulting even by airport standards. $5 for a bottle of water $2.99 for a packet of crisps and $4.39 for a packet of gummy sweets. There are a few places that are much more reasonable. Sadly not enough seats available before security but if you look around enough you'll probably find some (particularly towards the A gates). Security was fantastic. There were very short queues and that was with busy flights going out to supposedly ""high risk"" areas. Staff were very friendly and helpful. There's not much though security in the B gates area but plenty of seating. Overall I didn't find cleanliness to be a particular issue. We did have a long taxi to get to our takeoff but that's to be expected with a busy airport. I'd happily fly to and from JFK again.

We were early for our Qatar Airways check in so did not experience any queues. Once through Immigration (very quick no waiting) there is free internet (4 terminals 30 minutes limit) and up the stairs there's a small cafe with reasonably priced (by airport standards) food (limited range Bangladeshi food only) if you don't mind the sales pitch to buy local confections! We paid in Taka so no idea if they take foreign currency. Duty free shops are cheap & OK and accept foreign currency. Seating is adequate. There isn't much else to do so bring a good book.

edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,Craig McDevitt,United Kingdom,2015-06-07,"Until last year I have been a frequent user of Edinburgh Airport and as a citizen of Edinburgh I have felt proud of the airport as a gateway to the world. Equally I have felt proud of the way the airport has expanded and has been an example of the progress Edinburgh has been making despite the recession. Now I think the airport has been stretched beyond capacity and I think there is now a danger that people will begin to avoid the airport and once customers are lost it is very hard to persuade people to return. The problem needs to be addressed urgently otherwise the economy of Edinburgh and Scotland will ultimately suffer. Looking at the passenger reviews over the past six months or so the inadequacy of the security hall comes in for most comment. I first used the new hall on a mid-morning in April and went through relatively easily. However I went through the hall twice in late May and both times it was a bad experience. The first time was lunchtime on 21st May for a flight to Dusseldorf. It took over 30 minutes to get through and although I cleared the process with no problems I noticed that more luggage after scanning was being shunted onto another conveyer belt for further inspection than was actually being cleared. was that necessary? I also thought that staff were generally ill-mannered with quite a lot of impatient ordering with raised voices. There was a marked absence of the word please. One person who received this treatment obviously could not understand English adequately but no one seems to have taught the security person that saying something louder does not help a non-English speaker to understand. I almost interfered and then thought better of it. How easily we learn to be afraid to speak our minds in such situations. On the second occasion I had an early morning flight to Madrid. With my experience of a few days before I arrived over 2 hours before the flight and I had Fast Track through using the car park at the terminal. The terminal was in absolute pandemonium on arrival shortly before 5am. The escalators to the security hall were not working and all passengers had to make their way up the stairs carrying hand luggage. Eventually reaching the first floor I asked for Fast Track and was told rather rudely to get in the queue like everybody else. I am 66 years old but at any age one should expect to be treated with respect and politeness. i never did get to Fast Track. The crowding was unbelievable in the security hall. Once again everywhere were the raised voices of security personnel ordering people around shouting at those who were either unable to understand or were too bewildered by the experience. Many of the passengers were visitors guests to our country for heaven's sake! This time my luggage were shunted to the side and I had an interminable wait for it to be searched. While I waited to be attended to I spoke to one of the security people who was standing beside me and said that I thought the system was terrible and asked if it was always like this. She said that she was afraid it was and that it was a disaster. Eventually it was my turn to have my things inspected. The problem with my luggage was that my iPad had been stood up on its side in the tray and I was lectured by the security person. ""How can you expect your stuff to be scanned properly if you put the iPad on its side. In future remember to put it flat in the tray."" When I explained that it was one of his team who had crammed it in sideways he told me to move along and not waste his time. As well as being 66 years old and relatively healthy I have a heart condition and try to keep stress levels low. Fat chance! By the time I got through security I had to run for the gate. What bothers me most is that my experience is only one of many similar to mine Many people have been complaining of these conditions for over 6 months. Does anyone read the reviews? Certainly there is no response. Does airport management care even though it is obviously bad for the airport itself the city and the country?

Nor did they call people in certain rows. There were two flights for the same gate 34 and people were confused about which queue to be in as no direction was given. Then they couldn't get buses to take passengers to the plane last call was flashing on the screen and 100's of passengers were still waiting to be transported to the plane.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,A Martin,United Kingdom,2013-06-10,Luton is probably the worst of the London airports in my view yet it still has its good point and I have been to far worse airports before. The biggest problem is getting there. Whilst rail services to Luton Airport Parkway are very quick and regular Luton is the only London airport to have no on site railway station and therefore requites a shuttle bus ride to/from the terminal and that can really slow things down. The drive to the terminal from the M1 motorway J10 is atrocious and frequently congested. Speaking of congestion the airport terminal gets very busy in the morning and I believe nearly half the days departures leave before 9am. The relatively compact airport can get very busy in the morning period and queue times reflect this. We had to queue for a good 20 minutes to reach security which is significantly longer than at Stansted or even Heathrow T3. On the plus side the airport is very nice if flying after 9am where queues are shorter (but still could be better) and the departure lounge is bright and spacious. There's not as good a range of facilities like shops or restaurants as other London airports but it's still not bad considering the size of the airport and you do have everything you want or need before you fly. I have also never experienced poor service from staff although I have never had the misfortune to experience it really at any airport. One thing about Luton is that I can't really see it changing or improving much in the short to medium term as it's always very samey. Overall I would not recommend this airport out of choice however I would never really advise people to avoid it either.

There is a third smaller screening across the bridge to Concourse A). Baggage claim can be a wait and seems to be getting worse.

Departure was just a nightmare. Queuing all over the airport in lines you could not identify counters used by staff that was unable to speak a single word English or German (flight went to CGN) and had to use a travel assistant to translate everything we said. Airport was horribly overcrowded. There was no space not a centimeter left. After we thought our baggage was checked in we were told to take it back go to another counter and have it x-rayed there. This never happened to me before and I have been flying quite frequently in my life. What a stupid organization. People around you were quite rushy. The security check is just a joke. I left all my jewelry and belt on had liquids in my bag but they just did not care. No one was interested we could have easily taken anything into security area. The ""gates"" are funny too. It is unbelievable how easily people manage to get out (for a walk?!) on the runway they probably search for their airplanes themselves. Flight was delayed we were not informed. There were two monitors in the whole hall one suddenly went out of order. The hall was overcrowded no place to sit very uncomfortable light no facilities to go to except for a duty free shop and a sandwich store and there was just not a single person feeling responsible for telling us something about our flight. It was not even orally announced delayed when it would have been time for boarding already. The staff controlling the tickets and letting the people walk outside the terminal to the planes seemed extremely swamped several planes were delayed by many hours there was one flight that had a delay of far more than ten hours. They were just unable (or unwillling?) to control who went outside the building. Most of the time staff was busy giving final calls for noshow passengers calling them again and again... and again.

In fairness to the airport it was only the third day of the new departure lounge and I am sure there were some teething problems. But staff I saw all seemed to be very harassed and grumpy. Going through security no-one smiled at all. I try to be helpful and have my jacket off belt off and have everything ready to put in the boxes. The chap behind the conveyor belt leant over and barked ""shoes""™ at me. Not ""please could you take your shoes off"" or anything polite like that. Just a barked word. The worst part of a Ryanair flight out of this airport is the call to the departure gate about 50 minutes before the flight departs! True to fashion the flight was called to gate 6 in the long unheated cold corridor where Ryanair passengers are herded in line. Here a female regimental sergeant major of Aviance the ground handling agent stood and barked at us all to get into line. As I lined up people were passing by me on the right. The RSM barked at them to join the queue for the Stansted flight. I hadn't heard a tone of voice like that since a teacher in my primary school told me to pay attention! The trouble was these were passengers arriving of another flight heading for the arrivals zone. An Asian family of four stopped and looked confused and another foreign gentleman stopped behind me. What a welcome to Northern Ireland! I had to patiently explain to the gentleman he did not have to queue with me as the arrivals area was just through the doors to the right ahead. This must be one of the few airports where arriving and departing passengers are not strictly separated. Quite why Ryanair force their passengers into a queue for thirty minutes before letting them board at this airport beats me. I am surprised the airport allows them since it means passengers are not in the terminal spending money! One cannot return to the good old days but I cannot help but nostalgically look back to when Belfast City was a great wee airport where the staff seemed happy in their jobs knew the regulars and smiled. Horrid though working hours and wages probably are now at airports a smile costs nothing. Most of us understand we have to be processed herded contained and controlled but it would be nice to have it done in a polite and civil way.",NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

So even with the fast line it was too long and the bag takes 8-10 min it almost had nothing inside and 2 separate lines go to one to get each and every one again checked and body search and shoe removal and they wait for everyone to take their shoes which can take a century for some. They could at least make everyone take off their shoes from the beginning and not waste time. I ended up running to go to the gate after you go through all the shops. Very stressful.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,C Fairfax,Australia,2014-10-13,Arrived mid morning from the US to be confronted by chaos. An announcement was made advising that passport processing had been stopped due to overcrowding in the baggage area. At least one self serve machine was not working but eventually found one that was and processed self only to discover that the exit points were seething with people all pushing. There was no organisation and no one to advise people where to go. Many people had got into the self service queue without the required pass and were then fighting against the crowd to get out. Why can't the airport provide cordoned off runs for this like they do at other airports? After getting to the baggage hall it was a struggle to view the inconveniently located board to see which carousel to go to. After a long wait for luggage we proceeded past a customs employee towards the exits only to be then told to return to the back of the hall and get in the line which now snaked around the whole area. I am at a loss to understand why Mr Useless did not have the customer service skills to start directing the traffic at the appropriate time. Doing so would go a long way to calming people instead of making them angrier at the disgrace that is the arrivals hall. An explanation of end of school holidays is no explanation. School holiday dates are listed 5 years in advance- surely enough time to roster staff appropriately. On eventual exit we entered a taxi line where an occasional cab arrived until we realised none were being directed to the rank by the taxi manager. We had to walk down to request a maxi taxi (of which there are not enough) for groups arriving with luggage. There was no sign or person advising that the centre cab rank was not working. Overall a frustrating end to a holiday and after experiencing the efficiency crowd control and organisation of other airports in numerous places I can only say that Melbourne is an embarrassment.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Travelled with excess baggage including technical equipment (three boxes) requiring ATA carnet. Immigration area first; strong smell of diesel. Three lines with two officer booths each but possibility to go to booth on different line i.e. possible pushing in. Officer says nothing but takes ages to inspect your passport. Never mind it's a tourist visa. Collected bags from carousels. This is a small and chaotic area with people pushing trolleys into you at speed from all angles. Then customs: with ATA carnet went to area that looked like 'anything to declare'. Waved carnet at officer. He took us directly into a staff area at end of corridor is a customs office. They (old guy and a trainee) dealt with the relevant section of the carnet checked a few items communicated in English took photocopies. Had a cover letter in Russian explaining what purpose of equipment which helped. Were told to come back to the same place exactly when departing. This was pretty efficient. Leaving from DME: Travelling from area of KUNTSEVSKAYA Metro station (i.e. West Moscow) allowed four hours to departure. Orbital motorway anticlockwise pretty quiet at 0615AM clockwise direction was already very busy and slow. Kashira highway going south east to DME also OK. So that part in 45 minutes. Possible to drive to front of the only terminal get (free trolley) and go straight inside building. All baggage scanned just inside building but this was simple no delay. Went to the left (east) end of check in area to get to arrivals showed carnet to a the first customs-looking oficer available. He waved us to the staff area to have the next section of the carnet dealt with. No queues no problem. Documents were photocopied and we were on our way. Then back to check in area (waving carnet at anyone official) checked in personal baggage taken told to go to airline cashier desk (Swiss) to pay excess baggage. Showed checkin clerk the excess baggage receipt then took the three boxes to excess baggage reception. It was scanned and we pushed into a lift and said goodbye to it. Then went upstairs through passport control/security. This was no problem either (got waved into business lane for unknown reason).

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,Jerome Vanderberg,United States,2011-05-17,"My wife and I flew KLM from Schiphol to JFK last week - the worst and most offensive security arrangement we have seen. The security check is done by a team at each of the gates prior to boarding. When the start of the security check was announced we stood in a long line and had no opportunity to prepare ourselves by emptying pockets removing jackets taking out computers etc. People standing in line finally came to the single checkpoint where a woman barked out orders like a drill sergeant to move on through quickly. The people operating the full body scanner were competent and professional. Once we had passed through security we assumed that boarding the airplane was to begin shortly. Instead we were kept for 2 hours. in an overcrowded holding pen that seemed to have been designed for cattle. The holding pen had no toilets and a single machine for selling water. I lost 3 euros in it without a bottle coming out and when I asked the KLM agent nearby she replied brusquely (without looking up) that the airline had nothing to do with the machine. A short time later I saw a Dutch gentleman go through the same procedure. I walked over to the counter where he spoke to the same KLM employee. He said that he had lost his money in the machine and asked if he could exchange a 5 euro bill for coins so that he could try again. The agent dismissed him saying ""I am not a bank!"". He was told a place in the airport where he could report the problem but came back later saying that they could not help him there. I elected not to go with him because I was informed that I would have to go through the entire security routine again and that we would be getting water on the airplane. Later on in the airplane the captain apologized for the long delay explaining that it was due to the fact that the airplane had arrived late from its previous flight. Obviously the security people knew this so it was puzzling why they rushed us through so quickly knowing that we would have to stand in the holding pen for hours before being able to board the airplane.",NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Christopher Moore,United Kingdom,2011-08-07,The decision to book with Wizz Air from Luton for bigger baggage allowance was not a good one. Arriving about 5.45am on a Sunday morning 2.5 hrs ahead of the flight dumped us in a 1 mile+ 40 min traffic queue on the approach road. Who designed the several-dual-carriageways funnelling down to one lane culminating with incoming traffic being blocked by in and out junctions to/from drop off and short term car parks? It is the most inept piece of road design I have ever encountered. How on earth did it ever get planning approval? And then to have to pay £7.50 for about an hour of short term car park to get my family's baggage dropped off was a shocker. Two thirds of the check-in desks were unused and the rest were rammed with frustrated travellers delayed by a faulty baggage conveyor. Having finally dropped off the baggage and seen people to the stairs to Security (escalators not working) I went to the loo before the drive home. Even the design of that was incompetent with narrow corridors in and out leaving people queuing although there were plenty of free facilities once inside. I have never been to a more ineptly designed airport anywhere or one which cynically rips off its customers as badly. Poor signposting coming in means it's easy to get ripped off for a £1 drop-off fee if you take the wrong turn (easily done) instead of the overpriced car park.

baltimore-washington-airport,/airport-reviews/baltimore-washington-airport,Baltimore Washington Airport customer review,K Maeda,United States,2013-06-02,"Possibly the worst airport I've flown into. Flying in I already had a car reserved but it took over an hour to get into a car and out of the airport. First you go to the car rental counter in the terminal and wait to get the contract set up. The car rentals are managed from a different building and it took 20 minutes for a bus to show up to take us from the terminal to the rental facility. When the bus arrived it was standing room only. On arrival at the car rental facility it's a fairly long walk from there to the individual pick up locations though the parking garage. No walkways just stripes to walk between. Then you wait again for a rental attendant to look over your contract and point you in the direction of the type of car you've reserved. After that debacle I determined to allow myself an extra hour to return the car and be on time for my flight. Return was somewhat better although the stop designated for my airline turned out to be incorrect because of construction. Returning the car only took half an hour from driving into the garage to arriving at the terminal. That meant I had plenty of time to make my flight so I set up my computer for the ""free"" WiFi. For free you're required to sign in again every 15 minutes. You can upgrade your service for $5 for an hour or $8 for the day. But you probably won't need more than an hour because you won't have found a place to plug in your computer or other rechargeable internet ready device. I ended up sitting on the floor next to the luggage carts because there was an outlet there. There was one other outlet I saw on the concourse but two people were already plugged in there and that was the limit. Before 9/11 tightened security and the major computer age I used to fly in and out of BWI fairly often. It was an attractive airport and close to home. Since then I've mostly used one of the two DC airports but I got a really great deal on a flight to BWI.

In such a large area with lots of customs bays only 12 were open. 8 for international passengers and 4 for US citizens. Seems to me no matter what country you are from if you are arriving back into your home country your citizens should get priority or at the very least have the same number of bays open for both citizens and international passengers. It was slow slow slow. Then there is getting your bag and going through security again which was very slow and chaotic. Extremely lucky to make it to our connecting flight with only 5 minutes to spare. The customs both arriving and leaving Costa Rica was much much more efficient and the agents were friendly. Due to the time it took to get through customs still awaiting arrival of our bags which did not make the connecting flight.

I remember queuing for 3 hours once at this airport. A real nightmare! But only Air France was to blame. That is the day when I decided never to fly Air France again although I'm French. If you have an hour or so before boarding and want to do some shopping at reasonable prices (not like those of the duty free) there is a shopping mall very near the airport ( actually within walking distance) but as there are a couple of highways to cross you must take a local bus which takes 5 minutes or so. Ask for directions as I can't remember the bus line number. When arriving the airport bus is the cheapest way to reach downtown; it takes about 25 minutes if there are no traffic jams. You'll save even more by buying a return ticket. From the bus terminal you can easily reach your hotel by subway or get a cab if you have too much luggage to carry. The bus can actually drop you a some of the major hotels which are on the way. Ask the driver. The drive back to the airport is 15 minutes longer as the bus goes around town to several hotels in the hope of collecting more passengers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Once past check in and security one enters a long corridor with some shops and eateries. One of the fresh sandwich bars looked good. Again seating is very limited. Hectic scene as travellers were making their way down the corridors to their respective gates. On the plus side a walk to the furthest gate is less than 10 minutes and wifi is free.

I imagine those people were queued for hours. There are 27 customs desks and only 5 were open so this is the reason for such slow movement. No announcements or anything were made and no one thought to open more desks. The elderly people had no choice but to stand for the whole length of time. Americans were getting put through first. The staff were also very rude; the woman in charge pointed to people and made faces at them to show them where to go rather than speak to them. When she had to speak she made it clear she was unhappy shouting 'yeah you' or 'no there' etc. It was like people being treated like cattle. The man at the customs desk was equally rude only saying 'thumb' when he needed our fingerprints.

There is no public bus to the International Terminal and don't even bother catching the one from the domestic terminal unless you only have hand luggage. The private airport bus is useful but expensive (Around $15 AUD). Once in the departure lounge there are few services and facilities and those that do exist are very overpriced.

I was really worried after all the bad reviews but had a really nice experience. I travelled economy so no fast track or lounge for me so had the basic encounter with the airport and have no complaints whatsoever. On the first leg (on a Tuesday morning around 7.30) I timed myself from the moment I stepped off the plane until I cleared security to less than 20 minutes! Lots of signs pretty clear instructions no problem. I had to take the train to T5C again nothing to worry about. On the way back coming from SFO and connecting to BRU early afternoon of another Tuesday I deplaned the A380 and timed myself again from getting off the plane (T5C) to clearing security: about 40 minutes although security was a little bit more crowded and my bag was put on the side and double checked. Overall I had a quite good experience but I can easily understand that it can quickly become a bad one when there are lots of people or when having tight and stressful connection.

Those 20 minutes were partly spent by travel to the luggage reclaim (about 10-15 minutes in total) and a bit of waiting time. My departure was okay. The only thing I missed was a dedicated baggage drop-off counter for people who checked in online. Security is tight without becoming ridiculous and the air-side is diverse despite its size. There is a big duty free shop for alcohol smokes and perfumes. Other smaller shops scattered over the departure area cater to the needs of people looking for books/magazines jewellery clothes and more.

munich-airport,/airport-reviews/munich-airport,Munich Airport customer review,B Triezenberg,United States,2011-08-03,"If you read these reviews you come to the conclusion that Munich is very hit and miss. Either it's a breezy 5 minutes or a terrible ordeal. My experience at Terminal 1 as a non EU citizen is that it is a horrible ordeal. While there were 2 lines and 2 inspectors for EU passports control there were two lines merging to one ""all other passport"" inspector. A relatively short line that would have been 15-20 mins in any other airport took 60-90 mins. The passport inspector was unbearably slow without any added security that I could determine - we were asked several questions on entry to both the UK and the US but zero questions on exit from Munich. The lack of questions just seemed to make it slower - I've never seen anyone take so long to push a passport through a scanner and apply an exit stamp. This is exit passport control and yet it takes forever just to look at the passport picture and match it to the face of the person. In contrast once we got through passport inspection security itself was well staffed courteous and helpful. Several people were late for their flights due to the slow passport control. The airport rep explained that she had no control over the passport control process or staffing.",NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
durhamtees-valley-airport,/airport-reviews/durhamtees-valley-airport,Durham/tees Valley Airport customer review,Leo Enticknap,NA,2010-06-28,I flew from MME for the first time in almost a year largely because the cost of KLM tickets to a long haul destination have for some reason become more expensive than their equivalents from MAN. This time however there was only about a £60 difference between the MME-AMS-SEA-BUR flight compared to going from MAN and I thought that was worth paying for the convenience and absence of queues that MME offers. On the outward trip at least it was. Apart from the KLM flight I boarded there was almost no traffic at all (I get the impression the loss of charter and holiday flights due to the recession must have hit MME hard) and it remains one of the most stress-free airports I've ever used. There was one irritation. The Iceland volcano business started while I was away as a result of which my return was delayed by four days. While I was away I emailed MME telling them that my car would overstay its paid-in-advance booking in the airport car park asking them not to clamp it or have it towed away and asking if I'd be liable for any extra charge. Don't worry your car is safe and no extra charge came a very quick reply. However when I did return there were no airport staff around anywhere to get my ticket validated and I had to pay an extra £38 in the machine to get out of the car park. I later wrote to the airport enclosing the receipt and asking if they'd consider refunding me. It's now two months later and I've had no reply. Admittedly this is a very minor problem compared to the volcano disruption some people experienced but given that MME must be having real problems retaining routes and passengers (not surprising given how much the cost of KLM flights from the airport have gone up) I didn't find that very impressive; especially given that the volcano disruption would have meant fewer departing passengers and thus my car was not taking up a space that someone else would have wanted and been willing to pay for.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Neil Wilkinson,France,2013-02-20,I use Liverpool Airport regularly about every 2 months because I fly to Nice and during the winter months easyjet from Liverpool is the nearest option. Considering all the changes that have taken place recently and the volume of traffic it serves I find it one of the most badly laid out airports I have ever used no sky bridges no covering when walking to plane etc. I have also found the security staff to be extremely rude and officious and the queuing time is to go through security is disgraceful. The most shocking thing to my mind is the 'Fast Track' facility where you can purchase for £4 a ticket to enable you to queue-push there is no dedicated check area for this you are simply directed to the front of the queue in front of everyone who has been waiting. I could understand the merits of fast track if the money collected funded another desk whereby by paying your money you have the benefit of a speedy transition and all the other passengers queue as normal. The security checkpoints are funded by all passengers by virtue of the money we all pay for our airfare and the money the airlines pay to the airport why then should we be expected to pay extra because the security is so slow and inefficient just get your act together Liverpool and speed up and use the money from Fast Track to improve things and not slow non payers down further.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Passengers in-transit need to go through a separate security screening and for some reason the Ministry of Justice officials refuse to put more than one team of screeners at either of the transit area security posts. This means your Airbus 380 arrives with say 200 passengers who are transiting through to other destinations suddenly appearing at a security checkpoint manned by 2 screeners. The airport was designed for multiple lanes but for some reason the Ministry doesn't use them. In my case we had the full gamut of angry passengers crying babies people needing to use the facilities but unable to leave the line and the inevitable missed flights because of 1 hour long transit security lines.

However I must say it's probably the worst airport I've been to when it comes to departing. I arrived at 9:30am to check-in; probably fifty people were waiting in line to check in - but apparently the check-in for Air Berlin doesn't open until 1000? I wanted to sit and read while waiting for my flight but learned that security for my gate wasn't supposed to open till 11:00AM - actually employees arrived at 1100 to get ready; it didn't actually open till 1120. So I had about two hours before going through security and could find neither a place to sit down nor good food options. Once I made it passed security I encountered a relatively tiny somewhat dirty waiting area and a tiny little food stand. At most airports you have many food/drink options beyond security; this is not the case at Tegel. I guess my review doesn't matter much as this airport will be closing within the year.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

I regret to say that judged by the experience of myself and my wife on 2 trips through the airport this year drastic action needs to be taken to even begin the process of 'mission accomplished' - particularly in the areas of effective staffing security procedures reduction of queues staff training and customer relations. On 27 March at 11.50hrs we arrived at bag drop (2hrs before departure) having checked in online and then spent the next hour or so going through the queues at security. The x-ray scanner for some reason detected a problem with my cabin baggage (after 12 mins wait I was told it was my camera and after another 7 mins or so I was finally cleared without explanation or any word of apology). Staffing appeared inadequate and uncaring as to the needs of customers. We had no time for a coffee or to go to the toilet before boarding. On 7 June we had a repeat performance. Having arrived at terminal 1 at 04.45 (2hrs before departure) once again we spent the entire time before boarding waiting in security queues. This time my wife's cabin baggage was chosen for a random check (passed ok) and mine for search again apparently because it contained a piece of soap in a plastic soap box (perfectly allowable). The security officer did not go to the soap straight away but at a snail's pace opened and took out all my various pills and other items before declaring on opening my washbag that it was the soap causing the query. She could not adequately explain why the scanner/scanner operator should find a piece of soap problematic and I said that I did not believe her explanation (she had just reopened my wash bag for the second time!).

Security staff were polite and efficient (despite me forgetting I had an MP3 player in my shirt pocket). In order to check-in at the gate we had to squeeze past a long queue of other passengers with our wheelchairs down a corridor and then reverse the process to get back to the accessible ramp down to the aircraft. The outside queuing areas for normal passengers looked cold and drafty and we were held at the foot of the aircraft steps for around 5 mins waiting for the crew to allow us to board. It was dark and windy but luckily dry. On return we were again met by PRM staff and fast tracked through Border Control and into baggage collection without any problems. Would agree with comments about the general dingy feel of the apron areas and the outside queuing areas but for us the process was generally okay.

vienna-airport,/airport-reviews/vienna-airport,Vienna Airport customer review,Paul Evans,NA,2006-09-05,Flew to Vienna recently and the terminal seems to have been improved in appearance since I was last there 5/6 years ago. It is confusing to step off the aircraft into the departure lounge but the adequate signage soon directed us to the baggage reclaim - quite a walk. The overhead screens indicated which carousel our bags would appear on but they never did. After some head scratching we found our cases in a pile with about 20 others in a corner of the arrivals hall. Both were damaged but we had no idea where this had occured as we had passed through several airports during the day. One redeeming factor was the information/tourist office in the arrivals area where the staff were excellent and seemed genuinely pleased to welcome guests to their city. They gave good information regarding the options for travel to the city centre and in view of the damaged luggage we took a taxi at 28 Euros and travelled in a spotless Mercedes estate taking less than 30 mins to our hotel. We returned on the CAT train which is non stop in 16 mins from the central Wien Mitte station but is a bit pricey although better than the S Bann if travelling with a lot of luggage at busy times. We had none of the problems with checking in or passing through security that have been highlighted by others but that may have been due to the early afternoon flight we had rather than a peak time departure. However security is carried out at the gate so it is a good idea to get to the gate in good time rather than hang about in the departure area shops. There are no refreshments once you pass through security but there are toilets which are useful in the event of a delay.

However despite the fact that Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines there is nothing overly impressive about its airport. I arrived at CEB on a domestic flight and was quite surprised how desolate the terminal was. This was in stark contrast to what was waiting just outside. For a flight of 60 or so people it seemed like the whole city of Cebu was waiting to greet us in the ""welcoming area"". I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only Cacuasian around but never once felt threatened by the smiling faces of Filipinos. I was immediately greeted by a sonata of sales pitches as taxi reps competed for my business. I gently waved them off since I was waiting to meet my friend. They were persistent but not obnoxious. The availability of transportation is not a problem at CEB but you will need to learn the art of negotiation to avoid being charged unfairly. Thankfully my friend is quite skilled in these matters and we never had to pay an elevated fare. A few weeks later I left from the international terminal at CEB for a flight to HKG. I don't remember much about my actual impressions of this terminal since I was contemplating a heartbreaking goodbye to my friend. However I do remember that the security line was not long at all and the entire process of getting my boarding pass and clearing customs took about 15 minutes max.

There was an Air Canada rep lurking around the US Customs area to make sure that Air Canada pax were taken care of. Security was also slow inefficient and surly as others have commented.

The main problem is queuing on arrival one queues for visa (if necessary) and then to have it checked for immigration (an hour in my case). On departure you queue for security before you enter the building (a few minutes) for check-in (about 15 mins in my case but by the time I got to the desk the queue was about 4-5 times longer than when I joined it) and then for emigration and a second security check. Fortunately a friend had advised me to arrive at least 2 hours before departure I endorse that. I recommend the metro and tram to get to the city centre the price is a tenth or less of a taxi or the shuttle bus and the time is about the same given Istanbul's traffic. Be aware it does require a change if you have a lot of luggage and also there is not a metro/tram stop near all hotels but if there is one it is a reliable and cheap alternative.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I read so many bad comments on the internet that I literally lost my sleep on my last night in Warsaw Fryderyk Chopin trying hard to hide my feelings from my wife as we were celebrating my birthday. Our flight was at 6am so we arrived at the terminal at 03h45am. We stood in a long but disciplined queue. After 30 minutes we checked in. Reasonable waiting time. We then dropped our suitcase as we were instructed to do and proceeded to the departure hall. A bit small to handle so many passengers but not suffocating. Shops opened at 05h something. Bought water and soft drinks plus two sandwiches. Though expensive (13 to 15 zlotys each) the food was delicious. We departed on time. Bottom line no drama! We travel a lot and have been through different situations. And Etiuda was by far not the worst. Taking into account what we saved by flying Norwegian I found the terminal ok. The airline very ok and reliable too. Just be there well ahead of time that's all. Or fly another airline and pay double or tipple. The choice is yours!,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,M Steinfeld,NA,2009-05-26,"Dulles seems to be an airport in transition at the moment. There are construction projects all over the place but I'm confident that ""new"" Dulles will get things right. Once the new AeroTrain opens later this year things will improve greatly (mobile lounges - which we all hate - will not be used much for one!) and then passengers will be able to enjoy a brand-new spacious security and transit mezzanine in the Main Terminal. It will take a while before the permanent Terminal C/D is built (keep in mind that the current building is temporary and has been that way for over 20 years now) so unfortunately everyone traveling on United (all mainline flights + some Express flights) Air Canada or Ethiopian will have to live with outdated facilities for now. Also it will take some time before the new International Arrivals facilities are finished. If you're arriving on a Star Alliance carrier (and are connecting to another flight) you'll be able to experience the newly-remodeled FIS. For everyone else sorry but you'll have to wait for the brand-new International Arrivals Building. Many people don't understand about the international arrivals process and often complain about it (see many of the comments below). Know that the process is not regulated by Dulles but rather Customs and Border Protection. Everyone must clear Passport Control. The US government says that you need to be cleared through passport control you must claim your bags before continuing on and you have to be screened at a TSA security checkpoint. It's just policy. I do agree that Dulles isn't the most efficient airport in the world - there are plenty of issues there. It sometimes takes forever for non-U.S. citizens to clear Customs it sometimes is a breeze. It all depends on how many officers are working when your flight arrives how many people are in front of you in line if there are any extraneous issues the airline/ airport must deal with etc. Until the facilities are improved the most you can do is schedule a longer layover at Dulles (i.e. more than 2 hours for an international connection; domestic connections aren't bad).",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the delay in baggage delivery on arrival into T5 from Manchester transfer between terminals 5 & 4 and so called ‘fast-track’ security was a nightmare - taking almost 3 hours lost in total. The lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (Sri Lankan shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used – very spacious and relaxing environment plus excellent attentive service with good quality regularly refreshed buffet food (European and Asian).

We arrived on a flight from Houston, and were met with a backlog of about 1,000 people attempting to pass through Customs. An airport employee explained that this was the result of a number of flights arriving at nearly the same time, but an airline employee later told us this is a common occurrence at YVR. We attempted to use the automated Customs entry equipment but even with the assistance of an airport employee the equipment would not properly read our passports, and would not read our immigration card at all. When we attempted to locate our connecting flight, in the absence of adequate signage, we followed the directions of an airport and an airline employee, and spent over an hour in a line-up with other incoming passengers, only to be told by another airline employee that we should have gone elsewhere. As a result of these delays, we missed our connecting flight, and were booked onto a later flight. We then proceeded to airport security, where we encountered a very slow-moving line of several hundred other passengers. As a result of this delay, we missed our new connecting flight. We then spent about 7 hours attempting to get on several flights to our destination. When we finally did reach our destination, Air Canada had directed our luggage to the wrong city.

I was iffy about flying American Airlines to begin with, but knowing how their main hub of an airport is, I will never be visiting again.

Certain terminals are very nice with nice restaurants and waiting areas, while others are the underground tunnels of construction and uncleanliness. If coming through this airport be prepared to walk to anything and everything. The tram system is nice, however, the restaurants and gates can be up to a 10 minute walk away. When departing to our destination, we once more taxied on the runway for 20 minutes with a full flight and no little to no air-conditioning circulating as it was 95 degrees outside. When coming into Dallas for the layover returning home, seconds from touching down, we suddenly began to speed up and take off into the air. After 5-10 minutes after being in the air, the pilot came on the intercom and said the runway had traffic, and we are circling around. After the commotion of the flight, we waited around for our next fight, and never realized until 10 minutes prior to boarding that our gates changed to a completely different terminal. Lastly (there is no surprise to this one), we had to wait around 15 minutes for Dallas to transport half of the missing luggage from the other side of the airport.

We allowed a 4 hour layover so all relatively painless except the last minute Gate Change from C terminal to A terminal - just to keep the passengers on their toes and awake presumably. Returning from Savannah 13th October we then had the usual interminable walks through various buildings and up and down miles of escalators before collecting the baggage (which did arrived relatively quickly). The only problem was the signage to where we then had to go to check in with BA for our flight home - a very grumpy man at the Information desk eventually grudgingly told us the right direction to head. Check in at BA desk a breeze security queues minimal and Terminal B actually a very quiet and pleasant place to be for a glass of wine before flying home. Perhaps because it was Columbus Day. Would I recommend Dulles? I suppose as much as I would recommend any US Port of Entry or Departure - some are bad and some downright dreadful (Newark Chicago LAX Miami etc etc). Do allow plenty of time if you are transferring flights - we allowed 4 hours and got total peace of mind. And none of them are particularly good but Dulles was as painless as anywhere. My own personal opinion is that ANYONE who manages or is going to design an International Airport should be sent to Changi in Singapore to see just how it should be done. But all in all not too bad.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

No certainly not I would say. No walking area no decent shopping area no waiting area no transit connection to other terminal. Real ugly architecture (floor with covers every few meters narrow gate exits looking like foxholes narrow escalators confusing ways for transit passengers (up down up always crowded and one cannot walk past other slower passengers. One feels like in cage always everywhere. Stay away. It's clear passengers prefer to transit in Munich or Frankfurt - much better airports.

Completely agree with previous comments on the lengthy queues as the airport failed to deal competently with the Monday departure of about eight flights to the UK. Passengers on our flight (Jet2 to Manchester) suffered the added frustration of being advised by the display that the aircraft was boarding at its expected time. Passengers passed through passport control only to arrive at the jammed departure gates area for British flights and eventually be told that the aircraft was not even at Funchal having diverted to Porto Santo. Clearly nobody thought to override whichever computer thinks that the airport runs smoothly every day.

sao-paulo-guarulhos-airport,/airport-reviews/sao-paulo-guarulhos-airport,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport customer review,P Lord,United Kingdom,2012-08-24,Unfortunately I travel through this airport up to 4 times a year which I thought might mean I'd get used to it but not as yet. Very few places to buy food and what food that is on sale is very expensive even by international airport standards the seating areas aren't great and if you have to spend an extended period at the airport then you're well out of luck if trying to find somewhere a bit more comfortable to sit. The signage and flow between international and domestic flights and domestic to domestic flights is slowly getting better but it's still quite poor especially as the country is due to host the football world cup and Olympics. Aesthetically the building is drab with no natural light which gives it a generally depressing feel. Transport links from the airport are ok buses located outside the terminal and a taxi company has a desk outside of each terminal - not sure why it's outside the terminal but don't bother looking inside as you won't find anything there. Difficult to pre-book a taxi through the local airport provider as nobody seems to speak English. If travelling back from the city to airport on a Friday keep in mind that traffic is horrendous and the journey time can be up to 3 hours as opposed to 1 hour in off peak traffic. Within the last 2 years an information desk has been put in a more prominent position within the airport and they now even have some staff that can speak English. I sometimes case my mind back over all the airports I've ever flown in to and try to compare Guarulhos airport with all the others. Maybe I haven't travelled enough but as yet Jo'burg international airport back in 1997 is the only airport that compares with Sao Paulo in terms of general shabbiness.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

In all fairness they are trying to modernize it and by the look of the sketches of the proposals it should turn out to be a quite respectable place. In the meantime no airbridges so all passengers deplane on the tarmac. It's thrilling to stand so close to those huge behemoths or even drive next to one but still after a long flight waiting on a bus for everyone to deplane is not my idea of fun. Immigrations is a mess - for some reasons all flights arrive in an hour and a half span. The hall is a temporary one (and it shows) and it gets so overcrowded that sometimes they leave you stranded in the bus waiting until there's enough space in the hall - just to queue. Once queuing the lines are so long that it took me an hour and a half just to go thru. Once you pass customs into the arrivals hall it's throngs of people it feels like the whole town is there - so much people it overflows the terminal hall. Of course you get hit with a wave of hustlers peddlers and just plain greeters - really stressful situation. A brawl broke out amongst taxi drivers just for my business. The cops had to come and my party just fled scared to pieces. Departures are no less friendly. Check in to flights take forever (especially US bound ones) lines are never-ending as well.

Then, all the US passengers who were transiting to another flight had their passports confiscated for about 4 hours while we were basically paraded from one spot to another in the airport, finally ending up in a cockroach-infested office of the army officer who took our passports in the first place. Eventually they were given back to us, with no explanation, some 45 minutes after a member of our captive party complained to someone at the Emirates lounge.

kuwait-airport,/airport-reviews/kuwait-airport,Kuwait Airport customer review,Mark Stableford,Kuwait,2015-07-10,"This has to be one of the worst, most confusing and incompetent airports on the planet.  Departing, there is not one single check-in hall, but four - each at completely different ends and corners of the airport. You can only get into two of them from the outside, while the other two are burrowed deep inside where you would not expect them, each of them again at different ends of the airport. It is completely confusing and time consuming to find where to check in, involving walking in and out the building (bearing in mind its 50c outside) and across large distances through what looks like a refugee camp. It takes many visits and missed flights to eventually get some idea of the layout and check in process. If you do manage to check in, you then have to encounter a myriad of incompetent, slow and lazy barriers from security through immigration. If your boarding pass is printed on a piece of paper instead of cardboard, you will be sent back to do your check-in all over again. On arriving in the country you can spend hours trying to get through immigration along with teaming masses of other poor souls (South East Asian migrant labour) with people running between queues as one is closed whilst her majesty there takes a phone call, wanders off to the toilet, or just simply closes up her booth having lost interest. You can end up at the back end of a queue again many times doing this. The airport completely lacks any signage or common sense. Asking for help or information is a pointless waste of time. Nobody knows, or nobody cares (unless you are lucky enough to find an Indian or Philippino member of staff), but then they are almost always completely powerless to help. Its also filthy. Unfortunately it sums up almost Kuwait infrastructure and management.  What a contrast to places like Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Worst of all, this was not too many decades ago the most advanced and progressive country in the region. What a absolute shame. 0/10 is all this miserable horror of an place deserves.

providence-airport,/airport-reviews/providence-airport,Providence Airport customer review,Michael Wiggins,United States,2012-06-26,"(June 27 2012) As a frequent user of the Providence T.F. Green airport (PVD) I will say that the airport is a true four star facility. While it still is a small airport by most standards it has a surprising number of plusses that as has been said by others to be a reasonable alternative to Boston Logan (BOS) but only if you are flying within the US (no international arrivals or departures except to Toronto). Upon entry into the departures area the ticket stands are almost all within the same distance from the entry doors to the terminal. You don't have to hike a mile to get to Southwest and 10 feet to American like many other airports do. TSA security is also right there so one doesn't have to hike for that either. The TSA crew does their job well but they get backed up during the 6-8 AM rush. After TSA the main passageway is quite wide and is always clean. It is set up so when you leave TSA you are located dead centre in the passageway (equidistant to either end of the terminal) so there's not as much walking to do. There are plenty of concessions. Signage is good. The seats at the gates are what I would rate as not bad not terrific. Upon arrival the walk to the baggage claim is good with a ""detour"" that keeps the arriving passengers to not have to deal with departing passengers. Waiting for your luggage is longish sometimes but good overall. There's even a Starbucks in the baggage claim area! There is now a connecting passageway that takes you to a train station that is served by the MBTA (important: weekdays only! With any luck this will change in the future.)

International - newer building - just . Bag and body search - 20 mins to negotiate emigration - then a further bag scan - full body search - THEN to an officer who rummaged in bag. pulling items out at random ! - Bussed to Gulf Air Plane - on getting off bus yet another body search and bag search by the aircraft. A little overkill i think . On arrival in Muscat some 5 hours later I looked in rucksack and realised that I had inadvertantly packed a bottle of shower gel and toothpaste - both were not allowed - and were not noted by the three searches.

This was totally untrue as our friend in the next queue had 1 clear bag but had left her makeup bag in her cabin case. She asked if this needed to be removed the member of staff said ""no that's fine it will be okay""! So totally conflicting advice and obviously depends on the person you get.

Been here numerous times and not impressed. Sure it has its fancy expensive shops to make revenue but what about the people who want to sit down? Here's why I gave Heathrow 0/10. 1. Not enough seating areas - simply unacceptable. 2. Uncomfortable chairs - when the airport gives its passengers delays after delays at least provide comfortable chairs. Ever seen reclining chairs or free massage chairs in Singapore? 3. No trolleys - this one just blew me away. What if there are some pregnant/elderly or even just want some weight off your shoulders after a 13hr flight (like me 4 days ago)? Sorry not at Heathrow. First airport that I've seen that doesn't have trolleys. 4. Delays - this is bound to happen and I understand that. But if I can predict that I will have a delay that's sad. How did I predict? Well on a perfectly fine day without snow fog heavy rain wind etc. On the departure gate screen there were about 75% flights that were delayed. It seemed that the longer haul were taking off without delay but within Europe everyone was getting delayed. Then to make matters worse they decided to tell the passengers that the plane have ""not arrived yet"" when it was standing outside the window the whole time. 3hr delay with the plane there all along. Why? To fit 3 different flights in to 1. Again I understand that sometimes they have to do what the have to do but what I don't understand is why were 75% of all flights at Heathrow delayed? Why did everything have to be so disorganized? I felt extremely disappointed and its a shame that in my future travels I will try to avoid this airport at all costs even if that means paying for a more expensive ticket.",NA,NA,NA,NA,2,4,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The attitude of US border officials is nothing short of disgusting. While we had a pleasant stay in Miami we will never go back to the USA and risk experiencing this type of treatment again.

To get there I had to exit Terminal 6 cross several streets that are full of traffic and catch a shuttle bus to get there. Then the TBIT is so old that part of the check-in area is being rebuilt resulting in long lines. The seating area is so small that it only provides half the seats required for a full 747. And the best part is the restroom. They are totally disgusting and look like they are cleaned once a week. However my arrival experience was a bit better. The arrivals of the TBIT have been renovated. Immigration took nearly 20 mins. but baggage arrived very quickly. Overall a very disgusting airport. Tom Bradley should be growling in his grave.

The new terminal is very welcoming well planned and organised. It was good to see Irish language signs and to have a sense of arriving in a wonderfully welcoming airport. I found the use of art work and the theme of the 'gathering' to be very nice and both professional and sentimental. The airport seems to employ a lot of non-Irish people some of whom are very surly and let the airport and indeed Dublin down. The catering facilities are rather good but it is a puzzle that staff have a poor command of English. At a time of high Irish unemployment one would like to see Irish people employed rather than those with poor English and a bad attitude.

paris-orly-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-orly-airport,Paris Orly Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,NA,2010-01-30,"I often use ""Orly-Ouest"" terminal for French domestic flights and my experience is quite mixed depending on which boarding halls I use. Hall 1 is mainly used for medium-sized destinations (with turboprop and Fokker aircraft) and is my preferred one - security checks are usually quick boarding area is bright with sufficient seating areas. Hall 2 is dedicated to LaNavette shuttle flights to Bordeaux Toulouse Marseille and Nice - at peak hours waiting time at security can be very long and the boarding area is cramped. Furthermore as LaNavette flights run every hour or even every 30 minutes it can become confusing and difficult to locate the right boarding gate! Hall 3 uses only departure gate 30 for domestic flights - no need to rush through security as tha gate has only toilets and no other facilities. Hall 4 is used rather for tourist destinations with larger aircraft (A320/A321 to Biarritz Toulon and Corsica) - the boarding area gets crowded rather rapidly and the small bar has rip-off prices. ORY is much closer to downtown Paris than CDG but is unfortunately missing a fast and reliable train connection. Avoid the Air France coaches and the OrlyVal train which charge rip-off prices - around €10 one-way. The OrlyBus shuttle is cheaper but is always overcrowded. My preferred alternative is to use the RER C suburb train: first catch a shuttle bus from the airport to the train station ""Pont de Rungis - Aeroport Orly""; from there a RER train run every 15-30 minutes to downtown Paris.

Customs stops everyone and even the Japanese show their tickets. Foreigners are usually searched thoroughly without exception. Customs officials are often monoglots. Bureaux de change require travellers to fill a form to list the currency they are exchanging. Signs within the airport are often in Japanese only. Airport restaurants treat non-Asians like little green men from Mars. The restaurant menus are mainly in Japanese only. The Airport bus ticket machines show destinations in Japanese only. Bus drivers are monoglots. No wonder hardly any tourists go to Japan. I was lucky. I speak Japanese.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Usual long queues at Immigration but nothing out of the ordinary for non US citizen visitor. Real pain was at Customs with 4 double lines snaking through the hall. Only 2 eventually 3 officers on duty who now seemingly check your passport as well as collecting the customs forms - why - this at least doubles the time taken to process passengers and causes long delays at peak times. Do the Management at Houston not understand that they are losing revenue as customers no longer have time to spend money on food and drink in their airport and frustrate customers who maybe struggling to connect with outbound flights. I used to allow at least 1.5 hours for transit through US gateways looks like this is now more like 2+ hours if you are lucky. I hope someone has told the airlines and that they have re-programmed their computers to account for these excessive delays. I will now have to look for direct flights where ever possible Houston we have a problem.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0
nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,Jim Wood,NA,2007-08-14,I have traveled into and out of Kenyatta over the past 4 years and have found the experience palatable. They try but the best thing is not too spend too much time there. Not modern by any means; shops are plentiful but tend to be limited to liquor (including Tusker!) chocolate and tea and coffee. Food has improved. It can be crowded for evening departures. The lines to get in can be long especially for evening flights so allow yourself 3-4 hours. Once past ticketing (everyone has to check in at the ticket counter) it fairly fast. Immigration and customs are quick and friendly. Remember that rush hour in Nairobi runs from 8-10 in the morning and 4-8 in the evening and traffic is VERY congested on the way to and from Kenyatta. I would be close to the airport if I have a flight anywhere close to rush hour. Any little thing can bring traffic to a halt and add hours (yes hours) to the trip.

darwin-airport,/airport-reviews/darwin-airport,Darwin Airport customer review,Christian Hodson,NA,2005-07-04,I have made frequent visits to Australia both for business and pleasure over the last ten years although in April I made my first visit to Darwin. I arrived domestically on a Qantas flight from Adelaide and there were no complaints - hardly any distance to walk from the arrival gate and relatively quick baggage delivery. My international departure to Singapore however a few days later was a different story. Check-in takes place for all flights domestic and international in a very small terminal area. There were two check-in staff servicing a fairly full A330-300 aircraft and although we arrived a good 2 hours prior to departure we had to queue practically outside the terminal building and by the time we arrived at the desk we had about twenty minutes to get through immigration and security. As a result the flight had to be delayed. Qantas international departures use gate 6 I think at Darwin - three immigration officers were on duty for the whole flight which I find to be completely unacceptable. The gate area contains one duty free shop / cafe and has seating for about 80 people at best - I can imagine a huge delay here to be purgatory. The upside of the airport is that it is only 5-10 minutes from the city centre by car and would probably have to rate as one of the best landings into an airport in the world for scenery but they need to get one or two things sorted particularly the international flight departures before it can be regarded as being a great gateway to a fantastic Australian city.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The security staff simply do not understand that BA's Club Europe is Business Class and try to refuse entry to fast track. This is even more surprising given that only Turkish Airlines Swiss Lufthansa Air France and BA operate from and to Basel as proper international airlines and surely it cannot be that hard to learn their business class products. This has been happening for the last three - four months now. The airport facilities are extremely poor.

tokyo-haneda-airport,/airport-reviews/tokyo-haneda-airport,Tokyo Haneda Airport customer review,Anand Diwakar,India,2011-06-12,Have used the new international terminal recently for departure. The airport operates international flights between 2300 to around 0600 (when Narita is closed). There are some flights to/from Taiwan Korea and China throughout the day as well. The terminal is modern clean and beautiful. Monorail and limousine buses offer good connectivity to the airport. However these transport modes are not available after late night. Last bus to airport is around 2200 and from airport is around 2230. So if you have a flight early morning you must reach airport by 2200 and wait or should use a taxi. One weird design flaw which is not expected in a place like Japan is the way you arrive by taxi or bus. You arrive at the terminal at ground level. However departure areas are on 3F. When a bus load of people arrive at a time you end up in a queue at the elevators. Escalators are useless as most of the international passengers will have luggage and will use trolleys. To add to this when I arrived one elevator out of 2 was closed to save electricity. Not sure how things work for arrivals. Check-in is speedy. 4F has very beautifully decorated shop and rest area. The area is designed like old Japanese town street with wooden facades and lanterns. Has a good variety of shops and eateries. Beware most will be closed after 2300 though. I guess as the passenger traffic will increase these facilities will start staying open in the night. 5F has a very good and big open viewing area. Enough benches to rest and vending machines if you need drinks. Good place if you want to do some airport/aircraft photography. Spend as much free time in these areas at 4F/5F as there are not many shops once you clear immigration. Got down to 3F again to clear immigration and security. Both were breeze. Staff was friendly and smiling (as anywhere in Japan). Not many shops at this side of the building but enough area to sit and wait for boarding.

Located in a beautiful setting of gardens and palm trees and overlooking the Baie des Anges a few other airports can boast such an exceptional location. The terminals are very compact and rational though Terminal 1 is now showing a little bit its age and doesn't offer many shopping possibilities. Soon anyway there will be a new extension to Terminal 2 and I'm looking forward to see the amenities this new facility will offer to passengers. The airport is very close to downtown and you can actually access it in 5/10 minutes by taxi. If I have to mention an inconvenience well that's the schedule of the direct bus to the city centre - if your flight lands in Nice after 10.30 pm - and there is quite a number of flights arriving then - you'll be possibly waiting the bus for 45/50 minutes as it's only running at hourly intervals then.

On both occasions getting through security was an absolute disgrace. The organisation in this area of the airport simply cannot cope with the volume of people trying to get to the final departure area.

On arrival we spent many minutes cruising round the edge of the airport in a transfer bus eventually got to the transfer gate the fast transfer lanes were closed but no queue at all at normal-speed lanes so no problem. Arrived at departure gate as it was due to open admired once again the confusing way a flight disappears from the gates display screen list as soon as the gate is opened. Our flight was delayed so we hung around for half an hour. They don't make announcements about delays over the PA because it is a 'quiet airport' (no-one told the lady who was using the PA to tell us not to smoke). Suddenly the gate was open we moved forward but great efforts were made to persuade us to sit down again to avoid an unsightly queue but we resolutely kept standing and submitted ourselves to the first of 3 back to back ID checks. Got to the gate itself (check number two) and down an escalator to a tatty ground floor area waiting for access to the transit bus two of which were parked by the doors. The escalator continued to bring more and more people down from upstairs. Still no exit was allowed to the bus. A man struggled through the crowd with a key. It didn't fit the door lock. The escalator had been turned off by now to stop people tripping over each other at the bottom. The man tried the other door. An ironic cheer went up as the door opened. Time for our third ID check and on to the bus which then didn't leave for a few minutes even though it was obvious more the one bus would be needed. We set off on another extended tour of the airport perimeter and arrived at the foot of the aircraft's steps.

The renovations are of a significant size causing passengers to walk extremely long distances to reach airline lounges. Why couldn't KLM position a lounge closer to the D/E gates? (Or is this yet another way of saving money by assuming that a significant number of passengers will not bother or have the time to hike halfway across the airport to find the downsized facilities?).

When we finally got to security, they had only 3 lanes open for all the thousands of travelers. All of the personnel were moving incredibly slowly, as if intentionally trying to ruin everyone's day.

Unfortunately that led to some people on the plane then missing their connecting flights and having their days ruined even more.

It is probably one of the worst designed ""new"" airports in the world. It is one big shopping mall with airplanes a long way away. The check in is chaos unless your in Air Asia's business class but if your doing a connecting flight you still have to go through customs and drag your bags to be checked in for your connecting flight and if your flight is many hours away you can't check in early to get back into transit to use the transit hotel. You can't stay in transit if you can get to transit for more than 10 hours so if your connecting flight is say 12 hours you have to stay in the country side of customs I believe this is all planned to get you to shop in their giant mall. Going from arrivals to departures for connecting flights is mostly a mystery as the signs are confusing and sometimes the moving stairs don't work and the elevators get jammed up with baggage carts. I had to go through three security checks. At Singapore Airport they check at the gate! Wise up Air Asia! The gates seem like miles away and you have to walk 99% of it.

la-guardia-airport,/airport-reviews/la-guardia-airport,La Guardia Airport customer review,A Johnson,NA,2007-08-08,The airport is close to Manhattan though the lack of a direct connection to the subway is a glaring omission from what is otherwise a comprehensive transportation system. I have always been able to check in and clear security very quickly though there are often long queues on the tarmac for takeoff given the fact that the two runways cross meaning that departing aircraft need to wait for arriving planes to land. Airside there isn't much in the way of facilities to keep you busy while waiting for your flight. There are four separate unconnected terminals (many of which are further divided into piers) all of which have their own security controls. If you happen to connect through LGA (which is uncommon since it's primarily an arrival/departure airport) you will likely need to clear security and in some cases (e.g. mainline Delta to Delta Shuttle) have to take a bus to the entire other side of the airport.

taipei-taoyuan-airport,/airport-reviews/taipei-taoyuan-airport,Taipei Airport customer review,B Ho,Singapore,2015-04-19,Have been to Taoyuan International 3 times in less than 2 years. Every time I have had bad experience at the departure hall. To be fair their immigration is quick and efficient. Although the queue can be pretty long they clear up very fast. However the check-in process for baggage is simply ridiculous. As with most airports Taoyuan do not allow batteries in checked-in luggage. However their checking process is simply illogical and very time consuming. After checking in the luggage we are instructed to stand in front of a monitor to ensure that our bags clears the x-ray machine. This is also ok as it is a good way to ensure that batteries are not in any checked-in bags. However their set-up is unable to cope which resulted in long waiting time and many frustrated passengers. Here are their issues: 1) Their single lane conveyor belt and xray machine obviously cannot cope with the volume of a full flight. 2) There is only 1 person at the x-ray machine. Once a baggage is flagged the entire scanning process stops until the flagged baggage is checked. What made it even more frustrating was witnessing the x-ray machine person went about looking for masking tape to reseal a box she had opened to inspect it's contents. That held up the scanning process for another 10 minutes. All in all the check-in process took 70 minutes. Actual baggage check in took 30 minutes and standing in front of the baggage TV screen took 40 minutes.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It seems SAS has entered an agreement with Aeroflot to use the terminal but at the cost that bag drop is unavailable until a strict two hours before departure. The difficulty is that road traffic to and from Sheremetyevo is notoriously unreliable and can take three or even four hours one way.

The parking is still convenient though the best offers are no longer by the airport itself but that's almost all that can be said in its favour.

It feels terrible having to just dump friends at the roadside pay £2 for the privilege of doing so and then panic about getting out. 15 min from driving in and out is not enough to get people out of a car coats on luggage out and then say goodbye few days later I get a bill in the post saying I had overstayed my 15 min and a fine of £80. Currently arguing the point as my clock & watch say I was out of there before 15 min. Feels like they are desperate to rip off all people passing through the airport maybe from trolley hire VIP security express boarding etc. I'm surprised they haven't starting charging for using toilets yes. I've spent 13 years travelling and working all over the world I've never had the same terrible feeling of being conned as I did after going into Luton.

Terminal 1 is old dark and gloomy - last time I was there there were signs saying that the building works would make it 'one of the top 10 airports in the world!' Terminal 2 is marginally better being newer but facilities are very poor (one coffee shop around departure gates) seats are uncomfortable PA is risibly incomprehensible both in English and Portuguese thanks to dreadful acoustics. On arrival you'll be hounded by illegal taxi services before walking out onto broken down sidewalks. The only way to avoid it is to enter the country via GRU in Sao Paulo - arguably worse.

Being disabled with breathing problems I had asked for a wheelchair from the plane. I had flown in from Goa via Mumbai and had no problems and so much help until yet again I reached Heathrow. No wheelchairs and about a dozen or so people waiting for help. Eventually some buggies came and I was told the chair would meet me at immigration. How wrong that was. From there I was left to struggle through immigration baggage reclaim and customs. I asked why the chairs were not there and was told they don't have enough and couldn't find any. At least it was better than last time on the 25th February. Then there were no wheelchairs or trolleys and they couldn't find them as they were all outside.

I prepaid for long stay parking usually insert credit card entering insert credit card on leaving and away you go. Now take a ticket on return from holiday your ticket MUST be verified at the extremely hard to find 'information' desk.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,Peter Clarke,United Kingdom,2013-09-11,I am a frequent flyer and pass through Manchester at least once every month on business. Unfortunately I depart/arrive via Terminal 3. Departure has been a nightmare for many months now and the fast track takes longer than the normal queue. Staff simply do not care (or there is no one on duty) and people move freely between the normal queue and fast track. I departed there on Tuesday 3rd Sep and it was just the same. Arrivals is even worse as quite often you arrive at the same time as other flights and the queues for immigration are horrendous. On Friday 7th June I arrived on a flight and we disembarked at the far NE end of Terminal 3 to be immediately met with a queue that stretched as far as the eye could see (I photographed the queue being careful to capture the '2010 travel awards winner' proudly displayed on the wall) (for those of you that don't know the terminal the immigration control is in the centre). Unfortunately there was also a queue from the far SE end of the terminal and they had precedent over our side so we had to walk from the NE end of the terminal to the SE end and then join the end of that queue. There must have been four flights queuing. There was one immigration officer dedicated to Foreigners and max 3 for UK nationals. It took one hour to pass and I'd been travelling for 24hrs already that day. I came through again in July and August and had a similar but not quite as bad experience having to wait only 15 and 20 minutes respectively. The terminal is simply not up to the task of handling the volume it passes through. There are no automated 'chipped passport' scanners. Then once you get through immigration you have an equally frustrating wait at baggage handling. I wrote this review because the issues are long standing and show no sign of improving. I'm looking at either changing carrier or airport as Liverpool is only a few miles further away. So be warned if you plan to use this terminal. On the plus side when I go on holiday it is usually via terminal 1 and there I have no problems.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

This airport should be avoided if you have any choice or option. Arrival was at 3am from LHR very long walk to old terminal for immigration although both immigration and baggage were quick and cheerful. Outside the terminal is a complete zoo. No easy public transport. Luckily we had a driver. Transit involved a 4.5 hour change from international to international flight. We were met off the flight by airline staff who did not identify themselves as such until asked then placed in quarantine in a locked area with two other transit passengers. The only facilities were a water fountain and a dirty toilet with no paper. The staff took our passports boarding passes and luggage receipts. To my relief they did come back an hour later with new boarding passes and luggage tags and let us out of the locked area. It did all work in the end - we made our connection and our bags arrived at LHR - it just wasn't very pleasant Facilities at this airport - food shopping wifi toilets and lounges - are all minimal or poor and anywhere from unclean to filthy dirty.,NA,NA,NA,3,4,1,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0
newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,B Marcus,United States,2013-07-23,I have been using this airport for many years now and I am starting to dislike the place. Departing from Terminal C was a little bit of a hassle going through the Premier Access line for security. I waited over 20 minutes. The two United Clubs were a little worn and I feel they should invest money to renovate them. I also made some observations while I was walking around the terminal before my 16 hour flight. Terminal C especially C1 and C2 are starting to show its age a little bit and almost looks like a dirty bus terminal. Luckily I didn't need it but the United Customer service lines were massive with about 200 people on it and only one customer service agent on duty. The dining options are Not bad. My worst experience was coming through Terminal C International Arrivals. My flight came in on time and everything was going well until I saw the massive immigration line that took over an hour. There were three major flight that arrived and there were only 4 immigration officers on duty while there were at least 20 empty booths. I got my bags and the customs line took 10 minutes. As I was leaving I made another observation The United Transfer desk line for connecting flights was just as long as the immigration line. People in line were actually sitting on their bags. There were literally only 2 agents helping over 300 people. Luckily Newark was my final destination. Based on what I saw any connection less than three hours is a really tight connection. Maybe even three hours isn't enough. I always used Newark because there were hardly any lines and it was easier to use than JFK. TSA and United should really strive to improve their operations at Newark because over the past year it has been progressively worse.,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,NA,2008-11-05,Recently went through MAA for an international flight for the first time in a long while. The interior is still rather drab much like the Indian airports of yesteryear but the airport is much less congested than Delhi or Mumbai. Upon entry signage for the baggage screening machines (i.e. which one to use for your airline) is poor so you end up having to guess. Immigration counters were well-staffed and took no time at all and customs no longer goes out of their way to harass you like they used to 10 years ago. Shopping/food is dreadfully limited inside the terminal so if you need something to eat try the small food court outside the departures entry gate (the Anjappar restaurant serves decent local fare) or the restaurant on the second floor between the international and domestic terminals. The best thing about MAA is that unlike BOM or DEL the domestic and international terminals are next door to each other so if you have an inbound/outbound domestic connection it's a short 5 minute walk over - thus saving you from getting harassed for tips by the touts running the terminal shuttles or getting ripped off by the taxi/auto drivers.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The security and hand luggage check area is like a cave (it is so dark) and is very muddled before and after you go through it. But what a difference when you enter the duty free and waiting area - bright and well organised space. We flew into the airport on 23/08/2014: in the ladies toilets there was one door with a broken lock and another toilet was out of action. It did not smell very fresh either. We seemed to be the only arriving flight as there were no other passengers going through passport control or baggage reclaim yet it took 15 minutes for any luggage to appear even although there was quite a delay in anyone being able to exit our plane after landing.

I experienced delays in both my inbound and outbound flights so I got to see a lot of the airport. Immigration is a major hold up since they are very thorough at checking and have few staff. I went through the gates 6 times and each time spent over an hour in the queue. The departure lounge is small. but with plenty of seating and an excellent view of the apron and runways from the observation balcony upstairs. There are a few shops and a money exchange kiosk that changes money at the exact rate ie. it doesn't charge commission. There are two bars serving food and drink but this being Cuba the food selection is limited. I was there for 3 days and all they had was cheese and ham rolls for the entire time. Overall it's a pleasant enough place for normal transfers but you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time there.

lagos-airport,/airport-reviews/lagos-airport,Lagos Airport customer review,Rod Matthews,United States,2013-04-18,"I travel on a rotational basis so I am in this airport up to 12 times per year. The reputation described by others does exist but there are times it's better than others. The only thing consistent about it is that the routine is always changing when coming through immigration. ""Stand here now go over there. Come back here."" The immigration officials are either pretty much clueless or they do this for a reason. Luggage can be a painful process but even when I have had a bag not arrive with me (went to Port Harcourt on Lufthansa as part of a continuing leg for that plane) I did eventually get it back. The biggest issue is what you do outside the airport. Nobody helps for free and nobody is friendly for free. When departing if you are early you can go up to Abibi's which is on the 2nd floor and visible from all check in areas. It's expensive though. Going through the process of getting out is hit and miss. The airlines I've flown with have been courteous and professional. Fast tracking through immigration is nothing special.

After waving farewell to your luggage you go upstairs through security which on the face of it is quite good Boarding card check point - yes hand baggage and body scan - yes Passport Control - hmm there was a roller shutter door open between the scan area where you could see through to the departure lounge which was cordoned off with the sort of barrier posts and tape used for queuing in your bank. Duty free is average until to come to pay for your items. After standing in a queue of about 15 people for what seems like half an hour you present your purchases to them which they present to the barcode scanner from many different angles to get it to scan they then ask for your boarding card which has a lovely neatly printed barcode on it ripe for scanning - do they scan it? Of course not they continue on with their one finger typing hoping they manage to input the correct details. Whatever you do please do not try to pay with a combination of your left over currency and your plastic - this throws them into utter confusion. The departure gates were obviously designed when air travel was a rarity and planes only held 75-100 people. They are small cramped and with very little seating - you will end up sitting on the floor in the main departure lounge like some homeless refugee in a displacement camp. When your flight is called if you're lucky you will be able to walk to the plane however in our case we were loaded on to a bus driven by the star of the local rally scene who drove at full speed pulling tight turns to get us to the plane - make sure you hold onto to your luggage and small children tightly.

When you're flying out (especially international) make sure to arrive as early as possible during peak season. If you're flying outside of the main tourist season you'll be okay if you arrive within the time recommended by your airline otherwise make sure to give yourself an extra hour or so. Be as courteous as possible do not act entitled and be careful when questioning the authority of airport officials. This is generally a good guideline for flying anywhere in India. People working at the airport will be happy to return the gesture if you go out of your way to show them some kindness. Arriving in India for the first time can be pretty stressful but I've seen the process become downright awful countless times as other westerners get held up because they acted contentiously at a checkpoint. If it takes you 90 minutes to get into Kochi you need a new driver. Granted Kochi is big but without traffic it takes only 20-30 minutes to get to Lulu Mall which is in Edappally.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Do not let the tiny size fool you though; security was absolutely out of control bordering surreal absurdity; even with my Amercan passport with no questionable background or former travelled countries they just could not comprehend why a single man would take a day trip to Eilat questioning me over and over and then giving me a full-scale strip search and not even allowing me to take my wallet (!) with me in the plane.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,J Crickson,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,We were on a connecting flight from Izmir to Istanbul to Uk 18/02/15. We had to circle a few times as it was snowing in Istanbul we landed on a runway not cleared of snow! Waited for the flight to UK they called us and bussed us to the aircraft. No snow clearance was evident at all it was only ankle deep and fresh snow not compacted ice so fairly easy for snow ploughs shovels etc. We boarded but unfortunately could not take off because of poor weather (not the airports fault). We got back into departures which was absolutely heaving we were not given any information and were left to fend for ourselves. The problem for us is the system stated we were flying because we boarded without cancelled flight status you cannot re book another flight. This took about 5 hours! We then had to question in essentially what was a scrum at Turkish airlines desk. There were the queuing lanes which most people adhered to but lots pushed in at the side by the desk and the 5 staff who were helping allowed this to happen and assisted the people cutting in. We eventually got re booked for the next morning. We figured out (again no information) that for the airline to put us up in a hotel we needed to go to the hotel desk. The desk was situated outside the airport beyond passport control but you could not go through passport control until you got a photocopy of your passport. There was total lack of order system or control at the area identified for photocopying. We eventually got a copy of passport so could go through passport control to hotel desk. So far we had been 7 hours trying to ticket transferred and out of the airport to the hotel desk. Back into the chaos in departures to try and bed down for the night hard marble floor and metal seats no blankets very limited water and dry sand which supplied-the lack of information and any care was frankly astonishing. In the main the staff were incredibly rude and did not really want to help. When we finally found an area of floor to sit we expected to see a hive of activity fritters snow ploughs etc-after all there was less than a foot of snow. In the 36 hours I was there I saw 1 gritter and 2 snow ploughs. From beginning to end it was utter chaos. Very poor organisation and information so poor that it was totally unacceptable.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

charlotte-airport,/airport-reviews/charlotte-airport,Charlotte Airport customer review,J Oriole,United States,2014-05-05,Living in Philadelphia I always feel annoyed that I have to change flights at CLT to get to almost anywhere in Latin America on US Airways. That said it's very convenient if your flight arrives at concourse D (a number of PHL-CLT flights arrive at concourse D as they continue on to international destinations) as all international flights depart from concourse D and it's very convenient. If your flight arrives at any other concourse expect a really long walk. However my latest arrival at CLT was anything but convenient. There's a lot of construction going on in the customs and immigration area and confusion reigns with even the staff not really understanding where anything is. The Global Entry kiosks are still right at the entrance to the hall but for some inexplicable reason instead of letting Global Entry passengers exit through the lane closest to the kiosks they are now directed to join the huge line of passengers waiting for the other lanes and then directed all the way to the other side of the hall where the exit for Global Entry is covered in black plastic. After pointlessly waiting over half an hour to exit the scene in the baggage claim and customs area was just as chaotic. After finally emerging from customs and directly into the baggage re-check-in area I totally forgot that I needed to check in the two bottles of wine I had purchased in duty free before I rechecked my suitcase. Luckily I hadn't got too far but by the time I returned to the counter my suitcase had already disappeared into the bowels of the airport so I then needed to check in my carry on bag with my wine.

The airport has a variety of resturants that are very reasonably priced and the food is excellent. Access into and out of the airport is easy. Parking is great with a well lighted attached parking garage. The new arrivals terminal which was recently completed is huge and baggage retrieval and rental car pick-up is a breeze.

The queuing system for arrivals (passport check to security with the escalator) is totally amateurish and unacceptable - it is much too cramped poorly designed and there are at least 3 waiting points. The amount of staff required to control passenger flow is above normal the security queues block passages to other queues because of lack of space.

panama-tocumen-airport,/airport-reviews/panama-tocumen-airport,Panama Tocumen Airport customer review,Brett Armstrong,Canada,2015-06-25,"I've only transited at Panama Tocumen, but it's a pleasant breeze. The airport is being renovated a bit and that helps.  I swear there's chunks of the terminal where the wifi and aircon don't reach - but you can walk to any other part easily where it's more comfortable. Security is a bit odd, I haven't had to go through but you all have to recognize different countries require different things. Panama has it's own regulations, USA has it's own and other countries etc. When you fly from Canada to the USA, you have to take off your shoes. When you fly PTY-USA - shoes off. What's the big problem? They're just enforcing rules in place. I love not having to transfer my bag, or clear customs when making a connection. It's so easy. The Copa Club is pretty decent for those with access and for those without, there's not a lot of places to go, but plenty of places to sit. There's a lot of duty free shopping and electronics deals to be had. My biggest complaint about Panama Tocumen is the price of food. It's all in USD, so that's fine, but why is a Quiznos combo $11 when at a regular Quiznos it would be about $7? So unless you're transiting and going to be there a while, be prepared. If you're showing up from your hotel or whatever, eat first. Not sure why someone said there was no bathrooms after security. That's false. There may be a line, but that's possible anywhere, it's no worse than anywhere else. There's lots of bathrooms.",Transit,25-06-2015,Solo Leisure,7,3,4,3,NA,3,5,3,NA,1

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,Alan Gebhart,United States,2015-06-26,"We were First Class passengers flying through LHR on our way to Athens from IAD. I have transited or arrived in LHR more times than I can count, always on British Airways. This was the worst experience ever. My traveling companion had forgotten to remove two small liquid containers from his luggage to be scanned separately in a plastic bag. Although we were in the FastTrack line, we were shunted off to a secondary screening line where the hand baggage of individual passengers who did not somehow pass the screening were sent. The gentleman at the head of the line said he had been there for over an hour and had already missed his flight. There were a number of other people in line. The secondary screeners were rude and unprofessional, and the process was vastly over-complicated. Security is a necessity, but efficiency is also important. It appeared that each individual compartment in any hand luggage that had some sort of violation had to be swabbed, and the swabs read. There was a single person doing this, and the line kept getting longer and longer. A supervisor came over several times but left after a few minutes, doing nothing to remedy the hold-ups. We finally were cleared after almost 90 minutes in this line. The offending liquids could have been removed, put into a separate tray, and the offending liquids and bags could have been resent through the screening machines. This process is often used in other airports when there is a problem with hand baggage.

Arrival at the newer domestic terminal was similarly painless.

On my outbound easyJet flight to IOM check-in was swift and staff were courteous the much maligned security was swift and I even managed a humorous exchange with the staff. Sadly the return was poor by comparison. We were late arriving from IOM but I noticed only one Ryanair and two other easyJet aircraft on a very empty apron. Even so we were parked in such a way that (we were told) we would have entered the terminal - through a nearby door - at the same time and point as some international passengers which would mean going through customs and passport control. Instead we waited quite a while for buses to ferry us round to the Domestic entrance where our aircraft could have been parked anyway!

I was there on a saturday recently for a flight to Edinburgh and people were having to sit on the floor everywhere because of the sheer volume of passengers. I also find the shopping airside woefully inadequate and the fact the departure lounge has no windows whatsoever I find somewhat claustrophobic after a while. However if you fly on a quieter day it's a great place and so easy to get to and leave from and luggage is out in no time.

I had to queue to use the men's toilets which is almost unheard of anywhere. Showers were entirely useless as they didn't provide towels soap or shampoo.

We waited over 45 minutes being fifth in the line for a one minute process! Just before us a person cut into the line and then the immigration officer spent five minutes arguing with them before sending them away. Ridiculous! At least there were taxis waiting as we walked out. On the return we waited 30 minutes for the counter (Air France) to open only to find yet another problem with our tickets that took 45 minutes to resolve-and then we were lied to by a supervisor about it when he acted like he was doing us a favor just by giving us the seats we had ticketed a year prior. The flight was delayed and there was no place to sit other than a hot humid non-air-conditioned open air space right by the smoking area a few feet away. There was only one snack bar with limited offerings and too many children who were not being properly supervised by their parents. It was like a 3rd world country.

islamabad-airport,/airport-reviews/islamabad-airport,Islamabad Airport customer review,N Lazaredes,NA,2005-11-30,This is one of the most irritating airports I have ever been for a capital city gateway. Arrivals on an emirates flight from Dubai was efficient albeit using buses to the terminal followed by a slow sometimes torturous process of being checked through immigration. Each passenger seemed to take 3 minutes to process and there were over 100 people. The bag conveyer was extremely slow to progress to our bags so we had to endure the double irritation of waiting with the passengers from the flight which arrived after us until they had collected all of theirs. All of this at 2.30am. Customs was a matter of loading bags through ancient x-ray machines but we were waved through to the green channel. Outside was bedlam but with people to greet us we felt better for having survived the enduring entry process inside the airport. On Departures first comes the security check as soon as you enter. These guys don't have much of a sense of humour. Then you are allowed to check in. After this you through 2 security checkpoints before you reach the transit lounge. Expect these checks to be intensive. The departure lounge is barren - a lonely shop sits in a corner calling itself duty free but has all sorts of odd bits and pieces inside that it looks like more of a quaint village shop or a stall at a school fete. Passengers are expected to sit for two hours in this dismal hall but at least there is a tea and sandwich lady who comes around to sell you something to eat and drink. After this stint in the Islamabad isolation cell passengers are herded once again onto badly air conditioned buses for the trip to the plane.

karachi-airport,/airport-reviews/karachi-airport,Karachi Airport customer review,Karl Uebanks,NA,2003-09-10,KHI was built about 6-7 years ago and is still a clean well run and manageable airport. Arriving passengers are quickly processed through immigration and there is a separate line for foreigners which is quite short. Baggage arrives quickly and trolleys actually work. All bags are x-rayed and then passengers can leave the airport. Since no one but employees and ticketed passengers are allowed inside the terminal the breezeway outside is where the Asian experience truly begins. Touts taxi drivers and a myriad of people with no discernible purpose mill about. Hopefully you have a hotel meet-and-greet and you can leave quite easily. For departing passengers once you enter the terminal things are quite civilized as only passengers are allowed inside. All bags are x-rayed and there are several additional security screenings. Check-in is usually quick although outbound immigration queues can be longish. There are shops selling duty free but I would suspect that prices are fairly inflated. CIP lounges are sub-standard with limited food and beverage selections. Without fail staff are polite and helpful. Even security personnel though armed to the teeth are professional and courteous.

Each instance at CDG was an unhappy ordeal that left me spent and breathless. Sparing the details the words asanine and ludicrous best describe the layout and navigability of this facility. There was little in the way of courtesy at check-in desks and security with some instances of outright rudeness. I did however encounter one kind woman an employee who was helpful along the way. Personally I will avoid transfers at CDG in the future. If you must transfer at CDG I suggest allowing yourself a minimum of two hours between flights preferably longer. CDG was the only blight on an otherwise pleasant travel experience with Air France and Finnair.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It really is the way forward and makes the trip to LHR (for short haul) a waste of time. Improvements to the terminal have been most welcome and baggage is often ready for collection as you arrive in baggage claim. However the bar prices are eye watering (£4.30 for a beer!) and car parking the most expensive in Britain (£120 for three days) so take the DLR at £1.50 to Greenwich.,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On our return however the security queues were extremely long and the staff surly at best. My gripe was they expect you to take off your shoes and do not provide anything for you to wear. When I questioned this I was told why should we provide shoes? You know you are coming to the airport you should wear socks! It was 96 degrees outside socks were the last thought and normally airports in Europe supply them. Once again airport staff seem to be untouchable in attitude and service and we are at their mercy in order to be processed to travel.

Whilst it is a large and roomy airport it still seemed cramped. Staff were at times rather surly and the lack of English language skills a bit shocking. Immigration can take a while with the visa process not well laid out. It's a bit frustrating that there are so many security checks: to enter the terminal from outside prior to passport control at times prior to nearing the gates and most strange: when transiting from one international flight to another. You need quite a bit of time between flights even when your trip commences in IST. Facilities are nice; plenty on offer and prices are comparable to other airports. Good catering at food courts. Non-airline lounges are very nice especially the CP Premier lounge.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

In Frankfurt, both times I passed through on the 8th and again on the 21st July, the woman who inspected me was rude and pushy. In addition to this issue, because I needed assistance between flights, my family and I were transported from one airport section to the other, with most staff seemingly confused over what to do with us, security staff were rude when we passed through the second clearance, and we nearly missed our connecting flight to Marseille.

Presumably this is to remind is that no matter how much inconvenience and expense the tram in Edinburgh has cost us it is still not over.

The range of shops is small and predictable - a couple of overpriced ""luxury"" stores a tax-free store a news- stand stocking two-day-old foreign newspapers and an uninspiring cafe.

bordeaux-airport,/airport-reviews/bordeaux-airport,Bordeaux Airport customer review,David Hodge,France,2013-09-19,Bordeaux is our nearest airport and Gatwick is our usual return destination. So we have a choice of British Airways or Easyjet. The BA flights times are not great Easyjet's are better. Depending what offers are on the prices are often comparable. Unfortunately I took an Easyjet flight and had the extreme displeasure of using the Billi terminal. A cattle-shed basically - although under EU directives I don't think you are actually allowed to treat cattle as they do in the Billi terminal. The length of the queue to check-in was dire. Then queue number 2 is joined to deposit luggage (for which I paid you to handle for me Easyjet) at the scanner while some idle layabout sits and watches. Indeed he only got animated when a surfer dude put his board through and it gets to the right angle turn at the end of the belt. Anything over a standard suitcase is going to get stuck. (There is an oversize luggage belt back in Hall A). Then I can only echo the waiting with 6 seats available. Easyjet what have you done? I presume this cattle shed is to reduce costs that is Bordeaux Airport charges them less to handle the planes luggage etc. It is a bad mistake. It is dreadful. I am afraid you have now driven me to British Airways. I expect to check-in my bag and see it again in London. What next? I have to go out and load it on the plane too?

No sales taxes in Oregon makes everything more attractive.

It is a fairly basic airport and the architecture is pretty unimpressive. However it is one of the most efficient airports I know. Luggage is normally delivered within 15 minutes from arrival and one can be in the centre of Milan in 15/20 minutes provided there is no traffic. I also like the fact that the parking area is next to the terminal and one can be in the check-in counter minutes after parking. Its downside is the lack of amenities the cramped spaces and the fact that on international flights you are whisked to the plane in a bus which is too small and always packed.

Don't even bother with a bus. Couldn't find one. Not a good idea to take a bus that time of night anyway. The airport is very third rate and this was confirmed when I returned 7 days later to catch an internal flight. Automated check-in which you had to do was hell. They don't do counter check in. You're not allowed to check in your bags until you've done automated check-in. 4 days later I was back at the airport to take a flight to London. Internal arrivals and international flights is a good ten minutes walk. The whole place is under construction so it's a building site to say the least. I was at the check- in desk 4 hours before take off no cafes nothing. There was nothing to ease your waiting. Business desk opened as stated but economy wasn't going anywhere. After check in tried to find the business lounge through the building site. When I eventually found it what an utter disappointment and judging from the faces in the lounge there was a universal agreement. The lounge is not fit for purpose. Tiny and cramped. There were a couple of showers crammed into the little lounge and using them wasn't a nice experience. Door being rattled the whole time with people trying to get in to use the toilet. I saw successive people trying to use the mains power for their laptop and surprise surprise hardly any of the sockets worked. Food was very much a token affair. I've never left a business lounge to wait at the boarding gate an hour and a half before take off before but that was better than sitting in that awful lounge. The departure gate waiting area was even worse. Another building site. Silly me to expect world class airport amenities for a city that's to host world cup and the Olympics. So let down.

As we previously had visited the USA, had a valid ESTA and a machine readable passport we were able to use the passport machines. Quite straightforward and my wife and I were able to get clearance in the same transaction. A little tricky getting our finger prints in the correct position on the scanner. The machines printed out a form which we handed to the immigration agent. A few brief questions and a passport stamp and we were through. This was much the quicker route than traditional queuing. Bags arrived promptly and 30 minutes after getting off the plane we were standing at the taxi rank. Some airport hotels don't send their shuttles to the international terminal so we took a taxi to the Hampton Inn College Park. About $15 and well worth it. The alternative would be to take a shuttle to the domestic terminal and then wait for a hotel shuttle. A most pleasant arrival, we were having our first beer in a restaurant 60 minutes after arrival. Departure - Dropped off our car at the central rental centre. A shuttle bus took us to the international terminal. The bus arrived after 5 minutes waiting - but it was small and some people were left behind. We arrived at the terminal 3 hours before our flight at about 7pm and no queues at the BA check in desk and security was very quick. Didn't do any shopping and went upstairs to the food court. I cant say I was impressed. An expensive restaurant and 4-5 fast food outlets. Similar to a shopping mall but twice the price. My recommendation is to eat before you get to the airport if you want a good meal at reasonable prices. Fortunately, we were able to use the Club lounge.

T3 is a bit of a hassle and security takes a while but I always use the speedy queue. The thing that makes the difference is people who know what they are doing at security. Terminal 5 is very quick and you can go from club world or first desks straight through to the Concorde lounge almost instantly. Travelling with family to Newark NJ was very easy. It's the airlines that can make or break a journey and every single American airline that leaves Heathrow is appalling. Coming back into the UK is usually quick if you are a British citizen.

hanoi-airport,/airport-reviews/hanoi-airport,Hanoi Airport customer review,Ian Liversidge,Singapore,2014-04-21,To be fair this wasn't as bad an experience as I expected having read many of the previous reviews. Arrival was a little chaotic. VOA desk is not well sign-posted between the application and collection counters which caused much confusion for many people standing in the wrong place. Once handed in the VOA took only ten mins to process although that was because we were off the plane first and at the front of the queue. Immigration and baggage collection were smooth and we were through the airport in about 45 minutes at the most. Departure was very smooth. Hardly any queue and through immigration and security in minutes. Yes the airport is showing its age with not too much in the way of facilities after immigration. Although there are a few gift shops duty free and snack outlets. As many have said not enough seating so I guess a problem at peak times?

salvador-airport,/airport-reviews/salvador-airport,Salvador Airport customer review,A Hijmans,NA,2008-05-16,On the whole SSA is everything you'd expect a medium-sized airport to be. It's spacious well- signposted and safe. Check-in is usually fast (except for charter flights to Europe) security is fast and friendly domestic arrival also fast and efficient. The one major problem at SSA are the long queues at customs in the afternoon when several international flights arrive pretty much at the same time. If you don't carry a Brazilian passport expect to stand in line for over an hour. There are just enough shops and food amenities. SSA is still (thankfully) first and foremost an airport not a shopping mall.

There was only one person most of the time checking in the flight who was spending a ridiculous amount of time in each passenger.

We queued for 2 hours only to be told they couldn't check in our flight yet as they weren't sure how late it was going to be - yet why did the staff patrolling the queue not announce this to anyone? This situation continued over the several hours we eventually spent queuing at check-in over the next 20 hours. No organisation skills at all. Also as might be expected in Switzerland all food and shop prices were astronomically high (and it's not because you're paying for quality - €20 for a cheeseburger meal at Burger King for example!).

I eventually found someone and explained to them that I had a connection to make and as the queue was taking so long to move that I would more than likely miss my flight. They were rude and totally disinterested and told me that there is one queue. After eventually getting through passport control the luggage had not arrived as there were electrical problems getting it off the plane this was announced via at annoy system. Again no staff around to advise passengers who were all travelling onwards and panicking about missing their connecting flights. I did miss my connection.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Rosemary Eldousoky,Qatar,2011-10-29,I live in Doha and use the airport frequently. The most common problem is the lack of seating or space for travellers. The departure queues are the least efficient but customer service is great at the counter. The problem we have experienced is knowing where to go for the check-in process but staff are very hands-on and get travellers in the right queue. Signage could be better. I never experienced any issues through security and immigration staff are wonderful. The food places located in the terminal are usually very busy with a lack of seats and there are lines for food. The currency exchange booth is generally busy. The baggage return is hot and cold. When I returned from Egypt we waited over an hour for the bags to be distributed. After an hour I went to the baggage office and complained because incoming flights after ours had received their bags. After I complained bags started to be distributed one-at-a-time. The smoking rooms are available and relatively clean with air vents. Restrooms were clean with service assistance available. The bus transits are long but usually very efficient.

I used to live in Denver so when I was scheduled to transit through DIA enroute from Atlanta to Sacramento I decided that I would have dinner at a restaurant in the main terminal that I used to eat at. When I lived there the upper level in the main terminal was part of the secure area - now it isn't. I came out in the main terminal and realized that I was outside the security area.

Terminals 1 and 2 are pretty good with a good selection of shops if you're into that kind of thing. Terminal 3 is always a disappointment to me seems to be lacking in restaurants and somewhere to get a drink (unless you find a table in the almost always packed central food court). T1 and T2 have lounges that I can access so a plus there the Wilmslow lounge has fantastic views. If you avoid the busy central area in T1 which is always full of lager louts on a stag trip to Benidorm the terminal has some quiet spots at either end of piers B and C also the toilets just left before the 'walk-through' duty free are usually quieter and cleaner than the rest. Lots of complaints about security on here but I always find it a breeze even at peak times if you're patient and prepare (don't decide to rumble through your pants for change/phones/wallet just before you get to the scanner you've had 10 mins to prepare!).

berlin-tegel-airport,/airport-reviews/berlin-tegel-airport,Berlin Tegel Airport customer review,J Moff,Germany,2010-03-30,Tegel was built to be an airport of short distances - so at least at Terminal A (which is the only one I know) the walking distance from the plane to the taxi is 30 meters - including passport control baggage claim and customs. The same is for departure: The security is right next to the check-in and after passing it you face the gate. However there is no space. The queues in front of the check-in can be a real obstacle if you need to get past them. Furthermore after the security check you arrive at a small waiting area for only two gates - small means there are enough seats but at best only one small shop selling drinks. So if you are early at check-in and fancy a coffee it is better to first visit the coffee shops in the main hall rather then going directly through security. One big plus is the public transportation: Even at late evening every ten minutes a bus is leaving to the city and the ride takes only 15-20 minutes - with the ticket costing not more than about 2 euro. If you are departing from Tegel for the first time you should mind that the system might be a bit uncommon to you (every gates has its own check-in security and waiting area) so be there in time. But as soon as you know it you can make use of it leaving the hotel only 60 minutes before take-off.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,A Meyer,United States,2013-12-03,We were told to arrive 3 hours prior to departure and believe me it was needed. The airport wasn't designed for long lines (pre 9/11) in mind meaning that you go from security screening to the ticket machines (good luck with those) to the passport control hall. This deserves special mention. The hall is too small with too few agents. You enter from above and are usually held at the top of the stairs to prevent people being fed into the breach like cattle. The guards move slowly and there is too little focus on the non-euro zone folks so there will be open positions but they are in the euro zone area so to speak. Once past there (call it 45 min) on to the security check point. Here you will find everyone being shunted through two or three checkpoints despite there are six available (unmanned of course). The only bright moment here was we were traveling with our children and were led to a separate family position where it was shorter. This probably saved us 20 min. Then on to the dash for the airplane. My wife decided to stop for some shopping I gave her the boarding pass. At the gate I was told that I needed my passport and that we all had to board together. My wife shows up and we all pass the check-in gate not 10 feet away we are asked again for our boarding passes. When we finally get on the bus to the plane I was speaking to another passenger he said it was the most baroque system he's ever encountered. I would have to agree. So when they tell you 3 hours plan on 3 hours. With regards to the workers themselves they seemed to be polite etc no issues there. The restrooms were as clean as any I've seen in an airport.

Queuing times and parking are beyond a joke. You can get a 2 hour flight from Europe and then queue for an hour to get through immigration. Last night there were just two personnel on passport control at Immigration arrival! The parking for pick up and drop off is worse than Draconian. If you want to pick up someone the only place you can stop is the Express drop off and pick up or if you are lucky enough to find one open the Short Stay car park. The former costs £2 for a 10 minute window but you can't leave your vehicle to look for someone! Then if you go over 10 mins they charge you £2 per minute! Yes £2 per minute. Bearing in mind the queues to get out (see above) this makes pick up virtually impossible. If you realise there is a delay and leave if you come back within 30 minutes you get fined Â£20.

The security checks to get to my CX flight took 45 mins with the plane leaving late due to more passengers being caught up at security. This was mostly due to a recent secret EU review which enabled secret staff to get explosives and weapons easily through security on every second attempt out of 50!

Held on the plane for 15 minutes. 20 passengers all with connections to make locked outside the airport. We then sprint to passport control and it takes 4 checkouts 10 minutes to see my wife and I. With 15 minutes left informed that because of a mix up our bags were not sent to our next flight. We had to run back to collect them. By the time we arrived at the counter our flight had departed. The checkout man then had the cheek to ask us why we only left 45 minutes to make our connection. We were informed by 5 different staff members that this means we would be 1st to get a seat on the next flight. This wasn't the case though. Given boarding passes for a 17.45 flight direct to JFK gate 8 we were on the system for gate 9 to Miami at 17.25 (this was the 1st we'd heard of this). We could catch a connection from there. So with 10 minutes to spare off we run to gate 9 to explain the situation. Gate 8 phoned gate 9 and it turned out yes we were meant to be on that flight. By the time we finally we arrived at our hotel in New York we'd been travelling for almost 14 hours.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
islamabad-airport,/airport-reviews/islamabad-airport,Islamabad Airport customer review,John Anstis,NA,2005-10-15,Things must have got better since July 2005 certainly from a public relations point of view. I found the staff and my fellow passengers very friendly there was little in the way of queue jumping and there weren't any mechanical faults with the luggage conveyors. I'd agree that the Rawal lounge is worth spending the little bit extra it costs to use  if only because it's the last call before you start your long journey proper and you may as well be comfortable as you face the seemingly inevitable delay in boarding times. The new airport will be a welcome addition to the city because this airport is tired and lacking in the sort of facilities that would normally be taken for granted in an airport of this size.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,Thomas Beale,NA,2006-05-19,Both domestic and international airports are reasonable in my view for most aspects of travel. Checking in when travelling interstate on business is very fast with the modern machines. The real problem is the airtrain - it is becoming non-existent. The last train is at 19:30 and it seems that the service has been downgraded to about half-hourly even around 6pm the time I last went out to the airport 2 weeks ago. There are flights coming in way past this time and the service needs to be every 15 minutes to have any hope of being used. And it is too expensive. In general the transport situation at Brisbane airport is a complete disaster. Due to the limited usability of the train most people are still in the mode of being picked up or dropped by family members to avoid the huge taxi fares especially from the west side (I did it recently - $55). The traffic out there is out of control. This is a joke - no other modern city I have been to in recent years in Australia western Europe and even the US has such poor transport options from its major airport.

tokyo-narita-airport,/airport-reviews/tokyo-narita-airport,Tokyo Narita Airport customer review,H Lee,South Korea,2013-06-20,Transferred through Narita airport arriving from the US and heading into Korea a few hours later. Passed through immigration to enjoy the landside. Has a notorious dysfunctional layout. I was unlucky to encounter the worst case scenario departing from Terminal 1 but having to taxi to runway 16L. As a result the taxi time itself already was over 20 minutes. Except for that the facilities are mostly quite well maintained. Spotlessly clean. Plenty of places to dine and shop. Convenience facilities like shower rooms also available. Carts free wherever you go. Free wifi also available. A spacious observation deck. Not many people speak decent English. Another rather big disappointment involves the never-ending queues at immigration and transfer desks. My impulsive decision to hit the landside was made when I arrived at the transfer desks with so many people that they were not even able to stand in lines. Immigration was not much better but at least in a seemingly interminable line for foreigners. Despite the efforts of the officers to divert some people off to the counters for Japanese nationals it took over 30 minutes just to pass immigration. Another minus 2 point for this. In conclusion a very well-maintained airport with professional people running it although some issues regarding the terrible layout long queues at immigration and transfer desks and multiple frustrations after failing to communicate in English almost everywhere I went in the airport complex.,NA,NA,NA,7,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Arrived from Prague on a late night easyjet flight landed at around 2250 at the South Terminal the same day when the UK security level was raised to severe. When we disembarked the plane we realized that the door between the jetty and the terminal was closed and there was no one inside the airport. We then managed to ask the flight attendant to help and managed the first door. Then we realized there was another second door locked. Again no sign of any staff at Gatwick. The flight attendant had to open the door again and here we are at the departure lounge rather than the arrivals. Then all the passengers wander around the almost empty airport without being approached or questioned. Eventually I managed to get the attention from a security personnel and he directed all the passengers though the arrival hall. No explanation whatsoever. They blamed easyjet of course. I have written to Gatwick airport but no response at all. It is ridiculous that they operate the airport link the jetty to the airplane and then when something went wrong they said it wasn't their responsibility.

We were ushered into the immigration hall which was already extremely busy although several processing desks remained unmanned while several immigration officers congregated chatting in groups. Joined a queue which moved unbelievably slowly indeed three people ahead of us were held aside and then escorted away for secondary screening. When we finally made it to the top of the queue (after standing for 55mins) the immigration officer was unbelievably rude and discourteous. If anybody was on a power-trip this guy was. Although my visa-waiver form was completed he claimed he couldn't read the telephone number I had supplied and told me to rewrite it. When I asked to borrow his pen he snorted that he didn't give out his pen and told me to go ask another passenger to loan me one. What is it with US Immigration? - Do they deliberately employ a certain number of people who have never had a decent upbringing? After finally leaving immigration I collected my luggage only to have to join a queue about 75 people long that snaked through the luggage hall in order to clear customs. I then had to recheck my luggage (which thankfully can be done in TBIT) before heading the few hundred yards stroll to T4. Thankfully I made my connecting flight - but I was glad I had the 2.5hr connecting window. All in all a horrendous experience.

I am travelling on a Star Alliance ticket so each time I want to fly in Europe Lufthansa takes me to Frankfurt. This costs me both time and money since it uses unnecessary air miles and if course one needs to factor in landing and take off time transit time and potential delays with each stage. Now I know that you also have to factor in potential very long bus rides to the wrong end of the terminal for your individual purposes. In my case the first time both planes were parked at one end of the airport but the departure gate was at the other extreme. In the second case one of the planes actually did connect to the terminal but the walk was still very long and even in the business class lounge I was warned of this.

vilnius-airport,/airport-reviews/vilnius-airport,Vilnius Airport customer review,Eddy le Couvreur,Netherlands,2014-09-28,The airport is not well designed and badly sign-posted especially if you arrive by rental car. There are no signs at all telling you where to return your rental car. After driving around for a bit we decided on a hunch to try the multi-storey car park. Just behind the entrance there is a smallish sign with the logos of the rental companies but again no sign to any designated parking spaces. So we kept on driving upwards until we saw signs indicating the reserved parking spaces for Europcar Sixt Avis etc. Again no instructions on what to do next with your keys. We then try to find our way to the departure hall. The only obvious entry is via a narrow sidewalk beside a ramp leading around the old terminal building up to the second floor of the new building. Inside no car rental office to be seen. A plan of the airport indicated that rental companies could be found on two locations inside the old terminal building that functions as departure hall at the ground level. But no indication of which rental firm is where. No signs indicating how to reach that part of the airport. It turns out you have to leave the building cross the road to the old building find a staircase downstairs. Here you find signs to car rental but pointing in two opposite directions! I tried left but found that my company was on the other side of the building. Once I found it I had to accompany the operator to the car for inspection. And after inspection back to the terminal building. Good thing we were there with good time to spare! Our flight left from gate A2. For gate A2 and A1 there were a total of 6 seats in the waiting area so waiting passengers had to spread out to rest of the A wing of the departure lounge. The airport tries to show an environmental consciousness by placing separate garbage can for paper plastics and other items.

After waiting until all passengers were checked in I asked again for help. The girl begrudgingly said she'd go to the Main Office and took a French woman passenger with her with a similar problem but told me wait there. They were gone almost an hour and I asked for help from the remaining check in desk woman on duty. She told me she had nothing to do with ""my problem"" so my husband explained in Arabic and asked her politely for help. She was very rude and very angry I asked her for her name. She started screaming at me ""Are you the police? Are you a gendarme? I don't have to tell my name or badge number to anyone but the police."" She refused to call her supervisor and continued her contemptuous and rude treatment towards me yelling at me to go sit down. The police showed up and she calmed down. The other woman then arrived with the French woman she'd helped who also had only an electronic ticket but told me the same thing again ""We will put you on the plane to Lisbon and when you get there get your baggage and go find US Airways and ask them to straighten it out."" The police then escorted me to the plane which was late taking off which had inconvenienced all passengers.

The terminal building has a long frontage which is for buses and taxis only - private cars cannot stop anywhere for free - other than as mentioned above.

Even though my gate and the lounge are in the same terminal I had to pass through security. All together from arrival to lounge to gate I went through passport control 4 times (getting four stamps just going through Terminal B) security checkpoints 3 times (including the same checkpoint twice) and customs twice. it's the most inefficient and stupid layout for a terminal. Added to that everyone I encountered was unfriendly. While I expect that from airport security personnel I don't expect it from Lufthansa customer service. I asked a simple question of the check-in person at the lounge whether this particular lounge has shower facility I got a curt and snooty reply: ""Of course this is Lufthansa lounge.""

My father and I waited a tedious 30 minutes in the queue for a 5 minute flight to Vancouver. We had several trays of stuff and a man thought I dropped a SD card and when he took it up from one of my trays and asked me all the security people turned to me, glaring for no reason. The four trays blocked the traffic of baggages coming through the X-ray machine so out of respect I put them all onto one tray and moved away, and a security personnel said kindly to place it on a table. However as I was worried that we'd miss our flight as the security was taking forever to screen my father I was talking in a loud voice as he was across the room and all the security were busy looking at me and it just took forever. If you are flying from YVR to Victoria I highly recommend not using YYJ, as the security is appalling.

We had 1 hour 15 minutes to boarding and 2 hours to flight departure and only just made the flight. Indeed our flight was delayed due to the need to wait for passengers still in security. The transfer bus drove out of the airport and in to the traffic jam of cars entering the airport (1 hour). Security was ridiculous and could easily have taken the two hours alone. Fortunately a group of us managed to persuade a very unhelpful guard to open a 'quicker queue' barrier (45 minutes) plus time to find boarding gate meaning we arrived at the plane at the departure time. Many of our companion transferees missed their flights. There were no members of staff able or accessible to assist.

Departing I was preparing for the worst since I was leaving around 5pm when most of the flights to the US depart. I was very pleasantly surprised I breezed right through security and immigration then right to the ANA Lounge. Speaking for Terminal 1 South if you don't have access to either the United Club or the ANA Lounge the restaurants and shops are very limited. The ANA Lounge is great!

Inbound went well (no passport control between Norway and Poland) luggage came fast and no delays getting out of the airport. On departure things were not that smooth baggage system failed but much worse was the queue through security. Our departure was at the same time as a Ryanair flight to Dublin and it took the best part of 1.5 hours to pass. Staff was not rude but in dire need of learning how to smile and treat people nicely. Pity since the facilities are quite nice once you get through security. When boarding the plane there was no one leading the way from the terminal so we had to find the plane more or less on our own. Hardly satisfactory from a security point of view. All in all it wasn't that bad. Szczecin Solidarity is one of the smaller regional airports and as such rather new to international traffic.

If you do drop off and pay the fee it's still a long way to get inside because of paranoia about security. I have never seen an airport this bad including Heathrow Gatwick Manchester and Geneva. Dreadful in bad weather. It's wrong that traffic wardens should patrol the service roads to enable a private company to extort this rip-off charge from people. Most of the upstairs seating (there isn't any downstairs) has been ripped out to make a bigger cafe so people clog up all the tables instead so if you are actually wishing to eat there are no free tables.

I regularly contact the airport management team with my concerns and am yet to hear back on any issue despite their promise of getting back to you within 5 working days. Recently I was travelling with hand luggage only and as instructed at security I placed any fluids in a tray along with my phone keys etc. The only fluid I had was a single tube of toothpaste which I placed in the tray. I was informed that even though it was a single item I still needed a clear plastic bag which I would have to buy for £1. Even though it seems ridiculous to need a clear bag for 1 item (I thought the clear bags were to keep your fluids together and limit the amount you could take on board - I highly doubt that a plastic bag improves the view that the security controller gets of your liquids and gels) I agreed only to find that the point where I had to buy the bag was after security! Added to this absurd procedure was the fact that I was treated with utter contempt by the staff on duty. My other gripe are the drop-off arrangements at T1. They have made some changes where now cars and taxis have to pull into one of 15 parking spaces rather than simply dumping their passengers by the door to the terminal. This causes horrendous tail backs often onto the M56 spur.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Immigration into the USA even for transit passengers is mandatory. The queue was immense so it took me 1.5 hours to get through. On my way back to LHR coming from LIM I was tormented by US Immigration as apparently my fingerprints didn’t match with the ones they took 3 weeks before. They brought me to a waiting room which was chock-full of people mainly from Latin-American countries but also from Australia Canada and EU countries. There were children and disabled people waiting here for hours. It was not allowed to stretch one’s legs or to use a mobile phone. There was only one restroom for men and one for women one water tap with drinkable water but no cups. I was kept hold more than 2.5 hours before an Immigration officer called my name and escorted me to the exit returning my passport and customs form with the obligatory stamps in and on it but without any explanation or apologies. I was lucky to get my connecting flight but many other people didn’t and US Immigration doesn’t feel responsible for this. If they don’t like your face they subject you to an interrogation no matter how long it takes no matter what future consequences it will have for you because in their eyes you’re a suspect and they treat you as a potential terrorist.

Then to drop off bags for transfer to my continuing flight to ATL. Bags just queued up everywhere the fact that my bag made my flight was pure luck I'm sure. Last hurdle was having to clear TSA all over again - anyone trying to make an 8am flight will know the queues are obscene. After negotiating the queues and checks I had to run the concourse just making it onboard my flight as the door closed. If you arrive in LAX as first landfall and especially if you arrive at a terminal 5 (Delta) gate allow 3 hours. 1hr 50mins was just not enough - one delay in that process teamed with inadequate CBP resources and the need to re- clear TSA makes it too much of a gamble.

I have used LBA for departure twice recently with the new layout. At first the impression was a bit claustrophobic. I appreciated the new facilities. The idea of separate lounges (one for business one for leisure) is smart. I got a lot of work done on a 5 hrs delay and the £17 for 3 hours fare was well paid for. The small airport after the revamp has managed to squeeze in a lot of shops and cafes but still managed to preserve a small gathering area for each gate. The airport is obviously always busy and I can't imagine how it can be during peak holiday times. After security (pretty friendly and fast indeed) the hall is stretched to an almost single passageway. Getting a seat in the various cafes and fast-food places is a lottery.

There are now a large number of flights departing to the U.K mid morning and as at early May 2005 neither security nor passport control was ready for this. The upshot was that there was such queue at passport control that passengers on the Ryanair flight to Liverpool could not respond quickly to the last call or boarding the flight missed a slot it had for an early departure and in fact left 20 minutes late. A very small glitch as the flight actually arrived only a couple of minutes late. However as the number of flights and passengers increase through the summer this looks like a problem that is going to increase rather than decrease.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

In reality it is a glorified bus terminal as it does not have any airside gates directly to aircraft just bus bays to ferry passengers to and from their respective planes. Entering the building for departure everything seems back to front and confusing. Firstly you are swabbed for explosives before being allowed into the building. I had to ask where Check-In was located I was then directed through the Customs area. In front of me was Immigration Check-In was off a corridor to the right that I had walked past. Check in was clumsy with passengers being asked to walk behind the counters and x-ray scanners to handle baggage. Other staff were having to walk along the conveyor belts to clear constant blockages. Next came Immigration then there was only one xray and search area open in a tight constricted area. Everyone was being quizzed about their baggage and I had to pull my carry-on apart for inspection in the small area. Finally I was in the smallish lounge area with three duty free stores and a single restaurant.

luxor-airport,/airport-reviews/luxor-airport,Luxor Airport customer review,John Treacy,United Kingdom,2014-08-18,We flew into and out of Luxor as international passengers. Landing at the airport all flights are transferred to the terminal building by bus. Once stepping inside the terminal it is possible by get a visa at any of the banks before going to passport control where the visa is check and landing card (as previously issued and filled in on the plane) is taken. Immediately after this there is a staff member who checks your visa has been stamped. Never ceases to amaze the level of irrelevant check. From here to baggage collection/ customs and then out to face the scrum of touts. They seem to be keener as there are far few flights. The return trips was much the same but in reverse. Touts scanning checking/ bag drop exit card (given at checking and need filling) in before getting to passport control. The lounge is quite large with four duty free shops one on each corner and in the centre a gloriously named 'food court' with quite a poor offering of food but expensive. To the gate. No announcements but numerous displays on screens but very slow security checks. As to why with 10 staff they didn't open a second channel to deal with hit is beyond me. Not many people there only three international fights listed for departure that day. Previously used the same airport many years ago and it is a vast improvement on what it was.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,Ron White,NA,2009-04-16,Travelers to Brisbane airport need to realize that there is no free regular convenient inter terminal shuttle service between domestic and international terminals. The airport web site advises using the 'Airtrain' - or a taxi (they must be joking!) The Airtrain is in fact the regular service to the Gold Coast operating twice an hour so if you just miss one you have to spend 30 frustrated minutes on the platform from which the other terminal is clearly visible at the risk. And the train costs $4.00. (Only travellers arriving and leaving on Qantas flights have complementary travel by train.) There is a further inconvenience: getting yourself and your luggage to and from to the elevated train track; this may involve another $2.00 for the use of a trolley. There is an alternative: the airport-city mini bus service. The fare -- $3 when I last used the service - is paid at a kiosk just outside the arrivals hall and you have to wait nearby while a confusing sequence of mini buses bound for various destinations comes and goes. So inter terminal travel at Brisbane isn't a seamless experience and with trolleys and train fares factored in can cost around $6.00. .

SAS airline staff at the airport was polite and helpful as they helped me check in (I lost my reservation number on the previous flight so I couldn't use the machine to check in). Security check went ok and fast. Everyone was pleasant. I didn't like the fact that airport gives you only 15 min of free wifi. There is no recharge point and you can find a power plug only in some restaurants and cafes which are far too expensive and do not accept diners card and can't return cash in euros.

Departure is a bit of a performance with any number of checks and people with different rubber stamps involved. Check-in is entirely a manual process with hand-written baggage labels and seating worked out usually a hand-drawn grid representing the cabin. But it all seems to work.

Staff were asking people to move to the front of the queue depending on their time of flight giving passenger only 20 minutes to go through security. Then to find out that bags were being checked by 1 member of staff who obviously could not cope with it and was not fit for purpose due to her false nails which hindered her ability to open cases and plastic resealable bags. It was appalling to say the least. Airport staff were screaming at each other when asked to fast track families through the queue. Obviously understaffed and unable to cope with the pressure.

It is inconceivable to me that going from one terminal to another could be so inefficient and costly. There is no tram that runs between domestic and international terminals. Option #1 is a shuttle bus (called T Bus) that runs every 30 minutes (and not on a schedule). Passengers were queued up for this service and it isn't even free - there is a A$5.50 charge for what amounts to an inferior unreliable service. Option #2 is a city train (called Airport link) which also charges A$5 for transport between terminals. Option #3 is a taxi which we chose because of a reasonably tight connection. Fare was A$15 and after generous tip cost me A$20. I cannot think of another major airport in the world that does not offer high quality reliable comfortable free transport between terminals.

Drop off and car parking is a scandal. But by far the worst problem at Bristol is the long and bizarre walk to gate 11 and other new gates. We stood in a long wraparound style queue while we waited for our easyjet flight to disembark and prepare for us to embark (30 mins). There are no seats or toilets whatsoever in this small grey room. Easyjet staff are clearly up against it as they try to move us from one queue wrapping up and around a narrow staircase to another queue while cramming us in to this miserable room.

I appreciate that one has to queue for passport control as regulations are now more stringent but what really annoyed me was the lack of staff (including managers) to cope with what they must have known was going to be a chaotic situation as the luggage carousels jammed. The people who should have collected their cases were held up in the massive queues at passport control while those of us who had struggled through had no cases to collect because of the blockage on the luggage belt. You must have known this was going to happen but had not drafted in staff to cope by stacking the cases along the walls and keeping things moving.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,R Cooper,Australia,2015-04-08,In the last few years this airport has gone from being reasonably acceptable to being a total joke particularly since the recent renovations. Making both arriving and departing passengers pass through the duty free stores thereby running the gauntlet of aggressive sales staff is totally unacceptable an insult to the travelling public and something of which Brisbane Airport Corporation should be ashamed. While I pass through the terminal at least twice a month and used to spend time perusing the shops while outbound I now refuse to spend a cent in the shops on principle. On top of that mornings at the airport (both arriving and departing) are an absolute debacle with long queues and insufficient customs staff and the most inefficient security staff (outbound) I have ever encountered. If the body scanners are in use it seems that the whole screening process for the rest of the passengers comes to a halt. To further inconvenience the travelling public the scanning machine operators change frequently and instead of adopting a system whereby there is a short overlap between operators they have to stop the whole system for about five minutes further backing up the queue. Finally when inbound and holding an express card one would think the process would be efficient right? No. Following the signs to the express queue at immigration results in the longest possible walk to the counters and then you simply merge with the normal queue! Who dreams up these systems? My recommendation is to avoid this airport wherever possible. Unfortunately for those who live in Brisbane there is little alternative but at least don't encourage their poor management lack of planning and foresight and the derision with which they treat passengers by spending money at the overpriced duty free stores or extortionate foreign exchange facilities.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

We had 5 minutes to make our flight before doors closed. LAX to Bangkok on Singapore Airlines again I gave myself a 3 hour layover this time and it was barely enough. Shuttles that transferred via Southwest to the Bradley (international) airport rarely came. I dragged luggage 20 minutes to the Bradley. Finally got to Singapore airlines ticketing counter and was greeted by hundreds of people standing in long lines with of course LAX only supplying 6 ticketing counters. Both security check points had 250+ passengers waiting in line. LAX should get a warning in all areas of service for this.

There are no car rental staff to greet you on arrival we had to park our car in a different companies bay and go to the desk in the arrivals - totally chaotic. Ultimately this led to us missing our flight despite having arrived 90 minutes before departure.

To cap it all having taken the lift with our pushchair trolley loaded with bags 2 children the lift was broken when we wanted to go back to the ground floor - only option stairs - not a good experience!

I checked in for my flight about 1+1/2 hours before take off at 19.40pm. Going through check-in was a breeze but at security it was a nightmare. At the entrance to security are automatic doors which appear very new. At this point there was a little uniformed man barking out instructions to travellers like an RSM ""don't step beyond the yellow lines! wait your turn etc"". Passing though the automatic barriers you then had a very long zig zag queue of travellers. At this point I would hazard that about 45 mins had passed. If you had left it late as some passengers had you were going to miss your flight. The last section as always was the best bit and you had options which queue to join?! If like me you just accept that the queue you join will always be the slowest then no problem but if you're in a hurry! I got through okay and made my flight which fortunately had been delayed by 35 minutes. I am certain that many people missed their flights last night because of the delays in security.

The customs and immigration lines were horrendous. There were only four to five officers working at the counter - and when you get a jumbo jet with around 350-400 pax arriving be prepared for at least an hour to an hour and a half in line to get past customs. Once past customs we picked up our luggage which had already been pulled off the belt because another flight was arriving! After that we proceeded our way towards the money exchange bureau. There we encountered another long long line up of pax exchanging for baht currency (apparently the airport exchange bureau offers better rates compared to the local hotels). The line up was ok but the problem was when it was our turn to get the exchange the lady who worked there said she ran out of baht because of too many people exchanging!! This definietly was not a good way to start a holiday trip! The taxis outside the airport were mostly operated by private individuals with vans who gathered a group of people together and strapped their luggage on the top of the vans! Was a messy situation when you get around 500 ppl outside the taxi stand scrambling for a ride to their respective hotels! On our departure we went upstairs to check-in and the counter agents were quite efficient. Like the airport in Bahrain (BAH) we had to check-in and then go to a separate counter to pay for the airport tax! The customs this time was a brisk and we were waiting at the boarding gate within 10 minutes of checking-in. There were no airport lounges in sight so nothing much to do.. The plane arrived an hour late so we walked around the duty free shops and did some last minute shopping. The toilets were clean and the shops consisted of some good bookstores and souvenirs and the Thai people were always friendly. If you plan to pass thru HKT be sure to get off the plane quick and line up first at the immigration otherwise you're in for a nasty wait!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

As I live in BOG I do not have to change from El Dorado to Puente Aereo but I always can see upon arrival that it is a horror for those who have to. The saving grace are the fast track immigration lines for families with children and the good shops once passing emigration process. As far as Avianca check-in for premium passengers is concerned there are long lines too especially when leaving at the before mentioned peak hours.

However Denver is one of a few airports that I land at after a long trip and do not feel like I'm cramped stressed or outdated. The terminals are very large and spacious and allow a large amount of natural light to illuminate the area. Even during the height of the holiday season when there are hoards of people flocking to Denver the airport gives the sense that it is never really crowded. Even the train system is rarely jammed with people. Despite that the problem that always seems to hit me is that my bag is always delayed or lost. After traveling for 30+ hours the last thing you want to do is wait for your bag or even worse be told that it will be delivered the following day. My suggestion is that Denver needs to find a real solution to their baggage problems.

I have visited far worse airports but this airport does not meet the standards of an international hub like Singapore Hong Kong or Bangkok. The cleanliness and facilities are fair there are a couple options of food and retail not many and the restrooms are fairly maintained. The staff at the restaurants are friendly and will hook you up to their shop's wifi if it is for customers however there is no public wifi network at this airport which is a problem. The lines at check-in and immigration can be long you can wait in a line for almost 20-30 minutes depending on the staff efficiency and passenger traffic. The immigration officers are not friendly and they take ages to finish their job. The customs officers are not friendly either but they are efficient. Security is easy to get through with friendly and efficient staff who can speak moderate English. There is no information booth and the only way to get information about facilities etc is to ask staff at the restaurants and shops or to look at signs. This airport is nice for Vietnam standards and I think that it will continue to improve as it is with complete renovation of the old terminal now used for only domestic flights.

Then the fun started at passport control no fast track just EU or non EU lines but all merged into one seething mass of people. Horrible scrum which was terrifying for kids and resulted in 1.5 hours to get passport stamped. Crowd approached mob mentality at times and absolutely no crowd control from customs or security. Only a handful of customs staff on duty and complete lack of care attitude. We arrived at the airport 2 hours and 45 minutes before departure and just made flight. I have no doubt many desperate travellers missed their flight. No time to shop visit lounge or complete tax free process. Tragic for all the shops and food outlets at the airport which were deserted as passengers had to run after clearing passport control to make their flight. Even worse for the airlines and controllers trying to ensure timely departures.

The response was hostile and wound up with several security people lecturing me about acting suspicious not reading the sign that said it was safe telling me my film case would protect them from radiation anyways and then finally putting it through the x-ray machine just to prove this (and not even apologizing when doing so revealed that the film case was NOT radiation-proof)!

Whilst the new terminal is obviously a generational step forward on the old many of the practical aspects of the design are deficient. The lifts and escalators up from the rail station to departures go through a huge covered outdoor void a strange choice in a city where the average temp is low. This looks even more of a deficiency when you enter the departures section inside and see it is cramped. People tripping over each other to deposit bags too few check-in kiosks etc.. Why did they scrimp on the area of the departures hall interior when they had literally acres of adjacent space under cover outside. Equally baffling was despite building this huge outdoor covered void the car and bus drop off areas are uncovered requiring passengers to still walk out in the rain.

The appearance that maintenance is never performed on this structure is obvious. Trash is everywhere (inside and out) the seating rows are going in all different directions and the walkways are filthy with windows you can barely see out of. Maintenance covers were half hanging from their remaining screws dust caked the vents and grunge lined the walls. The baggage claim area wasn't too bad and the wait reasonable. Airport staff/security was very rude. Getting from one Terminal to another or to the train station requires walking a maze of rundown walkways. Signage is adequate. The restrooms are filthy. Staff spend more time gossiping than actually cleaning. Upon departing check in was simple and security lines average. Maps showing the locations of food/shopping are non-existent. You must be willing to walk long distances to find food of any variety. The terminal advertises free internet but we could not get it to work.

Start one level up from the lowest arrivals level. Go as far as you can to the southern end of Terminal 2 in the general direction of the Domestic Terminal. Walk past the bookstore on the right and around the 7-11. At the start of the long elevated ""tube"" that leads to the Domestic Terminal you'll see it on the right. It's clearly signed. If you find yourself looking at parked cars instead of the ""tube"" you are in the right spot but on the wrong level. The place is used mostly by Thai airport workers plus a few savvy travelers. It serves a wide range of Thai food so some (though not all) of the food is spice. It uses a coupon system in increments of 5 baht. Buy coupons before you choose your food drink etc. You can eat very well for 30-35 baht. And it really is delicious.

Actually they also have airport threecycle taxi but when I tried it they conned me by asking double the meter because it was before 6am. My Indian friend later told me that the rate was 1.5 times the meter between 10pm - 6am. The airport was small and located inside the city so actually it was also rather nicely located. Unlike gigantic airport like Changi or Cengkareng you can actually reach the city on foot.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-07-03,"One of the busiest airports not just in Asia but in the world. Was very disappointed given you'd think that an airport of this size would be used to handling passengers and meeting their expectations. The lounge in particular was appalling. I paid for lounge access but when I got in they'd run out of beer and I complained and all the staff said was ""come earlier in the day"". I then replied by telling them a high percentage of long-haul flights leave late at night. Another thing which was very annoying and this happened both times I recently arrived was that baggage trolleys ran out meaning I had to carry my big heavy suitcase. At the same time I could see porters who were possibly charging for their services using baggage trolleys. How difficult is it for the management of CGK to order more baggage trolleys? On top of that its not very well organised and can be rather confusing to navigate. Finally (I was lucky because I have a work visa) there was only one immigration desk open at about 4 o clock in the afternoon meaning those who had to get a tourist visa on arrival had to wait ages. Also there was no queue control system like a 'snake line'. On the whole this airport while not as bad as others like Charles de Gaulle and Manila is an embarrassment to Indonesia as it gives first time visitors a bad impression of the country as they get a feeling of chaos poor organisation and a lack of care for visitors.",NA,NA,NA,4,2,2,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

However at Manchester I was greeted by the mother of all airport security queues. Having shuffled along for 1.5 hrs I could see time was getting tight. Thankfully a member of staff shouted ""anyone with a flight in the next 30 min please come forward"" which I gladly did. Whereas most airports suffice with a full body metal detector Manchester insists on using a ridiculous body scanner. You have to queue to enter the scanner then after you exit you get scanned again! In all it took me 25 min to get through the body scanner leaving me 5 min to run to the boarding gate. Got there 5 min late - the gate had closed. What's the point of fast-tracking people 30 min before their flight when it takes 25 min to pass through security?

The terminal building is airy and clean sufficient amount of shops and cafes walking distances are not that far. The access taxiways to the terminal takes ages so the planes taxing was around 25min! The negative points are more because of local habits. For the first time I met a female passport control officer who was rude for that I am taking 2 stars off. Only passengers can enter the terminal building even the waiting areas. If you are not a passenger then you have to ""buy"" a ticket which is a bit annoying as they sent us 600m away to a stall to get the ticket. I realize that this is to control the crowds and the ""taxi drivers"" who hunt for arrivals but this is not the way to do it. Only passengers are allowed al the way to check in counters!

The restrictions to parking commented on by one reviewer are due to security - nothing to do with wanting more cash for parking - its the same at Glasgow now. Prestwick has all you could want from an airport - somewhere to eat - the food in the restaurant before you go to departures is fine and not too expensive for an airport. You then walk all of 30 steps to the departures which have never at any time I have been there been queued.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,Vincent Smith,NA,2008-01-10,"MIA is my hometown airport. For someone who has been using this airport all his life I'm use to the construction/traffic etc - so I know how to plan my way around these obstacles. Concourse J (the new one) is beautiful and different to the rest of the terminal. Immigration lines are a breeze as well as check in. As for the rest of the airport; and I mean AA territory (literally) this is where most of the complaints stem from. The check in area is very small the roof is low it feels gloomy the carpet is outdated etc. Then you have the entrance to Concourse D in addition to a very popular restaurant all established right smack in the middle of this small check in area. In other words it does get very crowded at times in this extremely busy part of MIA. To add insult to injury Concourse A is temporarily closed - so all traffic that was shifted to that area at one point is now back to Concourse C/D. Folks brace yourselves if you are flying AA from MIA for the next 2-3 years because the lines will be outrageous. Check in online at home if you can (unless you have bags or traveling internationally) and get to the airport EARLY. Regarding customs/immigration arriving with AA this should no longer be an issue (time wise) as most other carriers that shared the E immigration facility together with AA have now moved to the new Concourse J. So AA (together with only a few OneWorld partners) has the E immigration facility to themselves. The frustration may start once immigration/customs is clear - bags have been rechecked and one has to ""find"" the connecting gate. The signage is pretty clear for those who have to endure this but it can be a bit complicated I will admit. Just ask for directions and you will be guided accordingly. It does involve having to go to level 2 since the exit for E Immigration is in level 1. The elevators and escalators are behind recheck. Once all construction to what will be known as ""The North Terminal"" for AA is complete (someday) then things will start to ease out for AA passengers at MIA. Unfortunately it will still take some time as building an airport on top of another one without being able to close it is extremely time consuming. For those with a layover in MIA its like any other airport - you have your shops restaurants and there is a hotel inside the terminal by Concourse E where you can go to the Top of the Port Restaurant and enjoy a meal or cocktail while waiting for your next flight - away from all the terminal drama. It almost feels like an airline frequent flyer club. Surprisingly the hotel is known as ""The Miami International Airport Hotel"". Regarding some comments complaining about how everyone at the airport only speaks Spanish or speak something that sounds like French Miami's population is predominantly from Latin America and the Caribbean. Please don't feel stunned or out of place just because you hear anything but English in your surroundings. All employees that work directly with customer service do need to speak English. For someone who lives in South Florida I will continue to use MIA. Even if the fare is slightly higher then departing from FLL unless the drive is worth it I will stick to MIA.

Flights particularly from the western apron are called early. Arrivals were not so good but just acceptable the passport readers were working but very slow - at least once it would have been quicker to queue to see an officer. My main gripe is the misuse of resources my last arrival was typical: the aircraft was parked at the far end of the western apron giving us a 400+m walk to the terminal building (they do at least advertise the distance). As we walked along we saw at least a dozen aircraft parking spaces closer (including 3 in right front of the terminal) none of which was being used.

islamabad-airport,/airport-reviews/islamabad-airport,Islamabad Airport customer review,Pamela Golder-Davis,NA,2007-07-03,"The Ladies' Toilet facilities were appalling and insufficient for the number of people. There was deafening noise from builders cutting and grinding inside the terminal so that announcements could not be heard. The escalator made to carry passengers up one floor during check-in was not working. And there were other steps to be climbed as well. No good for passengers with difficulty in walking or with children and pushchairs. BA have recently introduced ""Electronic Check In"" in which you check-in on-line 24 hours before the flight select your choice of seats and print your own ""Electronic Boarding Passes"". These were happily accepted at the BA check-in desk. However none of the many Airport Security staff conducting the various security checks had been briefed about this innovation. Our party was therefore subjected to much delay and inappropriate humiliation while passing through the checks -- even at the foot of the aircraft steps. There was much confusion in the departure lounge when the decision was made to allow two different Jumbo Jets to board simultaneously through one single gate. Surely this could have been done better. The transfer buses on the tarmac had dangerously steep steps: most unsuitable for the purpose. Indeed why were they ever allowed into service when new? During arrival the Immigration checks took much longer to pass through than the baggage took to arrive from the plane so there was a strong risk of unwatched luggage being stolen from the carousel.",NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
munich-airport,/airport-reviews/munich-airport,Munich Airport customer review,Kevin McDougald,Canada,2015-07-31,"Terminal 2 was one of the best airports I've passed through. I would normally avoid a 60-minute International-to-Schengen connection, but given that Munich Airport is promoted as offering such connections in as little as 30 minutes and the consequences of a missed connection were fairly low, I decided to give it a try. Only a mere 29 minutes elapsed from engine shutdown on my inbound flight from Canada to my arrival at the gate for my onward flight to Sweden. This included waiting and processing time at both Immigration and security screening, and I walked at a normal pace at all points in between. Schengen-to-International connection on my return to Canada was equally efficient, and quicker with no security screening being required. One suggested improvement: better Wi-Fi, as getting my iPad to connect to it was a hassle throughout the terminal.",Transit,31-07-2015,Solo Leisure,9,5,4,4,4,4,NA,2,4,1
vilnius-airport,/airport-reviews/vilnius-airport,Vilnius Airport customer review,Andrius Uzkalnis,NA,2004-05-23,VNO is trying but this is an example of a lack of planning and forward-thinking. The best thing that can be said is that it is very close to central Vilnius and a taxi will take you there for an equivalent of $7.00. Otherwise it is so hopelessly inadequate for the new stream of passengers brought about by Lithuania's admission to the EU and God only knows what it is going to look like after number of passengers will almost double this summer with all the new flights launched. Arrivals hall is dark cold and uncomfortable albeit clean. Departures: check-in lines are long but tend to move quick passport control and security is quick. Airside waiting areas are clean but seats are few toilets are spotless but there are not enough of them. Duty Free is a joke. Once airside you cannot buy a book a magazine or a newspaper. One little tip: when people are reduced to leaning on the walls you almost always CAN get a seat in the bar because it so obnoxiously overpriced that it is only half-empty at the worst of times. Most travellers would not buy $3.00 coffee or a $4.00 glass of water but to me it sounds like a bargain for a guaranteed seat and a table to put my laptop on.

So hopefully this will solve some issues. Arrival: There are only apron positions, so a bus has to bring you to the terminal. If there are some international flights arriving at the same time, passport control can take some more minutes. But it doesn't matter, because you need to wait for the luggage anyhow. Departure: The small terminal is always crowded and also not in the best shape anymore. Check-in (LH, OS, OU) is ok, but depends on the number of parallel flights. If you have some time left, get out of the building and enjoy sunshine or shadow in the small park. No issues at security, but sometimes only one passport control is open and you need to queue for 15 to 20 minutes. If you finally arrived in the airside departure hall, make sure you are not hungry. Only a small bar with soft-drinks, beer and sometimes a few sandwiches is serving the crowd. Seat availability is very limited as soon as more than 2 flights are leaving. Transport to the aircraft is handled by busses, which are equipped with aircon, but it's mostly just switched on in the drivers compartment. The recommendation is only because there is no alternative airport to travel to Zagreb.

After immigration there were not many seats hence you will find passengers seated on the floor shops are expensive.

winnipeg-airport,/airport-reviews/winnipeg-airport,Winnipeg Airport customer review,A Bryson,Canada,2013-03-12,I use this airport at least once per month and it is no where near the major improvement over the old terminal which people are touting. Firstly the long and skinny design of the terminal causes domestic travelers to have to walk quite far to the furthest gates (11 and 12). There are no moving sidewalks as the terminal is too narrow. Secondly the power plugs provided at bar table setups throughout the terminal have no seats! People can't be expected to stand at these charging tables awkwardly overall it just causes the power plugs to waste away unused except for the 1 which is accessible from the normal gate seating. To pay $20 (soon $25) in Airport Improvement Fees for the 'privilege' of using this airport is a hoot. I'd prefer using the old terminal which allowed me to go gate-to-curb in less than 2 minutes versus the extra couple needed for this unusually long terminal (if arriving at those far gates I specified earlier). There is only one escalator to baggage claim so when that is broken (and it has) the $20 in AIFs paid to use the terminal involves you carrying any carry on baggage down about 40 stairs or wait for the single elevator. Furthermore the rotating door to enter the terminal is frustratingly slow as people are pulling baggage and consistently get stuck which has lead to the door cracking and going out of service for weeks. While the increase in food options is nice over the previous terminal it would be great to have a McDonalds instead of the same old Tim Hortons as in every other airport. This terminal has 3 Tim Hortons - they should allocate space to a different fast food chain.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

One hour and 10 minutes later they found somebody to take me to the baggage reclaim via immigration. Whilst waiting it was suggested that my wife (62) may like take me while a 30 something man walked beside us as he was not trained to push a wheelchair but would show us the way. I spoke to the manager in charge on the internal telephone who blamed the delay on the immigration and baggage reclaim area but refused to come up with a solution.

I must say this was not a pleasant stay because there is very little to do apart from the brightly illuminated small tax-free shopping area which looks OK. There is enough to see to spend some time. Outside the shopping area there is hardly any thing to do save for some coffee selling points a pizza counter and a France Delight counter where you should think twice to order something to eat or you must be starved in this case anything will help to fill your stomach. The only comfortable seating facilities are situated in front of the France Delight counter but with only about 30 chairs available you find yourself lucky to get a seat. The other places where you can seat are situated close to the gates but these are very uncomfortable and dirty. The local’s are disregarding the non-smoking signs and when you comment to their behaviour they just ignore you and keep on smoking. The male and ladies restrooms are incredible dirty and not well kept. Almost all locks on the doors are not functioning; at the washstand the soap dispensers are out of order you may dip your fingers in the soap containers which are open standing for this purpose on the sink. The faucets are not fixed and rotate in all directions allowed by their flexible connection to the water pipes and in one of the restrooms the electrical cable of the hand- drying unit was inadequately repaired. They just twisted the live wires together and did not insulate the connection thus very dangerous in this wet environment.

Like all BAA airports the concept of providing a customer service is completely alien to the company owning the airport instead they treat it as a cash cow with the intention of extorting every penny from the passengers passing through. The seating area airside is woefully inadequate but this is because approximately 1/3 of the available area is taken up with a very expensive noisy and smelly World Shopping retail outlet which you have to walk through to reach the departure lounge. Mitchell's Bar upstairs (airside) is eye-wateringly expensive; £4+ for a watery pint of beer upwards of £5 for a glass of wine overpriced food and snacks etc - even a packet of crisps is around £1.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,N Emorinem,NA,2008-11-05,Good to read some positive reviews here but my advice is to prepare for the worst if you ever have the misfortune to go through MIA in transit. Having read some reviews here I changed my return flight to a later one as it seemed that 2 hours would not be enough to go through immigration & customs. New arrangements provided for 4.5 hours. Well I'm glad I did. After a 15 minute run from the plane I joined a queue at immigration at 5.45pm and was finally granted permission to enter the USA at 7.30pm. Some people in my queue and those adjacent were pulled for questioning by officials after queuing already for an hour or more. Guess they didn't make their connections. The baggage bit was hopeless - despite being told that I would have to collect my bag and go through customs to clear it and recheck it it wasn't on the carousel (no signs telling you what carousel to go to - you just have to wander up and down and hope you can spot your flight). Piles of bags everywhere - some of them were from flights which had landed several hours earlier. The concept of customer service is clearly non-existent in staff at this airport: to get help I had to break up conversations between staff who would have quote happily chatted indefinitely looking at pictures on their mobile phones flirting with each other etc. if I hadn't forced my way into their conversation. Turns out that despite what my Air Jamaica people were told in JA my bag was checked through already (apparently) though the staff at my departure gate denied this. I did have to check in again at Departures and eventually arrived at my gate at 9pm for a 9.30 flight. Concourse E - dismal place rubbish facilities (hot dogs and a tiny Pizza Hut concession - and that's about it). My bag did reappear in London. I dislike Heathrow and UK airports in general but it seemed like a paradise of good signage helpful staff and logical transit arrangements by comparison. If I can avoid it I will never go to MIA again nor will I book flights requiring a transit at a US airport - nearly missed my connection on the way out at JFK because of a 50 minute wait for baggage and being misadvised about transfer of luggage to next flight from different terminal. But that's another story.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

That wasn't the worst thing airport staff seem not bother managing the tour groups the small groups or individual travelers.

We finally had to ask the Officer to help us with the queue when we had only 10 minutes left before boarding time but the Officers didn't bother to do anything.

If you are picked up from your hotel at 1:30am to catch a 6:50am flight you will be stranded at the airport for long enough to end up buying at these ridiculous prices.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,T Maddern,Australia,2014-01-06,I have flown in and out of Brisbane International and Domestic terminals several times over the past year. I have found both terminals clean and easy to get around. I also like them because there are plenty of seats and places where you can look out and watch planes and what's going on outside. In both terminals security is fine and not too intrusive queue times for me also were not an issue. For those wanting food and drink there are plenty of places in the terminals to get these outlets in the international terminals as expected are overpriced. There is a train link to get to the city this takes about 10-20 mins apparently and also links with the Gold Coast. There is a taxi rank outside the terminals also.

addis-ababa-airport,/airport-reviews/addis-ababa-airport,Addis Ababa Airport customer review,J Abebe,NA,2009-01-14,Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa is clean compact and effective. Arrivals was quick. (I recommend getting your visa prior to arriving in ADD as the visa application process does take a while) Clearing immigration and getting your passport stamp took no longer than 3 minutes. Bags took about 20 minutes to arrive and came out sporadically but all came safely and thats all that matters. Ethiopian customs x-rays all luggage prior to exiting so that took some time as well but you are dealt with in a professional and polite manner. As for departures your tickets and passports are checked prior to entering the terminal building and there is an x-ray and metal detector immediately upon entering. Check-in was efficient USA departures have their own area where you are asked the typical security questions. Your passports/visas are heavily scrutinized (presumably because of the large amount of fraudulent documents that make their way through ADD and airlines getting charged large fines for transporting these people.) Passing through immigration is a simple exit stamp and you proceed upstairs where there is a fair amount of duty free shops and eateries. There is another security check to enter the specific gate area (and might I add the metal detector in the gate is extremely sensitive). Overall ADD is a clean and efficient airport with no major problems or difficulties encountered. 4 stars only because they could use a better selection of eateries.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,N Winchmore,Australia,2012-08-19,When you read some review sites and find negative comments you assume it is due to the reviewer having had bad luck and that it is possibly not that bad. However the reviews here are almost the opposite - most reviews are correct and in fact some almost optimistic. I have been to Dubai airport twice in the last six months and on both occasions Emirates parks 15 minutes away from the terminal and they pack you into a bus and drive you to the terminal. Signage isn't too bad - but why all the security checks? Anyway as described you keep going up and down escalators and finally enter a terribly overcrowded terminal concourse which even at 2am is absolutely packed with passengers. Very difficult to find a seat. There was a queue to use the toilets - but they are clean. How could Emirates expand their flights so much without thinking of airport facilities? It was therefore quite a relief to arrive in Changi Airport Singapore as the next stop.

Stuck here for 5 hours when flight was delayed a fate I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. The entire terminal was ridiculously hot no AC in the summer! The excess of people plus the sunlight streaming in from the glass walls made it unbearably hot. Bathrooms were okay in terms of cleanliness but because there are so few stalls expect to wait in line. The one restaurant served terrible overpriced food. Noodles there were foisted from an instant noodle packet. Just awful. The stores have no variety. You want in-flight snacks? Too bad the only thing they have curiously is chocolate. I ate so much chocolate I was sick. The VIP/first class lounges are a joke. They're temporary spaces with temporary walls enclosing the size of a closet. You can see the whole room just passing by. The lounges probably were a closet in a past life that were hastily assembled to be a ""lounge"" at the last minute with little standards of or consideration in quality. They just stuck a few couches in a closet. Worst of all there are no working outlets in the terminal so good luck if you want to charge your laptop tablet or phone. There is a stand with adapters for charging phones but it's only compatible with weird Asian phones. The few outlets on the wall don't work. Overall it was a horrible experience.

Entering the airport is already a painful experience due to the long lines and the chaotic crowd. The departure area is a mess as there are no adequate seats and long lines that consume most of the space. One has to make sure that the airline offers online check-in to avoid the long queues. The long queue at pre-boarding security is compounded by the inability of the security to immediately provide trays to passengers. Hence passengers put their stuff on trays just before their luggage are check in the x-ray machine. This matter has been raised to the airport officials but there was no action. Quality of food remains to be poor and no adequate choices. Seating arrangement at the boarding area are very cramped.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

For example the bar had a long queue snaking through it on a busy Saturday afternoon and only 2 staff behind the bar. You need a drink to fortify yourself for the mammoth walk to the plane along a leaky corridor. As mentioned previously the return experience is as bad. Long wait to get off the plane and another delay in a bus between the plane and the terminal building. An apology went out over the tannoy because of the long wait at immigration.

I've travelled here every other month from various UK airports for about 2 years and sometimes have to wait up to 2 hours to get away.

columbus-airport,/airport-reviews/columbus-airport,Columbus Airport customer review,H Lee,United States,2012-12-13,Overall pleasant to fly in and out of. The facility has gone through a major renovation some time ago and it is still well maintained. Most parts including the restrooms are very clean. The main terminal is not so big but not too small to be overcrowded either. The parking garage is attached to the main terminal so travelers can avoid being exposed to the wind/rain/sunlight to reach their cars. A McDonald's is located within the airport complex. The landside and the 3 concourses are also fairly well laid out and dotted with decent number of eateries. In most cases the check-in and security check procedures altogether took only about 10 minutes for me and as the terminal is not too big even walking to the farthest gate takes only about 5 minutes. Of course TSA agents sometimes can be less than courteous. Baggage handling was fairly quick I did not really have to wait for more than 5 minutes until my bags were placed on the carousel for pickup. This airport offers free wi-fi and plenty of power outlets in between seats including USB power ports. My only concern about this facility is the lack of public transportation options. This airport is connected to the city by only two bus lines (52 and 92). Of course as this airport is only about 15 minutes' drive from downtown even a taxi ride costs only about $25 which implies a low demand of public transportation options in this region. Nevertheless I sometimes just feel insecure about the lack of public transits from any airport and this airport is no exception to that.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

BKK need to be more efficient when it comes to handling passengers! However despite being an enormous airport I'd say it's fairly easy to navigate around (well signposted etc) and fairly clean. Journey out of BKK was a bit of a nightmare the woman at the check-in desk was quite rude. I was looking around for the resealable bags for the liquids in my hand luggage and none were to be found despite various empty desk slots for them and signs reminding you about the security procedure. Tried asking airport staff and they were completely useless. Decided to go through with it and by the X-Ray machine there was a stack of them! Luckily security and passport control went a little smoother and staff seemed friendlier. Plenty of shops in departure lounge which was nice but departure gate was such a long way from security!

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,Eric Simpson,NA,2006-07-23,I wasn’t sure what to expect on reaching Accra despite having read previous comments. It turned out to be a slightly surreal experience There are no airbridges. Passengers were bussed the short distance from the aircraft to the arrivals wing. A long poorly lit corridor led to the somewhat shabby immigration hall. Not perhaps the best first impression for arriving passengers. Clearing immigration and customs was a slow process however the officials seemed to go out of their way to give first time visitors a beaming “Welcome to Ghana”. Baggage reclaim proved to be a bit of a scrum. The public area of the arrivals level was much brighter and more modern in its décor but it felt somewhat empty and unfinished. The most intimidating aspect was being approached and asked for a tip to provide security by someone clearly eyeing up my luggage. Fortunately the driver meeting me arrived at that moment and whisked me off safely. Departing Accra provided a somewhat different experience. The outside of the Departures level was positively packed the reason quickly became apparent as only passengers were allowed inside the building. The appearance of the check in area was quite modern although it was not particularly well signposted and had a somewhat stark feel to it. Having joined a very long line at the KLM check in desks I was quickly directed to leave the queue to clear customs a requirement which departing passengers should undertake before checking in and which was not clearly indicated. Check-in was speedy thanks to a KLM official directing frequent flier card holders to the Business Class desks but passport control and security checks were slow. The large departure lounge has recently been refurbished it contains an attractive duty free shopping area and refreshment and seating areas. On a less positive note the seats were metal and lacking any form of cushioning were uncomfortable. Public address announcements were almost inaudible. Like the refurbished part of the arrivals level there were vast areas of unoccupied space perhaps awaiting future retail outlets or other passenger facilities. There are two departure gates one at either end of the lounge. With two flights boarding simultaneously through Gate 2 this is where things broke down. The corridor from the lounge to the departure gate was shabby and the toilets were in a disgusting condition. With 500 or so passengers crowded into the boarding lounge and no apparent PA system airline staff were pushing up and down shouting at the top of their voices trying to separate passengers into groups for boarding. Two busses were in use transferring passengers from the gate to the two aircraft. Although the process only took about an hour it was a chaotic hot and very uncomfortable experience. Sadly these last few yards took away the otherwise favourable impression of the Departures level of Kotoka International Airport. I hope that the refurbishment which is underway continues and quickly addresses the shortcomings particularly in the arrivals area.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The problem simply worsened exponentially now as the airport is undergoing ""renovations"" - in short the original VIP channel was shut down and they had to ration out the non VIP channels as the temporary VIP channels making the already chaotic scene even worse. Yesterday I queued for 1.5 hours to get through immigration. It was impossible to find where the queue started and which queue led to which counter there was hardly any staff to maintain the order. Security staff are poor mannered and sometimes can be very offensive. Once passing through security things started to get better: the food selection was good and plenty of cafes and shops.

The first issue was immediately being shouted at by a charming young lady handing out clear plastic bags before security. She just seemed to scream at everyone (and anyone) for no apparent reason. Next up was the carnage which was security a wait of 45 mins underneath the hottest roof spotlights in queues which went nowhere fast. The number of passengers waiting was actually quite low it just took an excessive amount of time. Finally once it was our turn to be screened we were met by incredibly rude staff. Now sometimes people say that staff are rude whilst they are simply just being efficient and doing the job with no fuss this wasn't the case. These security staff were frankly disgraceful rude remarks to simple questions and then providing zero information when the whole screening machine/process temporarily broke down. So got through security and looked forward to grabbing a coffee. Exited the security section to be met by a red barrier across the corridor it turns out that a toddler designed this section of terminal 3. If a plane is disembarking from some gates you cannot walk from one section to another speechless! To make this albeit slight inconvenience worse we had to listen to the two female ground staff who were guarding this red barrier and supervising the disembarkation of the British Airways Airbus (at 16.25ish on Tues 3rd Feb 2015). They seemed to relish being able to control a large group of passengers who were now running rather late thanks to security delays and who were now stuck between this red barrier and security. Some passengers were really late and asked if they could be let through to the gates it turns out that at least this is possible. But only once you had been spoken to like a child and told ""your too late"" and ""should have got to security earlier"" (really). They then spent the remainder of this lovely encounter laughing and joking about the plight of those late passengers in front of about 50 passengers. Brilliant. Finally boarded a nice peaceful aircraft after one of the rudest most uncomfortable airport experiences I have ever encountered. I will never fly from this terminal again at Manchester. Why is it so much worse than the other two terminals? Maybe I had a bad experience but not once did I come across a ""non-rude"" member of staff until reaching the departure gate.

almeria-airport,/airport-reviews/almeria-airport,Almeria Airport customer review,Mark Evans,NA,2005-03-22,Almeria is now gaining a higher profile having joined the Ryanair and easyJet networks. The single- building terminal now faces capacity limitations at peak periods and passengers are squeezed tight in the departure area when all five gates are required. The local Surbus route 20 connects LEI with the city centre some 8 km away. The fare is a very cheap EUR 0.80 and the service runs on a 40-minute headway on Mon-Sat. There is no provision for luggage and airport passengers have to mix it with the locals which can make for a crowded bus with limited seating accommodation.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On arrivals I can get from the plane to the rail station in about 15 minutes (hand luggage only).

Reasonably quick, then through the perfumery to queue up for a coffee. Some of the seats near the boarding area have now been relocated (why?) - and Vodafone signals are still poor inside the terminal. But we left on time, so no real issues. On arrival, the flight was late out of FRA. It always seems to take the ground handlers ages to sort out the jet pier here though, but at least it wasn't a bus this time. Long queues at passport control, but the e-passport machines actually worked OK. It took only 4 minutes from stepping off the aircraft to leaving the passport machines, whereas the week before it took 25 minutes at LHR T2! Luggage arrived within 10 min, not bad for BHX! Crowds hanging around at the exit were as annoying as ever, but I was soon on the bus. My car park estimate had been 23:45 and I was later than that, but obviously their system knew of the late flight and I was soon on my way home. Overall an entirely acceptable travel experience - if only LH operated more flights from here!

No one takes any sort of card payment and the cash exchange place charges a $10 flat-fee commission. Food is typical airport prices and then some. Restaurant staff abrupt and had to be prompted to bring the change after paying.

On the 25th October there were 100's of people inconvenienced like myself and it took over an hour to go through the process. I questioned the reason for this with an airport representative and she said the problem was management and the way it is run. So paradoxically the security screening process ""improves"" but the passenger experience does not. I agree with this and there needs to be step change in management thinking to focus more on customer satisfaction.

At 22h30 I was able to hear an announcement telling to go to the gate 2 (the visual information system did not work). There was a long queu already waiting so I went back to the hall. The next message heard was that another flight announced for gate 2 was redirected to gate 1. So a flock of people walked away and I went to the gate once more without having to wait for the entry control. I was asked for the ticket and the same dialogue began as before. They said I could not fly unless I would show a ticket. In order to show what they meant they order another passenger to show 'a ticket'. It was a flight confirmation on a shabby piece of fax paper. I had left the confirmation in the checked-in baggage but due to a lucky incident I found a preliminary confirmation in my handbag which was accepted.

At the terminal we were subjected to long queues for security but finally when I did manage to reach the duty free it was so expensive that I missed shopping in my Dutch hometown. The terminal is huge but I did manage to reach my gate smoothly. The food is just expensive. One chicken burger meal at the Burger King was 10 dollars and the staff were rude. Overall an average experience and I fly mostly out of Delhi which is the mother of rudeness for local passengers.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,Alastair Wilson,United Kingdom,2015-03-20,Has to be the worst Airport in Europe at the moment. Returning a Hire car is a joke as the traffic around the airport is horrific and the car hire is off site so you have to pile onto a bus which adds even more time. The queues at check in are biblical especially with EasyJet speedy boarding is more than value for money particularly on a Ski transfer day. Having done both I think it is now easier (and cheaper) to Hire from the French side and if you have to go on Swiss motorways pre-order the toll pass. On a ski transfer day leave yourself lots of extra time then add an hour to that and you should avoid undue stress. Finally as others have said security is an absolute bun fight. I will be avoiding Geneva for the foreseeable unless something is done about this pandemonium.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It's airport however is the 7th ring of hell. Departing Antigua though you speak to 8 different people. Check in does not warn you of the departure tax (which is now 50$ USD - a previous review stated it used to be $25 and was to be eliminated - guess that didn't happen). Why the hell can't they get the airline to collect this for them - it's cash only as well. There are numerous checks lines etc before you get anywhere near the plane - and they were calling 'final boarding' before we even checked in? It took an hour and a half to get through the building. The flight was delayed 40 minutes since there were still more people behind us scrambling to get on the flight.

Just push and shove. Probably 200 yards long. Overheating causes passengers to faint. A TSA rep charges into the crowd shouting and closes a line. Eventually we arrive at the 4 agents. Surly at best.

For example in connection HEL-WAW-POZ operated by LOT Polish Airlines all the passengers are screened in HEL but also in WAW which is idiotic. Also on the return way (POZ-WAW-HEL) everybody is checked in WAW again. So doesn't matter from where and to where you go in WAW you have another screening anyway. And the rules are these same for example no liquids even thought they were bought in HEL or in POZ in secure area. So no shopping before WAW transit.

This airport has some negative and positive sides in my opinion. On arrival into HEL to connect to a flight to TMP within a very tight schedule I nearly missed my connecting flight due to long queue at immigration counters (all international arrivals at the same time). Airport staff did nothing to help those with tight connection time and were pretty hopeless. I were told that if I missed my connecting flight the airline would put me on the next available flight. Why can't they have a designated line/counter for passengers with tight connecting time? At the end I was running to my gate and was one of the last remaining passengers to board the connecting bus to remote aircraft stand. If they want to become a better transit airport in Europe either they need to look into this or Finnair cannot sell ticket with short connecting time (45 mins). On the plus side it offers relaxation lounge with sleeping cells for passengers. Yes you can actually lay down on a hotel-style bed and sleep with curtain lowered down for privacy!

Arrival and getting through customs is a fuss and very slow although the security people are friendly I got my passport stamped as well as the visa when I asked (nice free souvenir). Toilets were a bit smelly and not totally functioning but did have toilet paper (Gents). Stuff is sold in both duty free shop and kiosks around the departure lounge. Note as expected the duty free shop is much cheaper. You can only pay in CUC's - or at an exorbitant markup by credit card. Good views of the apron from the lounge and the only downside is if you are a fervent anti-smoker. This is cuba they sell cigars you can work it out! Tip a few people had stuff confiscated from their hand luggage tobacco and spirits - I think it was all stuff that the proper export tax hadn't been paid on. Keep a few CUC's to slip the staff at the airport and they also really apreciated a drink or two. As everywhere the porters are quite bullish.

baku-airport,/airport-reviews/baku-airport,Baku Airport customer review,Frederik Oegema,NA,2008-08-15,I have been through Baku airport twice first in August last year and again in July this year in and out both times. Frankly my experience has been a lot better than most of what you see from other comments here: yes it's not a great airport in terms of facilities despite all the space the bureaucracy is not all too transparent or efficient either and you have to watch out for scams and extortion but during all my visits I have met neutral or even friendly staff at passport customs and check-in and no attempted requests for bribery. Upon arrival the visa procedure (for Westerners) is a bit odd: first get a stamp at the passport desk then back to the visa desk and then through to the passport desk again. Some people were not aware of this and queued up at the visa desk first and were then sent to the back of the passport queue first and then again the back of visa queue so that it took them an hour extra to get through. I was advised to sit at the front of the plane on my way in and pre-fill the visa application form in order to be at the front of the passport/visa queue; in reality I was all the way back but in the end this didn't make any difference as the people who were at the front still had to wait just as long as me for the luggage to arrive. Do bring your two passport pictures with you if you don't want to pay 10 dollars (or euros although that's worth 50% more) for them at the airport. The triple security checks at check- in are just a joke as I managed to 'smuggle' both a pocket knife and a bottle of water in my hand luggage through all 3 of them (I found out afterwards). I do suspect that my relatively good treatment may have to do with the fact I was flying European airlines (BA and Lufthansa respectively) on both occasions if that can be useful advice for anyone.

As a NZ citizen I planned to travel to Chicago. I submitted an online form 4 days before boarding. I disclosed the fact that 15 years ago I was denied a visa from my native country but was allowed to enter the US twice after that. I arrived at 'International arrivals' in LA they refused to let me go further and sent me to an 'immigration review'. The 'immigration officer' apologised for the inconvenience saying it was a mistake and I should have been allowed to enter straight away. From my point of view I had no problems found the entire process to be appropriate. But that was my only positive experience from Terminal 2. I waited at immigration clearance post for 40 minutes despite my pleas that I was about to lose my flight to Chicago. Two persons that arrived after me and had no transit flights were given priority. The woman who was co-ordinating the whole allocation process was very rude and obstructive. Next stop : the ""Connecting flight Drop baggage"". About 200 people waiting in line. The same woman that gave me trouble at Immigration clearance was now monitoring the 'Drop-in process'. I pleaded with her to let me go in the front to make my flight that I was detained by error for such a long time at Immigration. She said that she knew my whole story but that I have to 'wait in line' like everyone else'. After waiting in line I finally arrived at the counter and was told that the check-in for my flight to Chicago had closed. Told that I should run quickly to terminal 7 because they arranged for me to board the plane without check-in. After running from terminal 2 to terminal 7 I was told that no one contacted them and that I should not board. Afterwards I had a good experience with the personnel from terminal 7 but this cannot make up for my overall experience.

Check in is OK but you could see confused people trying to work out what to do. We were waiting on a flight to Edinburgh which when we sat down in the lounge showed as ""wait in lounge"" on the arrival/departure board. It then announced a slight delay of around 15 mins but still advised to wait in the lounge. As the time due to depart approached the message remained the same. Suddenly out of the blue the message read ""Boarding at gate 6"". When you are travelling with young children you simply do not need this kind of thing. Harassed and upset we headed for the gate as quickly as possible to find that we were neither at gate 6 nor boarding. We were at gate 5 and the plane was nowhere near boarding. Another reason why I will be reluctant to use this airport in future is the DLR. When we arrived on a Saturday it wasn't working. A bus service replaces it but does not seem to go any further than Canary Wharf. We decided to take it to Canning Town then take the Jubilee line into town but again travelling with children this is not convenient.

As a frequent traveller I felt this response was extremely rude given that on both occasions I went to the gate at the given time on my boarding pass.

I found this being my first visit all staff to be helpful and speak reasonable English. How many airports have smart staff in white gloves at the foot of the escalators bowing to you as ascend! It may seem slightly confusing at first owing the Japanese signage. But there is always an English equivalent even if sometimes in smaller letters. There is an excellent Airport layout leaflet with good maps of all the facilities. The airport is on a man-made island connected by a causeway to Rinku Town. The only hotel at the airport is the Nikko Hotel (quite expensive). A cheaper and just as comfortable option is the Washington Airport Hotel 2 mins walk from the Rinku Town station There is a hotel shuttle but not during the middle of the day. Otherwise its a mere 8 min train ride from either train line at the Airport station. Rinkyku Town is the first stop and the hotel is very easy to find once you come out. I found Immigration to be polite and efficient and I did not queue very long at all. There are excellent left luggage lockers for all sizes. If too early for check-in (or just enjoy planes and people watching) it is well worth taking the shuttle bus (100 yen each way) from Bus Stop 1 at Ground Level to the Skyview observation complex at the end of one of the runways. This superb facility has out door terraces stunning views of the landing and departing aircraft a very reasonable priced cafe and ""The Concorde Experience"" which is a restaurant serving meals on aircraft style trays out of old Ansett Airlines of Australia meal carts!

Do expect delays especially later in the day: more flights are scheduled in and out of New York than actually fit especially if there's any kind of weather or other problem (Air Canad will not let you book a flight online into or out of LGA JFK or EWR without showing a warning that there are likely to be delays due to weather and New York air traffic control). Not a big deal if you're doing a nonstop but worth keeping in mind if you're going to be making a connection.

Most of the experiences have been pleasant until recently. 1). Customs: As I was going through departure security check point I was asked to show my bag after the bag scan. The staff there dug through my toiletry bag with his dirty gloves without informing of what he's looking for. Firstly things in toiletry bags are generally more personal. It would be much more pleasant if he could ask before taking them out. Secondly those gloves he's wearing were protecting him but had touched luggage and many other things it would be much cleaner if they could have been more considerate and asked the passenger to show the items inside (at least I would have gladly done so) instead of running his gloves through the items inside and leaving prints on them. Thirdly that wasn't the bag that he was looking for. Eventually he told me what he was looking for and I took it out for him right away. Wish he could have communicated that at the very beginning. That way it would be more efficient and much more pleasant (and sanitary of course). 2). Immigration: I've noticed that recently immigration staff at HKG would throw a passenger's passport back at the end of immigration check. I had seen such behaviour at other airports before but never at HKG until recently. Hopefully that's just one singular rare event. Although the immigration officer was skilled enough to have the passport still land on the desk I would much rather my passport not being thrown around at all.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I had to get in a bus from the plane to a station to wait for another bus to a different terminal. Then go through security again even though we never left the airport. Then take another bus to the plane! Returning through Heathrow was just as bad. This time it was two different buses a train and security check with an added carry-on search. My bag sat waiting to be searched while employees ignored it and were just standing around.

In the terminal there were no screens or signs directing people to their respective connecting flights. Airport staff shouted out names of African cities and asked as many passengers as they could. Thumbs up for commitment and being helpful to lost or confused travellers. I was surprised to see my luggage arrive at my final destination but the transfer worked fine.

But I wouldn't want to be a transit passenger here; there aren't enough seats the air side food options are dismal there's hardly anywhere to plug in electronic equipment and the shopping is surprisingly poor; if I was in transit for more than a couple of hours I'd seriously consider paying for Oryx Lounge access (and maybe that's the intention). That every flight I've taken to and from Doha seems to involve a long bus drive from the gate to and from the actual plane is also a minus - and often confusing to people who haven't used the airport before.

In San Francisco we were given a brief explanation about getting our luggage near Canada Customs and having to transfer it ourselves. Once through Customs (the line was very short so there was no problem - but getting there from the plane was a long walk) on the way to picking up our luggage we asked one of the information people (right beside carousel 25) about getting our luggage to our connecting flight. She was totally useless!!! She told us we had to exit the terminal and go back in to the check-in area. That made no sense to us.

Of course the helper overheard us and then asked for our boarding cards and then changed her mind and agreed with us!

On the positive side it's one of the fastest airports to get through on both departure and arrival it's clean the layout is very easy to understand and navigate and it has a free rest are with lots and lots of plugs and free unlimited wi-fi. The facilities especially restaurants in the passenger area are very poor and expensive even as the selection and prices are above standard before the security checkpoints: a bizarre choice on part of whoever designed the airport. There are no trains (yet - I'm told they're building the tracks) but the taxis at the airport are clean fast and cheap and there are a lot of them (it costs about 20 EUR to get to downtown Prague and it takes about 40 minutes). There is one thing that just boggles the mind which is that Czech Airlines flights make people get off the plane on arrival squeeze all the passengers onto a single bus and drive them to arrivals.

Originally I thought this was a one time thing but over the years I have lost 3-4 bottles in that airport.

Arrived exhausted past midnight after long haul from IAD to find long lines at Passport Control. Male official very unwelcoming. I had lost my boarding pass and he gave me a very hard time because supposedly I could not prove what flight I had arrived on. Even after I produced my itinerary showing both the UAL and CO confirmation numbers he would not move me forward. He became quite angry when I told him I could not understand his English which was quite poor. Found a friendly and helpful attendant who came to explain the merger to him and he finally relented. I noticed he had also given two people ahead of me a difficult time and as a result there was a cluster of us just waiting around his counter to see what he would do next. They need more friendly immigration agents if they are to line the passport control process with their tourism promotion. Despite this used BKK again several times during month long stay in the area and other agents' politeness made up for this hopefully one-off nasty agent.,NA,NA,NA,4,1,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

The airport is ok although we mainly have trouble with the buses from plane to terminal and vice versa. Several flights get 'parked' in random positions which throws the bus pick-up schedules out the window. We have sat on the tarmac and stood in the connecting shutes waiting for transfer on and off the plane for over an hour sometimes. Excuses like 'the bus is broken' wear a bit thin when you see dozens of them zipping about outside the windows unloading other planes. Sometimes the pilot fed up with waiting has moved the plane nearer the terminal so passengers can get off and walk.

The transit hotel where passengers can get a room shower massage internet/entertainment and something to eat seems like a good idea to me though I didn't check it out personally. It did seem to me that ICN is more like a duty- free mall - lots of designer names and prices to match. There are also lots of places to eat and their prices are also high (I paid $2.00 for a can of soda pop). The terminal itself is very clean and bright the waiting areas are large with big flat-screen TVs (usually with Korean programming) and the seating is comfortable. I found at least 2 internet kiosks there are 3 money exchanges and the employees are friendly and helpful.

First of all announcements about departures are made in both Slovak and English with the exception of Slovak charter flights which are often (but not always) announced only in Slovak as the passengers are Slovak and perhaps Czech nationals. On the other hand arrival announcements are only in Slovak as there are quite a few monitors/screens which are directly linked to the system here at OPC and hence automatically display current information. The arrival announcements are made in Slovak as they are not aimed at the passengers (they have the monitors) but at different workers at the airport i.e. mechanics catering bus drivers as we bus passengers to/from the A/C with some minor exceptions baggage handlers etc). Announcements in the gate are made if the airline wants them and these are made at least in Slovak and English. I would also like to state that often we make announcements also in other languages ie. for the twice weekly SU flight to SVO also in Russian and sometimes in Hungarian Italian German French but that only if unnecessary and very seldom.

On my recent trips (three times) immigration control takes between 30-45 mins to clear which is unacceptable these days especially given that most of the other lanes are quiet. Simple resource re- allocation would be sufficient but this seems beyond common sense. On my last trip a survey was being conducted as to how long it would take to wait in a queue; a confirmation of the obviously visible in my view; suffice to say once through immigration baggage is a mess with all the bags landed some time earlier.

Based on experience I will avoid at all costs in future. Main issue is the lack of security staff and machines once going through immigration relative to number of passengers using the airport (exacerbated by stricter US Flight requirements). The security section is immediately after immigration (and I mean only 5-10 meters) and as a result the lines can back up quickly. It got to the point on the day we went through that they stopped processing passengers through immigration so the back log could clear meaning some passengers were late for their flights. Brisbane if you want to play with the big boys your International Airport needs serious work to compete.

The International arrivals is tucked away underneath somewhere. Arrivals and check in are on the same level so it can be busy. The next floor has a spacious and fairly new departures area with a couple of uninspiring restaurants and shops. One floor up again is a rather cute observation area - large huge windows and a few information boards - its a cool place to hang with kids and would be even better if the airport was busier.

Imagine our confusion and dismay when we arrived there to find queues of people waiting to purchase tickets. Never have I been confronted by such a difficult confusing and unfriendly method to find conveyance from one terminal to another in an airport. With assistance from a train agent in the area we were able to purchase tickets and wrestle our bags through the gates and get to T1.

alicante-airport,/airport-reviews/alicante-airport,Alicante Airport customer review,Ian Waddell,United Kingdom,2012-04-29,Whilst the new terminal has the general ambience of better-known international airports corners have been cut in the detailing probably due to the Spanish economic situation. The car rental situation is quite ridiculous. I have been through the new terminal 3 times since it opened and the route from the car rental desks to the car pick-up area is confusing without any adequate signage. There are always groups of bewildered people wandering around lost. You have either to go down by escalator from arrivals cross the road and up in a lift or up in a lift from arrivals to a bridge cross over and then down in a lift (the levels are numbered differently on each side of the bridge). The car rental booths need to be better staffed to alleviate the long queues that build up. Everything is pre-booked so they know what to expect.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Once you eventually get past security and the long queues instead of arriving in the main departure area where you can check your flight you arrive in the middle of a winding shopping precinct! It is complete chaos! There are so many people walking behind/alongside you that it would be impossible to look round the shops anyway. Then once you eventually get into the departure area there is not enough seating. It would be impossible to then go back and look in the shops due to the amount of people coming through security. The shops are completely in the wrong area. I cannot understand why it was designed this way it makes no sense at all.

Oversized shiny modern. Due to its huge size one has to walk quite far through the whole airport to reach the rail station (oversized as well) which is located at the opposite end of the arrivals / departure hall. Good and fast connection to the city centres of Halle and Leipzig but very unfairly calculated fare - they let you cross several fare zones so you have to pay more than for comparable distances in that region. Because of new restrictions for landing and taking off after 11 pm - interestingly there are NO restrictions for cargo flights - many budget airlines have cancelled their services to this airport and now only few major European cities are still served by non-stop flights . Very sad since the alternatives now are Altenburg Airport or one of the Berlin airports.

Even at that time we were at the back of a long queue and there was just one very slow girl checking in all the passengers for the flight. After nearly two hours a supervisor appeared and opened a second desk for those of us at the back of the queue. Otherwise we would still be waiting ! No apologies were offered and we sensed that this is normal procedure. We had no time to get a drink or use the facilities. We had to rush to another long line to pass through the security check where the same relaxed couldn't care less attitude was evident and from there we rushed to our gate where yet another long sweaty queue greeted us.

The two terminals (not domestic vs international as you might think but Saudia vs foreign airlines) are about 20 kms apart on a ring road that circumnavigates the airport (one of the world's largest in land area). Because my cab driver took me to the incorrect terminal (not entirely his fault I admit) I ended up missing my flight. To re-book on NAS Air Sama and Saudia meant standing for an hour in various lines. After being told by Saudia I could waitlist downstairs (there didn't seem any way to get downstairs nor any rationale as to why waitlisting required one to be in the Arrivals area) I ended up deciding to pack it in and go back to my Jeddah hotel. I hope I have better luck tomorrow. At any rate both the North and South Terminals need a major renovation. They are entirely similar to the worst Indian airports like Delhi or Mumbai.

Immigration and Customs procedures went quickly. This is the second arrival from an international flight to ATL and I can say it's pretty awful which is surprising since they have a fairly new international terminal! The walk from the gate to immigration can take 20 minutes which could be a problem for someone in a wheelchair or any disability. Immigration lines are long for foreign passengers but they do have new computer scanners for US citizens which help make it faster. However waiting for luggage was another 20 minute wait and I'm premium with Delta and my bags were among the first to come off. Then getting to the domestic terminal to get to MARTA or local ATL transport is another shuttle bus service away. The airport is huge and quite impressive but this new international terminal has its own separate exit from the domestic terminal and is really a separate entity. I will consider another international gateway in the future. Connecting to domestic flights is a bit easier than what I experienced but I can say that ATL is not a smooth experience especially after coming off a 12 hour flight from Tokyo.

The first time I assumed since my airline allowed me to have my boarding pass on my phone/email that I could print it out at the check in or service counters. This is a big mistake as some people have already said. Armed guards will not allow you into the airport without this piece of paper. You can print in an office next to the airport if you have cash. Second time I learned that even with a printed boarding pass it is not enough. If you have no luggage (just hand luggage) you still need to queue for another boarding pass. Both situations could have been avoided by clear communication at time of checking in or at the airport. Leave plenty of time for queuing. You will queue to get into the airport to get your boarding pass to get through passport check to get through security military-style to get through security airline-style oh and there is one final check at the gate of the plane. On Friday I saw somebody refused past that check because there laptop bag had a security tag but no security stamp. I'm not opposed to queuing but the hostility is incredible and the process is slow. I have a lasting memory of seeing 3 booths out of 10 occupied with long queues. One of these the guy was having a nap with his legs on the desk.

On arrival we entered the terminal building where there were toilets (thank goodness) before we went through immigration - which took only a few minutes once we'd filled in the form. Once we'd grabbed our bags then we had to put them on a scanner and then out into the warm Maldivian air and over to our hotel's info desk. On the way our experience was similarly relaxed and quick with check in and immigration taking only 10 minutes.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
belfast-airport,/airport-reviews/belfast-airport,Belfast Airport customer review,G Raper,United Kingdom,2013-10-29,Security staff at this airport are horrendous. Have a stoma passport but official refused to even consider looking at it. This contains information regarding my condition and what can be done in public and when there should be a private 'frisking'. Have never been treated like this at any other airport. And as for the search this too was far too personal. No one got through without being searched whether the machine bleeped or not. Officials were surly and very aggressive and do not give Belfast airport a good recommendation. It spoilt what was a great visit to a beautiful city.,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Steve Hayes,New Zealand,2009-09-04,I have used AKL eight times this year for various trips and each time has been a breeze. Short queues generally the trip from plane to curbside has been completed in under 30 minutes. I am aware of bag screening requirements. However if I were from overseas I am sure I would benefit from more prominent signage in the in the arrivals area where you have to have all your luggage screened by MAF to check for unauthorised plant material or food. I noticed on my last trip in that some passengers appeared to be unaware of the requirement and had to be corralled back to get their bags checked. The land side departure area is undergoing some refurbishment at the moment and as a result space is a bit tight. But once through immigration it is all good. Plenty of reasonably priced duty free options. Good lounges if you have access. Air NZ one has just been done up and is very nice indeed. For smokers there is even an outdoor smoking area.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,3,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,Sonya Snyder,Norway,2013-12-02,When I departed this airport the wait in security was long at least 45 min. To add insult to injury we had to endure listening to the airport employees repeatedly shout instructions for security procedures. Employees were also incredibly unfriendly to those who could not speak English very well as they didn't understand instructions. I'm sure it's annoying when passengers don't listen to instructions however a friendlier more polite atmosphere would be a great improvement. I am American but live in Norway and was extremely embarrassed by my countrymen's behaviour and poor quality of service.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

casablanca-airport,/airport-reviews/casablanca-airport,Casablanca Airport customer review,Robert Halverson,United States,2011-12-18,This is Morocco's largest and main airport but it is horrible. We arrived from Dubai on Emirates after a 9 hour flight. Immigration lines were about an hour long even though they had several wickets open. Then they randomly screened only half the luggage. There are few stores once you get out into the arrivals hallway. Just a bunch of taxi bullying you into using them. The rail station is downstairs with few signs it is dark and dingy. Trains run every hour and people just abandon their luggage carts in the walkway by the train doors so it becomes an obstacle course to get on and off. No staff collect the carts. When we arrived by train to fly out it was just as bad. They security-screen your luggage as you enter the airport but don't seem to care if you set the metal detector off. We arrived 5 hours in advance. Most PA announcements are in French and Moroccan Arabic very few in English. The check-in opened 3 hours in advance of the flight and we got through Immigration and Customs easily enough. However the departure lounge is horrible. Over priced duty free shops and an overpriced Internet cafe ($10 per hour). There are no lounge chairs. All chairs have arms so you can not lie down across open seats. When our Lufthansa flight was boarding they funnelled everyone out into the gateway outside and then stopped us. Avoid at all costs!,NA,NA,NA,1,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2014-04-16,LGW-DXB-BKK round trip Emirates all flights. My connections were 2 hrs 45 mins and 2 hrs 20 mins respectively. I made the connecting flight on both occasions - but only just. The outbound leg was late in and parking at a remote stand followed by a 25 minute bus drive and ridiculously slow transit security meant that my connecting flight was at Final Call by the time I set foot in the departure hall. A mad dash to the gate and on the flight as it was closing. The return leg was a similar story but at least the A380's seem to be able to park at gates but with touching down 1 hour late and Emirates requiring you to be at your Departure Gate 45 minutes before Departure time the whole thing gets very frantic compounded with bussing and terminal transfers. A few years ago a 1.5 hour connection was OK in DXB - not any more. 2.5 hour minimum and 3+ hours to be comfortable. Terminal Transfers and Security are NOT good and the extreme amount of bussing inflicted on Emirates just turns the whole thing into a very stressful connection compared to Abu Dhabi or Bahrain. Less of a journey more of a sport.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
venice-treviso-airport,/airport-reviews/venice-treviso-airport,Venice Treviso Airport customer review,J Gillespie,United Kingdom,2012-01-03,Flew from here on 1st January - what a mess. There was a huge queue for outgoing passengers to have their documents checked and bags put into measuring frames. Then you filter through to line up for security before finally descending to departure gates from hell - cramped with competing passenger queues intermingling due to lack of space. The initial queue was so bad that they resorted to calling out particular flights which were almost due to close and getting those people through. Two baggage drops were open which were very slow so if you had bags you had to queue there first before joining the documents queue. Truly dreadful experience and one which we will not repeat.

linz-airport,/airport-reviews/linz-airport,Linz Airport customer review,Hendrik Bower,NA,2006-10-12,The airport is tiny the shops are few and expensive even when compared to other small Austrian airports such as Salzburg. The opening times are poor by western standards (this is a general trend in the country). There is a departure room at Linz where once you have gone in you cannot go out . There is no prior warning of this fact there are armed police there to stop you leaving something to do with international law depends where your destination country is. It is literally one room before the runway with one drinks machine (poor) and one food machine (poor). The airport is terrible but it may still be the best option if you want a cheap flight to that area of Austria.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,A Veccio,Belgium,2015-05-13,I connected in LAX on my trip from LHR to SAN from TBIT to T4. I don't have much experience about connecting through US airports except international connections in MIA and had no particular expectations having heard how messy it could seem. Immigration was somewhat disturbing as agents came in front of the line you are waiting in and ask if there are any US citizens in that line. If so they are kindly authorised to cut the line and clear immigration before anyone else. I guess they know better and usually open different desks for US and non US citizen apart otherwise I don't understand this way of handling things. After that I collected my bag and cleared customs really quickly (no line) and re-dropped my bag so it could continue to my connection. After that I got out and felt like I was literally out of the airport with cars driving by and shuttle waiting for passengers. This is the moment one should be aware of: know before your flight which terminal you are supposed to go to as there is not that much of an explanation. My outbound flight was a domestic hop with American Eagle which departs from a remote satellite of T4. So if happening be aware that once in T4 you will have to wait for another shuttle that takes you to a mini terminal with a couple of gates from where your plane will departs (and adds 15-20 minutes before you reach your actual gate). It's not that I would particularly recommend LAX but it manages to handle a lot of passengers which may have its downside. If connecting there know where you are going print a map avoid tight connection relax and you'll be out of there as quick as you can.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Took 3 hours to get through the visa/customs debacle. Left on Monday 15th September 2014 and took 40 mins to check in go through all of the checks and find our departure gate which did change 3 times while we waited but thanks to these reviews we were prepared and just sat it out and listened to the announcements. Take plenty of rupiahs to the airport - food and coffee is very expensive. I bought two sandwiches and two mango smoothies and then did not have the $30.00! I don't know what the solution is to avoiding the busy periods on arrival - maybe travel agents have a heads up on ""good"" times to arrive and avoid the longest queue I have ever seen or been in in my life. Oh and my husband went off to see if he could ""pay"" for a faster entry and was told yes - $100 each to jump the queue which we declined more for fear of crowd rebellion than the exorbitant price.",NA,NA,NA,1,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,Noel Richards,Spain,2014-03-04,This is an appalling airport to travel from. I used the rental car facility. The signs for the car drop-off are unclear. There are warnings that if you stop to try and get your bearings you may get fined. The car rental drop- off is in an uncovered area at least 300 yards from the terminal building. There are no baggage carts! If it is raining which is most days in Liverpool you arrive at check-in soaked. The security process is slow stressful and inefficient. We waited for 30 minutes to clear security. Only a few lanes were open at the busiest time of the day - why? We were directed to Lane 1 and then after waiting there were redirected to the other end of the security hall - exactly where we had come from. I live in Palma de Mallorca where the security even at the height of the tourist season is smooth and easy. It is rare to take more than 15 minutes. So why is it impossible for a tiny regional UK airport to do the same. Avoid this airport if possible.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
