aer-lingus,/lounge-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus Gold Circle Business Class Lounge - Dublin Airport,Patrick Jordan,Ireland,2011-09-13,The new lounge spans two floors with views of the apron A water feaTUre dominates one wall. There are work stations and complimentary wifi. The range of food on offer during the early morning is sufficient and a bar service is available.

aer-lingus,/lounge-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus Gold Circle Business Class Lounge - London Heathrow Airport,Patrick Jordan,NA,2009-03-18,The range of food and beverages is reasonable. The main attraction of this lounge is that it is beside boarding gates. This evening I noticed the red wine bottle was empty. I asked the attendant to replace it but she wasn't able to open the new bottle. I can understand a bottle of wine being used but to have a staff member unable to open another is beyond belief.

This has got to be the pokiest grubbiest lounge I have ever seen or used. The food was soggy and not fresh and the decor is not very good. Gives a feeling of boredom and gloom.

Door understaffed & young man at desk very obviously nicer to male clients than myself as a solo middle aged woman. Lounge is poorly set up rather like a bus station where toomany travellers require seats for their bags & coats. Food selection is the worst I've seen in a lounge. Drinks selection is better but they sure do not hurry to put out the bubbly. The latest empty has been sitting on a counter for a half hour now. In general lots of empties left around to point some travellers are clearing up instead.

air-canada,/lounge-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada Maple Leaf Business Class Lounge - London Heathrow Airport,Stephen Lloyd,United Kingdom,2015-05-29,Having flow out of T2 twice on Eva Air recently this review covers both visits. Eva use the Air Canada lounge along with a couple of other Star Alliance carriers. It is close (2-3 minutes) to the boarding gates but suffers like some others on T2 in that it's a fair hike from immigration to the gates/lounge. One inside it is very modern and comfortable with a nice bar and service good range of food and good personal space. Travelling on a Wednesday evening there were not many people in the lounge and it felt quite and comfortable.

air-canada,/lounge-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada Maple Leaf Business Class Lounge - Calgary Airport,D Carter,Canada,2015-01-02,"I am always pretty pleased with the Air Canada Lounges (Vancouver is very good and so is Edmonton). Calgary has always been a large and crowded one. They have just done some renovations and while it looks much better (and the staff are invariably courteous and helpful) there is one down-side. There is no longer a self-serve bar. Been through there at least six times in the last month. When the Lounge is not too busy the bar is just fine (they will mix your drink or pour your wine) BUT when the Lounge is busy you end up standing along the bar with people several travellers deep... trying to get the bartender's attention. Once you have it it is very good - not sure if they are trying to control alcohol cost by not letting you ""help yourself"" but it certainly (only when the Lounge is busy as it often is) slows you down. I only had a 35 minute change of planes and could not get anything for the first 15minutes - waited at the bar got my wine drank half and had to leave. Again - it looks great but it is tougher if you are in a hurry. Staff still very courteous.",AIR CANADA MAPLE LEAF BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Calgary Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,4,4,2,3,4,4,5,1

We went out of our way to fly Air Canada back home from Europe. Had a 6-hour layover in Montreal which was nice. Easy access to the lounge staff speaks English and French (and possibly some other languages) quite fluently. Food in the lounge was not up to par (about 900 ml of cold pasta salad and some other similarly sized items were available for everybody). I went downstairs to the Burger King. Other than that however the internet is fast and functional there is a television and a wide selection of alcoholic beverages in an open-bar format.

air-france,/lounge-reviews/air-france,Air France Business Class Lounge - Paris CDG Airport,A Smith,France,2014-10-04,It's worth noting that it very much depends on the terminal; typically if you are in 2E and 2F it's good level of lounge with showers fresh food coffee/ tea internet and power - all a business traveller wants. If you go to a lesser terminal 2D for example there really is nothing more than a seat coffee and power. It's worth noting that if you do have a long haul flight and you arrive before 2pm you can use the lounge in the arrivals area of 2C.. this has around 6 showers and the usual... not the most comfortable but the staff are polite and it's a hell of allot better waiting for your TGV (Train) in here after a shower.,AIR FRANCE BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Paris CDG Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,2,3,3,3,2,1,2,3,0

It is divided in several zones depending on what you are looking for. Usually AF lounges are not very good for the catering but this one offers a wide choice of food and drinks.

air-france,/lounge-reviews/air-france,Air France Business Class Lounge - Paris CDG Airport,D Rose,United States,2012-05-21,I don't understand the Air France business class product at all particularly compared to similarly priced business class products like British Airways or Virgin Atlantic (which actually are less expensive). At a BA or Virgin lounge you get a fully stocked and staffed bar. At Air France the self- service selections at Air France are limited. At a BAR or Virgin Lounge I can order a full sit down meal. At Air France I got to chose from slices of cold pork some cheese some crackers and potato chips.

Staff in lounge very friendly food was sandwiches and nuts. Food well presented bar staffed at all times this I thought was not good as I like to get my own drinks. Showers great and very refreshing water hot and shower room was well cleaned. If I had one complaint I would say the seating looks like old school chairs. Great views from the big windows of the aircraft coming and going. I also imagine that with a A380 the lounge would be cramped and very busy - Lucky only 2 B777's on my departure day.,AIR FRANCE BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Washington Dulles Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,3,5,4,4,5,4,5,1

air-india,/lounge-reviews/air-india,Air India Maharaja Business Class Lounge - Mumbai Airport,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,Visited whilst in international transit. Good points - this new lounge is huge has a varied selection of seats including recliners shower facilities are good OKAY selection of reading material and half a dozen internet terminals for free internet access. The bad points are that whilst Air India's website shows alcohol is available to international travellers none is available or on show. In fact there's one small fridge with water pepsi 7 up fanta or fruit juice - that's it. The food selection is similarly limited and the hot selection was particularly unsatisfactory (2 veg 1 meat - however there appeared to be no chicken in this!). Wifi is the airports and not the lounges - limited and very slow - had to use the dedicated terminals instead.

Good points - plenty of seating good wi-fi newspaper selection tv drinks selection notified when it was time to board. Bad points - except for the shami kebabs the food selection was poor and in the case of the sheesh kebabs revolting. Had the crackers and crisps instead once the shami had run out. The staff were overstretched (there appeared to be only 2 of them) and as a result items were not cleared or refreshed.

I went to the Maharaja lounge by gate 3 passed security on 14th April 2012. I would not recommend this lounge to anyone. I arrived in this Room full of mosquitoes old worn out furniture with people trying to sleep on the worn out shabby settees I do not know how they could sleep with all that noise and constant phone going off and people just entering the lounge asking questions about other air lines. They will only serve you water or juice as apparently they will not serve alcohol to business or first class passengers on International flights since 1st April so a dry room. When I arrived in this excuse of a lounge there were about 20 children screaming and running around without any supervision apparently they were being looked after by a member of staff so they were not booked as business or first class passengers she then moved them to a more suitable area after about 10 minutes. You have to ask for water or juice. I asked for tea and they do serve this. Snacks are from a microwave and again you have to ask but I would not recommend these over microwave snacks.

air-new-zealand,/lounge-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand Business Class Lounge - Melbourne Airport,M Duffy,Australia,2014-10-04,Thai Airways uses Air NZ's Koru lounge at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport. TG462 departs at 0030 and it is sad to relate that this excellent lounge has very little to offer the business class traveler at the end of the day. Eats such as they were consisted of a very tired salad bowl a few biscuits and a bowl of fruit salad. In the drinks department there was no chardonnay only Marlborough Sav/blanc in the white range and one brand of red (cab/sav). I have used this lounge on several occasions earlier in the day when it is sparkling clean with plenty of food and drinks choices. I got the impression that the staff just wanted the Thai travelers out of the lounge ASAP in order to close the facility for the day. In fact the whole of Tullamarine Airport at that late hour is a shambles.

The check in desk upon entering is staffed by Alitalia employees who were fairly friendly. Since it was early (7:30 a.m.) we didn't expect too much. We weren't disappointed. The lounge is very dated with a bland color scheme - white and orange. There was a service station manned by a very unhappy looking gent who despite his sour demeanor provided efficient - albeit robotic - service. Coffee (American) was available but the cup is one that is normally used for cappuccino so not very large. Cappuccinos and espressos are available on request. The ""food"" consisted of cold cereals sweet croissants and bread/butter with jam. Yogurts were also available but without spoons. Since it was so early we weren't interested in cocktails but the 'bar"" consisted of bottles of mostly empty liquor save for the almost full bottle of sweet vermouth. Don't plan on having a drink in this lounge - there won't be anything available. Our flight was announced and we made our way to the gate. This ""lounge"" was really sad.

Lounge in Boston was much better in my opinion. Great views, better service and showers were lovely. It was spacious, filled with amenities. I decided to buy one of the items on their menu, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and it was perfect. It was fresh and delicious, well worth the 9 bucks. Overall, both locations were excellent.

I was the first in for the 9.20 flight to LHR. Nice selection of breakfast foods and drink. Papers and magazines all in order. The wifi was a bit slow and dropped quite frequently. Interestingly there were quite a few birds yes birds in the lounge that made it feel quite exotic. Obviously not a feature but watching the sing and fly around my head did make me smile.

My excitement at being allowed into this hallowed space was short lived. It looked congested and untidy. The service for anything from a full meal to a glass of water is waiter only. Empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables. As I had only recently eaten on the inbound flight I did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private. I moved to sit 'outside' on the balcony overlooking the departures area as it felt less claustrophobic.

Warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge. The main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables. Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language.

All food served in this lounge is waiter service and menus are scattered around the lounge for you to choose your selection from and change depending on the time of day. If you visit the First Galleries Lounge opposite the Concorde Room you can request items from their buffet selection and they will be served to you in the Concorde Room. There was a good choice of premium spirits and champagnes as well as teas coffees and soft drinks. I booked one of the private cabanas when I organised my trip which is a dedicated day room with bed TV shower toilet free telephone use and room service. You can request a cabana for a maximum of four hours it's an oasis of calm within an oasis of calm. I also had lunch and afternoon tea there good quality food and friendly and efficient service. I also used the Elemis Spa facilities which can be booked twenty eight days in advance if you are a First passenger. There is also a boardroom style facility to log on to the internet and printers so you need to produce any paperwork.

Capacity is a big problem in this lounge. I have rarely been in a lounge of this size where I have not not been able to find any seating whatsoever. The lounge was absolutely packed! It was so full that I decided to leave after a while because it was not worth the effort to find some personal space in the lounge. I wanted to go on-line but apart from two free computers wireless was at a charge. I paid quite a hefty charge and I had major problems trying to connect. I could only spend five minutes on-line and I was constantly disconnected.

There was a line out the door at one point to enter. The toilets inside were the same as the ones outside. The food on offer is the same as all Delta lounges which is limited to some raw vegetables with humus chips pretzels and other cheap snack foods. Drinks are similarly uninspired. They had special Johnny Walker drinks but for $15 extra per drink! The seats were stained from overuse. All the passengers were all hooked up to their in-ear phones and speaking loudly to people somewhere else about business making it really loud and strange. The only good thing about the lounge is the fact you get free wifi. As a passenger on an international connection in business class I was allowed to enter.

Lounge looks modern with lots of natural daylight spacious clean. On one side is quite a large bar. No self service for coffee tea etc you go to the bar and have your drink prepared for you - I think this gives a more personal service. On the bar is a menu listing available sandwiches. Around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to Heathrow T5 where there are no announcements. I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often. When my flight was called the gate was literally 30 feet away.

Not very much chance of getting a rest here. Finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times.

There are hot and cold buffets (except early morning): the cold buffet is especially good. The kitchen will make food on request; if you want toast and eggs for breakfast they will oblige. As I don't drink alcohol comments and ratings for the drinks are limited the tea coffee water and soft drinks which are all very good. There are only two (men's) shower stalls but they have always both been free and immaculate and the staff supply a hotel style bundle of towels. Plenty of hot water and decent pressure.

Elevator down one level after you enter the reception lobby to the business class lounge area. Plenty of comfortable seating in a variety of configurations lounge chairs sofas eating tables with chairs and work stations with outlets. The free WiFi was reliable and fast but the logon process is a little tricky. Separate food bar and lounge areas. The food area had a very comprehensive buffet both Western and Indian food one of the best I have seen second only to Dubai. Lots of snacks and fruit which you could take with you for your flight. The bar had a full wall video screen showing sports and a wide selection of beer wine and cocktails.

korean-air,/lounge-reviews/korean-air,Korean Air Business Class Lounge - Seoul Incheon Airport,Mark Williams,United Kingdom,2014-12-28,To say we were disappointed and underwhelmed with this lounge is an understatment. Incheon is a huge airport and so the lounge is necessarily huge too although it is cleverly set up is two areas separated by the lift shafts toilets etc. Comfortable chairs everywhere but largely lined up as if in a waiting room. Fantastic views from massive glass onto the tarmac apron. The catering was astonishing in its pausity. One unrermakable red and one unknown (and don't care too) white no bubbles of any sort a couple of self-serve draft beers water came in juice pouch things reminiscent of 1990s economy class meal trays. There was a non-descript pumpkin soup without bread a couple of unappetising salads a couple of pot noodle things (self-serve) a couple of juices and thats about your lot. Empty glasses and plates hung around for a long time including a beer mug on a table that was there when we wrrived and was still there when we left 2 hours later. Toilets were roomy and clean a must-visit to have a play with the electric flush bidet and warm air arrangement. Wifi free without the need of a password and was quick enough for the few emails and bit of browning I did.

As much as I loved the old premium terminal there were times when it would be so crowded it was impossible to get a seat but that was often due to passengers taking up a table and three chairs for the coats bags or newspapers no such problem now as there is a range of different types of chair and sofas spread around the bottom floor in different areas. The design is exceptional with a very nice water feature. At the time I' usually there the lounge tends to be quite busy when I arrive but after a few hours its almost empty. As this was the first time I' had any time to spend there I had a good walk around and bumped into two members of the staff of the old premium lounge who remembered me from previous times. There are two restaurants one on each floor a number of deli type counters and a few places where you could help yourself to tee coffee or soft drinks at any time. I tried a number of different chairs before managing to find an vacant sofa where I could stretch out for a few hours. Later I tried one of the work stations so I could use the USB charging unit each of the stations has a small bag of snacks and a bottle of water.

Excellent restaurant quality food and service with a knockout wine list. Lunch of crayfish washed down with a premier cru bourgogne! Absolutely no skimping on anything and everything works. Delightful staff with a sense of humour. Faultless. We felt vaguely guilty about such luxury! Doha premium terminal was busier but not far behind in quality. We had no trouble finding quiet seating on both visits. Both lounges are better than any others we have used in the last decade.

The lounge was too small for the amount of people present. At either end of the lounge were televisions although it was very difficult to hear them over the noise of the people. The smoking section wasn't screened off and I could hear people complaining about the smoke in the non smoking areas. Drink in plentiful supply including alcoholic juices tea etc and snacks were available although these were mainly cakes dates etc. It was surprising that even though there were so many people the lounge was tidy and plates and cups were cleared often. The staff clearing the plates were friendly but the staff behind the bar area didn't seem as friendly but they certainly weren't rude. It was certainly a retreat from the main terminal and as you get refreshments for 'free' to be honest even though it was very full I cannot complain and I did enjoy being there.,ROYAL JORDANIAN AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Amman Queen Alia Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,4,4,3,0,3,4,0

The obligatorily QF Club carrot and celery sticks also adorned the Business class lounge buffet too. I visited the lounge mid-morning and it certainly could have done with a good vacuum clean.

The catering is slightly above basic with some hot foods and soups and the usual au dourves biscuits cheeses and anti pesto. There is no bar but rather a self serve fridge as in Melbourne and Sydney international business lounges and a few post-mixes dotted around the lounge. The wine-bar area and the open round tabled seating area near the main food area are great for socialising while the darker quite areas are adequate but the lounges are not as comfortable as they appear. Plus the big floor to ceiling windows which run around the far side of the lounge are great to watch the goings on of the terminal below. The showers are incredible probably the best I've seen in a non first lounge. On the downside the lounge as with QF/BA First Thai United Lounges a fair walk from the QF/BA gates and up a set of escalators and very hard to find.

After a long flight a shower could make huge difference. Food and drink were limited you don't want to drink a lot anyway because there is no toilet inside the lounge.

When the route LHR-Edinburgh started I could get into both lounges using my Singapore Airlines Gold Card as per normal Virgin lounges. At Terminal 1 in Heathrow it is a good 10-15 minute walk about as far apart as you can get in the terminal from lounge to gate. Three time I have been refused access here - you have to go back down the stairs go to the internal desk hope it is manned or the person is free get a pass from them and go back. it is more hassle than it is worth. In Edinburgh twice they said ""no"" then looked at a card document and realised it was ""yes"" but this apparently changes in September and the SQ card is no longer welcome there.

I visited on New Years Eve when there was not much traffic in the lounge which is probably the only nice thing worth mentioning. The catering was appalling and range of drinks very limited since several machines were out of order. There were no newspapers and the very few magazines in the lounge were a few months old. I am sure this place was decent in the 1970's but it has not seen much upgrade ever since. Since I find United to be the worst US airline by far this lounge did nothing to change my point of view. On a final note if you are considering paying 50 USD to enter the lounge (ie. if you do not hold credentials to give you free access) I would seriously recommend you to stay way from this stale and tame lounge.,UNITED AIRLINES RED CARPET BUSINESS CLASS / STAR ALLIANCE LOUNGE REVIEW,San Francisco Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0

Plenty of staff doing next to nothing can see no reason why there are 8 people in this lounge when it charges for any decent food and drink several staff just stand around doing nothing. The worst is the excuse for snacks which comprises a platter of cubed American style (ie rubber) cheese of three different colours under a lid with a selection of crackers. Wifi not free. Why does United bother? It may as well get rid of all staff bar an entry guard and cleaner and just let it be a quiet place to sit.

Not having experienced the previous one I'm guessing this is a vast improvement on what it replaced judging from the publicity. Decor is pleasant & modern with good bar / food facilities (if very cramped). Biggest problem is the First lounge isn't yet finished. As a result the new lounge is like an overcrowded food court with people using chairs as tables and footrests for sleeping that's if you can find a spare chair. The overall noise level is much like a shopping mall. There are also only 9 showers which seems inadequate for an international gateway port. It seems destined to become undersized only soon after opening. Having flown extensively on CX through HK & EK through DXB this lounge falls far short of those facilities. The biggest issue is zero privacy or quiet space which are what most long-haul business travellers crave and get in those cities. I guess considering the hell American air travellers endure in North America it's probably a welcome haven. But by international standards it's a falls quite a way short of the mark.

There are actually 2 AA lounges in the same terminal one is on the top floor. I utilized both because the gate for my flight changed and they offered me the opportunity to go to the lounge closer to the gate. Both of these lounges are good and you can choose which one you use. Really it depends on what you're after. The one on the top floor gave me great personal service when I arrived and when they noted the length of my last flight they offered me use of the shower. I didn't have to wait they had plenty available. This lounge had self serve bar with a decent (though not extensive) amount of options or you could use drink coupons at their attended bar to order cocktails. The attended bar was a little lonely looking and didn't look well stocked but I'm not positive. The lower level lounge also had great customer service the front desk person greeted me nicely and assisted me with updates about my delayed flight changed my seats etc. They didn't seem to have a self-service bar but the attended bar over here was lively and had a very sweet older bartender who called every customer ""mi amor"". She was so sweet. When my plane unexpectedly began to board after many delays she quickly got me a drink so I'd have time to finish it and she got me bottles of water to take on the plane. Computers were set up next to the bar area and had high top chairs making it comfortable to have a drink while checking your email. I don't think this lounge had showers but since I'd already showered at the first lounge I didn't go looking for it either. Only gripe was that despite it being around dinner time they didn't have food options except a few limited things to purchase.

Lounge was very busy but there were still some seats available. Design is nice modern but also classic and typically British. Service was efficient but not really welcoming.

Spacious yes - impressed no. At the front desk beyond asking for the boarding pass frontline staff seem to assume that everyone who came knew what the Golden Lounge had to offer. No attempt to explain its facilities. Upon entering you come upon the room where liquor is served but it was small and so far from everything else. Sofa seats were arranged in lines and close together. Buffet choices very limited. Everything was self service much like a canteen. Glasses so small probably to discourage one from taking too much thus necessitating frequent trips for refills. I stood there for 3 glasses of juice before I moved off with a 4th. That's how small the glasses were. Tables while cleared of glasses and plates were not wiped down. I saw just one staff clearing tables. I did not realise there was 2 other counters serving food. There was no signboard to the shower/washrooms. Inside the shower stalls were not clean bits of hair left behind and why is the floor in the shower area level with the changing area. Good thing my shoes were near the outer door or they would have been soaked. After what you read in the Malaysia Airlines web page this was a disappointment you've oversold yourself.

Its flight departs at 1030 pm and check-in begins three hours earlier. However the business lounge operated by BA only allows EVA passengers to enter after 8:45 pm and attempts at early entry would be stopped by a British Airways staff stating that this is their agreement with EVA. The lounge is small and crowded and can barely accommodate all the EVA passengers.

As for the hot food there was curry and nothing else. No choice and no rice to accompany the dish. This must be the worst business lounge for hot food choice anywhere.

But worst of all - obviously United do not trust their customers so if you want anything with alcohol - you have to go all the way to the other end to a bar - just to realize that if you want more than a flat beer - you have to pay for it!

Their shower facilities are fairly decent with Chicago being recently upgraded but again Flagship do not have these - Admirals Club only.

malaysia-airlines,/lounge-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines Business Class Regional Golden Lounge - KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport,Arthur Lim,NA,2009-02-07,Very impressive you can tell its almost brand new when you step in. Great large chairs to relax in. Food choices good but they should not serve items like fried fish pieces in a food warmer and have it closed - these items tend to harden up and become a real challenge for your teeth! Drinks selection for alcoholic beverages had a bartender service which you had to use which I dont really appreciate - I would prefer a self service bar but only because I'm more used to it. Noodle bar was very nice. There was also a children's play room Surau Prayer room and a massage service corner- but you had to pay for every treatment or massage available - unlike Thai AIrways BKK massage lounge which gave business class passengers a free 30 min massage. Would have been good if MH offered that. The bathrooms were nice but toilet amenities were not 5 star standard. Previously MH provided L'Occitane and Aigner toiletries but this is no longer the case. In all a great lounge - much much better than the Business class lounge at the satellite building less people which means your chances of getting to use the shower is quite high and also more peace of mind! Only 1 criticism - too many staff on duty - wherever you walk they follow you like as though they're keeping a look out just in case you get up to no good! I know they are only there to see if you need any service but don't overdo it.

Additionally there are no bathrooms within the lounge and if you need those facilities you are directed to leave the lounge and go down the hall to use public bathrooms. Given all of this I'm not really sure why you would choose to come in to this lounge unless you would like to eat some of the simple packaged cookies or the cheese that is sitting out in warm temperatures. Very little in the way of hard liquor. No red wine on display and a single white wine in the refrigerator. There was a sparkling wine in an ice bucket that was untouched.

Gone are the days of dirty dishes and rude staff. It has been a welcome improvement. Unfortunately the YYZ MLL International lounge at the E gates seems to have been left behind. On the day I used it it was very busy with limited food offered and an unpleasant ambience. There are just too many people using the lounge many of whom have access because of their frequent flyer status. The end result is that pax who are flying on the expensive long haul flights in business class receive a mediocre experience. It's time for AC to divide the lounge into two sections one for the true international business class and ""Super Elite"" status pax and the other for the basic ""Elite"" pax and those flying on shorter route Rouge Premium. Provide a quiet area with better food for the first group and keep the current set up for the second group. My biggest wish is for AC to provide decent wifi access in its Canadian lounges.

royal-jordanian-airlines,/lounge-reviews/royal-jordanian-airlines,"Royal Jordanian Airlines Business Class ""crown"" Lounge - Amman Queen Alia Airport",I Dror,NA,2009-01-20,Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. Newly built (open for about 4 months at the time) large and boasting high-end features such as bedrooms along with high-end features one can expect to find in a flagship lounge. We had a long transfer at AMM (originally scheduled for 12 hours which ended out being 19 hours due to RJ technical problems) so were looking forward to a good lounge to make the wait less taxing. The first glitch occurred when staff at the counter attempted to deny us entry to the lounge saying that we should only come to the lounge 2-3hrs before our flight. When we pointed out to them the complete absurdity of this request given that we were on transit between two RJ flights and that this goes against the Oneworld regulations the matter was settled. However this was a poor welcome if we ever saw one. The so called bedrooms are a paid service at $50 for the first four hours then $20 per hour. Fair enough though a bit pricey for a long stay (and a bit cheeky to price the first segment at 4 hours when they try to deny entry only 2 hours before the flight). We had a look at a room which included a double bed shower and a cupboard (some 25 sqm I would say). We went to confirm that we wanted the room (was traveling with my wife pregnant of 6 months at the time) and were told that the rooms are considered single rooms and under no circumstances can be let out to more than one person. Again I stress that the room clearly had a double bed but we failed to get anywhere with this and were told that this is a clear order from “senior RJ management”. Why RJ went to the trouble of building and designing such rooms is questionable given this policy but at least this should be clearly flagged on their website when they talk of this so that other couples do not plan to book this service and make alternative arrangements. The lounge offers quiet rooms with some 6-7 armchairs in a relatively dark and quiet area adjacent to the bedrooms. However we found these very uncomfortable to attempt to sleep on and ended up leaving the lounge to a nearby hotel to get some sleep. In the morning there was a nice yet modest buffet (cold items only). In the evening there were three hot dishes. None too appealing but ok to snack if hungry. A separate staffed bar in a separate corner with less options that one finds in most other large lounges but large enough to cover basic requests. Infrastructure impressive and clearly RJ invested a lot in creating the lounge. However it is a bad sign that only 4 months after opening there are already issues with core features. For example there are some 12 individual sofas with personalized TV screens and high-end headsets. When we tried to use them we found the volume level unbearably loud. We tried another station. Same thing. When we asked the RJ staff we were told that all the TVs were like this and there is nothing to be done except to hold the headsets some 50cm away from the ears. Personally I find this pathetic and a miserable design/execution of a key feature of a lounge. I could go on but I think the message is clear - Amman Crown Lounge despite an impressive investment in infrastructure fails to deliver. My gut feeling is that with time as the new furniture and excitement wears down this will rapidly become a B-rated lounge at best.,"ROYAL JORDANIAN AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS ""CROWN"" LOUNGE REVIEW",Amman Queen Alia Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Internet is open without pesky log-in requirements but it is very very slow. The lounge is very busy from 8-10 so maybe the space simply cannot accommodate the traffic.

swiss-international-air-lines,/lounge-reviews/swiss-international-air-lines,Swiss Int'l Air Lines Business Class Lounge - Zurich Airport,R Krusenstjerna,Sweden,2011-11-28,I regularly use this lounge when transferring at Zurich. There is a good choice of seating. There are plenty of newspapers also foreign ones. Although a non-smoker the smokers' bar ie. the upstairs area with the serviced bar is my favourite spot. Best view nice light conditions very friendly bar staff and good choice of drinks. The choice of beverages in the self-service areas is very good. I love the Rivella a Swiss lemonade which is milk-acid based and very rejuvenating. The problems of this lounge are the lack of good food especially hot food items if any at all are very poor standard. Another problem are the loud service staff which sometimes make it hard to relax and refresh in this lounge.,SWISS INT'L AIR LINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Zurich Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,4,5,5,1,4,4,2,1

As there is no airside pharmacy in Sydney international a staff member actually took my script had it filled at a pharmacy in another part of the airport had it cleared by security and delivered to my table. Now that's service! The menu is the restaurant is short sharp simple and of excellent quality. The facilities are great I like that you can choose to use either Mac or PC in this lounge. They have a very nice day spa hard to get into but when you do very much worth the effort. The bathrooms are not that great but you really are not there to spend too much time in there. It's wonderfully spacious with plenty of places to sit. The only annoying factor was the number of children in the lounge. All in all a great place. This lounge is the only reason that I will continue to use Qantas it's a great benefit for platinum frequent flyers- Qantas inflight service could learn a lot from this lounge.,QANTAS FIRST CLASS LOUNGE CUSTOMER REVIEW,Sydney Airport,First Class,NA,NA,5,5,5,5,5,3,4,5,0

emirates,/lounge-reviews/emirates,Emirates A380 First Class Lounge - Dubai Airport,H Dalem,Netherlands,2014-02-20,Looks like a very posh lounge at the beginning. Almost deserted. Every gate has a separate boarding lounge with enough space to give everybody his own seating area with a coffee corner. And it looks very stylish. But that's it. I have been there a number of times and every time it was a very disappointing experience. If you want to use the shower be prepared to get into a sauna. The cold water is always warm and the very small shower rooms are humid. The aircon just isn't strong enough to keep the desert out. Unlike business you have to order almost any food and drinks. But the person who should be waiting on you seems never to be around. Or takes everything away but does not bother to ask if you want something else. Unlike business they only provide chairs for sitting. Not a bench or sofa in sight to lounge upon. This is a first class lounge. Unlike economy or business the boarding process is almost always delayed because the ground staff comes late to let you board the plane. All this has been mentioned to several duty managers. No change with the shower room temperature. Still not a bench or sofa to be seen. And the service remains a problem. The only thing that is cold are their excuses about this kind of service. A pity the business lounge is always crowed but it looks like a better place to stay. Less formal and more relaxed. And be prepared to walk a lot if you want to visit the shower and/or toilet. It is a huge lounge because it covers the whole building.,EMIRATES A380 FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Dubai Airport,First Class,NA,NA,3,2,5,3,3,2,2,2,0

I've been in every one they have in the DFW terminals and none of them distinguish themselves. If you're looking for a quiet place to work this might be a good place though you can find similar places for free throughout the rest of the terminals. If you're looking for food or drinks the AC has possibly the worst food I've had in an airport - and you have to pay for the privilege. Whoever runs these places would do well to visit any of their competitors lounges it would take less than 10 minutes to see how far short they fall. I travel a lot and was reasonably excited to get be able to use the AC regularly - at this point I now avoid flying American when I can so that I can get status into one of the other lounges - AA doesn't make anything about being elite worthwhile other than getting on first.,AMERICAN AIRLINES ADMIRALS CLUB FIRST CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,NA,First Class,NA,NA,2,3,4,1,1,3,3,1,0

If you pass the showers on the right there is an area with the same food and beverage offerings but less people. I was there all day the food stayed the same - standard hotel buffet. Nothing super special but filling. The bar was self serve beer wine whisky scotch and Jack Daniels. My only complaint was the smoking room. I know most airports do not have this but in Korea they are extremely necessary. Many Koreans smoke and the tiny closet sized room was continually full to the point of no room to move.

Uninspiring salad bar with no 'wow' factor whatsoever and three types of freshly-made sandwiches - ham and cheese chicken prawn with rose-marie sauce. All of them sorry to say utterly tasteless! The good news is thank goodness the excellent wines available and Champagne (for that you have to ask an over-worked but smiling waitress who will eventually bring it to where you are sitting) Usual premium spirits selection with mixers. Toilets (men) were frankly a bit grubby and dated and a tad smelly - not good enough! More like a traditional English pub on a Saturday night.

The booze selection is better than you will find in domestic carrier lounges. It is all free and self serve. You make everything the way you like it and no bartender to tip. There are two TVs located t either end of the lounge. The staff will accommodate your channel requests. There are boarding announcements and the gates are 60 seconds or less away.

iberia,/lounge-reviews/iberia,Iberia Velazquez Business Class Lounge,A Simon,France,2013-07-31,This lounge is located in the satellite part of terminal 4 where most long haul Iberia flights and a few other carriers such as British Airways (the airline I flew in this case). You can access this lounge if you are in business or first class on Iberia or another oneworld airline or have oneworld emerald or sapphire status through your frequent flyer program. So though it seems many can access this lounge it is not a problem as the lounge is needlessly large with two symmetrical wings accommodating many at a time. Overall this lounge was fantastic as it was very spacious and comfortable with areas to eat work relax and even a separate sleeping room with privacy dividers. The bar was well stocked and contrary to the Sala Dali lounge I used in the main terminal 4 this had a well stocked buffet with many different options. However I did not like that in this lounge you must ask for Internet cards from the staff at the reception where you scratch off and enter a c ode that you enter in your device. This would be okay but it only last 30 minutes before you need to repeat the process. That being said the Internet speed is very fast. The staff did a good job keeping the food and drink well stocked and the whole area well kept but while they got the job done they didn't seem as though they really wanted to be there.

british-airways,/lounge-reviews/british-airways,British Airways First Class Concorde Room Lounge - New York JFK Airport,A Simon,France,2013-07-31,The only downside to this lounge is that it doesn't open until 4pm for the evening flights (I am not sure if it is open in the morning for the morning flight out of JFK) so if you have a long layover chances are you will have to spend some time in the Galleries First and Terraces Lounges which are nice but don't touch the quality of this lounge. A very tranquil and peaceful area British Airways has made sure there are almost too many staff members so that while food is prepared the lounge is cleaned etc. there are also staff available to help with anything you need. When dinner is available the quality and choice of food is fantastic and there is a wide selection of snacks available upon request when in search of something lighter. The wifi works well and there are also 3 computers in the back. A small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax. The only negative to this lounge is that the spa/shower rooms are not in the Lou ge so to take a shower I had to walk across the terminal and into the Business class lounge but it's a small terminal so it's not that bad. Overall this has to be one of my favorite lounges in the world and I actually prefer it over the Concorde room at London Heathrow.,BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS CONCORDE ROOM LOUNGE REVIEW,New York JFK Airport,First Class,NA,NA,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,1

There is a 50 minute walk to the gate! Via a temporary roof walkway (till April I was told). By the time you have trekked over the roof of the airport it is not worth it. The lounge is small sparse cramped. Few facilities even the toilets are outside. Only breakfast items were small cartons of corn flakes. No milk provided. Thanks BA.

ethiopian-airlines,/lounge-reviews/ethiopian-airlines,Ethiopian Airlines Business Class 'cloud Nine' Lounge - Addis Ababa Airport,M Noormohamed,United States,2015-02-04,The lounge is easy to find. When you come up from the arrivals to the second floor there is a big sign advertising Cloud Nine. Staff friendly and make announcements for departing flights. Wifi connection worked fine once you get the password. There is a paucity of magazines. This lounge main problem is overcrowding and cleanliness of the bathrooms. There is water all over the bathroom floor and unlike EBB's Karibuni Lounge there did not appear to be an attendant who would clean and/or mop the bathrooms at regular intervals. Didn't try the food so no comment. The lounge has an open ceiling so one can hear all the commotion and noise from the main terminal building. I thought lounges are supposed to be oasis of calm. Despite all its faults the lounge is a better alternative than using facilities in the terminal building.,ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS 'CLOUD NINE' LOUNGE REVIEW,Addis Ababa Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,3,3,2,3,3,2,4,3,1

I was publicly humiliated with his loud out burst for what I thought to be a small crime! The staff member was rude arrogant and had zero customer service skills I would like to name and shame but feel this would lower me to his level. On our quick exit I did point out to him that I had seen numerous other clients taking stock from the lounge but this observation was ignored.

Basically the lounge has nothing to offer and can not be regarded as an intercontinental business class lounge. There is only one lounge worse than the intercontinental KAL lounge in Incheon; it is the intercontinental KAL lounge at JFK for the return flight on the A380. It smells of old tobacco the sofas are old and worn out. The choice of drinks and food is miserable the coffee is disgusting so are the muffins the rest offered is plastic cheese and some plastic sandwiches.

There was the ever constant noodle bar serving up good food. They had two types of sandwiches (vegetarian and w/ meat) and they had cake + chinese dim sum. Good varieties of drinks including premium liquor and soft drinks. The lounge itself does not compare to the Wing or Pier lounges in HK but for Taipei it provides a nice oasis for travelers to eat and drink prior to their flight. It is a better alternative to the lacklustre duty free that is provided at Taoyuan airport. If there try the beef noodles in soup and not the spicy peanut sauce based noodles.

asiana-airlines,/lounge-reviews/asiana-airlines,Asiana Airlines Business Class Lounge - Incheon Airport,J Bond,Thailand,2015-03-29,This lounge is always busy. It is a nice clean lounge in mostly good shape but starting to show some wear and tear. WiFi is great and there are lots of outlets to plug in. Seating is comfortable and it is usually quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to chill and read or do work. Don't expect to get anything decent to eat though. On my last visit (almost identical to my previous 3 visits this year) - which was more than 4 hours - the offerings consisted of one small EMPTY platter with sign that said 'Sushi' one small EMPTY hot plate with sign that said 'Chicken WIngs'. Food that was actually there consisted of a handful of pretzels with orange 'cheese' paste that tasted like wax a meagre salad bar with undercooked unseasoned flavourless potato salad and four large baskets of dry bread offered with jam and butter. About 10 tiny vegetable sandwiches made an appearance for 30 seconds - but they were immediately hoovered up by patrons desperate for anything decent to munch on. Three cups of vegetable rice also appeared briefly - but it looked and tasted like it was leftover from 3 weeks ago. Oh - and lest I forget two small cereal bowls with thimble sized cookies were offered for dessert. There are also cheap paper instant noodle cups always on offer. No proper bar (some beer on tap no wine to be seen no cocktails). Eat and drink before you come here.,ASIANA AIRLINES BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGE REVIEW,Incheon Airport,Business Class,NA,NA,4,5,5,1,1,5,5,5,0
