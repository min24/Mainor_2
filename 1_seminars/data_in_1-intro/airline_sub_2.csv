Just full legacy carrier fares for basically a budget airline. Flying out of Poland had no Euros or USD on me. I was thirsty and asked to purchase a bottle of water. The stewardess said that I could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency. When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be ""difficult"". She never offered me a tiny cup of water.

The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket.

The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice.

We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew.

Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time.

Food was pretty bad mostly tasteless slop for the main meal and an insulting muffin and coffee/tea for ""afternoon tea"" which was literally thrown at some people. We could watch movies/TV free but the headset quality was atrocious we couldn't hear clearly (same for announcements which could be a safety hazard). I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole ""Irish"" routine which went on for a while.

In DC our trip got off to a rough start as Aeroflot's flight was not listed on any departure boards, nor was the gate marked with flight information. I don't know if this is a problem to do with the airline or airport. Once on board we were greeted by a clean and new looking airbus. The economy seats were cramped on our trans-atlantic stretch but not more so than other US and European carriers I've flown. The service was fairly good. The cabin crew were all business and no smiles, but they came around often to see if passengers needed anything. We had two hot meals that were edible and the in seat entertainment system had a really good selection of films. My only complaint on the trans-atlantic flight was that breakfast was served three hours before landing at 4.30 am Moscow time, unnecessarily cutting into sleep time. Our short-haul leg was equally comfortable. Again the planes looked new and were very clean. Cabin staff came through with snacks and beverages. Overall I found Aeroflot a pleasant experience.

The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over.

aerolineas-argentinas,/airline-reviews/aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,B Aldridge,United States,2014-08-26,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,2,0

On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies.

This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled.

Seats were the standard for medium haul although getting off the seat to walk can be cumbersome for those on the window seats. Meals were OK. Purser was courteous but distant. Inbound flight is a redeye. Service and meals were really good seats new and comfortable the one problem is that Montreal flights have a dedicated check in area and there were only two staff members working the flight so it took a while to check in. New 737s are really modern with PTVs and sky interiors. I don't know if this experience is enough to say that they have really improved.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,4,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2014-06-09,Flew from AGP-DUB on EI585 (A333) paid a bit extra to sit in Business class not sure how comfortable I'd be lying 'down' at that angle for a long period of time or if it's worth it. The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work. Recommend all the same just don't be in a rush after landing.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,4,3,NA,NA,3,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,P Herman,Spain,2014-05-11,Flew Barcelona-Toronto via Dublin. First time on Aer Lingus and the biggest draw was the excellent fare. Having said that I won't recommend except for bargain hunters. BCN-Dublin is basically a low cost flight curiously more comfortable than the 757 they used for the transatlantic leg. This must be the narrowest twin-engine plane around very narrow seats (and I'm on the slim side) and little legroom on top of that. I heard many people commenting on the lack of space. The personal entertainment system is not bad although only a few recent releases plus some shows and documentaries and music and maps. Food on the outbound flight was awful and made me ill afterwards so I avoided it on the inbound and brought my own food. Drinks service is seriously cheap no free alcohol and just water orange juice or Coke/Sprite available. Crew was friendly but never followed up on the one occasion (each flight) I went to the galley to ask for something even though they said they'd bring it to my seat. Transfer at Dublin was easy but with a lot of walking. I won't fly this particular route with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,3,2,4,NA,NA,4,0

Flight out on time and the food was pretty decent I had upgraded my meal choice. Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

I received my preferred seats on both flights and quite good English spoken by cabin staff. Reasonable meals were served on both flights evening though the Omsk sector started at 1.40 am.

Seats on flight to Moscow were of an older type of business class seat but did everything I needed and all ancillary services (entertainment etc.) available. Seafood meal was probably the best airline meal I have ever had. (Expectations high but I think reasonable). On return flight had more recent capsule seats.

aegean-airlines,/airline-reviews/aegean-airlines,Aegean Airlines customer review,P McCarthy,United Kingdom,2012-06-11,LHR-ATH return. Found Aegean to be very average. Flight out delayed by 2 hours due to high winds with gate attendants 'managing expectations' stringing the delay out by 10 minutes every 15 that went by; however the return was on time. A321's seats are closely bunched for leg room and lack any head rests making sleep tricky on the longish flight. Cabin service was just slow meals of dismal quality in both directions though wine pleasant. A film was shown in both directions which worked OK. Some crew were friendly others were not focused. Online check-in works well but won't from their own iphone app. Experience at both airports fine.

Air Algerie need to improve if their star rating and credibility with other operators is to be upped. My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room. The interior of the aircraft was shabby the upholstery was dirty and there was even old food and hair in the table stowage area. The food was ok and the service was relatively attentive but I couldn't help but think that it was all a bit too much of an effort for the staff. Come on Air Algerie.

As this was known well beforehand we could have remained in our hotels instead of being jammed into the airport at 1 in the morning then finally boarding the aircraft at 04:30 and sitting on the Tarmac for an hour before takeoff.

Seating seemed tight in both width and legroom compared with other airlines we have used. We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer. Overall it was as good as economy gets on European airlines although not anything like as good as the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Would fly with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Seats are proper business class seats (2-2 config) but they do look and feel a bit outdated already. Nevertheless still comfortable and there's plenty of space. Cabin crew were polite and effective. The main (and only) complaint on this flight was the quality of food. The main dish was pretty much inedible but the choice of wines and drinks was good. Transfer in Moscow was quick and easy. No delays at security screening/passport control. Terminal F is bad in comparison to terminals D and E. The Classic or the ""First class"" lounge is old crowded and all in all unpleasant. Boarding the BKK flight was chaotic. Even if priority was given to business passengers there was no real control as to who was boarding first. Nevertheless managed to be one of the first ones onboard. Once onboard was shown to my seat and offered the pre-flight drink by a friendly cabin crew member. Aircraft was a brand new 777-300ER with a new cabin design throughout the aircraft. Business class seats (2-2-2 config) found these seats very comfortable and the atmosphere of the cabin modern and pleasant. Cabin crew professional friendly and attentive. A 3 course dinner was served and the quality of the food was much better. Plenty of drinks offered.

The inflight service was just as good though the aircraft was older. However the check-in in Damascus was terrible with all the line for the three desks merging into one big mass of people pushing to get served. I was waiting for over an hour before I got to the counter. I asked for a window and got a middle seat (they said they had no more windows). I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know. Back in Sharjah the immigration area is confusingly laid out and getting a queue that moves is pot luck. here again everyone is pushing to get served.

Secondly onboard quality service is unsustainable: sometimes attendants are nice and helpful sometimes rude and evasive. Aeroflot always forgets about its Business class passengers and priority Boarding especially in terminal F for long haul flights. However the major problem is the home airport of Sheremetyevo. In most cases people are spending an awful long time just to leave the airport area. Queuing in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2 week vacation and Business Class experience crosses everything out about the Aeroflot flight. So my recommendation to use Aeroflot would pretty much depend on the route time and class.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights. Two meals are provided;1 warm meal two hours into the flight and the second cold (and small) approximately 60 min before landing. This was the same for in/outbound. This means no refreshments or snacks for approximately 6-8hours!! So BYO! In addition make sure you select a low row number 1-35 rows in the back of the aircraft cannot select meals and get whatever is left. Meals are rather poor in quantity and quality.

Nevertheless it was good that Air Berlin efficiently recognised my One World Emerald/Platinum Status so I had pre-allocated good seats and quick check-in with early 'pre-board' on every sector. I also pre-ordered their hot meals and bought myself some wine on-board so not a bad experience overall. The return flight back from Antalya was somewhat bizarre but enjoyable with only 10 out of 210 seats occupied so it was essentially an empty aircraft - all other flights were full (and all on-time).

Boeing 767 decent in terms of space. Although we managed to get the exit row so I can't really judge the legroom in the regular seats but ours were great. Width of seats also great. Although we couldn't put our personal item (purse) under the seat so that was kind of a pain. A319 seats are decently sized in terms of width but the pitch is below industry standard.

On the way back when trying to load this flight which was supposed to be done on a larger Boeing 767-300ER they anticipated the difficulty they would have with carry-on bags because there was significantly less room and dealt with it brilliantly. The check in folks in Toronto were terrible. Cranky and super unhelpful. We asked where to take our bags to check them and were dismissed with an ""over that way"". Well over that way was about a quarter mile down to the other end of the airport where there were no signs to guide us. We had to pay $25 for each checked bag which is ridiculous. If we had paid for a much more expensive seat we could have taken up to 2 bags free. Seriously you can't even take one suitcase for free because we're flying economy? There was no meal on the flight unless your were in Premium Rouge. We could purchase food onboard which was okay. There was a decent selection and the prices were reasonable. But again, seriously, not even a free snack on a 4 hour + flight? The planes had no in-flight entertainment except for streaming video to their app. This was okay but selection was terrible. All outdated movies and tv shows and not good classics.  I'm not sure what our fare paid for. We weren't paying for a comfortable seat, for space for our baggage, food or entertainment. It seems like we paid to be uncomfortable, annoyed and bored. Why is it that basic things like having enough leg room so your legs are smashed into the seat in front of you or having a snack on a long trip is only for luxury passengers?

Finally, the YYZ-MEX leg on an Airbus 319 was a breeze as the cabin was almost empty.

Two years United screwed up and caused us to miss a flight to Hawaii but they bent over backwards and got us there only one hour later than our original time.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,P Smith,Canada,2014-07-11,YYZ-LHR-YYZ. Outbound flight on new 787. Return on 777-300. The new planes are a very welcome addition and a solid improvement over the dated 767. AC has reconfigured the business class pods for the 787 so they point towards the window instead of away. TV screens are much larger table trays are better located and there are actually places to put your belongings (not so for the 777). Very tough to find any fault. They just need more of them sooner. Service was better than usual (AC can be very inconsistent). Food quality was poor for business class. IFE is getting better but still needs investment. AC's switch from T3 to T2 is a good move as the terminal is much nicer and easier to get through security although the walk to the Heathrow Express is a long one.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,4,2,3,NA,NA,3,1

Check-in very straightforward. Used the Maple Leaf lounge in Terminal 1 close to the E gates. Spacious comfortable lounge but no hot options for breakfast apart from a very sticky oatmeal porridge. Flight was on a B767 with a herring bone 1-1-1 configuration. It felt both spacious and private. The crew were engaging and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast omelette was rather nice. IFE of a good quality but using the headphones was fiddly because you had to put on the sponge ear covers yourself! Seats are lie flat and quite comfortable-managed a nap of a couple of hours. The serving of lunch was delayed by some turbulence over the Atlantic. The Captain was very reassuring especially as he asked the FAs to be seated as well for about 30 mins. Good choice of champagne and 2 whites and 3 reds.

All planes were on time and embarkation was efficient. The Singapore legs used clean new planes with excellent entertainment systems. The longer London legs were both on a very old plane. It was clean but decidedly tatty. The food on all legs was unappetising and fell well short of any other airline food that I have ever had. Cold drinks were offered but we had to work hard to get anything other than orange juice or apple juice. There was very limited wine and my requests for tea or coffee were met from the trolley but not graciously. All of the above were not deal breakers but the following are - the old London-Beijing planes were very uncomfortable. The seats were old and tatty and the entertainment system was atrocious. If it worked it was extremely complicated and mine didn't work at all on the outbound leg. To add insult to injury a black box linked to the entertainment system was placed under the seat in front of you and this severely limited leg room and forced anybody with normal length legs to sit on a twist. The Singapore plane was more comfortable so would be put to far better use on the longer flight to London as ten hours is far to long to sit in a crooked seat on a tatty old plane.

CA is not my go-to carrier because they are priced higher on average and they don't have much flight time options for this route comparing to China Southern. Unless someone pays for your flights this under 3 hour-ish flight usually can just get away with economy seats because it is too short to enjoy anything premium. I got a half-priced business class deal this time so I tried it. Overall: I think it really did not mean much unless you are saving up miles with them. The word ""lukewarm"" can summarize my entire experience from the lounge service (staff) to the in-flight lunch (room-temp un-appealing Asian dish) that was served 60 minutes before landing - imagine how they ushered me to finish the meal within 15 minutes. No friendly name calls like United (they don't even greet you by name) and they skipped me for drinks and hand towels because I took a nap. I suppose I need to be alert the entire time to be adequate enough for serving?

She said no at first but then came back and said I would have to fly coach - I said no as I had an executive ticket.

Soon after the meal they shove a wrapped sandwich in your hand as a snack for later on.

We chose this airline mainly on price - approx £ £400 cheaper per ticket than British Airways or Virgin PE from London via I think New York. The first thing to say is that if you are expecting Business Class seating/facilities you will be disappointed. This was nothing like the BC we have used on Emirates and Turkish Airlines. However as a premium economy offering at an exceptionally good price we were very pleasantly surprised - in fact we could not fault it. I would judge it not quite as good as Virgin PE but certainly equal to if not better than British Airways PE. We were able to use the priority lanes for both check in and security clearance on both legs the aircraft was clean and comfortable the cabin crew were all extremely pleasant helpful presentable and very professional (other reviewers have complained that the crew are young and inexperienced; they were certainly young but we could not fault the service they provided throughout). In fact I much preferred the Canada Rouge crews with their positive can-do attitude to the 'Can I really be bothered?' stand-offish attitude I have experienced more than once on British Airways. We had no problems at all with the tablets issued to us for entertainment an issue that some reviewers have been unhappy with. The food choices were not extensive but certainly sufficient of good quality and presented nicely. Drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic were good quality and frequently offered.

Where they really fall down is the lack of legroom. 29"" pitch felt rather claustrophobic and I'm not even tall. Be warned if you're anything over 5'5"". I did appreciate one of the pilots standing by the door thanking passengers upon disembarking. All in all for an 1 hr 50 flight it really was quite okay and I'd do the same flight with AC Rouge in the future. Any longer I don't think I'll ever go for based on seat discomfort alone.

We sat on the tarmac for at least 30 minutes and were then told that we were waiting for traffic control clearance. Other announcements were made but they were so quiet that I could not hear what was said. After 1 hour the food came out while we were still waiting on the ground.

air-canada,/airline-reviews/air-canada,Air Canada customer review,S Paice,United Kingdom,2013-09-04,LHR-Toronto-LHR. Day flight from Heathrow wasn't too bad. Check-in painless lounge ok although the time from 'go to gate' to 'closing' in departures is ridiculously short. Inflight meal was ok - child's meal was well received adult's meal perfectly ok and served promptly with additional drinks available on request. Only downside was the bassinet wasn't available. IFE ok when it worked although it needed re-booted at least 3 times. Return flight. Check in at Toronto an utter shambles check in online but to get to bag drop you need to print out all your bag tags. This would be fine but their system can't cope with a booking including an infant. Thankfully the desk agent took pity on us and printed them out. Toronto lounge pleasant. Inflight pretty terrible. AC seem to persist with ancient aircraft without winglets so turbulence is amplified meaning the seat belt light on most of the trip. No food service during 'turbulence' so meal service took hours and the lights were left on so neither of the children (or us) slept at all. Asked for lights to be dimmed and 'we can't dim them' was the reply. Didn't get a drink before food due to the apparent turbulence cutting short the drink run and the never came back until 'breakfast'. At least I got dinner eventually unlike the poor folk at the back who waited at least 3 hours. 'Breakfast' was a slice of banana bread and the kids got a bran muffin. Asked for a diet coke to try and wash it down got 2 fingers worth and some ice. Pointless and not at all filling. AC would have been better with a light snack for dinner (given we took off at 10pm) and a decent breakfast. Some of the staff were quite friendly and chatty but it couldn't describe a truly miserable flight. I could only really describe it as 'United in disguise' expected far better from AC.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,A Cowan,Canada,2014-06-12,"We flew Air Canada 2 weeks ago (not Rouge) Toronto - Munich on an outbound leg to Athens. While boarding the craft in Toronto was a little disorganized the flight and service was great and the flight would have rated full stars across the board. Our return flight was AC 1901 Athens-Toronto only gets 3 stars for satisfaction as we did arrive safely and on time. That is really the only good thing to be said for it. This was an 11 hour flight through 7 times zones. The flight was half full so staff were not overworked. Unless you pushed the call attendant light they were only in evidence when the very poor meals were delivered (not served). No choice available limited beverage service followed 15 minutes later. One mid-flight trip down the aisle to slide some pretzels and 4 ounces of pop or juice onto your tray and two silent passes of an attendant with a bottle of water and the staff disappeared at least in our cabin. No entertainment available at the seat unless you were willing to pull out a credit card again to rent the airline tablet. The worst of it all was the total lack of comfort provided by the seat. We do not like having the seats in front of us recline so that is not really a problem however the seat design offers no support in the lower back and has restricted both aisle and window passengers from stretching their legs. The arm rest design means that you can inadvertently call the attendant or turn your light on or off. Others have commented on the lack of personal ventilation at the seat so I won't. A mixed blessing was having blankets and pillows provided prior to take-off. At 1pm this seemed a little like telling someone that they are being ""put down for a nap"". If you don't want them you must give up your limited space to store the items in the event that might want them. On the plus side overhead baggage storage was adequate (however this was not a full flight and might be a problem if fully loaded). Washrooms were adequate but masking tape holding dispensers and bins closed does not inspire confidence. As has become the norm the audio system was poor - either the airline staff need a lesson in microphone use and diction or the system needs an overhaul as most announcements were so ""mushy"" as to be indecipherable. Finally while we recognize that the airport is responsible at this point the baggage pick-up was a bit of a problem as the overhead monitors specified one carousel but the baggage actually arrived on a different one.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

air-france,/airline-reviews/air-france,Air France customer review,C Chan,Singapore,2015-05-06,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in.

I was told to 'just try it or leave it not their responsibility to know what the food was'!. For me the most worrying element was the lack of safety. We descended and landed with the air hosts standing up and chatting. Some of the overhead lockers were not shut and passengers were not asked to have seats upright or tables put away.

air-europa,/airline-reviews/air-europa,Air Europa customer review,E Lee,United States,2010-10-20,"JFK to Madrid with connection to Venice return via same cities. Plane took off about 2 hours late from JFK but arrived on time with the benefit of a strong tailwind. No explanation for delay provided but once on the ground in Madrid the cabin attendant gave the typical insincere apology for ""any inconvenience."" The next leg to Venice on time - the only flight segment that was timely. The return to Madrid left Venice about 1.5 hours late and arrived Madrid late by same amount. Madrid to JFK pushed back more than 2 hours late and then immediately halted for a half hour more while mechanics were called on board to fix the air conditioning. We deplaned at JFK 3 hrs late. Again the cabin attendant gave a rote ""apology"" but no explanation for the delay. Air Europa has no info on its rather primitive web site to inform whether flights are on time or delayed. Delays aside the cabin staff were polite animated and professional except that curiously no one claimed to know anything about the cause of the various delays encountered. This is a Spanish airline and most of the passengers seemed to be Hispanic. Important announcements were given in both Spanish and English but the message was often delivered in heavily accented English. The pilots said little particularly avoiding any discussion of delays. I suspect delays are too sensitive a subject for AE to discuss in a forthright fashion. Check the airline's on time record before buying tickets as I wish I had. Avoid this airline if making onward connections is a critical concern. Passenger comfort in Economy was at the lower end of tolerable. I don't travel enough to make a comparison with other airlines but I'd venture that few airlines afford the economy passenger less seating room than Air Europa if indeed that were even possible. For a relatively new A330-200 the seats didn't return to the upright position without some assistance. Stowed baggage was routed through to the end destinations and arrived without problem. Be careful though at the JFK we were charge $50 for an overweight bag. Next time I'll use something more accurate than the bathroom scale. Food and beverage service were OK. One observation: as the low price leader it's surprising AE has not sought to leverage this advantage by more zealous attention to managing flight delays. If so I would have given higher marks for value. For example they might start by acknowledging a problem exists and that saying nothing won't make it go away. I wish AE good luck but next time I'll pay up to choose a carrier with a better on time record a more informative web site and more seating room.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

However I found the cabin crew to be lazy as they never responded to the call button meaning I had to go to the galley when I wanted something like a drink. Also the entertainment was disappointing because although it was video-on-demand the selection of decent Western films was limited and there was no Western music only Indian. Furthermore the staff at Delhi Airport were so rude with far too many checks yet insufficient staff that meant getting through checks at Delhi during transit took far too long.

For example when the purser was meant to make the safety announcement she looked around and saw a flight full of foreigners. As a result she actually shrugged rolled her eyes and sat right back down instead of briefing us. That it was a 30 year old Tupolev made that nagging feeling of 'I should probably listen to the safety announcement in case I jinx the flight' all the more pressing. That said the flight was a dream. The plane felt so heavy we barely realised we were touching down. The food was passable but the experience was unforgettable. Our seats tilted forwards rather than backwards. But for a 2 hour flight the sense of wonder far outweighs any actual discomfort. The stewardesses seemed more interested in reapplying thick strata of foundation and redoing their 60s overdone hairstyles than actually serving their passengers but the sight was certainly more entertaining than the sad slightly desperate propaganda movies played throughout the flight.

Breakfast on board was a sad affair with the nasty frankfurter sausage having made an unwelcome return. The Crew however were fine. The return flight out of LHR was less joyous. We were treated to an unintentional and lengthy display of origami by the check-in agent writing folding our lounge invitations (Why cannot the boarding passes simply be used for lounge access?) and a whole wad of questions about my wife's visa which is perfectly valid.

At the risk of sounding like a record stuck in a groove this was the fourth Air Malta flight in two weeks which went very smoothly and efficiently. Check-in at Gatwick was instant and the revamped fast track facilities were as they should be. Plane left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. Service was friendly. Only gripe is that if you are sitting in row one there is nowhere to put ones bags as the overhead lockers directly above them are used by the crew necessitating stowing the bags slightly further down the plane which is a particular nuisance when disembarking.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

The rest of my family were seated in row 21 and myself in a middle seat in row 17. This route is the only route where this problem has occurred and may be something to do with the plane coming in from Munich with passengers on board or lack of efficiency at Catania Airport. The check-in clerk told me to speak with the crew on boarding the plane as there were spare seats in row one but these were already occupied on boarding making any further conversation fruitless. To make matters worse my pre-assigned seat (17E) was occupied by someone else who was reluctant to move despite being in the wrong seat. The saving grace was that the flight was short and punctual.

On board the crew were very efficient helpful and friendly. Very spacious seats although slightly uncomfortable when they are fully reclined.

This is probably the same for other airlines. I usually fly from LAX to GOA (Italy) via CDG from two to four times a year. I really wish there were better alternatives but it so happens that Air France has the shortest flights. Once after booking online on their website my trip I realized I made a mistake and although it says that all flights can be cancelled within 24 hours it took a lot of effort to get my money back. They seem to nickel and dime you for every little thing. More than once the flight from LAX was late and my connection was lost. I had to spend the night in Paris at a very cheap motel with bad food and uncomfortable beds. If you have the extra money to avoid Air France cheap accommodation you'll be fine.

Plane quite empty. Had to wait for 1.5 hrs for Virgin arrival from Melbourne which had 40+pax on. Even with them the flight was about 70% loading. Gave us a row of 4 to us so we were able to lay the child down for a nap. Outbound was daytime flight and quite easy - IFE very basic. Food was ok (poor entree). Not a lot of drinks (hot cabin too) and service was too quick with them wanting to get everything out the way ASAP. Toddler given an infant meal (as she was on an infant ticket) and we were not allowed to get anything else as there was no other food loaded. Return - slightly more full but this time we were given a bulkhead. Pointless with a toddler but we did have a row of 4. Word of warning the bulkhead rows the arm rests do not lift up. Overnight flight but bulkhead was near toilet which was going all night - so impossible to get sleep. Also some annoying little blue light sits right above you so its not dark either.

On the return flight food was better but crew offered the bare minimum of service - no smiles read the newspapers for much for the flight and even curtained off row one so they could use it as a rest/reading area.

Air NZ's P/E seats have varied over the past few years depending on aircraft type and routes. These former business-class-style leather seats are extremely comfortable. The only drawback is the footrest which is awkward. Main advantage in P/E is the legroom and space. Our view is that all seats should be like this. Economy cattle class now really is horrible. Air NZ's business class is superb but so much pricier. P/E is well worth the extra cost. If you are hesitating just try it. How nice to have a personal ""Kia ora"" message on your screen. Air NZ's safety video remains hmm quirky though some passengers now find it a little OTT and are fed up with the continued hyping of the Lord of the Rings movies. IFE was only adequate and offerings could have been more comprehensive. Food was excellent. It did seem unnecessary for the FAs to have to make two separate trips to serve up appetizers and main courses when one excursion would have sufficed. Not really a fan of overnight flights if arriving early in the morning (not the case if flying the other direction) as you have to wait hours to get into your hotel.

air-nostrum,/airline-reviews/air-nostrum,Air Nostrum customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2010-06-12,Madrid-Murcia return. I've had a few flights with Air Nostrum now and find their flights reasonably enjoyable. Service pleasant and friendly from the FA (coffee served) and flights seem to leave on time. I was very impressed with my check-in at Murcia's small terminal and which involved ticketing right through to Tokyo using Iberia and Japan Airlines connections and the whole process was seamless and efficient. I'm not sure if I like travelling in CRJ 200s that Air Nostrum uses but that may be because on Air Nostrum at least I never seem to be able to get clean windows and am unable to see outside much at all.

Maybe I was lucky but the experience was quite good. The flights both ways were on time and without any unpleasant incident. Connecting from Air Canada (Terminal 1 in Madrid) to Iberia (Terminal 4) was a bit of a trial. It took a good 15 minutes on the shuttle bus much of it on the highway. Air Nostrum used a Bombardier CRJ a bit tight for space. Service on this 50 minute flight exceeded my expectations. No inflight entertainment - none was expected of course given the small plane and short flight. The two FA managed to serve drinks and miniature sandwiches (an almost microscopic bun with a single slice of chorizo inside) although they had to rush to get it done. I was in the last row and the descent to Valencia airport was choppy - felt like a life raft in rough sea! Anyway service was pleasant and I give Air Nostrum full marks. On my return leg on an Iberia Airbus 320 the experience was also quite good although below Air Nostrum. FAs did their job and were reasonably pleasant. Clean plane with 3+3 configuration leather seats with lots of leg room. The flight was only half full and left about 15 minutes late but got to Madrid on time. The downside was absolutely no drinks or snacks of any kind except in business class. There was food for purchase but I didn't see a single person purchasing. No IFE or video demonstration of any kind. I had only carry-on so can't comment on baggage handling. Overall a good experience I would give Air Nostrum 4 star and Iberia 3 star.,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
air-nostrum,/airline-reviews/air-nostrum,Air Nostrum customer review,Roger Stone,NA,2008-07-11,FRA-ZAR-FRA economy on Air Nostrum for Iberia in mid-June. I was disappointed. The all-economy seating when booking had been altered to mixed configuration business and economy by departure date and the economy passengers seemed to get much poorer service and food than the one or two passengers in the little business class cabin. FAs on all flights also seemed to have a bad case of attitude. Maybe I was having a bad hair day but I found the service poor the flights noisy (in the CRJs) the windows almost impossible to see out of.

Seat only flight good on time good crew IFE fine but no laptop power and buy on board food is poor. I usually fly QF but their plane was full and this was the best bet but it wasn't cheap.

Several emails sent asking for assistance and only received generic emails with no answers. Got quote by phoning NZ $1700 per person. We can't afford it.

The guy in the aisle seat had no where else to put his long legs he seemed about 6 foot six inches tall except in the aisle which was not good for anybody.

We were supposed to be flying on a 777-200 but Air NZ had changed this to a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. What a bonus that turned out to be the aircraft was almost empty I had a whole three seat row to myself in the rear cabin and the new aircraft was absolutely brilliant to fly on. The seats are very much the same as the ones on the 777-300 but with a newer entertainment system and with bigger windows that tint rather than have a shade to pull down.

Flight was packed but ended up with an empty middle seat next to me! Flight attendants welcomed all passengers with a smile and small talk (I don't speak Serbian and I'd say 95% of the passengers were Serbian) but they were all fluent in English. Departed 5 minutes early and nice 1 hour 50 minute flight. Menus were handed out in coach and a yummy chicken or beef dinner was served. Seats were a little hard but for 2 hours who cares. Landed and luggage was on the belt within 5 minutes after going through immigration. Really enjoyed the flight and service.

Very unique feel to this airline it's a small airline serving a small population plus tourists. Impressed by food service in both classes one of the best breakfasts I have had in Business Class and on the return offering 2 hot meals on a day flight was impressive.

air-tahiti-nui,/airline-reviews/air-tahiti-nui,Air Tahiti Nui customer review,L Nelson,United States,2015-04-20,We flew on April 7 and 14 back and forth to Papeete. While the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights. A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea. In conclusion if flying to Tahiti again I would try to find a different airline when booking but would likely fly this one again if I had too as the destination is paradise.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,0,4,1,4,NA,NA,3,0

Good to be towards the front of the plane for disembarking but the seats are quite narrow and cramped. Sat in 57k onto LA which was slightly better. Missed out on preferred meal but only because I was right down the end. Food was the best I've had in a long time. Entertainment was great and the ability to order drinks from your screen is very handy. It also means no bells going off through the flight for service. Flight attendants were pretty average. Not great but not rude. I drank a lot of Sauvignon Blanc which was delicious and from New Zealand. All in all or was an average flight.

On the down side passengers are bussed to the aircraft and ATN staff lost complete control of the process resulting in a scrum to get on the busses. Onboard we passed on the meal offering and slept. The hot breakfast was welcome. Arrivals Hall was chaos and a 1 hour delay to get through Immigration awaited us. Returning the Departures Area is new spacious but very warm. Boarding went well as our seats were in Row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at LAX. Once again pleasant and efficient crew.

The same thing happened PPT-LAX. On arrival at LAX no bags. They were off-loaded at PPT and could not be traced. They did turn up on the next flight: that isn't good enough on economy but it is completely unacceptable in First. The response of the LAX agents could not havee dismissive.

By booking early for our Canada holiday I was able to secure Club Class seats at not much more than the scheduled economy fare and what a good deal that was. Comfortable seats with plenty of legroom in a 12 seat cabin pleasant and attentive FA's and as much food and drink as we wanted served with real crockery and cutlery. The ground procedures at Manchester need an overhaul though. Check-in and bag drop only open at the prescribed time and then they insist on checking and tagging cabin bags (which are never inspected again so why they have to be tagged is a mystery) all of which makes the online check-in facility superfluous. This was not the case at Toronto so why is it needed at Manchester? There was less service from FA's on the return flight although this did give passengers the opportunity to sleep which would have been easier had not the FA's been constantly chattering in the galley area or tearing up and down the aisles! Most of the complaints about Air Transat seem to come from economy class passengers but both our flights were full which says something.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Overall I was satisfied with this airline for the price I paid although by the time you pay for the extras you want you don't end up saving that much compared to a full service airline. All the flights were on schedule or ahead of schedule. The staff were all efficient professional and friendly. The cabin on the last leg of the journey felt very cold and so I had to pay to rent a blanket. The flights were smooth and I was pleased to get updates from the pilot about our flight - you don't get this with Chinese airlines.

Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing.

airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,Martin Brown,United Kingdom,2014-11-03,"Air Asia is trying to operate a Business Class service on a budget airline basis and it doesn't work. I was unhappy with the choice and availability of food the lack of TV screens and the insistence on being charged for your drinks except for bottled water which was given out freely. The cabin was spacious and the flat bed an essential. The price charged should have been higher and the service quality that Business Class fliers expect should have been provided. This all palls into insignificance against Air Asia X cancelling my flight that I had paid for 9 months in advance citing ""Commercial Reasons"" for this - in other words they hadn't filled enough seats for the flight so they cancelled it and bundled the passengers on to the next flight. This left me facing an overnight stay in Melbourne airport. Air Asia is doing something nobody else is they are trying to offer low cost Business Class service using the Ryanair model. It doesn't really work and travellers like me would be happy to pay quite a bit more to get the proper level of service.

air-new-zealand,/airline-reviews/air-new-zealand,Air New Zealand customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2013-09-18,AKL-LAX-LHR in premium economy on Boeing 777-300 with the relatively new Spaceseats. I have flown NZ many times in long haul but this was my first trip in the new Spaceseats and I was pleasantly surprised. On the first leg I was in the front row seat 23A (window) and 30E (middle section aisle) and found the seats private comfortable and with a great deal of width that surpasses any other premium economy on the market (this is a 2-2-2 configuration where other airlines have 2-4-2 in this class). The fixed shell seats mean there is no encroachment from any seat in front and the staggered design means the person next to you is not intrusive. The recline is a bid fiddly but once you get used to it is fine with a decent sized pillow blanket and a beanbag for footrest. I found it better to get my cabin bag down after takeoff place it on the floor and put the beanbag on top for a serious leg rest but it was easy to turn to one side resting the head against the shell of the seat and get some sleep. Food and beverage service is very much Business-lite not economy plus with good quality main courses decent drinks service and all at a level that makes you feel it is much more premium than economy. The cabin itself was quiet it helps that all seats except the windows have direct aisle access. Of course it is far removed from Business in that it is not a flat bed and the food/beverage service for that has a bit more choice and other touches but it is a world away from being crammed together like cattle in economy class. All in all it made this ultra long haul route tolerable and reasonably pleasant (with a decent although not outstanding inflight entertainment system let down by fewer choices than there once were on NZ). It shows other airlines what premium economy can be like although I'll admit the fare reflected this.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,3,1

airasia-x,/airline-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,Bruce McLaughlin,Australia,2014-08-28,SYD-KUL-PVG 23 August 2014. I chose Air Asia X because I wanted a multi-destination itinerary rather than a return flight and the budget airlines (Air Asia to China and Scoot back to Australia) were a much better deal than a legacy airline open-jaw fare. It was a great experience. Check-in at Sydney was quick and easy: the queue was less than 15 minutes and the check-in person was friendly and efficient. Transfer check-in at KLIA2 had no queue at all. I used OptionTown to try to get a row of three seats to myself for the SYD-KUL leg and an upgrade to Business for KUL-PVG. I got both. The row to myself from SYD-KUL cost about A$ 30 I think and the business upgrade from KUL-PVG cost about A$ 50. Both were a bargain. In economy for SYD-KUL there was more legroom than I've had on many legacy airlines. The seat was comfortable - it was fairly soft leather. It was even more comfortable with three seats to myself. Food - biryani - was excellent and good value. For KUL-SYD the business class seat was amazingly comfortable and folded almost flat: I could sleep comfortably lying on my side. On both legs FAs were friendly efficient and unobtrusive: they did an excellent job. One tip for people flying out of Sydney or Melbourne. You may be tempted as I was to buy drinks from a vending machine on airside so that you don't have to buy drinks onboard. Don't. A bottled soft drink at the airport is A$4; cans that you buy on board are RM6 which is much cheaper. The airline's only shortcoming is that you don't have IFE (although you can rent a tablet). But if you bring your own pre-loaded tablet that doesn't matter. I'll certainly fly Air Asia X in future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,5,5,5,1,NA,NA,5,1

On board staff are generally helpful. Customer Service could be better especially at check in in Riga - often long queues that merge into one - airport check in area is rather small and often the queue is out of the door so it pays to arrive earlier. Airport airside is pretty good now with the addition of new shops. I generally travel the London/Riga/London route which is nearly always full. Tend to be expensive at times - out of season usually the better deal. At least assigned seats - unlike the free for all on Ryanair in which case if you are not Latvian or Russian you will not win because they are queuing for plane 30 mins before boarding starts - look out for the passengers who stand up immediately the wheels touch the runway preparing to get off - it always amuses me.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,4,3,0,NA,NA,3,1

It's not the first time that I traveled with Air Transat and I must admit that it was not the best flight. The flight departed late and the cabin was very hot when we boarded because the air conditioning system had broken during the landing of the previous flight. During the flight we hit a lot of turbulence and the crew could not serve any meals during that long period. After that they rushed to do that service. The meal and the crew were fine nothing special. The seat was a bit uncomfortable it's the same comfort for their longest flights to Europe but I enjoyed extra legroom because it was an emergency exit seat. The inflight entertainment was an old movie show on the overhead screens. I also found some announcements made in French were a bit unprofessional but they were made in a joyful tone. Overall despite the turbulence the flight was fine. I've travelled a couple of times with Air Transat to their Europe flights and the crew (some of them are friendly while a few were unprofessional) the service and the seats are all the same nothing special.

My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,Rohit Thukral,United States,2013-10-25,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped.

Both flights excellent value at promo fares offered and even with the extras came to just over 100 pounds return for 2 people return. Flights on time aircraft very clean check-in at both airports very efficient. Airline food on way out OK but way back actually very good for an airline hot meal (roast chicken and thai green curry options for the return flight).

Having flown with AirAsiaX a number of times years ago (which I think the experience was acceptable for a no-frills airline) this last flight I did was nothing but excellent and exceeded my expectation even though the flight was delayed by more than 24 hours. Bad weather was the reason why the aircraft that we were supposed to get on that morning could not land in OOL and was instead diverted to BNE. Ground crew in OOL handled the situation extremely well by keeping us up-to-date about the situation every half hour. As the situation developed we were offered cash vouchers to get lunch at the airport. At first the crew were trying (very hard) to bus everyone to BNE and fly us out from there on the same day but BNE airport authority wouldn't allow them to do so. Without further delay we were offered a night stay at a hotel in Gold Coast with dinner cash vouchers and free bus rides to and from the hotel so we could take the flight out the next morning.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

After delay of over an hour it eventually turned out Air Transat had messed up my wife's booking and given her a completely wrong name but they did not seem to have a clue how to sort it out. It was only because our travel company rep had back-up evidence of our booking that we were allowed to travel and then not seated together otherwise we'd still have been in Gatwick not Calgary.

While theoretically we had more legroom being by the emergency exit that space was virtually permanently occupied by the queue for the loo so far from being able to stretch out my long legs I was claustrophobically hemmed in. Add to that it was the narrowest airline seat I've tried to fit in and I may be tall but I'm not wide.

There is 9-abreast seating when it is normally only 8-abreast on the same aircraft on full-service carriers. The headrest is also very uncomfortable. Hand-carry luggage was not properly monitored which caused some problems with boarding. Comfort amenities only provided if paid for.

Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy.

alitalia,/airline-reviews/alitalia,Alitalia customer review,D Olteanu,Hong Kong,2014-08-02,For 10 years I avoided Alitalia but then visiting Italy for holidays I thought we may give it another try. So travelled from Florence to Bucharest via Rome on 31 July 2014. It is a 1.5hr flight that was delayed by about 30-45 minutes but there was no acknowledgement or announcement of the delay. Transiting through Rome itself is a case study in how not to organise an airport for transit and boarding the flight was a nightmare. No priority for families or business no possibility to upgrade to business with miles from the alliance even though the business class was completely empty (meaning not one seat was taken). On the flight itself food was very poor and the cabin staff just disappeared. There were no sick bags in the seats and the staff did not answer the call button at all - too busy chatting in the empty business class - and then spent 10 minutes looking for sick bags. Also no announcement for landing or beginning of landing. In fact no pilot communication whatsoever after taking off. And as we got to our destination in Bucharest our checked in bag was lost and apparently many other people on the flight who transited via Rome had the same problem so long queue at the Claim section.

If you have to cancel for some reason you won't get any of your ticket or upgrade back. The real notable problem though is the very meagre meal service. For an 8 hour flight the meals are more the size of a snack and certainly not enough. And even if you want to buy something extra unless you have a credit care you're out of luck.

Inflight entertainment was poor but I believe this is being upgraded. My one criticism would be the food. I ordered a special meal but there was no record of this on the system when I checked in. I tried to contact Air Transat whilst in Canada but could only get a recorded message telling me that I should have requested this through a travel agent at the time of booking which I had done.

Arrived at Vancouver airport 2.5 hours before departure to find check-in queue already 100 metres long. Inadequate number of check-in desks trying to deal with 3 separate flights. Queue moved 10 metres in 40 minutes but then a bit quicker. Concern mounting everywhere that we would be denied boarding or that flight would be seriously delayed. No announcements no staff on hand to explain - general couldn't-care-less attitude. Asked to see check-in supervisor but she declined to appear. Finally we arrived at check-in after 90 minutes standing in the queue and saw that they had opened more desks. Further 30 minutes standing for security and we headed straight for departure lounge to find them already boarding. Miraculously flight left on time but a lot more could have been done to soothe angry passengers. Once aboard cabin crew on this flight completely cackhanded. Man next to us had chicken dinner tipped into his lap. I was hit by passing trolley at least six times because my arm was about 10 mm over the edge of the arm rest (I am 1.82 m tall and weigh 80 kg). Tonic water went down narrowly missing me but wetting floor all around. Night flight over the arctic but windows kept up all the way so no sleep possible. No long-haul flight in economy is really pleasant but this was the worst I have experienced. Schedules of this return flight were changed three times in months and weeks prior to departure.

Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours; that's absurd) and their MVP Gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers (they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied). Overall I have enjoyed them however and I will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a Seattle-to-Houston trip (there are no nonstop flights going to Houston on Sunday afternoons with Alaska or its partner airlines so I'll have to get there using Continental and come back on Alaska which is fine).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Ruckel,United States,2015-03-17,I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions.

Onwards to the departure gate screens indicated a 25 minute delay. Was not too concerned as had around 4 hours to connect onto BA flight once landed in JFK. We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door. Anyway the four hour connection time was fast approaching and people were starting to become annoyed and very irritated. Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling.

The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster.

Small mattress and nice blanket provided for sleep - but the cabin temperature was insanely high. Both myself and my travel companion were sweating trying to sleep.

The night before I did get an email that said that the flight had been delayed from 7.45am to 3.05pm. I was thankful for that because their were many people that didn't get the message. So about 2-2.30pm they announce a gate and plane change. They had to get a plane from another airline Suncoast. Since this plane didn't have the same seating they changed to open seating. So they boarded handicapped first then priority people then groups with small children then people with assigned seats and then everyone else (seems like Southwest seating). By the time we did all this it was about 4.15pm. They did give us water and a snack pack on the trip. So we get there late and what do you know there is an Allegiant plane already at the gate. We have to wait another 30-40 minutes until that plane leaves until we can get to the gate. There were no weather problems at either city. I overheard the Suncoast crew saying that Allegiant did have any crew available and that's why they had to change planes.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,4,0,0,NA,NA,2,0

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,2014-08-13,ORD-MIA-GRU in Economy on July 28. Daylight flight from Miami to Sao Paulo - delayed 4 hours and that is where American failed its passengers. They boarded us and at the departure time they asked us to de-board as the plane has mechanical issues. Ok - fine. They say there is a plane at a gate that will take us to SP and they just need to service the plane. That was a lie - all the passengers got to the gate (and we had been told to take our pillows and blankets as the new plane wouldn't have them) and there was no plane. We sat around for 3 hours before a plane showed up from the hanger where 4 AA 777s sat the whole time. Finally board and take off - 8 hour flight and flight attendants were friendly. Seat comfort is awful - no leg room due to entertainment box at the window. Seat cushion is non-existent so luckly the extra pillow helped (we got on the plane and blankets and pillows were already there). Upon landing in Sao Paulo at 12:10am (4 hours late) we finally got an apology from the flight deck - until then they didn't say a thing about the delay. Come on American - have some respect for the people who pay your bills. I did get an email when I landed with an apology and 5000 AA miles - ok - that's nice. But I felt sorry for the many passengers who missed connecting flights at 12.10am there are no more flights until morning. I had a 2.5 hour drive to Santos and didn't get to my hotel until 3am. When AA does it well - its great. When they fail - its really bad.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,4,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

Flight boarded and crew had just come in from Miami. They were awful - no one said hello or offered a drink until just before we departed 45 minutes late to Porto Alegre. I understand they are tired - AA needs to change crew at Curitiba and have a fresh crew all the way to MIA. Landed 30 min behind schedule at POA - had to exit the plane and they gave us new boarding passes and just waited in the gate area for boarding. Little cafe had snacks and flight was packed (in coach - 1/2 full in Biz) so gate area was busy. POA-MIA - excellent service! Flight attendants were so friendly and accommodating. Greeted you by name - were always in the cabin even though the flight leaves POA at 12:05am - with water and snacks. Slept well and had a quick breakfast before landing in Miami. Aborted landing due to some warning light in the cockpit but did a fly around and landed safely. A really nice flight once we got the new crew at POA.

Personalised check-in through separate lounge area at Narita and use of ANA's stylish Suite lounge go a long way in helping to relieve any pre-flight stress. Once you are onboard and seated in your semi-private ""booth"" you are rewarded with an extremely comfortable fully reclining seat/bed and there is a very good entertainment system. Where the service excels though is with the flight crew and the dining experience. Having lived a long time in Japan I thought I had already experienced ""first class"" service and hospitality many times but that provided on my flight was the best I have ever experienced.

ana-all-nippon-airways,/airline-reviews/ana-all-nippon-airways,ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,M Finch,Japan,2013-05-04,San Francisco to Tokyo in economy class. This was the first time my wife and I have flown an international flight with ANA. From the moment we checked in everyone was extremely polite professional and even smiled. A smile goes a long way. The aircraft was clean and had the hard shell seats that slide forward instead of reclining. This took some getting used to but I managed since I didn't have anything under the seat in front of me. I don't think large people will like this style of seat. The benefit is not having the seat in front of you recline into your lap. The seat backs were higher and the top pf the seat did not taper to a head rest. The top of the seat back was the same width as the rest of the seat back. This allowed for a much larger video screen. I usually need to wear my reading glasses to watch movies but not this time! They also had room to put the remote next to the screen. Nobody hitting the seat back behind me like those touch screens and no remote in the arm rest taking up space. I also liked the foot rest. It gave me another option when adjusting to get comfortable. The differences with this aircraft did not stop there. The lavatory had automatic faucets. No need to push down and hope the water would last long enough to wash your hands. There was a beverage holder on the back of the tray table so you didn't need to pull down the tray table for only a drink. Then when you did pull down the tray table for your food there was another beverage holder in the seat back so you had more room on your tray. The main dinner course was excellent. By far the best airline food my wife and I have had in economy. Then another cart came by with miso soup. As if that wasn't enough an FA came by with Haggendaz ice cream for dessert. Throughout the flight beverage carts were making their rounds offering the soft drinks juices wine and beer. FAs walking around offering three different types of hot tea and another one offering coffee. We were rarely interrupted with those annoying long announcements in English and Japanese throughout the flight. When the seatbelt light came on no announcement. Instead FAs walked the aisles to ensure everyone was wearing their seatbelt. When dinner was served FAs carried a menu to show you what was being offered. All of the small details made a huge difference from our experiences with United and Delta. This flight was part of a trip which included flights with United. Too bad ANA cannot offer US domestic flights. United could learn a lot from ANA.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

For the first leg of this trip the plane was operated by IBEX and arrived on schedule. I have bad knees so I need assistance. It was offered each time. Plane to Frankfurt was a 777-300 and the flight attendant greeted me by my seat number: 24C. Service was excellent and the AVOD superb. Food was reasonable. For the changeover I had a courier who took me straight through passport control to the gate. Without this assistance I would not have made the connection. Flight to Amsterdam operated by Lufthansa and the difference was rather obvious. Nevertheless food and drink were served on the 50-minute flight. On the return trip the Lufthansa flight to Munich took off late and I was concerned about the connection. I was taken to the ANA plane by car and made the connection without difficulty. Departure delayed 2 hours however while the plane was de-iced and it was here that the superb ANA service was slightly lacking: given relatively little information. After takeoff the flight was good but again I was not told about the arrangements for assistance at Narita. 777-300 arrived well behind schedule and I missed the connection to Hiroshima. I was given a bus ticket to Haneda hotel accommodation next to Terminal 2 and had been booked on the first flight to Hiroshima the following day. I upgraded my ticket to Prestige Class on the 767 and had a pleasant Japanese breakfast. All in all the level of service was very good and I would recommend ANA as my preferred airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

The ANA gate is on the extreme edge of the LAX a 10 minute walk from Bradley terminal. Then from the gate you'll have to get a bus - another 10 minutes - to another stand-alone gate structure out in the runway area to board. The cabin was very hot and the seats have no individual air conditioning control. Throughout the 11 hrs flight the florescent light overhead was left on at all times which made it difficult to nap or sleep. The transfer in Narita was also a nightmare. There was a long line to another security check plus another 10 minutes walk and 3 floors down to board the connecting flight to Manila.

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,P Miller,United Kingdom,2014-06-17,LAX-LHR. Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films.

At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good.

Fast talking agents resulted in penalties which were more than the price of the economy class ticket even though I spent 4 times that to upgrade the tickets to business class using cash not miles. ANA C-class seats and AVOD are getting dated - pitch is much poorer than UA Cathay or Asiana. Cabin service was technically perfect but lacking sincerity. AVOD was spotty partner's AVOD did not work on the return flight. Indifferent attitude from the FAs.

IFE showing its age but again perfectly OK for an 8 hour stretch. Half the price of BA (although BA were in gouging mode because the flight was booked within 2 weeks of departure).

The passenger in the next seat just did not fit in his space he intruded into mine. Cabin attendants handed out standard airline food - awful. Three times they offered Korean immigration forms and then just disappeared until just before landing. Immediately on boarding the passengers in the row in front fully reclined their seats. That was possibly the only way they could fit in the space. The inflight entertainment had a scratchy sound. This was the worst airline experience I have had.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Delayed a bit in Chicago but landed on-time. Flight attendants friendly and love AA's new E-175 jets. Return was on the day the huge freeze hit the Midwest. Morning flight to ORD cancelled and put on 9.15am flight. That was delayed a few times then cancelled. Went back to the ticket counter where the agent put me on the next available flight Tuesday night (36 hours later). I asked to be routed through NYC but she said I had to deal with the ExPlt desk for that. After 2 hours on hold for the ExPlt desk (completely ridiculous but with the storm issues expected) I got a friendly agent who booked me on the 12.55pm to LGA then Tuesday flight to Chicago. YYZ-LGA flight an hour late with only 8 passengers aboard. Great flight attendants - lots of humor. Landed in LGA and went to AA desk to see if there was any flight leaving for ORD that night. Only one was scheduled (6 cancelled) and she got me a seat in coach - was very happy. At the boarding gate got my upgrade by an excellent gate agent who had a fun attitude in dealing with all the craziness at the gate. Good flight to ORD - had a nice squash gnocchi and salad. Cookies offered also. Landed 15 min ahead of schedule as there were no planes landing at ORD. It was a bad weather period but I think AA did a good job.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,9,4,4,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

Went from LHR to SYD via ICN and then return. Quality was definitely variable. The flight attendant's command of English was not brilliant so when requesting anything other than a drink or something to eat they really struggled. Food was ok but nothing out of the ordinary - nothing served for pudding except fruit. Air con was extremely cold on the outbound flight and seats very uncomfortable. On the newer planes the legroom is superb and much more comfortable but the older planes have standard legroom.

atlasjet-airlines,/airline-reviews/atlasjet-airlines,Atlasglobal customer review,M Turner,United Kingdom,2014-08-20,Flew from Luton to Ercan Northern Cyprus via Istanbul on the whole a poor experience. On the outbound flight our tickets said the flight was 12.20 but it was in fact displayed as 12.00. Check in staff were unfriendly put the wrong seat numbers on our boarding cards which we spotted otherwise our family would have been separated. Boarding was called 20 minutes before the inbound aircraft arrived and the aircraft left late resulting in standing in line for over an hour to board as there was minimal seating in the boarding area. The interior of the aircraft was dark and gloomy cabin lights were left off. The seating was cramped which meant the passenger in front could not recline his seat. The cabin service was shambolic the crew attempted to serve food and drinks from the same trolley and were constantly running our of things and were going up and down the aisles for more items constantly took over an hour to serve the meal. The meal was disgusting and was stone cold and my drink was half a glass of flat diet coke the crew had run out and didn't want to get another bottle. Staff were not friendly and continually forgot to serve people due to the distraction of running out of food. For most of the flight the aisles were blocked with crew with trolleys and food trays were not collected for a long time. Combined with turbulence it was not possible to visit the two economy class toilets for some time and it was not allowed to use them on the ground in Istanbul. On a positive note baggage collection and immigration in Ercan was fast and efficient. The return flight was slightly better boarding was more ordered cabin service more organised and cabin light switched on. Check in however was shambolic. When we landed at Istanbul most passengers had to change seats but had not been advised resulting in chaos and families being split up.

The hard working and pleasant two man cabin crew served a hot English breakfast coffee and then bar service twice on the 2h 30m trip (aided by plane being only about 70% full). 10 minute late departure might not have raised an eyebrow at Heathrow but the LCY ground staff apologised and the crew made it up en route.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

BA offered us nothing apart from rebooked us on the next flight out of London airports. Hotels near LCY fully booked so I opted for earliest flight departing from LHR at 0705 rather than spend a night in the expensive hotel in the city centre.

avianca,/airline-reviews/avianca,Avianca customer review,Cristiano Miro,United States,2011-02-24,Miami-Bogota-Guayaqui-Bogota-Fort Lauderdale. With the exception of BOG-GYE on a Fokker100 all segments on a new A320. Good legroom and large individual touch-screen entertainment- including a nice pillow blanket and quality head-seats. A small but tasty meal is served with colombian coffee and good-quality whisky. All free of charge! Female flight attendants are courteous and attentive but their male counterparts can be less so. One downside not Avianca's fault is the international wing at Bogota's Eldorado airport. Completely uninspiring not providing even an intercom system. Flights are called by the gate agents in loud voices as if we were in a bus station. However major construction is already underway and it should improve considerably the experience for the connecting passenger. All is all this is one of my favourite airlines when flying to South America. Not top-notch but above average at competitive prices.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Exceptionally good flights with unbelievably good service meals wine and comfort. Only problem was in making my 90 minute transit at Seoul-Incheon on the outbound Asiana flights. On return flights I noticed one transfer and security gate that was almost completely empty while another transfer and security gate a hundred metres away was jammed packed and virtually not moving.

New seats are a significant step up from the previous product. Had 3A on the way out and 7K back and the seats had excellent room lots of space for storage and comfortable for sleeping fully flat and relaxing. Topped off by the excellent food and beverage service with a trolley bringing out soup and 2 other starters 3 hot options and 2 desserts plus ice cream. A standard of food service you don't see on business class elsewhere. Only bettered by the coffee service with about 10 different coffee combinations on offer. The in flight entertainment screens are large and responsive with the only disappointment being the extremely small selection. I didn't mind as both flights left just before midnight so after dinner it was time for sleep. Service from the crew was excellent. Austria's only weak point in the past was the angled lie-flat seats now it has seats that are up there with the best.

Seating is same as economy with middle seat blanked out so could do with at least a bit more legroom. Main benefit is being in front of aircraft and having good quality catering. Service was very good outbound but inbound staff appeared to struggle with a larger business class section (seemed to be about 9-10 rows in business). Food in both cases quite good but unlike previous occasions no choices regarding options you take what is offered or nothing. The inbound trip saw the meals distributed and it taking around 20 minutes before drinks appeared which meant either eating without drinks or letting the hot snack go cold. Finally there was a 45 minute delay in delivering the baggage at LHR apparently due to an aircraft technical failure.

Travelling with an infant on this route is difficult but Asiana made it much easier with attentive service good food for the baby bassinets and good food for us. IFE excellent with programming on demand. First time going to TAS that we did not have to use a bus to get to the terminal. We had to gate check our stroller but at the Tashkent airport you need to pick it up at the baggage claim so we had to carry our baby until then which if you are familiar with the speed (or lack thereof) of the customs officials at TAS you know that it is not a small feat. The return was nice in business but even though we gate checked the stroller at TAS and told them we needed it at ICN they sent it through to the baggage claim. Luckily the ICN staff were wonderful and retrieved it for us quickly. Return was in the new Quadra business lie-flat seats which were comfortable for us but I can see how they might be too narrow for people with a larger build. Also strangely enough the business class bassinets are more narrow compared to the economy class ones. Nice amenity kit with L'Occitane products excellent food and service.

For the most part I enjoy the service i.e. friendly staff clean and well maintained aircraft food OK. However the legroom is not all that great and the on-board entertainment is woeful. Since I first started flying with Bangkok Airways back in late 2011 their prices have increased considerably such that the cost of a return ticket Dhaka to Bangkok is only slightly less than Thai Airways but with no Business Class far worse flight times and crap on- board entertainment. Their so-called 'lounges in Bangkok and Phuket are also not worth bothering with.

Baneasa airport is terrible has to be one of the worst in the world badly organized Staff unfriendly rude and unhelpful throughout. Only 2 checkin counters for about 5 flights leaving around the same time terminal is tiny and was fully packed. To make matters even worse they have a stupid policy where if you have baggage to checkin you need to pay a fee of I think 20 euro per piece but they cannot take the money at the checkin desk you need to shuffle through the fully packed terminal and then go and line up at another desk with even more people and pay for it separately then return to the checkin desk so they can check you have paid. The whole process took around 2 hours and we never moved more than a few metres the whole time. When we were finally bussed to the plane the staff were rude and someone I was travelling with has a fear of flying so they wanted us to be seated together but they would not allow it even though there was a spare seat at the back which I then moved to after the flight took off. One cabin crew member yelled very loudly at me because apparently my bag was too heavy but no one mentioned it in the terminal. Staff at the airport spoke little English. The plane was old and we really questioned the safety of it. Complimentary water served but then cabin crew at the back of the plane for the rest of the flight they even were not present to prepare the cabin for landing. On landing there were many people (Romanians) on mobile phones making phone calls etc none of the staff said anything. Mentioned it to staff after landing and they said they did not see it happen.

Blue Islands' price was all inclusive comparable in total costs and offered a really impressive service in the face of adverse weather conditions. We were due to depart early on a fog-bound April Friday morning with a ferry connection we had to meet by 4.15pm at the latest. First flight was cancelled due to fog but second noon flight was swiftly re- arranged luggage transferred all with minimal fuss and still within the desired time window.

There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all.

The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action.

Checked-in at the machines for the 1540 flight to find an hour delay reported so I went to the bar. This hour delay was put back an hour every so often. After two hours I was quickly given a £5 voucher for use in Belfast City Airport and the delay eventually showed as 2000. Thankfully this is a boring but good value airport to be stuck in. During this time announcements were made for various passengers presumably to sort out connections or be moved to any spare seats on other BMI departures which were ongoing. Finally at 2000 we did get a plane and get away. The crew explained they were not themselves delayed as they should have been making a flight at this time anyway; fair enough but reasonable empathy with passengers delayed over 4.5 hours is not too much to expect. The delay was down to two technical faulty aircraft and the pilot made a pious speech about customers understanding that safety came first. The plane was ok in terms of comfort though not too clean. This is also one of the handful of routes on which nothing is served free - BMI should re-assess this and move back to the levels of most European full service airlines.

Only after reminding the ground crew that Luanda is an not an easy destination to reach, that we had confirmed tickets and that we hold Star Alliance did we get on board. The flight from Brussels to Luanda was just not good. The cabin looks and feels fresh and clean, food is acceptable but there end the positive comments. The seats are nothing but horrible. In theory they may be ok but that's only on paper. You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back. The recline is ok but as long as you have someone behind you, reclining is not an option. The fact that my traytable was very loose of course did not help.

Sandwiches were fresh and very nice. Plane as a 747 that had seen better times. The seat was clean but tired looking. The biggest let down was the screen that was blurry in comparison to the Bling Airways screen I had in economy. The main meal was really nice. Beef fillet that was tender and cooked. Side Salad full of flavour and Mediterranean starter that I wanted more of. The 2nd meal was ""afternoon tea"" of 3 finger sandwiches and a piece of chocolate rocky road. A real cream tea would have been better! Seat comfortable upright and in sleeping position. Got plenty of rest and sleep both ways. Coming back the lounge in Vancouver is above the gate. Just enough seats. Nice snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was a big disappointment. Expecting a cooked English breakfast we got fruit in a plastic box followed by an egg and bacon muffin. I took one bight of the muffin and it mad me want to gag. Good crews on both legs.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Gurevich,United States,2015-04-17,9 April 2015 BA 777 Business Class Seattle USA - Heathrow. Check-in easy lounge good boarding pleasant. Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,3,3,5,NA,NA,3,1

brussels-airlines,/airline-reviews/brussels-airlines,Brussels Airlines customer review,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,2012-01-27,I fly BRS-BRU by Brussels Airlines (actually operated by BMI Regional) 3 or 4 times a year. The flights are good; punctuality excellent efficient online check-in comfortable seats and crew efficient. Frankly though they should be as the standard fare (BFlex) is over £600 for two one-hour flights. They claim a cheaper BLight fare exists but even booking 6 or 8 weeks in advance it never seems to be available. To add insult to injury after paying £600+ you are charged £5 to use a credit card that is just extortion.

brussels-airlines,/airline-reviews/brussels-airlines,Brussels Airlines customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2012-01-18,LHR-BRU return in B. Economy flex. On Airbus A319 and Avro RJ85. Economy flex is essentially economy class on a flexible ticket but has a few advantages. Fast track security is available at both Heathrow Terminal 1 and Brussels which is helpful at peak times. Seating is allocated with an empty middle seat if available which it was on both flights making it similar to business in that sense. Onboard there is complementary food - in the morning a rather bland cheese roll and a pain au chocolat in the afternoon it was two sandwiches and a cake. Still drinks included complementary wine and beer which is welcome. Overall reasonable for what is essentially a 50 minute flight with time built into the schedule to take into account expected delays at Heathrow. Competitively priced with BA on same route and the fully flexible Eurostar fares.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,4,4,2,0,NA,NA,3,1

These flights are operated by bmi aircraft and crews. All flights on time or a little early. Embraer aircraft are a fairly small but I like them particularly if they are not full (only one of these four flights was nearly full); they are light smooth and the leg room is fine for a short flight. My one complaint is the price one of my trips was economy (B.Light) and the other economy plus (B.Light+). Although the latter was over twice the price (and even economy is not particularly cheap) there was virtually no difference in the quality of service - a bit more food and that is it. I believe the hand luggage weight limit is a bit higher but if you check-in online nobody knows. So my advice is buy the cheapest ticket; though as previous commentators have said that is not always possible.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1

My only gripe was that I wished I'd flown Economy and saved money. The seat is exactly the same as is the leg oom.

brussels-airlines,/airline-reviews/brussels-airlines,Brussels Airlines customer review,Jean Louis Vergaert,Belgium,2009-09-23,Brussels to Budapest B-Flex: seems the additional cost of B-Flex compared to B-Light is worth when you fly on a B737 as you have a probability to get the seat next to you free. However if you fly the Avro the flight is almost always full and you are in exactly the same cramped seats and suffer lack of hand luggage storage space like B-Light - so you pay much money for the privilege of a regular food tray and apple juice.

I was given a very warm welcome. On the return from JFK I was surprised and pleased to have been given an upgrade to Club World in spite of travelling on a Reward Flight. This meant I was able to use the pre-flight supper in the JFK lounge which is so much better than eating during the flight so I was able to maximise sleep.

We have never liked the premium economy seats on BA but connections in JNB made it necessary to travel BA.

Return on BA56 on 29th Jan same problems on seats also toilet nearest to our seats was out of order and without treading on people you have to walk to the end of the aircraft for an alternative also when sitting in premium economy it is not possible to see toilet lights as all are behind you.

The food was very good too lovely and hot large portions of chicken/beef tasty liked the choices given so we were very happy. The new seat configuration on the Airbus we did not like we were in row 8 then 6 and they were fine but I'd not like to be in the first row right by the door and noticeably colder (stood right by the row queuing for the loo) and there is no bulkhead any more so it's a very small open space between the first row of seats the loo and the galley! I'm only 5 ft 2 tall and very slim build and I found the loo cramped looking around I couldn't see how 1/3 of the passengers would fit in it and I don't mean they were all way overweight it is very small and slanting roof. A tall and big built person would not be happy! I gave inflight entertainment 1 as obviously they don't exist on short haul flights. The seats were far too upright and therefore uncomfortable you could only recline them a bit or otherwise the poor person behind you wouldn't have had any space and I kept sliding forward on mine.

On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat.

A second drinks or coffee/tea service would have been appreciated. Flew Club Europe on inbound (Jan 7 13.40 flight) and although I'm not a seasoned business-class traveller I thought it was impeccable for the modest premium paid. 737 had the old layout so no complaints about seat comfort not sure if I'd say the same with the newer seating arrangement from what I've read on this forum. Crew member serving the club cabin could not have been better - everything was served with the most gracious of smiles and the mood in the cabin was relaxed but convivial.

Check in was easy and very quick and we were soon in the lounge. The lounge as usual was comfortable but with a very poor selection of food. As we were there around 09.15 I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which I didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first. On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. The return from Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However this was compensated by an excellent lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area. As usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away but I did manage to read for a while and then sleep for 3 to 4 hours.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,A Singh,United Kingdom,2015-01-11,Los Angeles - Heathrow - Los Angeles over the holidays. Club world is a perfectly fine business product. Staff on both legs were very good getting the job done in a polite and friendly way. Food again is pretty good and benefits from covering the basics well and not being overly fussy. Portion sizes not huge but I don't need the calories anyway. Plenty of drinks offered. An unexpected nice touch was when during the outbound night flight as the only passenger awake a crew member popped her head over asked if I was ok and if I would like a hot chocolate - and then went and made one. In terms of product this is not a million miles away from United business (both even have backwards-facing seats). However the BA cabin crew are in a class of their own and it feels like they know it which translates in to good service. United's intercontinental crews are a somewhat more eclectic group whose get-up-and-go appears to have got-up-and-gone. Just like with the 747 the upstairs on the A380 has side storage which is useful. The upstairs front section bathrooms are also huge (and from the front section you can go up and down the stairs if that tickles your fancy). But downstairs is light and roomy. On return on Dec 29 I was delayed at the gate at Heathrow as staff fussed over various 'company' passengers that needed to be accommodated. These company passengers - flight crew heading off on vacation - then unluckily sat next to me in Club and behaved appallingly for 11 hours - drinking champagne constantly loudly talking all night and demanding a running commentary on the ins-and-outs of working the A380 from every crew member that passed. They acted like children who had never been on a plane before - and their taking 'selfies' (that included me in the background!) all flight was mildly vexing. Upshot? As long as BA doesn't stiff you by putting its staff on freebie upgrades next to you you'll enjoy club world on the A380.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,D Thomas,United Kingdom,2014-11-25,On past experience I chose BA for our long haul return flight to South America from the UK. Not until I got to the payment stage did I realise that of the 4 flights only one short flight to Madrid was actually on a BA plane. The others were with Iberia Airways. I understand that flight operators have to partner with other agencies but you would expect then that they would adhere to standards expected of the original operator. Standards were very poor. No inflight entertainment on a 12 and 13 hour flight. Poor food and on the last leg of the journey we were even expected to pay for our food. What is this a budget airline at full blown prices? Again on this last leg the toilets weren't flushing! So at oyr destination they were almost full. My advice would be check who you're actually flying with.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,3,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

Positives were all flights on time and crews were overall great on all sectors. Was able to upgrade return at check in at DXB for about $1000 which I thought was worth it. I was not too impressed with WTP product - I still had to pay to get assigned seats which is ridiculous when you are paying extra anyway. The 747 the product looks old and tired. Menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a business class entree. Catering out of LHR was absolutely atrocious - almost like a TV dinner which is strange as this is their main hub. Return in Club world was a decent product. Lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable. Second meal service (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy.

It is just like Easyjet seating but with a business fare price tag. Food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam. Really? The flight gets in just before 19.00 hrs local time.

How BA have the audacity to screen 'BA A Very British Airline' on their IFE is beyond me! While the film chronicles the supposed high standards and rigorous staff selection and training the reality is altogether different. The food on BA85 LHR to YVR was atrocious - dried chicken sitting in a dubious brown 'sauce'. The service was unsmiling unhelpful and inattentive. BA used to have a good IFE selection. Not anymore!

Much below previous experiences flying in this cabin on BA. Staff were indifferent and inattentive. The meals were deplorable! Despite being a small cabin there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service - a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. Hardly suitable food for a long flight. Breakfast was worse - an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. Very poor!

The meal service has also improved and now has the Club World main course served together with wine in a glass and metal cutlery and a printed menu. There is also a hot towel service and drinks served before take off but in plastic cups and non-alcoholic.

Unfortunately this time I chose my National carrier. Disappointed is not the word. To start with the seating arrangement is absurd. All the others manage 1-2-1 or 2-2-2. BA manages 6 abreast in a horrible tight arrangement whereby you face your neighbour. When the hot towels were given out they were like warm rags in comparison to the other airlines. Food - ok there was a selection on the menu. However at service time I was merely passed a tray over my neighbour. On every Qatar flight you are not only addressed by your name but the table is made for you as if being in a 5* restaurant. None of this with BA. Once the appetiser and first course are consumed you hand the bowls back to the attendent who then passes your main course to you in a bowl. Shabby is not the word. After a reasonable sleep in a very narrow bed it was time for landing. With no sign of a priority immigration pass being given I asked the steward for one. He replied they did not have any for this flight but assured me there would be ground staff at the gate to supply this basic amenity. Stupidly I believed him. Upon departure at BKK no ground staff or passes. I return to the UK next week and for the first time ever I am dreading the experience. Never ever will I fly my national carrier again. Disgraceful.

Plenty of places to sit and relax; good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar. Priority boarding line worked well for business/status passengers.

First return trip was perfect - 10/10. Very comfortable business class seat and bed good food and attentive service. Only improvement could be to the choice of movies. First trip from ICN-LHR was particularly noteworthy as the first leg was 2.5 hours late due to a thunder storm in Seoul - flight landed in HKG 10 mins after CX255 was supposed to leave but Cathay held that flight which was very impressive and lucky. The ground staff were excellent. The ICN-LHR trip in May was not so fortunate. Due to ATC restrictions over China all flights to Europe were subject to creeping delays - i.e. 30 mins at a time. With the exception of our flight all flights boarded and eventually left - some were up to 4 hours delayed. For some reason CX255 was the only flight not called for boarding and eventually after 5am (4h30m after scheduled departure) the board stated it was est at 0900 the reason being the mandatory crew hours had been reached. I suspect the decision to hold our flight was more about aircraft rotation as that particular aircraft sits on the ground at LHR for 12 hours so effectively CX255 withstand a long delay without suffering a knock on impact to Cathay's schedule. Eventually the flight took off at 0945. Whilst I accept the delay itself was not under Cathay's control the decision to withhold CX255 was not communicated and all passengers were made to wait in the terminal through the night without any offer of accommodation.

Cathay Premium Economy never seems to vary: good food good service passable wine (albeit in a plastic cup) and quite good seating. A negative is that the Cathay Pacific web-site often shows premium economy as being already completely full when looking at potential flights and selecting seats when in fact it isn't full at all. I wonder how many customers Cathay are losing because of this. They've lost me this time because of this odd problem and I will head to Hong Kong and back on Qantas next time.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,John Frewen-Lord,United Kingdom,2014-07-06,Flew from LHR to YYZ on 23 June on new 787. Not impressed. Very bumpy taxiing. Smooth inflight but I couldn't really notice the extra cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to be so wonderful. I was seated in a window seat. Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since I paid £30 extra to choose my seat! Cabin crew friendly and efficient though why they didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it I don't know - safety issue if nothing else. Otherwise flight OK.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,4,3,5,NA,NA,3,1

(No First Class on the aircraft I used). Both aircraft's are similar from the point of view of the seat itself and the service you get although the A330 seat is slightly smaller but that is only really noticeable in the smaller side-cupboard by the seat. Storage is impressive and is everywhere. The headphone cabinet has more storage space too and it has a mirror. Seat firm but comfortable. You don't get pyjamas or a mattress with business class with Cathay only in their First Class. Initially I was miffed but actually I didn't notice not having the mattress and I slept well. The amenity kit has ear plugs anyway. Cathay dining is esoteric and not always to a western palate. It is served from a trolley so you get to see the product before you select it which is rather good. Cathay service is practical and competent but I feel that it is not polished like say BA or Emirates. I chose Cathay because I wanted the best seat for a 24 hr flight and in that respect any short-comings in other departments (food no mattress humourless but efficient staff) are insignificant: these seats will get you there in comfort. I was most impressed and will use them again. The seat does it for me - it is what makes a difference after the flight.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,3,2,4,NA,NA,5,1
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,2014-06-25,LHR to VIE BA 704 23 June 2014. The meal service in Euro Traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the New Mixed Fleet Crew The food offering was inedible a choice of Flat Bread with Chicken Tikka or a Salad. Do British Airways not understand that not everyone likes Curry or spicy food. At least do an offering of Meat or Cheese Sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. As for the cabin crew this new Mixed Fleet with their Thunderbird Hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. At least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. This crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. I would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the Duty Free. I fly British Airways every week and this is the worst crew I have known. I think the Mixed Fleet Crew are appalling in their customer service standards they can certainly learn a lot from their more experiences colleagues who are on the old contracts so come on BA start to bring back the high standards again the new Mixed Fleet Crew are letting you down very badly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Ian Robinson,United Kingdom,2014-06-16,Paphos - LGW 11th June. We had monitored the outbound flight on the internet so we knew it was about an hour late although we did not receive a text from BA to confirm this. We arrived at Paphos airport to a somewhat chaotic scene as the queue for security was snaking back around the complete length of the check in area and ultimately merging with the passengers looking for and waiting to check in with a number of different airlines. BA had 3 check in counters open one of which was for Club Europe with around eight couples queuing for each one. We had checked in online but still had to drop the cases off and receive our boarding passes and this took approx 20 minutes. I then asked where the fast track through security was what a stupid question that was as as there wasn't one. After 45 minutes in the queue we finally made it to the shared lounge and settled down to a glass of wine or two. The food options were OK but again not a great choice for veggies. The flight home left around 45 minutes late and was fairly uneventful with a relaxed cabin crew. We were off the plane quickly but then had to wait for around 45 minutes for the cases to arrive on the carousel although fortunately ours soon came through. Overall just an OK flight but BA's premier European product is somewhat underwhelming.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,5,2,4,3,1,NA,NA,3,0
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,H Davis,United Kingdom,2014-06-16,Recently travelled LHR to San Francisco and returned via Las Vegas flight BA0264. Some years since doing long haul and forget how tiring it can be. Flight out was 'ok' but return not so. Outbound spoilt by an hour or so delay when boarded as they decided to change one of the wheels glad they did though. Return yesterday not so good as flight again delayed by about one and a half hours but no real explanation. I realise people want to sleep but they can be so inconsiderate at times. No sooner in their seats and fully reclined. Meal was just adequate curried chicken but breakfast of a very hard croissant with jam a nutty bar some dried cranberries and coffee was not what I really wanted after a delayed 9 hour flight. Entertainment had good choices but sound quality was poor. Boarding process in Las Vegas was rather shambolic. Will still try and 'fly the flag' again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,1
british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Ian Robinson,United Kingdom,2014-06-16,LGW - Paphos 4th June. Check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. As we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. The lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. The food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. My wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. Having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. After a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. Why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. No pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. Pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. The crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not have been used on this route. My wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed FA said she could have hers. It was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. I was told that there was only one option left for me and I could have Kedgeree or Kedgeree so that's what I had. It was OK but not particularly hot. Arrived at Paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. Overall the flight was just OK although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. My wife did receive an email from BA within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,3,4,3,1,NA,NA,3,0

Food choice is excellent and service as always of a very high standard. Not too sure about the new wash bags large draw string bag with minimal contents the wash bags get bigger but the contents get smaller! Nothing really useful in the wash bag not even eye masks or ear plugs. Useful contents would be mouth wash wet wipes etc it is about time BA looked at returning to Molton Brown which was a lot superior than the Elimis range.

The new flat bed seats are comfortable to sit in and to lie down in and easy to function the choice of wines is limited but top drawer and the flight crew on all four sectors were neither slack or over the top.

Simple and tasty flatbread and drink ideal for the 1.45 journey. The return was a tad delayed due local ATC but even though only 10 mins or so the flight deck kept us very well informed and the crew came round with juice or water. Delay was made up enroute and bag appeared as I reached the carousel. Advance booking and using a few points (some I earned back on this flight) made the fare cheaper than low cost carriers.

SYD-HKG operated by A333 all other flights operated by 77W. Seat comfort was very good even for such a long flight with adequate back support and leg room.I found it relatively easy to sleep on Cathay. Food was of a very high quality for an airline - especially the Asian food options. The IFE system Studio CX kept me entertained for the entirety of my flights. The highlight was when I was flying from HKG-SYD and was stuck in a row of crying toddlers. The flight attendant came and asked whether I would like to move seat without me even asking. I was moved to a free exit row seat. It's the kind of service that you would not get out of the vast majority of competitors.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

Both legs (SIN to HKG HKG to JFK) of the flight were perfect. Meals were better than many other airlines and they served good dim sum! Staff were attentive and friendly. I read some reviews complaining that once meals are served and lights are off Cathy crew tend to chat at the rest area. I certainly didn't witness this. My only complain is the lounge at Changi and HKIA. The lounges were far too crowded I couldn't get a seat at The Wing I wished for a shower but I was told that it comes with a 30 minutes wait. I ended up at the public food court for some decent Hong Kong food. Though I managed to rest at G16 during the 3 hours transit. And take note priority boarding almost doesn't exist for Cathay in HKIA. There was an announcement but not exercised by the ground crew. So if you are those who like to board early join the queue early! I've got to say Singapore Airlines manage this much better than Cathay.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,4,1
cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,A Moreitz,Australia,2014-12-31,I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient.

The first leg Brisbane to Hong Kong was very busy and I took the view that the cabin crew were very pressed. Hence they made mistakes. For example I asked for red wine and got white wine despite the stewardess repeating my order to me. Water was served from plastic jugs and tasted of cleaning fluid. Clearly they had not been rinsed properly. And unlike most other airlines on such long haul routes there was no overnight pack (containing eg. toothpaste and toothbrush etc).

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Peter Bedson,Oman,2014-06-01,MCT-LHR-MAN and LHR-MCT I think you need to fly BA every so often to remind yourself why you don't do it any more. The first flight was just poor - from check in to landing. Although they have now changed the aircraft on this route and the IFE is better they still treat the passengers as self-loading cargo. It took me 3 hours to get a drink - the staff were cheerful they simply didn't do anything. A full flight and at least one washroom out of action was an additional pain. Transit through LHR is always an unalloyed joy and this time I had to go through immigration which added to the fun but despite this I still had time for a very quick shower between flights - hooray and full marks for the lounge staff. LHR to MAN was fine. Coming back was much better the crew were responsive and pro-active and the food was actually edible - if all BA flights were like this I would use them more - I only used them this time because Swiss have axed the route temporarily while the work on the Dubai runway is happening.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,2,2,4,NA,NA,3,1

When I told her I recognized her from my outbound flight on 4 Aug she was thrilled that I recognized her. Seats were spacious great leg room but I would have appreciated another 2 inches of recline to make sleeping that more comfortable. The downside was the food what was served was tasty but the portions were small and served on a tray not much larger than an A4 size piece of paper. The meal service was rushed and as it was a night flight there could have been more patrols with drinks and snacks.

When we asked for a snack for her they offered peanuts or mentoes hard sweets-both unsuitable for her. On the HK to London flight our attendant was great but all other flights we felt that we were being a nuisance if we asked for anything and even when they said they'd bring us something they didn't get around to it! This was simple requests like an orange juice or an extra bread roll. Our attendant from London to HK was very young and maybe just inexperienced. She was quite unfriendly.

Boarding was efficient with a dedicated air bridge for First passengers. Welcomed on board offered champagne newspaper pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. The space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. The food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. There are also treats available in the first galley. Breakfast was also very good. I managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. The crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. The entertainment system was the Thales product.

The first time I have flown with Cathay Pacific and it won't be the last. Excellent service throughout. Flew outward premium economy and flew back with business class. Aircraft was clean and tidy but the cabin crew were the stars of the show very attentive and pleasant without being too enthusiastic if you know what I mean. The food was excellent in both in premium economy and business class but business class certainly has the edge with the comfort and privacy. My wife doesn't normally sleep well when travelling in aircraft however the fully reclining seat was a great bonus which allowed her to get a few hours of good sleep. In comparison with other airlines I have travelled with the service that Cathay Pacific provides gives it that little bit extra. We can all say the seats are hard or the food needs a little bit extra but at the end of the day it is the staff who can make or break a journey and for me the staff certainly made it for me.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

One recommendation is try to avoid flying during the Chinese New Year which is very busy we flew January 19th and return flight was Feb. 4th and both flights were full. Our return flight was on a Tuesday (from Sydney to Hong Kong) and was absolutely chaotic and full. I found the Flight Attendants to be very helpful and extremely nice (compared to US Carriers). Our 2 yo daughter was screaming/crying and they were very attentive. Tried to upgrade to Economy Plus but not available. Economy is not going to be comfortable on any airline you choose (9 hr flight from Hong Kong to Sydney). Plan on little to no sleep on if in Economy with the seating. Most flights are red eyes to and from Hong Kong and Sydney. Food was ok and they do feed you no matter the time. We were annoyed as we flew back from Sydney as they fed us at 11pm we were hoping they would darken the cabin to help our daughter sleep no such luck. Inflight entertainment system was great.

Good usual Cathay service in Premium Economy I have found to be remarkably consistent over recent years (I tend to travel on Cathay to somewhere of other about once a month). Premium Economy is excellent if the smallish PE cabin is not full otherwise it can become rather claustrophobic. Cathay Pacific lounges are always first rate in my opinion - great for working or eating. Inflight food also seems to be improving. Only hassles I have is on very long sectors where I seem to have become the target of inconsiderate fellow passengers - getting kicked in the back every 20 minutes all the way from London to Hong Kong overnight is not much fun maybe a function of the seat pitch in PE.

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,A King,Australia,2013-10-01,Flew Heathrow to Melbourne. It was a pretty terrible experience all round. First flight to HKG was a 747-400. The seats were bizarre they did not recline but the seat slid forward a little bit and the support for the bottom of your back is rock hard. Terrible pockets on the seat in front mean if you put anything more than a newspaper in there the seat pocket is touching your knees. Also as with all Cathay flights I've been on there was no personal air conditioning control. Food as always was terrible - 2 meals on a 12 hour flight both of which were not nice at all. Breakfast choice always seems to be an egg based dish or seafood congee. I'd rather just have cereal next time. The dinner is always a choice of an oversalted Asian dish a vegetarian pasta dish or something else unappetising. Having already flown the opposite route we luckily knew to take snacks on board so we didn't starve. With Qantas / Emirates I usually end up feeling almost overfed not with Cathay though where you feel like you're in prison. With 2 or 3 hours before landing when breakfast was about to be served my girlfriend noticed that a child on the seat in front had been sick which had trickled between the seats and gone all over her tracksuit pants which were on the floor in front. We tried to get the cabin crews assistance but they continually ignored us. We ended up just putting them in a bag and then throwing them away. Never again!

china-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-airlines,China Airlines customer review,M Davis,United States,2014-05-08,SFO-PEK-MNL. The flights were better than expected based on past reviews I read. The food was fine and the kid's meal provided for my son was much appreciated. The FA's were not overly friendly but polite and efficient. I particularly liked the beverages made available in the galley. It was nice to be able to get up and get something to drink when needed. The FA's kept it well stocked with water soda tea and juices. The inflight entertainment could have been better. The movie & TV options in English were limited and aged. However they still gave us something to do during the flight. The provided headsets were not very good but we brought our own for the long trip so it wasn't a problem for us. Overall I was satisfied with Air China and appreciate the money saved when compared to other airline prices. For the value I would consider flying with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,3,NA,NA,4,1
china-southern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-southern-airlines,China Southern Airlines customer review,J Foster,United Kingdom,2015-06-07,Our son and daughter in law flew with them from New Zealand to visit us in UK and wanted to take an additional bag back to New Zealand and asked us to find out the cost. In February I phoned China Southern at Heathrow and carefully checked the cost and was given a break down of charge depending on whether booked at airport or on line and made it VERY clear the flight was London to Auckland. The day before they were due to fly I again phoned to check the figures and got the same charge to book in additional case at the airport. On arrival they were told the fee was double as it was two flights and would not budge. She felt she was being treated very badly and the attitude of the staff was absolutely dreadful. They were not that impressed with the flight to the UK and said food was nothing special and somewhat greasy and the staff not that bothered. They were not particularly looking forward to the return flight.

Overall the experience was mixed. Pros - needless to say brand new airplane and facilities. Above average (based on my experience on Chinese carriers) crew. Meal was nicely presented. Large IFE screen with plenty of choices. Cons - my seat did not go flat. I don't know if it's a mechanical failure so I asked an attendant to help me. She wasn't able to recline it either.

The seats are very uncomfortable there is a very thin padding that separates your body from the metal under the seat. There is absolutely no entertainment no drop down TV screens or personal TV screens. The food is very nasty and tastes inedible the rice was very dry and tasted like it was over a week old the vegetables have no seasoning and tasted horrible the beef was the worst the meat tasted very dry and was under heated as though it were a leftover from another airline it was cooked in a sauce that had no flavor and tasted like water. Passengers randomly got up during take-off and landing when the seat belt sign was on and no flight attendants even tried to tell people to sit down.

Online check in was non-existent due to website issues so did the old fashioned thing and checked in at the airport. Boarded first due to travelling with children. I am 6' 5"" so if I were sat with 3 adults it would have been a challenge. As we were travelling with a child I could get my legs into quite a nice position and slept for about 7 hours. Good selection of films for a 12 hour flight. Kids TV options aren't great so a portable DVD might be a better option. Service onboard was great. A drinks run before food a food run and then another drinks run - twice. Food was generally edible. Service is quick and effective and staff can speak enough English to get by. Dreamliner certainly kept me feeling fresh once we had arrived into CAN. CAN to HKT on a A321 was a little different in that there was no entertainment but a full food and drinks service. Return flights were exactly the same so for the money we paid I can't fault China Southern.

These flights employ well-used A330s. Flights smooth and on time. However my economy seat was narrow and very poorly padded - little better than a city bus. The entertainment system was old and tired with a limited selection of movies. Flight attendants did the basics but disappeared for long periods. They did however keep the toilets very clean. Loading procedures were amateur and chaotic as if the ground staff were improvising. Individual staff were OK but as a group they lacked management. This unpleasantness was magnified by the loading at Beijing. For reasons unknown the SIN and YVR flights had to load using buses out to the tarmac (when gates at the main terminal were obviously available). This is not appropriate for a large plane at capacity. Beijing airport is a liability as a hub. It is very large dreary inefficient and immersed in a toxic smog. Moreover as a passenger in international transit I had to go through a passport check and then through the general security check.

I flew from Brisbane to Guangzhou on one of CSAIR new airbuses which was relatively roomy with great inflight entertainment. The only downside of this flight was some very ordinary food. I'm not a fan of airplane food at the best of times but this food was close to unidentifiable. The next leg was from Guangzhou to Vancouver on one of the new Dreamliners which was great. CSAIR certainly have some of the most modern aircraft. The food on this leg was much better. The air stewards were good. Obviously English wasn't their first language but they did their best to understand English speaking customers. They don't bowl you over with friendliness but overall the trip was great especially when offered free accommodation due to a long stopover - only problem was I had already paid for accommodation. One thing if China really wants to crack the Western market they need to work on their 'people skills' at their airports. In Guangzhou we were made to feel very unwelcome with unhelpful airport staff. The 72hr transit visa waver is a bit of a nightmare with no one clearly explaining you need the boarding pass for your next leg even if it is 2 days away to get through customs - the airline ticket doesn't cut it.

Check-in and security was fast. A long walk to the lounge and the gate at the new Shenzhen Airport. Lounge was mediocre. Priority boarding good. Now about the flight itself. Good things: seats very good comfortable and lie-flat a light quilt and soft pillows placed at every seat. IFE was very nice with headphones and lots of movies and other videos to watch but the ads are a bit annoying but can be fast-forward. Now the bad part. Staff didn't smile much makes you feel you're not welcomed. The A380 seemed under-staffed and I had to wait 10 minutes for a drink refill. Food seemed a little unfresh a mysterious sauce and meat? In general China Southern has 5-star hardware and 3-star staff and service in my opinion.

china-eastern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-eastern-airlines,China Eastern Airlines customer review,Colin Lusty,Australia,2013-03-04,Recently flew from Shanghai Hongqaio to Qingdao on MU 5525 scheduled to depart at 08.30 am. Flight boarded on time and in common with all Chinese domestic carriers the cabin crew hustled passengers to get their gear into the overhead locker and take ones seat. Doors closed at around 08.25 am then we sat and sat and sat for 5 hours. Reason given was runway congestion at Hongqaio (a constant nightmare at this airport). After about 2 hours the food trolley was rolled out and the boxes containing bread cake and some nuts were handed out along with some drinks. We eventually took off 5 hours later. The 1hr 20 minute flight to Qingdao was uneventful.

FRA-PVG flights on time on new and clean A330-200-completely full high season flight but crews were very friendly and attentive. 2x meals Lunch and breakfast were served each with 2 choices (Asian and Western) but this time the drinks offers were limited to soft drink 1 sort of beer and 1 French red wine only. AVOD with over 700 programs of films and games is more than enough. During the night flight crews came around regularly with water and soft drinks. We seated near the WCs and saw that cabin crews often cleaned the WC which was appreciated. Transit at Shanghai Pudong was better organized than last time. Onward flight PVG-BKK on smaller A320 without AVOD (only shared screen) flight full crew pleasant but worse English skills than on Frankfurt leg - Lunch (2 choices of Chinese) again limited drinks offered. Return flights BKK-PVG with 90 minutes delay. After landing in PVG with only 30 minutes of transit time - thanks to escort of CEA ground staff- smooth and quick transfers with immigration and security checks. PVG-FRA on very new A330. After arrival in Frankfurt CEA ground staff told us that our luggage will arrive a day later.

The in-flight service was terrible on the way back to New Zealand and services were carried out without a single smile from any of the cabin crew. All the cabin crew had minimal English and were abrupt and inclined to give passengers any meal or drink irrespective of what was requested. They made assumptions that just because we spoke English we would therefore have an English meal. A smile would go a long way. Snacks were seen down in the kitchen area of the plane but we did not once have any of this offered. Hygiene standards questionable. When I went down to the back of the plane for a stretch and to ask for a glass of water I was ignored. Another hostess on her return trip back to that area answered my request once I caught her eye but all done without any eye contact or smile or any verbal exchange. Would not fly this airline again. For an international airline one would expect a better level of English language. At the end of the flight only one cabin crew in sight at the aircraft door and she was busy doing things so even if one wished to say thank you there was no one to say it to.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,4,2,2,4,NA,NA,3,0

The English level of the staff was not high but they were quite friendly and efficient. The food was reasonably good but only Chinese style food was available. The flight out of Dhaka was over an hour late departing and so I missed the connection in Kunming but the staff in Kunming were friendly and reasonably efficient in arranging another flight for the following day and a free night's accommodation in Kunming.

The most frustrating part of this whole saga was finding someone at Guangzhou and Beijing Airports who could speak proper English and explain to me what was happening they put me and a few others up in a hotel in Beijing and collected us at 6am the following morning. Then had to hang about for a few hours to see if I could be transferred to a KLM flight leaving later that morning what a relief when I got a seat on that plane and all the flight attendants spoke English and with a smile! I missed my connection to Birmingham and had to pay again and eventually arrived in Birmingham some 12 hours late. The biggest problem I found was the lack of English spoken which surprised me but the service generally on all China Southern flights was poor with hardly a smile from anyone plus the food was very ordinary beer and white wine came warm the entertainment unit was not working on the first leg and although available on the next leg was nearly all Chinese.

Guangzhou to Auckland: pretty good inflight entertainment food is OK seats OK modern aircraft. Excellent on time performance on all flights signifying a pretty efficient operation. There are deficiencies in English with many staff but since at least 90% of passengers were Chinese on every flight it is unreasonable to expect too much. The written English in their publications videos and notices also needs attention. If China Southern wish to increase the percentage of foreign customers however they will need to improve their language skills - in English and in other languages.

For the price I paid the airline met my expectations. Checked in online but the website is not user friendly and after entering data for 6 people was told system was unavailable. I chose the option of not paying to preselect seats and it seemed as if it was a scam to have me pay out of frustration with the free option. It eventually worked and we got 6 seats together. Condor doesn't have a bag drop option in Calgary we had to stand in the checkin line for 45 mins even though we were checked in. It was the first flight of the year from Calgary so once fully boarded we sat in the plane for an hour because the contracted ground handler didn't train their staff on condors systems. The pilot told us such. Once enroute the flight was fine. Entertainment was one free basic movie and then a small fee to access the premium content. Overall selection was mediocre. Dinner and breakfast were served and again the food was mediocre. Crew were fairly robotic and weren't overly friendly. One of our bags were lost but eventually turned up an hour later in Frankfurt due to a handling error. Overall you have to remember it's a budget airline and you get what you pay for.

The flight crew was not able to assist and they offered no compensation or rectification for the situation. The food was okay but the selection of drinks in business class was extremely limited. The seat did not fully extend flat due to it not being operating properly. The connection time in FRA is not enough time although it is a legal connection in their system. One must give themselves at least 2 hours between flights. Condor have limited gates and the size of FRA requires at least 2 hours for connection. On our return, I was injured a day prior to our flight and we contacted Condor to reschedule our flight and to request a wheel chair and was refused due to their rules for needing at least 7 days notice for any request changes. Flying business class and not having any customer service was astonishing. We had to contact the airport to arrange our own services. When we arrived at the gate in FRA, we were told business class was oversold and we were asked to fly another airline to get home. We asked if wee would be in business class and if we would have seats together and would our luggage be on the flight. The Condor representative assured us all would occur. When we arrived at the other airline, we did not have seats in business class, we did not have seats together, and our luggage was not in their system. The other airline called Condor to get the information but no one at the Condor gate would answer. We had to work with the other airline by ourselves.

Firstly the flight was delayed 1 hour in FRA. However what happened next was a true nightmare. As we descended into Dubrovnik the captain informed us due to a problem at the airport we were to divert to Split. After landing at Split and spending 1 hour on the ground we took off for what we thought was Dubrovnik. However after attempting to land the captain turned the flight around and proceeded to Zagreb (only one announcement and no information as to why). We landed at Zagreb at which point the captain and crew left the plane and the passengers with no information. We were given no food and only one glass of water during this entire ordeal. A new crew came on board about 30 min later and several passengers demanded to leave the flight. We finally took off for DBV and landed 7 hours behind schedule.

The only difference between the two is that booking through Czech Airlines you automatically get 23Kgs baggage allowance whereas with Smartwings you get 15Kgs and have to buy extra. I found the Smartwings plane to have terrible leg room. I'm average height and my knees were brushing against the seat in front. The person behind must have been the same because when I tried to tilt my seat there was considerable resistance - the person's legs!

The seats on board had adequate legroom but a hard bar across the lower back made them rather uncomfortable. While the boarding passes had allocated seats in fact passengers could sit anywhere except in the front area which was for the international passengers (some young men not in uniform seemed to be security staff enforcing non-mixing of international and domestic passengers). For most of the flight the cabin lights were totally extinguished (it was an evening flight) and the personal reading lights didn't work. The cabin crew disappeared while the plane was in flight. No refreshments were served. On arrival the plane docked at the international terminal where as ensured by the security staff the passengers from Paris disembarked via an air bridge while we were bussed a long way to the domestic terminal and waited a long time for our luggage.

A320 between Barcelona and Prague and return was clean comfortable with excellent legroom and a bit of IFE on overhead screens food same old sandwich and very limited free beverage service (only one round and a very stingy one) however. A bit too many announcements from the flightdeck for my taste. 737-400 between Prague and Istanbul and be aware that these aircraft seem to have a third substandard class which starts halfway down the economy section and features narrower seats and less legroom than the economy seats up front. I´m not sure if these are for passengers who have paid cheaper fares but I was seated in this area on PRG-IST but on the return flight I was seated closer to the front and was much more comfortable. Passengers who have booked business class on this aircraft should know that the first row in Business class located right behind the bulkhead features considerably less legroom than in economy.

delta-air-lines,/airline-reviews/delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,E Berman,United States,2015-03-09,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,2,3,NA,NA,4,0

Check in was efficient the flight crew were attentive offering light refreshments and warm towels on both legs and both flights were on time despite some very inclement weather on the approach to Leeds/Bradford.

Checked in and printed my boarded passes at home so just had to drop my suitcase at Birmingham which took around 5 minutes. I like that Easyjet now allocate your seats although they still call the flight very early presumably to ensure everyone is at the gate ready for boarding. Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,5,1

We had a slight confusion with a staff member at the baggage drop as after he'd weighed and labelled my case I mentioned that the case was my hand luggage but he didn't understand what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but the confusion could have been avoided if there were signs up at both Bristol and Reykjavik airports telling people with just hand luggage that they don't need to go to baggage drop but can proceed to wherever the next step is. Staff on the outward flight were very polite friendly and helpful but the staff on the return flight (EZY6002 on Thursday 9th April) seemed eager to get the journey over and done with and reluctant to go the extra mile for the passengers. Sandwiches were also sold out by the time the staff came round asking people if they'd like anything to eat and drink.

I am 6'2 and whilst normally I can find airline seats restricting this was the worst I have experienced. I can never before remember having to sit open legged as my knees do not fit in the seat when my legs are side by side including when using budget carriers. What's more the head restraint didn't stay in position making it doubly uncomfortable for a man of my height and despite the seat being in the middle of the plane there was no recline (not that there was any room to recline into). Food was ok drinks only served once despite it being almost a 10 hour flight and the entertainment system had only old movies and the TV box sets were missing random episodes meaning it was difficult to watch anything sequentially.

This was an unpleasant experience but we were staggered to learn from regular passengers on this flight that this is standard prior to departure. From the moment the cabin doors closed pretty much until the wheels touched the tarmac in Liverpool 4 hours 15 minutes later those of us in the rear rows of seats were subjected to an absolute barrage of noise from the staff in the rear galley. During a long evening flight it clearly never occurred to them at any point that their passengers may wish to have some peace in which to rest read or sleep. Even the ""trolley service"" was conducted in between their gripping chats on many occasions causing them to have to ask passengers to repeat their orders as they clearly hadn't listened to them in the first place. We were both glad to finally exit the aircraft and both agreed on walking across the tarmac in highs wind and rain that we would not have had much confidence in this cabin crew to competently handle anything outside gossip and moaning.

easyjet,/airline-reviews/easyjet,easyJet customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2014-10-28,Have travelled several times with easyJet and continue to be very satisfied with the service provided. Crews work hard are helpful and informative and we never feel hassled. Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche. We would find it much more convenient if the whole of the Spring and Summer flights were published at the same time and easyJet would be less likely to lose our custom.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

The gate agent addressed my wife and I by name as we boarded. All passengers were greeted by the F/A as they boarded. Flight left a few minutes late but arrived early. The meal consisted of a cold shrimp/chicken platter or a turkey/chicken sandwich which was very good. Service was good. My only complaint is the seating. The seat is more comfortable than Economy Comfort but Delta should add an inch of pitch in the first class cabin. I did not rate the inflight entertainment as there was none available due to the short flight. Delta 2043 first class on 09-11-14 JFK to ATL.

The one thing to prevent giving a score of 10 for satisfaction was the cleanliness of the cabin. Whilst clean the seats and floor covering were in need of replacement.

Very comfortable truly lie-flat seats in 767s for the international legs (maybe not quite as nice as the A330s of US Airways in biz class). My wife had asked for boarding assistance due to an arm injury and she said whenever she made any move on the GRU-ATL leg an attendant was at her side almost immediately. No Delta club at GRU so had to use the somewhat smaller and more basic Gol Airlines club. First class for the ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW legs was your basic domestic first class.

We only ever had hand luggage (within the stated dimensions) and encountered no problems.

As we were travelling with our young daughter we boarded ahead of other passengers which allowed us to get settled without holding other passengers up getting things into and out of bags. Service during the flight was great announcements were adequate and we landed ahead of time in Hurghada. I am 6ft 5ins and found leg room to be fine. Sure you can't stretch out but it's fine for the duration of the flight. I really liked what seems to be new seating with thinner more comfortable padding.

Return trip flight was delayed by 90 minutes at Marrakech but they did not announce the delay until 10 minutes after the flight was meant to depart no announcements or explanation until after we had boarded. What was worrying is that another easyjet flight to Milan was boarding whilst we were waiting and they had adopted a Ryanair style cage to check bag sizes there were a lot of disgruntled passengers Easyjet is my carrier of choice but that will change if they start to adopt cheap money making tactics.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,3,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early.

Even check-in at FNC has improved and was much better than the last time we were there (looks like EJ now has its own staff as opposed to handing agents).

The bags contained our computers wallets money tickets and other valuable items. These bags were not lockable as we expected to have them with us. Their size has been acceptable on dozens of other flights with Easyjet and other airlines as they are made to fit within the airline in cabin sizing. The excuse for this 'new' ruling was that the flight was full. Every flight that I have been on with Easyjet has been full! They need to address the issue of passengers taking oversize bags onto the aircraft without penalising those of us who always ensure we have the correct size and weight for cabin bags.

Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on.

On the return flight our flight was delayed for more than 2 hours Easyjet gave us £3 voucher each which was even insufficient to buy a sandwich and a cup of coffee in an expensive airport likes KEF.

In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage.

Paid extra for exit row seats as this was a 4 hour flight and that gave us the option of Speedy Boarding. However not so important now that easyJet have started offering pre-assigned seats which removes the scrum. Speedy Boarding does mean you can drop your bag at a special Speedy Boarding desk rather than queue with the majority of passengers. This saved quite a bit of time at both ends. We had checked in online and the airline's website suggests you just turn up and drop your hold baggage. However Easy Jet's definition of ""bag drop"" sees the same lengthy queues at desks that you would get if you were checking in at the airport. Seats were comfortable with the extra legroom that goes with exit seats. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. The food offering is perfectly adequate for the length of journey.

All other legs on A380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the IFE or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. I sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. Meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. As for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get I went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and I was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,2,2,3,NA,NA,4,0

After the Chief Purser heard about this she immediately took action and moved me to another seat. I was for approximately 2.5 hours of the flight moved to seat 4K on the flight thereafter. The electronic console handset which is connected to the seat did not power on and didn't work. There was water clogging in the shower in the bathroom on the right side of the aircraft. I had a vegetarian oriental meal requested and instead it was an Asian Vegetarian Meal that got loaded. Once again we are now in the 21st century and still Emirates Business Class does not have a single (out of four) main course meal options in the menu which are vegetarian. Often last minute travel options have to be ticketed and this means I will not have any assurance of a vegetarian meal option on Emirates.

I thought they had a reputation for excellent service but unfortunately in my experience this was not the case. A delayed departure and fog at Dubai meant a late arrival. The biz cabin was not very clean with a stained seat and debris in the drinks holders. The staff appeared disinterested and we were not offered a welcome drink. Thankfully the lie (almost) flat seat was comfortable and the cabin cool so got a decent sleep. The window blind wouldn't shut so woken by dawn over the desert not long before arrival although we were then stacked because of the fog. Huge comms failures at Dubai trying to get a rearranged flight to Colombo. The biz lounge staff couldn't help us so we joined a slow line at the help desk to be told to run to the gate as the new flight was boarding. When we got there the boarding flight was to China! We returned to the desk and also mentioned we had now economy tickets but had been booked in biz. They were unable to help although interestingly the 6 other members of our party had received new boarding passes issued in the biz lounge! Advised that we would get a downgrade voucher (not refund) at gate but the clerk could not do this and advised we would receive it in Colombo. I said this was not acceptable as we did not want to fly Emirates again. They could also not guarantee our re-entry into the biz lounge as the passes said economy! We just walked in anyway! The flight to Colombo was routed via Male lovely apart from the stop and 1.5hrs on the Tarmac meant I missed my pre-conference meeting. At least they left the IFE playing! My colleagues advised the biz cabin had lots of space from Male to Colombo but we were not offered to move. On arrival in Colombo there was no record of the downgrade voucher. On discussing this with the ground staff they said it would be available when I checked in for my return flight. Why do I not believe him? Why would I want a voucher when I will not fly with them again for this terrible service? Ironically my original connection was late leaving and as I only had hand baggage and can run I could easily have made it for that departure.

EK parked their B777-300ER somewhere at the far end of the airport and we were made to climb down the staircase at that time. We were packed in a bus and sent to the terminal which took some 15 to 20 min. I entered the terminal at around 5.45am and walked down for security check. Finally at around 6.30am I reached my gate B30. After the boarding pass check guess what we are asked to board a bus again for a 15 min ride to the far end of the airport where they have parked their B777-300ER again. There was no proper organised zonal boarding as everyone just boarded the flight through the rear door and had to queue a lot before taking the seats inside the flight. Inflight Service - The inflight service was awful. The standards have down in this area since 2010. Their food portions have gone down I always felt hungry after the meal! Cabin crew don't want to move from their seats at all! If you want something it is always better to go to the galley rather than wait for anyone.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,3,NA,NA,3,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2015-01-23,LHR-DXB-BKK Economy. Check-in pretty efficient in T3. The flight was full (as usual) with Emirates and left on time. The A380 is much quieter than the 777 but there's not much difference in the seats/space. Cabin service on Emirates is variable depending on the crew and this one was OK - nothing special. Economy food has improved recently and quite tasty. Good choice of drinks and frequent water/juice runs. On time into DXB and A380's park at the gate instead of remote stands which makes connections easier. I got upgraded to Business on the DXB-BKK leg again an A380 which was about 30mins late. The best part of Business on Emirates is a priority pass for immigration in BKK. The cabin service in Business was nothing special and I prefer to eat in the lounge rather than on the flight. Good IFE - there's always something worth watching on Emirates.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,3,4,5,NA,NA,5,1
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Alasdair Brooks,United Arab Emirates,2015-01-23,DXB - IAD [Washington DC] in January 2015 economy class. Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi-lingual staff amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,4,1

Fog at DXB extended delay to 3 hours including an abortive attempt at landing. Landed 03.15 exactly the time onward flight to SIN should have been taking off. That flight had closed so missed connection. Incredibly difficult to get rebooked. Long queues at transfer desk. Staff did not have ability to make re bookings directly but had to call their reservations department somewhere else in airport. Long long waits to get a response (half hour plus for each passenger) and no queuing system on their telephones. No offer to arrange hotels even though some passengers clearly becoming distressed at length of queuing time. To cap it all I later found that my connection was still on the ground when I arrived in DXB and did not leave for another 2 hours even though shown as flight closed i.e.they had allocated my paid for and checked in seat to someone else!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,1,0

Three out of four sectors were fine: Excellent service and very clean and quiet aircraft. Big disappointment was in Business Class on the A380 due to one main factor: the fact that there is a fully serviced lounge bar area at the rear of Business Class. This sounds rather special until we realised that loud mouthed yobbos can stay in there for the entire journey (in this case Dubai to Hong Kong) and walking up and down the aisles with their drinks and abusing staff for not being fed lunch on time (even though they were all in the bar) and so on. I had to move further to the front of the aircraft to avoid the noise coming from this bar lounge area. This made for a very unpleasant experience and I could understand why some staff were very sad and quiet in going about their duties. Perhaps Emirates should seriously consider getting rid of this little so-called luxury as the concept seems to have backfired badly. The A380 flight was otherwise remarkably smooth partly due I suspect to the design of the aircraft but also the route take for this sector. Food and service on the remaining flights was superb but I could not recommend Business Class on the A380 for the problem of the bar-lounge section.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,0
emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,A Jones,United Kingdom,2014-09-17,LHR-DXB-BKK / BKK-DXB-LHR. My first experience with Emirates and it was an impressive one. All flights on time with no issues with connecting flights. Outward connection at Dubai for 3 hours was a bit too long followed by another 6 hour flight to Bangkok would have meant feeling shattered on arrival but it was a brand new 777-300 and it was empty I counted 10 pax in our section so climbed on the 4 seats and slept uninterrupted until woken for landing. How anyone can not be impressed by the A380 beggars belief. We had seats in the rear on outward front section on return and it's incredibly quiet compared to the 747! Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft) and comfortable seats. Food quality was good too I've flown Thai quite a few times and the food as been excellent every time for me Emirates was not far behind. Plenty of drink runs and flight attendants were helpful and courteous. The ICE system needs hardly any mention it's simply superb especially on the A380. Online check-in and seat selection made this experience an effortless one. We landed at LHR at a busy time early Friday evening we were off the aircraft through border control and collected our luggage within 50 minutes! All in all can't fault Emirates. Would recommend and certainly fly again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

The tired old 777 from BHX to DXB was awful the entertainment didn't work the crew were grumpy and the food was tasteless. I must say the A380 from DXB to Hong Kong was a vast improvement apart from the crew.

I tried to upgrade the other sections five times over three weeks and was given the run around each time including at the airport three hours before departure. Turns out the plane was full on every leg so they could have saved me time and angst. The crew in economy looked unhappy without exception and were overworked and brusque. Seat comfort was what you could expect - but narrow seats made sleeping very hard. Luckily my fellow travellers were sanguine about the heat stuffiness and general mayhem.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-07-06,Flew on a round trip from Jakarta to Newcastle via Dubai. Once again I was not disappointed flying Emirates. The cabin crew are attentive and have an excellent attitude. The food and entertainment system are the best in the business. Previously queues at Dubai airport security checkpoint for transit passengers could be a nightmare but this has improved drastically with the introduction of a 'snake' queuing system. I was through security in less than 10 minutes while in transit. The only things that could be improved by Emirates are: 1) It could remove the 10-abreast seating arrangement in Economy class on its 777 fleet and switch to a standard 9-abreast arrangement as seats are currently too narrow. 2) A snackbox on the galley similar to that of the British Airways 'tuckbox' would be a useful addition. Nevertheless Emirates will always remain one of my first choice airlines based on my experiences with them so far.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,3,5,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

When we arrived in Dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood queuing for about 6/7 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At around 12/12.30 so after nearly 6/7 hours (standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet) we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 (further 11 hours wait) we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside Dubai airport and although we waited so long Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. The food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunch/dinner we were told that they were all finish so We had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. Worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers.

My daughter and I were extremely impressed by the comfort of the seats the quality and variety of food and the huge selection of movies etc offered on the IFE. We flew out overnight on 30th May and were looked after by a lovely FA who quite simply could not do enough for us. We arrived early in Dubai and were provided with Fastrack passes for Immigration. I have travelled to Dubai on many occasions (with BA KLM and Air France) and this was the best experience so far. The return (day time) flight was also excellent - again could not fault anything. Another fabulous FA - a young man this time - friendly and helpful. Ground staff in Dubai and Glasgow were courteous and helpful. One minor thing - if Emirates are serious about their commitment to Glasgow Airport they should establish their own lounge. This was the only downside of my experience - they do not have their own lounge in Glasgow - they have space in the ServisAir lounge which has to be one of the most soulless places I have encountered. Very limited choice of drinks no fresh foods at all (only packs of crisps!). Polar opposite is the lounge in Dubai - wonderful is the only word to describe it. It is large airy and offers free WiFi. Hot and cold meals and snacks available in abundance - and Moet and Chandon by the glass! Chauffeur driven cars were provided for both of us for the journeys to and from Glasgow airport (I was travelling from Edinburgh my daughter from Glasgow).

Having booked with Emirates legs were actually with Qantas (partner airline). This was made clear at booking. However Qantas schedule changed prior to flying which gave a very short connection in Sydney then the Wellington-Sydney plane was late but Qantas air hostess rang through and arranged for a buggy to meet me at the terminal and fast-track me to the gate for the Emirates flight. They closed the gate immediately after I arrived for my flight which I appreciated. However I was seated at the very back of my flight and knowing my predicament no effort was made to help me off the plane first to make my connection. I arrived in Bangkok to discover that though I had made the connection my bag had not and would not come for another 17 hours. The Emirates staff person at Bangkok informed me off this but gave no apology. They promised to deliver the bag to me but as I was two hours out of Bangkok and in a rural area my host had little confidence that a courier would actually make the delivery so we decided to come back to the airport ourselves to collect the bag. Effectively I lost a day and extra money for taxis etc and have still had no apology from the airline.

On time Departures and Arrivals for all flights apart from MNL-DXB which was 1.5 hours late in leaving MNL due to ""Immigration Delays"" for 15 passengers. Not Emirates fault as such but I'd have thought the Captain would have had a cut-off time with many more passengers (myself included) having tight onward connections in DXB. In fairness they made up 30 minutes en route. In Dubai passengers with tight connections on late arriving flights are usually gathered together and accompanied through the terminal and allowed to make their connection after the 45-minute cut off period stipulated by Emirates - usually. Cabin Service on all flights was perfectly acceptable but the seats on both the B-777 and A380's are not the best. Food in Economy was of a high standard with plenty of drinks choices.

Check-In (online) on all flights excellent. As for the flights themselves all very full so Emirates must be doing something right. Cabin Service in Business is OK but nothing special and in Economy is very much dependent on the crew - can be highly variable.

Very friendly and welcoming crew they seem to love the A380 and explaining its features to passengers actively inviting you to come for a drink in the lounge bar. Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar. Massive screen but I remain un-impressed with the range of films and TV programmes on offer. Red eye service cabin lights nice and dim throughout the flight. Full dining service offered despite the 1am departure time with a breakfast served before arrival. Skipped the meal had drinks and canapés at the bar. Nice feature of the Emirates A380 but bar seems to have little space for stock and they constantly run out of things and the poor crew are backwards and forwards from the galley constantly. Lie flat bed was extremely comfortable more so than the 777-300ER beds and combined with the seat liner and nice blankets it was brilliant. Best sleep ever on long haul.

Upper deck boarding via air bridge. Crew friendly and welcoming on the whole some perhaps just business friendly. Menu for flight looks far more enticing than previous sectors. Extremely friendly and efficient steward from Dubai himself was looking after me. Very attentive throughout. Seat again is fantastic but this time a LH window seat with minibar to the window and seat more to the aisle - does not feel as private. Under window stowage is also hard to access. Variety of appetisers and sweets at the bar was great on this sector and the Manchester born girl manning the bar was chatty and genuine. Skipped breakfast and snacked at the bar on and off.

emirates,/airline-reviews/emirates,Emirates customer review,D Thomas,Australia,2013-12-23,"Bangkok to Sydney. Have previously flown this leg 6 times with a well-known Thai based airline. As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated. The tickets were cheaper than the other airline by quite a few hundred dollars and did have a couple of little nice hand-outs the other airline does not.

The flight over wasn't too bad and the crew were pretty efficient and pleasant but on the whole I thought it was a shabby cabin with uncomfortable seats that were almost impossible to recline in fact I thought they were fixed upright as no one seemed to be able to recline their seat. When we travelled back from Istanbul the flight was worse. Once again seats that did not recline without a real struggle and crew that seemed indifferent to the needs of passengers and they seemed to operate in a chaotic manner at meal times. We waited ages for the meal then didn't get the bread roll and after the meal were completely missed when it came to the longed for cup of tea. I had to ask for a drink of water once as they did not regularly come around and I felt like it was an imposition. Some of the crew seemed unfriendly and cold and it didn't make you want to use that airline again. We missed our connecting night flight due to a delay and the next day Etihad didn't put my name on the passenger list for the next leg home only my husband which wasn't ideal and took a long time to sort out leaving us to rush to get on the plane without breakfast or anything.

In the air Etihad are usually OK. Nothing special but OK. On the ground they are one of the worst airlines I experience. This applies to the online booking process online check in at the airport departing and at the airport departing. It is very clear their management have never tried to use their website or travelled with the bulk of their passengers at the back of the plane. On the rare occasions when their website works at all it is usually wrong or fails later. Information at the airports is non existent and passengers are treated as a major inconvenience to the staff. The frequent flyer programme is appalling. Usually wrong often missing flights. When you try to claim lost miles you get an automated message saying they will respond quickly then wait months for anything to happen.

The chauffeur pick up worked well and the lounge at T4 was very good. Staff very attentive. On A340 on both outbound legs and food and wine of good quality. On the way out visited the crowded lounge in Abu Dhabi but managed to have a shower and the staff helped find me a place to sit. Inbound first leg on code share Virgin Australia. Etihad seats far superior as every seat has an aisle access. On the Virgin flight (777) I had a window seat and had to climb over the passenger next to me when he was sleeping. Pleasantly surprised to find the new premium lounge was opened in Abu Dhabi on the return leg. Staff very welcoming and lounge at least 3 times the size of the old one. Food and wine again good on return legs. My only criticism is that the entertainment on offer is nowhere near what it is on Emirates or Qantas.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,9,5,5,4,3,NA,NA,5,1
etihad-airways,/airline-reviews/etihad-airways,Etihad Airways customer review,S Kumar,Australia,2014-09-14,I flew Etihad for the first time this August because I found an incredibly cheap fare. I flew 4 sectors and I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the overall service standards. The aircraft's were clean and everything worked well. Most importantly the toilets were clean on most sectors. Very disappointing that passengers dirtied and water clogged toilets on the Istanbul - Abu Dhabi sector. The IFE was adequate even though I found it repetitive during the 3 week period. I feel the content should be changed every 15 days. I had ordered special meals AVML and was served on all 4 legs. However I also found that the person in charge of menu planning needs to look at a little change. On all 4 legs I was given Green lentils in the salad. I am sure a little more variety will not cost anymore. On one leg I had a Green lentil salad and a yellow lentil dhal curry so two lentil items in one meal. On the AUH-MEL sector the flight took off 2 hours late. The boarding commenced late and were kept seated in the aircraft for over an hour. Were advised due to congestion. Still a 2 hour delay is unacceptable without a good reason. We arrived at least 1 hour late in Melbourne. If the fare is reasonable I will fly Etihad again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Of course I was not offered any voucher not even for a drink of water! The worst was my recent flight to Morocco from Abu Dhabi. The flight scheduled to leave at 2 am finally left at 7 am. Not a single announcement was made to inform passengers or to guide them to some desk to get assistance or a voucher. Up to 7 am the airline's website kept listing the departure on time at 2 am. The company was not to blame with the delay the airport was experiencing a failure of the lighting system on the runways. The Etihad service desks were swamped with stranded passengers needing to be rebooked. It was madness to try to get to the desks. Etihad staff was trying their best not to been seen. No attempt was made to bring order to chaos. Things did not get any better once I finally arrived in Morocco. Being so late I had missed my connection.

Business Saver fare was an absolute bargain. We booked the limo service from Suffolk to LHR and this arrived on time and dropped us outside T4 for an additional charge of just £20 since our home was just outside the 100 mile trip limit. Quick check-in having pre-booked our seats and apart from the pretty useless Fastrack courtesy of Heathrow's disinterested staff we were in the lounge shortly thereafter. As lounges go it was fine - quiet comfortable and good service. Boarded 15 mins before departure with no delay and the gate was conveniently opposite the lounge. Jacket taken and champagne provided. Settled into comfortable seat in the Airbus 340 the excellent cabin staff explained the menu and took orders alongside after take-off drink requests. Flight took off on time and the rest of the inflight service was outstanding. The freshly made steak sandwich as a snack from the kitchen was as good a snack as I have had on any airline. Arrived into AUH on time but we had gated at the old terminal and had to transfer to the new one for our flight to Bangkok. Business lounge was very busy so we went in the First Class lounge and had a shower. Boarded EY408 on time and had a trouble free flight to BKK in a 777 this time but pretty similar set-up. Steak sandwiches just as good. Arrive BKK slightly ahead of schedule and given card to use its Premium lane so was cleared of immigration and collecting bags of carousel in quick time. Return leg was exactly the same with excellent service throughout and punctual arrival into LHR. My only gripe? The complimentary chauffeur. I initially booked one for arrival in BKK to our hotel but never got confirmation and when I tried to it seemed their was some confusion as to eligibility (2 journeys per adult passenger). Since it is hardly an expensive taxi from the airport to downtown Bangkok I cancelled it to make sure that we had the return from LHR to home but given the confusion wanted to make sure this was understood. I had to call Etihad in AUH in the end and it took ages and then started getting calls from the limo company in Bangkok advising what time they would be collecting us! When we arrived back at LHR they had organised a car for me and a car for my wife! We declined and continued our journey together.

However the competitive pricing and perfect routing SIN - BUD via HEL then TXL - SIN via HEL made me try them for the first time. I must say, it was quite good. The flights were on time, the A340 planes form SIN - HEL though aging were fairly well kept. Service, though not as slick as QR or SQ, was attentive and more relaxed. No complaints. The seat was comfortable but not a flat bed. IFE adequate and food was good. Excellent lamb dish out of HEL. Of course they don't serve gourmet coffee or tea, but overall, no complaints. The HEL lounge for the international flights side was good with vintage wines and good quality supper food. Very good showers and Helsinki Airport is very easy to navigate.

Only 2 counters open and after about 40 minutes they realised they weren't going to get everyone done before the flight left so opened another one. No time to do anything then before we went to the gate. Boarding was announced and then one of the two staff disappeared so we waited for 10 minutes for him to come back. They let us on first as we were travelling with a toddler which is the only positive of this flight. They needn't have bothered though as departure time came and went. No announcements before finally got one 15 minutes after due to leave to say we would be leaving in 10 minutes. 20 minutes before landing we finally got offered a drink. At baggage claim our bags were not on the belt. We were making an onward connection to Kittila the next day and for some reason our bags had been checked through. We didn't ask for this, nor were we asked if we wanted this. Waited for our bags to be retrieved from the ""bag hotel"". Finally got out of the airport about 2 hours after we should have.

Seats were fairly comfortable with sufficient legroom and width (I'm a 5'10 for your reference). IFE selection was nothing special but had a good spread of films and TV shows to keep one entertained for 11 hours. Muslim meal consisted of local Singapore food which was alright. My main complaint would be the lack of beverage service throughout the flight. Attendants came out sporadically offering cups of water. Security and passport control in HEL took 15 mins. AMS departure was delayed for 40 mins. Explanations were only given prior to boarding which I felt was unprofessional. Irritatingly it seemed as if there was no effort to speed up the boarding process to make up for lost time. Flight was operated on a new A321. Felt like a low-cost carrier as there were no amenities whatsoever except for free water and juices on this 2.5 hour flight. CDG-HEL-SIN. HEL sector operated by an A321 with no flight amenities again. Flight departed on time and the connection in HEL was very quick. SIN sector operated on a refurbished A343 and was similar to the outbound flight. However the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to broken ground equipment. Updates were given by the captain which was nice. Food was extremely bland. The muslim meal consisted of the same dish for both dinner and breakfast. Overall the experience was nothing to shout about. Finnair got the job done at a significantly lower price. However the delayed flights on both journeys and the no-frills intra-Europe flights may make me hesitant to fly with them again as they were not that much cheaper. Nonetheless if you are on a tight budget I would recommend Finnair.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,3,2,4,NA,NA,3,1

I have used the other airline on the route on a regular basis. The flight was late by about 50 minutes probably due to poor weather conditions. I never understand why these short haul airlines don't allow for more slack in the timetable for their evening flights which are bound to pick up delays during the day. The slogan on the front of the Embraer E195 jet plane “ yn falch o wasanaethu Cymru proud to serve Wales was a nice touch. The flight duration was due to be 50 minutes but we appeared to be placed in a holding pattern close to Dublin so probably the same flying time as the competing turboprop plane on this route. The aircraft itself was very good spacious relatively quiet comfortable leather seats and a smooth flight considering the weather. This is in contrast to the aircraft used by the competition. Upon arrival in Dublin the plane did not park at a remote stand and require a bus transfer which made it easy to connect with public transport.

Even that little piece of chocolate is now gone! It is all fine and well to charge for food but this completion of transformation of this national airline is not reflected in their fares going down.

Having read the reviews I was somewhat apprehensive but in general it was okay. Let's take the positives - flight times suited us as we did not suffer jet lag on either journey even though sleep was difficult. Crew were efficient and flights were all on time or early. Total flight time is as good as it gets for this journey. Now the negatives - planes are old and tired the Airbus on the return flight even had ash trays. The breakfasts are inedible and the rest of the food is average to poor. Economy leg room is minimal for a 12 hour flight you certainly don't want to get next to anyone in the XL size range.

Legroom was fine for me as I am not that tall. F/A service was adequate and quite prompt. Food purchased from the menu was not bad at all for a low cost airline. Alcohol is overpriced at AED 40 for a whisky. The 737 is obviously not the fastest plane versus the 777 for instance so I found the duration of the trip to be a little more tiresome as a result.

From Helsinki to Norrkoping and return and a recommended way of getting into Norrkoping if for some odd reason you have to get there. Enjoyable flights - probably due to the very good crew members on Flybe up in this part of the world although beware that all drinks and food are charged for including water. Flights were more or less on-time in clean ATR aircraft where boarding is from the rear of the aircraft - also where the best seats are located. Use of the Finnair lounge in Helsinki is an excellent attraction. The return flights arrived into Helsinki Vantaa close to midnight and I was surprised to see so many Flybe and Finnair flights arriving and departing at this time including into northern Finland.

I was seated on row 14 and as soon as the flight departed Denver (Flt 612 on July 26), the three people in front of me recline their seats and laughed loudly that they paid $50 more for a first class seats. Row 13 is an exit row. It made the overnight flight very uncomfortable for me since my seat did not recline and my knees were firmly pressed up against the seat in front of me for 3.5 hours. During the beverage service, the flights attendant approached each person saying, ""would you like to purchase a cocktail, soft drink, or snack"". I ordered a water and was surprised to hear her serving wine to the person directly behind me. I looked up at her and said excuse me and she just said, ""I'll be right with you"" with a bit of an attitude. I guess if I paid $4 for the water I would have been served before the person behind me. When you add up the flight, extra costs ($3 for a seat selection, $25 for a carry-on bag, $30 for a checked bag, and $4 for a soda or $6.99 for a beer), I really didn't save anything by flying Frontier. I am most surprised that Frontier apparently charges $50 more for Row 13. It seems very unfair the only row that reclines is Row 13 and anyone seated on Row 14 gets a seat back in there face.

In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels.

I was worried about my flight today after reading all of the negative reviews but I must say that I was pleasantly shocked! This was probably one of the best flights I've experienced flying out of O'Hare airport or other airports for that matter. Our flight even departed a little earlier than planned. It was a pretty early flight so I did sleep the entire way which was very uncomfortable because the seats have little cushion and do not recline. Since I slept throughout my flight it didn't matter to me that there wasn't any entertainment or wifi. Also I like that the cheaper option is to check a bag in. I decided to pay more for a carry on and the process to board and off board is so much faster since many elect the cheaper option to check their bags but also there was plenty room available in the overhead compartments. For the price I paid for the ticket and because I am an anxious flyer pilot skill is more important than the seating or entertainment. The fact that I was able to sleep on a flight which is very rare is important to me. I think Fronteir is exactly what it markets itself as an economy Airbus.

However when I went back to the airport two days later it was to find that my flight was massively delayed due to ""weather"" again despite other airlines having no problems.

My flight was delayed more than four hours (with no food vouchers offered) and sat on the runway for a further hour and a half with everyone aboard while the plane de-iced.

You will have to pay for your baggage (both checked and carry-on). Your seat will not be guaranteed unless you pay a minimum of $8 to select your seat. Frontier has a strategy of overbooking presumably to ensure full flights. Every day groups of these extra passengers are forced into later flights. ""Check-in is 45 minutes prior to departure"" means that you will be charged $75 and forced into the next flight if you do not check-in 45 minutes prior to departure. Frontier is the only airline that pulls their employees from the check-in counter and shuts down their check-in computers 45 minutes before departure to ensure that you will not be allowed in if you arrive late. I was running late to my flight this morning and called Frontier's 1-800 number at the suggestion of the friendly JetBlue check-in folks as Frontier's counter had recently been abandoned. I manoeuvred my way through the expected automated system and finally reached a woman who handled my situation with the patience and understanding of a grizzly woken from hibernation. I was interrupted and rudely instructed to be quiet and listen to the rules before rebooking my flight. By the way this airline treats its passengers I should not have expected their employees to be any happier. Frontier employs bait-and-switch policies to maintain the ""cheap ticket"" reputation. In reality Frontier's customers are not presented with an honest estimate of the cost of their travel at checkout. My conclusion is that the service one receives from other airlines is well worth the additional 20% in initial ticket costs.

frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,R Carter,United States,2013-12-21,On October 24 2013 my sister and I began a long-awaited vacation with flights from SLC to Denver and one from Denver to Fort Lauderdale. SLC to Denver leg of the journey went without a hitch. We were not questioned about our carry-on bags or our purses. When we went to board our flight in Denver we were rudely told we could not take our carry-on bags because they were too large and would have to pay an exorbitant charge for it ($100). The Customer Service person told us to go to a kiosk several gates away and pay for our bag knowing full well that if we did so we would miss our flight. We were forced to pay the charge of $100 per bag. I observed at least 15 people on the flight that had bags two and three times larger than the size of my bag. We were then put into seats that had the least amount of leg room that I have come across. When we finally got to Fort Lauderdale out of curiosity I tried the pre-formed compartments that several airlines had in front of their check in gates. My bag fit easily into each of them with room to spare. At least we were finally able to go on our vacation no thanks to Frontier. On November 4 the trouble started again. When we checked in at Fort Lauderdale we were told that the flight was delayed by one hour because of mechanical problems. That delay would mean that we would miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. They said they would get us on a partner airline. A gate agent had put us on an American Airlines afternoon flight. When we tried to check in at American Airlines we were told that the gate agent had not called and confirmed us. Fortunately for us American was kind enough to work with us and find us a late flight to Dallas that then connected on to Salt Lake.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

The 'meal service' if you could call it that was appalling. Our meal consisted of soggy watermelon cantaloupe and a few grapes served with cheese and crackers.

Flight attendants came around occasionally with trays of juice or water. Inflight entertainment is on a loop system which some will find antiquated but I actually didn't mind as it allows you to watch several things at a time.

The pluses end there. Minuses: For international passengers the food/beverage and inflight entertainment is dire. Can see why US passengers might rate them highly given what they endure domestically! What's with the bland chicken and rice dishes on all lunch and dinner flights? The free F+B offering on SFO-HNL breakfast run consists of 4 grapes 4 slices of melon a piece of cheese and 2 packs of crackers? HA should charge a couple of bucks more and get serious with their offerings or drop the pretence of food completely and charge for a decent offering. The 'complimentary IFE' is a joke in content despite the new A330 planes even the pay per view movies (US$7.99 a pop) were exceedingly limited in choice. The HA terminal in HNL and terminal in LIH are in a time warp but suspect this to be the fault of the airport authorities (and TSA is certainly outside HA's control). Like I said all's not lost this airline certainly is no 4/5 star airline but it could be halfway decent with a few weeks. For the price paid not really good value.

Potentially efficient but the communication needs to be better. However the extra charges are ridiculous on Hawaiian. Check in per bag at $70 movies at $12 extra legroom seats at $70 again. I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem. Bags in SFO took ages mitigating an on-time arrival. Sorry Hawaiian but serving sub-standard complimentary food does not allow you to rip off passengers with extra charges and poor service.

Flight attendants were able to suggest wine and were quite generous about serving it. Once service concluded, a self service bar was set up in front. One thing I liked about Iberia is that flight attendants are not intrusive, which can be confused with uninterested.

Both flights landed on time. Meals were good on both legs although no alcohol served which doesn't really matter on a 2 hour flight. Service was good on two full planes (A330's both ways).

Boarded easily and settled down into 2A right next to the window but a squeeze to actually get into the seat because of the herringbone conformation. A good seat with a 6 ft bed and soft pillow and blanket . Warm welcome from the all female flight crew in Spanish and English and then some bubbly and a delicious lunch very healthy food and not too heavy and decent Spanish wines.

Booked with British Airways and had BA flights from LHR-MAD and MAD-LHR. These were more than satisfactory with decent aircraft and excellent crew. The Iberia flights terrible. Going out flight completely full disinterested cabin crew and tired aircraft. Return flight like something from the 1990s. The A340-300 must have had zero upgrades from new. Again completely full and I was seated four rows back from a bulkhead. The bulkhead had the television screen fixed to it and for the whole flight(10hrs) flickered and flashed the whole time making any kind of sleep impossible. The cabin crew were as disinterested as is possible almost throwing the food on to the table. Not sure if they are in some sort of industrial dispute or not seemed like it. Seating uncomfortable but just enough legroom to twist and turn. All flights arrived safely and on time which are the most important things. We booked these flights to avoid the inconvenience caused by US immigration and customs when trying to transit to Costa Rica from Europe and using a US airline.

I've flown on and off for 68 years both on major airlines and on minnows including internal flights on Ethiopian Airlines DC3s Aeroflot and CAAC in the 70s. Nothing was as atrocious as this recent Iberia flight. Checked in online my careful choice of seat was ignored at Guatemala City airport and I ended up exactly where I wished to avoid being - in the middle of a four seat row. On the short hop to San Salvador all the lights - secondary lighting exit signs included went out leaving the cabin in total darkness for two or three minutes which was a tad alarming. No apology or explanation given. No seat back screens only a large screen at the front of the cabin which was obscured by heads in the rows forward of me making both the security demonstration and any entertainment offered only partially visible. Overnight the cabin crew could not be found to bring water for the necessary taking of pills. To cap it all my bag did not make the transfer to my ongoing flight MAD-LHR.

On the positive side they are generally punctual and if you fly one of them new A330-300 and A340-600 then the experience is satisfactory however flying on one of their old A340 (there are still quite a few in service) is a truly miserable experience as the seats are uncomfortable and cramped and the entertainment system is limited to a few screens for the whole cabin. Food is generally speaking mediocre and the crew service ranges from indifferent to fairly polite. I find their policy of charging for selecting a seat and food on European routes really mean and I really wish they stopped doing that.

The seat was hard and narrow with poor leg room. The IFE system had a decent variety but required a fee (so make sure you have your credit card on hand) though on a full service airline this should be complimentary. Refreshments were served. Breakfast was served shortly after but consisted of a disgusting breakfast burrito and sugary bun with no other options. No complimentary refreshments were available for the remaining 3.5 hours of the flight. The flight attendants were well mannered but unprofessional.

Flight times changed but no one from Iberia told us until we tried to check in meaning we'd have a really quick connection in Madrid. The check in staff were good enough to give us 2 seats in the front row of economy so we could get off quickly. Asked for quick connection tags on bags told no need they'll make your connection. Crew where friendly enough leg room was appalling! Amount of hand baggage that was allowed on was a total joke as was the rudeness of the passengers sat in front who felt the need to recline their seats before we'd even pushed back. No meal service or BOB due quick flight time but arrived on time into Madrid then taxied to the furthest gate possible! Got of quickly onto Jetty then made to go down onto the ramp and get a bus around the airport wasting a good 10mins we didn't have to play with to make our BA connection.

For the short hop to Guayaquil (30 mins in the air) boarding was again well organised and the captain apologised for the delay from Madrid. Arrived 50 mins late in Guayaquil.

Pre-selected seats for an additional fee several months in advance however informed a few weeks before departure that our selected seats weren't available for outbound flight. Had flown into Madrid on a BA codeshare from Heathrow and legroom was probably better than on the long haul Iberia flight. Seat on Iberia has a box which severely reduces legroom. Inflight entertainment was poor however we had prepared for this and knew about it beforehand. Food was pretty good and cabin crew were reasonably approachable. Landed in Quito 20 mins late. Return flight: At check-in they told us that our pre-reserved seats had been sold to someone else. A departure tax had been retrospectively added a cost which Iberia should have absorbed. Flight to Madrid involved a technical stop in Guayaquil. Flight between Quito and Guayaquil was delayed however the real shocker was when the plane had to turn around an hour after leaving Guayaquil and make an emergency medical landing. Significant delays were caused. When had taken off for a second time out of Guayaquil we were carrying a 4.5 hour delay. When we finally landed in Madrid we were advised that there were no available connections to Heathrow that night so we needed to overnight in Madrid to fly out the following day. Iberia agent who helped us with hotel vouchers etc. was quite helpful and had clearly exhausted all possible routes to London. Stayed overnight at a hotel at Iberia's expense and the following morning to the earliest flight back to London arriving 15 hours later than scheduled.

The Lounge at MAD pier was OK. The service on board was abysmal. They brought around papers and magazines but there were no English publications only Spanish. Secondly not a smile from any of the crew at any time in fact they all bordered on rude. It is obvious that the customer is in the way of them enjoying themselves. Drinks were not served until 1 hour after take off. No welcome drink. The hot towels were cold and damp. The food where do you start? Starter tuna salad 2 small strips of tuna on lettuce and cold soup out of a packet. The main was veal 2 thin strips and some spinach. There was plenty of bread and wine but the food left you feeling hungry. The snack bar was not replenished. I asked for a diet coke and was sighed at by a crew member and did not get it. This is not business class food nor service. The seat was broken and did not extend. I reported it to a crew member but nothing was done not even an apology. The AVOD system had 8 B rated films that were years old. Overall it is pathetic excuse for a business class experience. I can only thank my lucky stars I am flying BA Club home.

Very impressed with onboard service and found it interesting that very few pax actually opted to take advantage of the on-board meal purchase which enforces my belief that most pax only eat airline meals because they feel they have paid for it so they should eat whatever is offered. Found the customs / immigration at KEF to be friendly and welcoming which was not the case with the security people at KEF who were anything but friendly and welcoming and quite aggressive with pax. Departure of flight from KEF was on-time as was arrival at LHR with luggage waiting on the carousel.

Island Air is also very good about pointing out landmarks historical facts and when you could see whales in the water. The attendant on board the OGG-HNL an older American female was bilingual in English and Japanese. The service was good everywhere but a little irritating at ITO with a person handing out customer surveys and sharing the same gate as an Aloha Airlines confusing many passengers on when to board being that both flights were headed to OGG.

I generally like Japan Airlines especially the exceptionally high service standards and generally good food. However on recent Premium Economy travel through from Sydney to Frankfurt and return I found the shell seats almost impossible for sleeping (were these cast-offs from the similar old Cathay Pacific seats one wonders?) and due to a promotional fare offer the PE cabin was packed with noisy passengers and became claustrophobic which tends to negate the benefits of flying PE in the first place! Also this must be the only airline I can think of that allows passengers to keep their window shades closed during the take-off and landing phases of the flight - half the cabin was in darkness from before taxiing and then for the entire flight including the landings. Isn't this a safety hazard when passengers are unable to see out of the aircraft in case of emergency? On the other hand I like the JAL First lounges in Narita and use of the Qantas First lounge in Sydney - excellent.

I had first booked a direct flight from Bangkok to Kolkata but two weeks later Jet Airways made a schedule change and simply emailed me to tell me that the Bangkok - Kolkata flights were cancelled with no information about where I stand in regards refunds and rebooking. However I phoned a phone number here in New Zealand and the consultant worked hard to come up with a suitable alternative for me which meant longer flights and less sleep but ensured that I got to where I needed to be and charged me no extra. I got the feeling that running on time was very important to the airline one leg was 10 minutes late and it was made clear to us that it was due to a late inbound aircraft due to congested air traffic (ie: not Jet Airways' fault). They hurried us through boarding so that time could be made up. Food and staff were fine check-in staff very helpful and friendly. Ironically at the slightest bump in the sky seat-belt sign was on and we were told to remain in our seats yet prior to take-off staff didn't come and check seat-belts and also a passenger two seats over from me was busy talking on her phone during take-off and staff didn't address this even though the safety briefing had been very clear.

Not so good was the food in Premium Economy - minuscule tasteless portions of poor quality especially to and from Australia. I can recall wonderful Japanese food even in basic economy 10 years ago on JAL. An odd aspect is that JAL seemed not to be able to recognise my OneWorld Emerald details and status until I complained on check-in on each leg.

Food was reasonable the cabin crew on our aisle on the way out were incompetent (those on the adjacent isle knew what they were doing). The meal on the night flight on the way out arrived 2 hours after we took off which was far too late. My major complaint would be that all the cabin crew (bar one) disappeared once the meal had been served and did not appear again until the next meal.

While I understand that such limits are imposed on domestic flights but for someone who is on a long business trip in India who has been allowed up to 20kg or 30kg on international flights how do the authorities expect us to shed off excess weight when flying from one city to the next within India? I was asked to pay for the exceeded amount at a Jet Airways counter. When I went to the counter the service was extremely slow. The counter staff were more interested in attending to the sale of tickets. Onboard there is lack of discipline by staff.

Well our 737-300 was nearly 28 years old but looked fresh and clean with a refurbished interior which had the new seats with fixed thin backs profiled to give decent legroom. The cushions were a bit short but overall were fine for a flight of less than 3 hours. There was plenty of information from the flight deck and the cabin crew were excellent being friendly and efficient although we could have done without the loud and strident sales pitch on the PA but I suppose it's par for the course.

Online check in was unavailable as we were travelling with an infant but I was still able to pre book my seats and check in was a breeze at both airports and took less than 5 minutes. Once on board our outbound flight we realised that the back of the cabin where we were was mainly rowdy youngsters off to San Antonio and at the front of the plane mainly families. Without us even asking and despite the flight being almost full the attendant told us row 8 had 3 spare seats next to each other and we were welcome to sit there once the seat belt sign was switched off. As soon as the captain allowed passengers to move around the cabin she came straight over and told us we could move down to the front and even helped us with our baggage. The return flight was on a Jet2 Boeing 737-300 and although it was clearly an old aircraft it was clean well maintained and once again on time. I really can't praise this airline enough and thankfully they are now the biggest carrier out of Newcastle meaning we will be using them many more times in the future and have indeed already booked to fly with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Seat pitch feels similar to Air Canada. I didn't purchase any food so can't offer an opinion on this. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is somewhat superior - they offer a wider variety of audio and video entertainment gratis while Westjet offers certain TV channels for free and premium programming (Movies and certain TV programs) at additional cost (there is a slot to swipe a credit card in the seatback to pay for this). I did find it annoying that the channel displaying the aircraft's position (a personal favorite) was 80% Westjet advertising and only 20% map.

Cabin crews invariably very friendly and welcoming.

Small snacks and complimentary drinks served on all sectors. Ground crew friendly and informative too.

Inflight experience equally superb - even being asked how I wished to be addressed by FA; and proper food/wine. Newark's a great airport - efficiently through Immigration (don't think there was a dedicated lane though??) and although the Lounge is not as good as Luton it's still great and you still get a quick easy check- in and great service.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,J Barr,United Kingdom,2007-11-06,Luton-Newark-Luton. I found this for the money an excellent service with just a few niggles. Plus points are the really excellent and stylish lounge at Luton; the quick and simple check-in and boarding procedure there; polite and enthusiastic staff on the ground and in the cabin; the food and its presentation; and general impression of stylishness and design. Personally I find Luton perfectly accessible from central London: trains from Blackfriars (London Bridge Farringdon and Kings Cross are other stops) every 20 minutes or so and a cab to the terminal. There is simply no comparison between the check-in and security experience with Silverjet at Luton and Heathrow or Gatwick whatever the airline and however elevated the class. The niggles: though I had printed out my confirmation and several other web pages my computer packed up a day or so before I left and I could neither check in online nor order a car from Newark to Manhattan. I tried to ring Silverjet to arrange the latter but could find no telephone number on the website; obtained the number from new unimproved directory enquiries but despite my 'phoning several times at various hours over the next two days no-one ever answered. When I checked in they agreed to send an e-mail requesting this but it was almost as if this was an innovative and brilliant solution! I did not find the non-availability of duty-free shopping at Luton any problem - it's the quid pro quo for the private channel: but prospective passengers should be aware of this indeed the website (otherwise informative re the terminals) should state it. I am also quite happy not to have duty-free goods flogged in flight. Arriving at Luton Parkway on a filthy wet day no taxis were evident and none of the station staff seemed to have heard of the Silverjet-branded free taxis as advertised (this despite the fact that they obviously pull up or wait in front all day). A very scruffy and decrepit minicab eventually showed up - quite a way from the canopied forecourt and then a silver 'black' cab. The procedure was not obvious and I got very wet. At Newark I had to wait about 20 minutes in the rather crowded Silverjet lounge before my car came: the ground staff were not efficient in locating me. On that subject I agree with the comments of many other passengers that the Newark lounge is inadequate: but this seems to be a feature of all US so-called premium lounges and no doubt Silverjet has had to be grateful for what it can get. Also Luton sets a very high standard for comparison. Immigration at Newark was amazingly quick for the US and courteous and friendly: and the baggage was already on the carousel. I would agree also that the seat is not as comfortable as it looks especially when reclined (too short and not flat as people have noted). Still pretty good for the money. The outward flight in particular was very lightly loaded with the rear cabin almost unoccupied. Pleasant though it is to fly without crowding I do hope that they get higher load factors or they will not be in business much longer. I do hope there is no truth in the suggestions that flights are cancelled for lack of sufficient passengers - there is no way one is prepared to risk this happening. I would give a 5 but for the niggles and really do hope Silverjet succeeds.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

JFK is a disaster for small airlines as the big boys get priority on departure slots. We waited two hours to be assigned a slot sat nailed to the seat unable to visit the bathroom was no fun for anyone. The endless queues in the immigration lounge also should put off any sane traveller. Other points of interest: The food was good (not exceptional) though service speed was ponderous. The tv system sits on the table and is therefore an aggravation when the food arrives due to lack of room. The choice of films/tv programmes is excellent. The planes are old and the bathrooms are in dire need of a professional upgrade - the current bathrooms have obviously had a paint job but the job was rushed and shabby. FAs are ok - some smile some dont. The seats are fine for the price but don't compare to VA or BA's business class offerings. They are vastly superior to Premium Economy seating.

jetstar-asia,/airline-reviews/jetstar-asia,Jetstar Asia customer review,Jim Thomson,Australia,2014-10-13,JetStar first and last flight with this Airline! We were booked to fly to Singapore on October 1 in the early morning we were to arrive in early afternoon leaving the us rest of the day. We were notified at 6 am that we now would be delayed and not arrive in Singapore until 9 pm so thank you Jet Star for ruining our day. Flight back with Tiger from Singapore to Perth was much cheaper and arrived early. I know JetStar will blow me off as just one disgruntled passenger who wont fly with them again but I heard a few others on the same flight who echoed my promise to pick another carrier in future I think in today's highly competitive airline industry if JetStar continues to shed passengers by constantly delaying flights they wont be around to repeat the mistakes for too much longer.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,0

Flew Denpasar to Adelaide and as soon as I joined the check-in lines I was glad I'd booked my return trip on Virgin Australia. Queues at check-in were horrendous and the Melbourne flight had been cancelled so many of that flight's passengers were shifted onto the Adelaide flight. On board people can't pay cash for food and drink which seems ridiculous especially if they aim to save time. I was sat in the middle of the plane and they took over an hour to reach me and by the time they got to me they'd run out. When I asked for a fourth beer they stopped serving me because I'd ""had enough"" which is ridiculous given a) I was paying for it b) even a teetotaler wouldn't get intoxicated on four small cans of beer and c) their service had been lousy. If I go back to Adelaide next year I think I'll pay a premium to go with Singapore Airlines from Surabaya where I live even if I do have to backtrack and add 2 hours onto my journey because one doesn't get all these annoyances on full-service airlines that you get on these budget carriers.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,1,1,0,NA,NA,3,0

The price was too good to resist and we couldn't see the point of paying triple that with Vietnam Airlines. Check in was a slight issue with flights being cancelled left right and centre. The poor staff did their best to deal with an array of angry and difficult customers - but what do you expect for the money you paid? Our flight was delayed 10 hours but staff were lovely and moved us to an earlier flight so we only had to wait 5 hours. In saying this we noticed all of the Vietnam Airlines flights were delayed as well due to weather or late aircraft's. I was happy we hadn't paid an excessive amount to still be sitting around at the airport. If you want to fly out of HCM I would recommend Jetstar for their excellent prices.

Passengers wandered around the cabin changing seats as the plane taxied to the runway and walked in front of the engine on the tarmac as there was no roped off area under the wings talking on their mobile phones. Safety demonstrations could not be heard in English due to the heavy accent and muffled PA. When the captain asked the cabin crew to 'prepare the cabin for landing' they simply dropped what they were doing and sat down. The second the plane landed passengers were up and opening overhead lockers despite the plane still hurtling down the runway.

Overall the standard of these flights was good better than on some of JetStar Asia European counterparts although the seat pitch was less than advertised. Would we fly with them again?

Everyone knows that Christmas week is very busy with long queues at the airport but Jetstar could make it much easier for passengers at Tullamarine by having a dedicated bag drop queue. Then there would be some point to checking in at home. The long queue that I had to join included both people who had already checked in and others who hadn't. After being called out of the queue to catch my plane there was a long wait in the airless dungeon that passes for Jetstar's terminal - then a late gate change which led us back into the Qantas terminal -- and then a long motionless queue with no information. Finally we were able to board around 30 minutes late. Once on the plane the journey was fine. The seat was comfortable and the service was friendly. There was a long wait at Hobart for luggage probably due to the arrival of another Jetstar aircraft minutes before ours. The return journey could not have been more different. Quick efficient check-in and boarding a comfortable seat (I was offered an exit row seat at check-in) and arrival in Melbourne 20 minutes early.

Everyone had two pieces of hand baggage and the crew were very helpful in finding places to stow it. The efficiency and the professionalism of the crew was top standard and we actually pushed back on time despite the late boarding and the full flight! The aircraft was an A320 which has more legroom than the Qantas un-refurbished 737! After this experience I am certainly more happy to fly Jetstar if there isn't a convenient option on Qantas.

KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible. The flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. All in all one of the worst experiences I have had with KLM.

Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service.

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,P Stevens,Australia,2013-12-17,Jetstar are in the habit of cancelling flights with little notification time (45mins before flight time via an email) and then abandoning passengers after transferring them to closed airports. Ground staff less than helpful and claimed that this type of service is to be expected from budget carriers. They appear to be over-anticipating passenger demand on some routes and when supply outstrips demand simply cancelling flights and disrupting passengers by either flying them the next day or transferring them to flights to other airports on sister airlines and bussing passengers to their original destination. Totally unacceptable when travelling with children and being left outside a locked airport terminal after an hour long bus transfer at 1.00am.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,3,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

I was happy to get a good deal for my trip only to realise that now I can carry only one piece of baggage on international flight (Jet Airways still allows two pieces of luggage at same price). YYZ-AMS leg was the most uncomfortable one with hardly any legroom on Boeing 737. Once you fit yourself in the seat it is a mammoth task to pry yourself outside of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers. The seats themselves are pretty uncomfortable too. Thankfully YYZ-AMS leg lasts only 6 hours. I ordered Asian vegetarian meal - big mistake - tasteless food. Dessert contains only few pieces of fruit. The staff seemed ok - not courteous though.

KLM is a really good reliable and above all friendly airline. A330-200 for AMS-HAV means much better seat-width than sister-airline Air France's 777-300 used on CDG-HAV a far more comfortable 2-4-2 seating than the 777`s 3-4-3 and of course only half the amount of passengers making arriving formalities in HAV much faster. Still the success-key is the cabin crew and the in-flight service standard. First pre lunch drinks with pringles then a hot towel followed by a good hot lunch (choice of main) and after collecting meal trays: coffee/tea with cognac/liqueur. Ice cream was offered with coffee (and/or drinks) mid-way + several offerings of water/coke/juice through flight and a hot towel again before a new hot snack/meal in good time before landing. All this offered by crew members who seem to enjoy their work. Who can ask for more in economy? (Have flown KLM several times on long hauls and this seems to be their standard service program in economy). Hopefully some day in the future KLM/AirFrance will lean totally on KLM`s service standards.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Cheap price for the fare but this cheapened the actual flight experience. At least I got a free mug of water when I asked for it. Didn't bother with an entertainment iPad.

Jetstar insist that their own international passengers claim their bags at Sydney domestic and then carry them across to International although they will check bags through for American Airlines passengers! In fact nowhere on the ticket is it mentioned that passengers have to make their own way from the domestic terminal in Sydney to the international - either a bus or a train fare away. The only oblique reference I could find on the Jetstar website was that passengers with a Qantas segment on their tickets could use the Qantas shuttle bus without charge. On the SYD-HNL leg I had an empty seat beside me which was fortunate as there wasn't much legroom. A330 economy seats are hard and uncomfortable on a long flight. I had paid in advance for meals - food was OK and the bottle of drink was fine. The flight wasn't great value for the fare I paid.

kulula,/airline-reviews/kulula,Kulula customer review,Michael Preston,NA,2009-12-09,GRJ-JNB. 18 hours before departure I received a text advising that the flight scheduled for the next morning at 10.40 was delayed until 14.30. As this was going to inconvenience me I tried calling them to see if I could reschedule. This is where I saw how abysmal Kulula after sales service is. After listening to 25 minutes of inane drivel (at R2.40 a minute) telling me how wonderful their service is and how all their agents were just waiting to pick up the phone and help me I gave up. Later I contacted the office at George Airport where the response was unhelpful and I was offered a refund. The alternative SAA flight would have at that point cost me R800 more. I wish I had booked SAA from the beginning but foolishly thought it was worth saving some money. That said I understand that flights can be delayed I was notified in advance and when I checked in I was given a R250 voucher to use on a future Kulula booking and the service and flight were satisfactory. I don't like the Kulula 'jokey' approach and the 'funny' announcements - most of the FA's simply can't pull it off and it's just irritating.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Both 787's (actually was the same plane for both flights) in good shape and excellent flight. Flown LAN many times and this time the crew was good but lacked the warmth I had on other flights. They did one drink run (as stated in a previous review) but if you needed anything just ring the call button. They come immediately and happy to get you what you want. Dinner was excellent - delicious soup and cheeses entree of shrimp and veggies. Slept thru breakfast so can't comment. LAN Biz seats are the best - I always can sleep 5 hours easily on them. Quick 1 hour connection in SCL - security check took a minute if not less. Almost 3 hour flight to Sao Paulo - 1/2 filled cabin. Friendly service and they left you alone to sleep if needed. Tasty breakfast and good movies to watch. Had an aborted landing so landed a bit late - bag was last off the plane (even with priority tags) but was just glad to get it. Overall a good trip - I would just say I wish their TV shows were more than 1-2 episodes; for a 8-10 hour trip you would enjoy to see 6-10 episodes available.

lam-mozambique-airlines,/airline-reviews/lam-mozambique-airlines,LAM Mozambique customer review,R Thomas,NA,2009-03-17,I booked a flight with LAM to fly from Dar es Salaam to Maputo. After 3 flight cancellations and 4 additional changes on the dates I booked originally the airline offered a very round-about way to get to the destination via Nairobi (which is the wrong way and the capital of another neighbouring country) and via two small domestic airports Nampula and Pemba. All in all this journey lasted for more than 8 hours for a trip that should be just short of 3 hours. In addition at all Mozamibican stop-overs passengers were asked to leave the airplane and leave their luggage aboard. During one of these stop-overs goods were stolen from passenger hand luggage that remained on board. On the way back our tickets were cancelled by the airline for unexplained reasons even though I was holding the originals in my hand. We spent hours at a desk trying to get our flights back (connecting internationally) which finally was successful due to supportive ground staff. The service onboard was fair and we received assistance while travelling with an infant. The routing from capital to capital is unacceptable for a self-respecting airline and the stealing of passenger's goods obviously ruins any holiday / business trip. I will not fly with this airline again if I can avoid it and would strongly recommend against flying with this airline.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,P Cross,United States,2015-03-09,My wife and I flew LAN/TAM from JFK to Sao Paulo and returned from Santiago in February 2015. LAN's facilities at JFK are way below standard and they can't handle the slightest problem. While there were weather issues on both ends of our trip they did not justify the poor handling of flights by LAN. On the outgoing flight there were 3 planes loads of passengers waiting at one gate at JFK. This is close to 1000 people all expecting to fly out. It appears LAN only has one gate at JFK. Also they seem to be dependent on American Airlines to service their planes. When something goes wrong like the weather American will of course service their own planes first. The counter staff continually lied to everyone about the situation. The only truthful statement they made was that the flights were not cancelled. When our plane finally was ready to board 7 hours late all 1000 people were trying to figure out what flight was boarding because the lighted sign was wrong and still said all flights were on time. Finally someone taped a paper sign over the lighted sign to say what flight was boarding. Our flight was first of 3 and we were 7 hours late. I have no idea how long the other folks waited. On the return flight the Captain proudly announced we landed at JFK on time. However we sat in the plane for 2.5 hours on the tarmac because there were no gates. Finally to avoid being fined (after 3 hours) they unloaded us on the tarmac and bussed us to the terminal. Why didn't they do that 2 hours earlier? I will never fly LAN in the US again. They don't have the facilities and depend on American which itself is another story. Our experience in South America has been much better.

lan-airlines,/airline-reviews/lan-airlines,LAN Airlines customer review,L Smith,United States,2015-03-04,The customer service on LAN varied greatly. At the check in desk staff went out of their way to be helpful. Flight attendants on the flights from BA to Lima to JFK were awful. I asked for a glass of water it never arrived. Later I asked if we could get a bottle of water I was told no. When I asked for ice during the drink service only 1 or 2 cubes were provided. A flight to JFK will include a certain number of Americans who don't prefer warm drinks. The cabin in row 14 was extremely warm i.e. uncomfortable. When using the restrooms I noticed the rear of the plane was quite comfortable. I went to ask flight attendants if something could be done of if they could look into the temperature. They acted like it was a crazy request. A few hours later after my hands and feet were uncomfortably swollen a flight attendant stopped by to see if anyone had answered the call button. This I'd pressed about an hour before. This is lousy service. This flight attendant was marvellous. This new attendant however said that the pilot controls the cabin temperature and in fact it was quite warm in our area. She said she'd discuss the issue with the pilot. Half an hour later the temperature was beginning to come down and there was some airflow in the cabin. While we appreciated this one flight attendant and the check in desk service greatly the rest of our experience with LAN staff was miserable.

I must say I have been impressed with Korean Air. Their prices on business class have been almost half of Delta's. My most recent flight was on their new Airbus A380 service. The seats are the same as Prestige class on the 777ER but there is an added storage compartment next to the seat that can hold your laptop and pillow and blankets. The food and staff on Korean are excellent. Prestige class is the entire upper deck of the A380. There are lounges at the rear and front of the upper deck. The forward lounge has assorted vodkas and martini mixes and is self-serve. At the rear of the plane is another larger lounge with an attendant serving as bartender with a larger selection of drinks. Probably my only cons are the pillows and blankets are more comfortable on other international carriers I have flown. Also I now take extra bottled water on the plane with me and use the large storage compartment of the A380. They tend to be stingy with the water. Tiny glasses and it is impossible to get them to fill them more than half way. It is the same with the wine.

LAN provided a good on-time service complete with some basic but tasty meals and wine. Emerald status which meant straightforward access to their business lounges in both Santiago and Montevideo and use of wifi etc. My only complaint was that as I'm not much good with Spanish it was occasionally difficult to follow what the flight attendants were asking.

Overall very pleasant flights particularly due to the friendly efficiency of the crews. Good food and drink and efficient service. On the transpacific routes the A340 has two business class cabins. The rear one (rows 6 and 7) is very cold and apparently the temperature cannot be adjusted so avoid these rows if you can. They are obviously aware of this problem because on both journeys the crew moved all passengers (including us) out of rows 6 and 7 into the forward cabin (rows 1 to 5) where we were much more comfortable. However we were in rows 6 and 7 for the short legs from Sydney to Auckland and vice versa where we had to use blankets over our shoulders to keep warm. We greatly enjoyed our flight in the LAN Dreamliner from Buenos Aires to Santiago. It's a much more comfortable plane than the A340. The lounge in Santiago is quite basic.

Check-in boarding and luggage delivery were all efficient and all flights arrived on time or early. The Premium Economy seats are Economy seats with the middle seat left empty.

LAN seem to have major operational issues with their A343 flights to and from Oceania. Being kind one could say they are erring on the side of caution but significant punctuality issues where flights are frequently either delayed or cancelled does not inspire confidence (retrospectively checked flightaware.com to verify my suspicions). LAN800 delayed ex Auckland by over 1 hour which proved QFs text message received the night before to be correct. Contacted QF on receipt regarding my 1h20 min connection as was travelling on to Europe from Rio same day. Told to contact LAN directly. Did so and LAN adamant that no problem with connecting as flight on time. Phooey! Encountered same circus at Santiago on arrival from Rio enroute home. Went to allocated gate to snare some snooze time for the 4 hours transit only to wake up to 2 gate changes (from gate 11 to 14 then finally 17B) one flight status of 'cancellado' and one of 'atrasado' (delayed). All for the same LAN801. Amazing. Flight eventually left some hours after scheduled 2320h take off as a replacement crew then needed to be called up. Insult to injury was the dinner served around 4-5am. Food masquerading as beef is not worth being kept awake for. Real shame as inflight the crew are pretty charming and attentive. I would expect these shenanigans from AR with whom I've previously travelled to Argentina. Had hoped LAN would be superior. On the positive side the flights between Santiago and Rio were pleasant.

One female agent checked in the whole flight herself. The aircraft (A300) was very old and it showed. Very shabby inside. The 8am flight was full and the air con was not very efficient so everyone was overheating. Seat pitch standard for short haul economy. Safety announcements in English and Farsi on overhead monitors. Interestingly just before take off the video showed soothing images accompanied by what I presume was religious texts read by a comforting voice. It had a nice calming effect. Live camera in the nose gave us a captains view of take off and landing. Breakfast was ok - usual pastries juice and jam. Tea was very nice. 90 minute flight touched down on time. Most of my fellow travellers seemed to be business men but some families also. The mostly female cabin crew worked hard and were very pleasant even though their khaki green uniforms were not the most attractive. Overall I was glad when we landed. Safe and on time.

Lufthansa serves hot meal but seating is crowded and provides less comfort. Also City line crews mostly look disinterested. Ticket prices looked excellent value for money. A big letdown was Frankfurt airport experience. Not a single time had we embarkation or disembarkation via finger. Long bus rides only. To add insult to injury when boarding via bus they never used bus gates.

I find standard economy now is so cramped as to be almost unbearable on long flights. The premium is well worth paying for and much more affordable than business if you are paying yourself. IFE was superb fast and responsive and an excellent choice of both video and audio channels. Food was good if not remarkable and service was extremely prompt and polite. Getting on and off was fast.

The feeding flight to Frankfurt was uneventful the small snack was okay I also like that you can have a beer on shorthaul flights. The walk to the departure gate was very long but that's not the fault of LH. Flight left Frankfurt on time but arrived late due to the very long flight time of 14 hours (resulting from bad weather over the Atlantic Ocean). Food was okay but less in quantity. I frankly do not understand why airlines cut costs by reducing the amount (and the quality) of food. At least you get alcoholic beverages. Entertainment is now great with a lot of movies/shows to select. I could also find some rest during this 14 hours flight.

MH rather inconveniently uses a 2-5-2 layout on this plane. The plane was old with an ancient looking entertainment system.

Cannot fault this low cost carrier departed on time fair legroom on way out much better on return with an emergency seat. Snacks on board were reasonable cost though Mango was let down by the airport baggage claim at both ends. By far the worst was Bloemfontein having to wait just short of 45 minutes. Taking into account that the Mango plane was the only plane there and that it was a 2 min walk from the plane to the baggage reclaim I was sorely tempted to walk back to the plane and get the bag off myself. As for Cape Town there were 4 conveyors to pick from but they loaded/mixed the bags on the conveyor that had baggage from another flight hence major confusion.

Areas which need work: you can't choose your seating online as with EK and have to go through the airline instead; the online check in asks you to print your boarding passes but (at AKL anyway) these had to be reprinted - took extra time; the IFE on the B777 services (to/from AKL) is now next to obsolete and is very limited in its selection.

All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the A330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the A380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. MAS now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their A330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for MAS would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money.

On the outbound sector service was generally good albeit a little perfunctory by a male flight attendant who was occasionally a little rushed and gruff. Otherwise the rest of the staff were great. In contrast to previous journeys there was no rush to get the meal service over. There was a good choice of wine and spirits. Inflight entertainment was extensive but not to my liking but that's a personal choice. They supply you with a duvet pillows and a rather sad amenity bag which is embarrassingly cheap and tacky (apart from the creams and moisturizers). The seat is angled flat and is terrible for sleep. I am 183 cm tall and was constantly sliding down and ended up setting the chair at an armchair recline to try and get some sleep. The return flight was great just 6 people in business class so there was lots of attention and the attendants were truly warm and friendly . They got it right in that they were unobtrusive but yet managed to keep their eye on your glass and plate offering second helpings of food and topping up wine regularly. I used the book-the-cook service and my main meal of nasi lemak was just okay nothing special. Bear in mind that nasi lemak out of Adelaide is not to be recommended!

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,A Thomas,Sweden,2014-08-28,Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1

Seat ok and legroom in first row restricted by bulkhead. IFE didn't work in my row but not fussed as tired (purser handed out 25 euro voucher to use on return to Rio. Appreciated). Teriyaki chicken a strange choice out of Rio (impression coloured by horrible experience of teriyaki chicken on Hawaiian) but tasted better than looked. Campari enjoyed as aperitivo and Baileys as digestivo. Previous LH experiences have been lacklustre but felt the crew were personable and not the usual robots. All in all v satisfied.

Old 340-300 no USB chargers a terrible screen late departure and arrival without explanation and dinner was served by only 2 teams for the entire economy class one by aisle which means that we in the back (row 42 of 27 or so) got ours an hour after they began. This also meant on a 7 hour flight that there was little time between dinner and breakfast. In flight entertainment is pretty poor - 3 weeks between the flights and they were still showing the same episodes of TV shows.

It would have been nice to be able to check-in online but on charters this isn't possible apparently. Queues at both airports no more than 15 minutes. I noticed the cabin crew taking time with all customers and being friendly and professional. In my opinion the on-board menu is rather dull and I can't figure out why airlines can't sell stuff of the quality of high street coffee shops either heated or fresh? Both flights were on time and the return flight was in fact early to leave and arrive. Monarch is distinct because of it's high quality cabin staff and characterful identity.

Return on a 777 that was much more pleasant - in fact just having 9-across on a 777 is a reason to choose Malaysian (or Singapore) over someone like Emirates and their cattle trucks.

Having flown 6 sectors with Malaysian over Christmas and New Year I have enough experience to make a judgement. The cabin crew are generally inefficient and disinterested. The food is mediocre (breakfast during an 8 hour flight consists of a soggy chicken pasty and no hot drinks). Despite relatively calm flights on all 6 sectors I was offered tea just once due to the seatbelt signs being illuminated for most of the flights on all 6 sectors (which the majority of passengers ignored but the cabin crew ignored their non compliance).

Check-in at SYD was fast and the agent was really friendly. Fast-track through immigration and security provided because of elite status. Priority boarding for status passengers honoured. Seated in bulkhead rows on both flights where legroom was plentiful. Onboard catering was reasonable and of a decent portion but nothing outstanding. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful with the exception of one particular female attendant on the SYD-KUL leg who was a bit abrupt with other passengers. IFE was AVOD with a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Seat itself was much more comfortable than I was expecting and recline was also quite generous which made it comfortable enough to get a decent amount of sleep on the overnight flight back home. Both flights on time. KUL-PEN-KUL was on very old B737-400s. These planes will thankfully be gone by the end of this year. Priority boarding on the domestic flights for status passengers honoured.

Angled flat-bed seats on the A330-300 is behind industry standard but they were comfortable enough to allow sleep but storage space is severely limited. Flat-bed seats on the A380 are much more comfortable with a lot more storage space for personal items but still not an industry-leading product. Forward mini-cabin on A380 feels very private and quiet. On-board catering reasonably good on all flights with the satay being consistently top-notch. Check-in at LHR also quick with friendly agents. All seat requests honoured as well as Chef-on-call meal orders. A very good product overall let down only by the hard product on the A330-300 but it was excellent value for money.

This was a morning flight so there was no need to recline.

Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines.

SYD-KUL flight was on an aged B777-200 with small television screens and old broken seats. KUL-SYD flight was on a fairly new A330-300. The return flight landed 30 minutes late primarily due to the fact that it took the ground crew an hour to board the plane. On both flights the cabin crew were rude surly and inefficient. The food was generally appalling especially the sausage roll served two hours before landing and poorly planned with wine served mid morning and tea served in the afternoon. Drink runs were lacking on the both flights especially the return flight where I had to suggest that the cabin crew make one and even then they missed several rows of seats. The KUL-LGK-KUL flights were both serviced by extremely old B737-400. The fact that MAS still operates these planes is a disgrace. The interior was extremely dated the seats were broken and the air conditioner works poorly on the ground. The return flight landed 45 minutes late in KUL due to problems with the air conditioner.

Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles. Lounge access was good as layovers were 3hrs 30min too long. Loyalty for this airline is completely useless for me I will change my loyalty to another Scandinavian carrier with better timetables.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,4,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

monarch-airlines,/airline-reviews/monarch-airlines,Monarch Airlines customer review,Ian Robinson,United Kingdom,2013-10-13,Gatwick to Tobago leaving on 2nd October returning the following week. Disappointing check in at Gatwick with unclear and misleading signs. We were told that we were unable to have a window and aisle seat (pre booking was not available) as a section of the Premium Economy cabin had been 'blocked out' and as a result these seats were not free. However with the help of the supervisor this was sorted out and we were given the seats that we had asked for. Once on board the cabin was only one third full so not sure what all the fuss was about. Very impressed with the level of service and helpfulness of the staff through out the complete flight (BA and Virgin could learn a lot from this crew). The food was excellent and drinks were available through out. The seats were a little narrow and the IFE was just OK but considering the cost of the holiday it was fantastic value. Exactly the same crew flew us home and the level of service was equally as good. Based on this flight and despite the problems at check in we would have no hesitation in recommending Monarch.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,8,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Large section of ceiling trim came lose after very heavy landing. 45 minute delay appx. The return on August 19 was a nightmare. Nine hour delay. Little information from the airline and all of it conflicting including the reason given by the captain once airborne. No apology of course. After some hours at the airport most passengers bussed off like livestock to a dismal meal in a barn of a dining hall at a local resort hotel. Back at the airport to be greeted by further delay they were given pittance tokens for 'dead' sandwich rolls and a soft drink. Once it was obvious the delay was going to be prolonged we cleared off back into town for a proper meal and refreshments at our own expense.

Outbound flight had a few empty seats which enabled passengers to move around. Legroom was acceptable for a 6 footer like myself. Service was ok and we arrived earlier than planned. The return leg was much better as we were allocated row 6 which had substantially more leg room which was better than long haul leg room I have had with other airlines. I disagree with the leaving on of lights for a night flight to enable the selling of refreshments and duty free especially as there wasn't much demand for it.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,J Teoh,Australia,2013-11-10,LHR-KUL-SYD in Business class. LHR-KUL on the A380. Check-in agent at LHR very friendly and advised of fast-track through security and location of lounge. First class lounge (due to OneWorld Emerald status) very nice with great views of the tarmac and having a good selection of food at the buffet stand. A-la-carte menu was of excellent quality. The staff at the lounge were very helpful friendly and accommodating making the experience a complete pleasure. Priority boarding not quite what it should be as there is a boarding gate for business class passengers and economy passengers on the upper deck who board together and a separate boarding gate for first class passengers and economy passengers on the lower deck. Despite this boarding was relatively quick orderly and efficient. Non-alcoholic pre- departure drinks offered. Flight was delayed due to a crew member being injured prior to departure and they had to wait for a replacement crew to arrive. Seat was very comfortable in both the sitting and flat positions. There was also plenty of storage space for personal items. Good selection of IFE with a reasonable amount of latest releases. Cabin crew were excellent on this sector. They were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Pre-ordered meal through their Chef-on-call service was honoured. Quality of meals on this sector was quite good. Flight arrived late into KUL but some time was made up in the air. However it meant that the connection for the flight to SYD was still a bit tight. KUL-SYD was on a new A330-300. This flight was held back to ensure that connecting passengers and their luggage made it onto the flight which was much appreciated. Cabin crew again were great on this flight. My pre- ordered meal was honoured and it was excellent. This was probably the best steak I've ever had in the air! The satay of course was excellent. IFE similar to what was on offer on the A380 flight from LHR to KUL. The seat is comfortable in the sitting position but not so much in the angled flat position. Storage space for personal items is very poor on these seats. Flight arrived an hour late into SYD. Check-in luggage did make it through but did not come out first. However I was just glad that the luggage made it to SYD. Overall a great experience and one that I will continue to use due to the consistency of service standards and good value for money.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. Additionally the beer on board is better than other airlines Warsteiner. The food is similar to others in the same category - the only complaint is the number of films available. Perhaps there are 50 different films but compared to Etihad or others this falls a bit short by today's standards.

The cabins are fairly old fashioned and the leg room is bad for people with long legs. But the flight went quickly enough and was a good enough flight. Coming home the flight was delayed and no staff was anywhere to be seen. But the inward bound journey was fine and we still got home ok.

Aircraft apparently dates to 1990 but was in pretty good condition although the seat back in front of me was torn. I paid for extra legroom which wasn't too expensive and was definitely worth it as Monarch manage to squeeze 352 into this aircraft apparently. Seat width could have been better but it was slightly squeezed in Row 2 as the seat tray was folded into the arm rest. Staff were efficient and polite which was impressive given there were an awful lot of people to deal with. I should have booked food in advance as you can only buy sandwiches on board. Monarch say you can book a meal up to 24 hours before your flight but not if the flight is part of a package holiday you can't  at least not if it's Saturday or Sunday as the call centre staff pack up on Friday afternoons. Sandwiches were pretty poor and had I not been running late I would have bought something at the airport. No inflight entertainment but on a 2.5 flight that's not a problem for me. All in all a pretty good experience. Punctual and professional and a generous baggage allowance of 20kgs if you needed it. Throw in the classic Airbus A300 which is not seen in Europe anymore at least not in passenger airlines and I was more than satisfied.,NA,NA,NA,NA,8,3,5,2,0,NA,NA,4,1

However flight was full and found last row of seats in saab plane has reduced legroom so not happy. 2/1 - Buriram to Bangkok. Flight due to take off at 3.30 took off 5pm. No information provided about delay to any passengers from Nok air staff about delay or when incoming aircraft likely to arrive - dependant on information on internet instead. Buriram - Bangkok 5/1 worst of the 3. No information about issues until arrive at airport.

Originally scheduled to arrive 3.10 arrived Buriram at 11pm instead. Very disappointed with Nok Air this trip not only with issues but with lack of honesty about cause and information on delays being provided in an accurate manner. The issues have arisen due to one of the leased aircraft developing a major fault causing numerous cancellations and knock-on delays but would like to have been told this.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,N Werner,Singapore,2013-09-03,Flew CDG-KUL in Business on A380. Ground staff were ok but the airport is the worst to fly from in Europe. The lounge which is used by most airlines is not worth going. Once on board things change for the better and the Malaysian Hospitality can be experienced immediately. Staff were very friendly and offered great service. The seat was comfortable and included a comfortable duvet and pillows. The amenity kit from Tumi with Clarins product was very handy and of good quality. I ordered Chef on Call where you can choose a meal before you fly and the quality and presentation was nice. The satay and starter was great. Between meal times you can choose freshly prepared noodle soups freshly baked cookies or fruits. Breakfast was quite nice too and I managed to get some sleep during the flight. IFE was extensive and had a good collection.

malaysia-airlines,/airline-reviews/malaysia-airlines,Malaysia Airlines customer review,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,2013-09-01,KUL-ADL on 30th Aug. Ground staff at KLIA are appalling. After security there was only one person at the boarding gate to check boarding passes into the holding area resulting in a very long queue. No consideration given to people with babies and young kids. Boarding was a free for all resulting in congestion once on the aircraft. FA's were efficient but that was all. No smiles no interaction just the bare minimum. Food was good but the portions were small. Since it was a night flight they took too a long time serving the evening meal and that cut down on sleep time in what was a flight of 6 hours and 45 minutes. They would have been better off serving a snack and a drink and then lights off with a more substantial meal before landing. Toilets were clean no announcements from the cockpit crew and AVOD was just mediocre.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,1,3,1,NA,NA,3,1

Also inflight screens for every 3 rows was quite cool. Staff were very nice and friendly. Flight was cheap compared to easyjet as well. If you're considering the easyjet flight or this one this one will more likely be late due to poor positioning of the airline in the airport but it has wifi and they even texted me to tell me the plane was delayed (whilst I was on the plane 5 minutes after the delay time mentioned in the text but the idea was good) I would choose this airline.

One appeared to be leased from PIA and was clearly older than me by quite some way. The biggest problem with the OX service was the toilets - it would appear that they clean them in BKK but not in HKG - perhaps the services are too expensive in HKG. So even when we got on to the plane the toilets were horrible. One steward took the student approach of holding his nose opening the door spraying in a load of deodorant and closing the door again. Nice. We have flown OX before but I don't think we would again. Before they were just endearingly rubbish but they really seem to have gone downhill. Part of the problem is the passengers: no-one seemed to have a clue that you're not supposed to stand up during final approach or that it's rude to recline your chair into someone's face as soon as you sit down or that you should fill in your immigration form before you get the immigration counter or that you should queue to get on and off the plane or that you shouldn't commute with people 10 rows behind you by shouting. As far as your fellow passengers are concerned it's the worst airline I've flown on. I do feel quite sorry for the cabin crew: they really have their work cut out.

What makes a frustrating situation worse is the complete inability to keep passengers (and those waiting to collect them) informed. Check the airport information screens and they will likely say the departure time was two hours ago; check the internet and there is no indication of any delay. Absolute rubbish.

We flew with Norwegian as part of a package holiday booked through Monarch. At first we were surprised that we were flying with Norwegian instead of Monarch due to Monarchs flights being full. We were a bit concerned when we found out that the airline was a low cost airline but we were extremely impressed. Our outbound flight was on the 29/8/14. We used there self-service check in and it took no more than two minutes to print our boarding pass and drop our bags off and we were through security and airside within 5 minutes. The flight was 10 minutes delayed but the flight still managed to land so early that our coach wasn't even ready for us. Coming back on the 5/9/14 check-in was a nightmare we were in the middle of the queue for check in and still had to wait over 50 minutes it was only after about 30 minutes that they decided to open another check-in desk taking it up to two. The flight however still managed to board quickly and pushed back 10 minutes early. The aircraft we flew on was fairly new and had Boeings new cabin lighting which was really relaxing and changed colours. Cabin crew were smart professional and friendly and although you had to buy your own drinks and snack on the flight (very expensive but it's how they make their money) the service was very good. The plane had wifi and they use the wifi to display the flight details and flight map rather than on the overhead screens. Inflight entertainment was available on your phone/ipad/laptop for 7 euro but for a part of the flight they had short films playing on the screens such as Tom and Jerry. The only thing I can fault about the actual flight is that I found the seats fairly hard but at the end of the day the flight was less than 4 hours.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,S Ross,United Kingdom,2014-09-06,Following all the negative reviews of the transatlantic service I was somewhat nervous about our London Gatwick - JFK return flights. However I have to say that the whole experience was as good as economy class air travel gets these days. Norwegian is using the budget airline model for this service so if you have to be realistic in that you will either have to pay for everything or take it yourself (drinks snacks pillows blankets etc.). We did a combination of both. All the staff we dealt with were professional and polite we travelled on the Dreamliner both ways which was comfortable and had no issues with the entertainment systems that others have described. We were delayed on the return leg of the journey however this was not the airlines fault as someone had checked a bag and then not turned up for the flight we had to wait while their bags were removed. My only negative comment is that Norwegian put the time of the return flight back by several hours after we had made our reservations. Although we had a lot of notice of this and were offered the option to cancel the flight we were unable to re-arrange our plans as we had already booked connecting flights etc. As we were travelling with young children this was a real pain. It seems that when the transatlantic service works it is great if you can avoid the teething problems!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,3,5,NA,NA,4,1

Our holiday was booked through Saga and although our flight out to Bangkok on 2 April was uneventful after reading in the Bangkok press about the catalogue of problems occurring whilst we were on holiday we refused to travel back to the UK on 13th April with Phuket Air. As it happened this coincided with the Thai Ministry of Transport grounding the entire fleet (11 of the 13 had already been suspended pending inspections). Saga found us seats on Austrian Airlines and Saga now want an extra £285 each for this - but that's another story!

Muscat has no airbridges so it's all bus transfers. MCT is a small airport with limited food and beverage facilities. Return leg delayed on departure from BKK meaning there was only 15 mins in MCT to get my connecting flight to LHR. Upon clearing Customs I was ushered to the gate for connecting flight. Reaching the aircraft we were told there would be a further delay as connecting flight from Katmandu was late. In the end we were 1.5 hrs late. Arrived in London 1.5 hrs late.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,L Watson,United Kingdom,2014-07-13,This is by the far the worst airline I have flown with. We were flying from Gatwick to Gran Canaria on the 4th of July 2014. We were meant to fly at 8.35am but the flight was delayed 2 hours which was fine. At 10.30 we went to the gate only to be told the flight was again delayed with no explanation to why just to wait for more information which was coming at 12.30. 12.30 became 12.50 and still no further forward on to what was going on. Finally at 1.30ish we got news that the flight was delayed as the plane was broken and they had to wait for another plane to take us to Las Palmas. They were hoping to get us boarded by 3pm. Got the call to go to the gate at 3 when we got on the plane we sat on the runway for 2 hours cause they had to wait for fuel. The staff were nice enough on the plane but by that point everyone on the flight was annoyed and irate after being delayed for 9 hours. It was meant to be the Dreamliner but of course it wasn't. Coming back we were delayed by 20 mins which was fine considering what we had entitled on the way there. If you get the Dreamliner it's a really nice plane with comfy seats and plenty leg room but I for one will never be flying with this company again. They may be cheap but frankly I would pay the extra to fly with someone else.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,4,3,1,NA,NA,1,0
porter-airlines,/airline-reviews/porter-airlines,Porter Airlines customer review,R Martin,Canada,2014-12-22,Flight 0383 on Monday Dec 8 2014 the outbound was cancelled due to 'mechanical' reasons. Of course I was only notified of the cancellation when I was in a taxi half way to the airport. I paid $1450 for my flight to Chicago due to booking only 5 days in advance. In addition Porter charged me $26 each way for the one bag I checked. On the return flight 0392 on Dec 10 2014 my bag was 1 kilo (2.2 lbs) over the limit. I was told I could remove weight or pay an additional $75 excess bag fee. At the same time the passenger at check in next to me was advised that he should carry on the bag he was going to check because it was below the carry on weight. I removed some items from my bag and went back to check in. The check-in agent advised me that my bag was now 1 kilo under and would I like to put anything back in my bag. What a joke. Absolutely no common sense with respect to the check-in agent. The flight was half empty so weight and balance was not an issue. Flight left about 10 minutes late and after 20 minutes in the air the captain came on the PA system to advise that a latch had come loose on the cargo door and we would be required to return to Chicago. Another 'mechanical' issue I suppose. Flight eventually left one hour later so that we arrived about 2 hours late. So Porter wasted 4 hours of my valuable time yet wanted to charge me $75 for having 1 kilo excess baggage. I think the service was really unacceptable.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,4,0,NA,NA,1,0

All the luggage on the plane was offloaded at Istanbul it was then supposedly sorted into two groups one group for those leaving the plane and one for those passengers flying on to Ercan and then the additional luggage of the passengers joining the plane at Istanbul for Ercan.

I have never encountered a more disorganized and unfriendly airline. We arrived into Manila and it only got worse. We were ushered into a dirty holding area after presenting our boarding passes at the transit desk and then us and a small group of people traveling to SFO were walked into our terminal where our next flight would depart in 4 hours.

This was my first time on Qantas in many years as last time I flew them I felt they were very poor but have read how much they have invested in improving the product so wanted to try again. This was the first leg of a multi-leg journey in combination with partner airline Emirates which made for an interesting comparison. A380 although relatively new was starting to look tired inside. Dark carpets and dull seat colours made for a very dark gloomy interior. Seat comfortable but legroom surprisingly tight especially considering the long flying times Qantas international flights make. Inflight entertainment good sized touch screen tv screens with very good selection of movies TV music and games. Inflight entertainment on from gate to gate which is a great touch. Crew predominantly British friendly and professional. ""Supper"" service served from London to Dubai which essentially consisted of choice of hot main meal and small desert. Tasty meal but for an evening service where dinner would normally be served very limited. A tiny carrot muffin and juice served just before landing. Qantas are obviously cost cutting evident through their reduced meal service adding more rows into economy by removing a number of toilets at the rear of the A380 and lack of legroom.

Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time.

Some good things happened due to integration of Rossiya and Aeroflot ground handing. Aeroflot is a quite civilized business so they taught Rossiya check in staff how to organize check in and how to politely serve customers. Ticket office services even despite coming to Aeroflot brand remain slow and helpless with insufficient staffing. Online services have all migrated to aeroflot.ru so all work fine. For some reason Rossiya still maintains its own website (quite shabby though) but clicking to check in or ticket purchase will all lead to aeroflot.ru. Inflight experience is well deserved 2 star with every effort put not to allow it to become 3 star. Meal service is the worst in the air (inedible sandwich plus cup of tea/coffee that are better not to taste). Bring your own food and drink from the airport. Their aircraft are second hand A319 with median age about 20 years or same aged B767-300 where seat configuration is 2-4-2. Toilets are old type (non-vacuum) so some terrible smells have accumulated within their lifetime. Legroom is non-existent on every plane type so I always try to get seat in emergency row. Seat comfort is the worst part of travel with them. Unbearable and painful if you're on a long flight. The crews are old soviet style. Even younger ones miss normal modern communication skills. Their English is usually incomprehensible so I don't get how foreign passengers can get flight info or even being communicated with. But there is one strong reason why this company is 2 star not 1 star. They are always on time. Not a single flight I was on have been more than 5-7 minutes late. Never.

I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request ""for technical reasons"" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,M Khan,Palestinian Territories,2015-01-19,Manchester-Doha sector.–While boarding had to wait in the walkway leading to the aircraft door as clearing of the aircraft was in final stages of completion unfortunately icy cold gusts of wind were funnelling into the tunnel. However all this discomfort was easily forgotten on seeing the warm and cheerful welcome we received from the two smart cabin attendants at the doorway. As usual Qatar airways aircraft was spotlessly clean. The 2-4-2 seating of the A332 is ideal for couples who wish to have their space remain uncompromised. The seat pitch of ~32” and width of ~18” is better than many other offerings which give a claustrophobic ‘sardine-can’ambience the cushioning is also more comfortable. The IFE has been upgraded to Touch Screen technology and the availability of Wifi is a further value addition. Service by the cabin staff was as good as ever. Flight deck crew also kept passengers updated on relevant flight parameters. Compared to my previous experience the only aspect that has slipped was the catering. On this sector breakfast and a snack were served I had requested a low-salt diet which was complied with in both instances but the quality of the offerings was very average tasteless and just warm the quantity of the serving has also diminished since my last economy class flight. Doha - Islamabad sector. Due to foggy conditions across parts of the North Indian sub-continent the flight was delayed by some 11 hrs. Though the airlines website stipulates that passengers whose transits exceed 8 hrs would be provided hotel accommodation commensurate with their class of travel they were unable to do so in many a case as the airport hotel had been totally booked they did however provide meal vouchers and make the ‘quiet rooms available to the stranded passengers which I feel did alleviate their plight to some degree.

qatar-airways,/airline-reviews/qatar-airways,Qatar Airways customer review,J Keep,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,LHR – DOH – MAA return on 21st – 31st December ’14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It’s fair to say that our impression of Qatar’s in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average – all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha – Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we’d been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it’s 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats.

royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,R Woodward,Australia,2014-09-06,I flew Melbourne to Manila return last month on RBA and was very satisfied with their overall service. Because the base airfare was already around $400 cheaper than Singapore Airlines and Philippine Airlines (who fly direct) I was not expecting a great deal. But from this experience I can say that aside from the no alcohol policy there was little to separate the flying experience between RBA and Singapore Airlines. The new B787 flying between MEL and BWN was presented in spotless condition the food onboard was very good and plentiful with very good customer service from the staff. Even on the shorter A320 flights between Brunei and Manila we were served a full meal similar to the longer Melbourne services. Probably the only downside to the experience is the small Airport at Brunei which was undergoing renovations at the time of my trip. Very little to see and do in the small terminal. No wifi TV to watch or even interesting activity on the airfield. Thankfully stopovers did not last much more than one hour or so. Like most modern economy class offerings the economy class seats on the 787 were not so comfortable and felt very hard. I have noticed this is also the case on new SQ A380s and CX 777s so it's not a unique fault of Royal Brunei. But besides these small faults I will be flying with RBA again the next time I return to Philippines and can say that as an overall experience they were well worth the money. The B787 service from Australia was much like that of Singapore Airlines' A380 for a fraction of the price.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,2,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1
qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2014-03-28,BNE-SYD-SCL (Santiago) -SYD-BNE. Superb flights. Qantas seems to me to have recently undergone a 'mood change' with a noticeable enhancement of service. Best aspects of this particular trip were the First Class Lounge at Sydney the American Airlines Admirals Club (which Qantas uses) at Santiago the excellent food and wines but above all the superb service despite a very full aircraft. If you get a good Qantas cabin crew you will get some of the world's best. Perhaps a word should also be said for the level of engineering and technology that we take for granted these days: it simply amazes me that an aircraft (747-400 in this case) can transport us accurately for 14 hours non-stop over the remote Antarctic Ocean in absolute comfort and safety and also arrive at destinations within one minute of scheduled times - incredible.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,10,4,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Use of lounges and fast-track service at both airports due to OneWorld elite status. Seat for day flight to SIN was comfortable. IFE system a bit on the old side but there was a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Meal was tasty and of a good portion. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Return flight to SYD was an overnight flight. Seat not great for sleeping as legroom not quite enough. Maybe another 1-2"" of pitch would have made all the difference.

It was the worst trip I have had there and back. The food was very poor we were watching the trays after every meal getting packed away and they were hardly touched so we were not the only ones who thought so the breakfasts were shockingly bad. The flight crew from Dubai were very unprofessional complaining out loud about the airline and their shifts. Qantas advertise on there own page about enjoying a hot chocolate this is only offered once each way from Melbourne to London and Back. No ice creams offered as advertised. The self serve snack bar food is plain and boring offering plain biscuits nuts and small cake bars.

Good service free wine and reasonable food for economy. On one flight I boarded with an upset stomach and the flight attendant brought me some quality white wine from business class which helped enormously. Generally very full flights but on-time departures. I especially appreciated the careful route track selection to avoid headwinds on the westbound flights and to take advantage of these strong westerly winds for the eastbound flights meaning all flights either arrived exactly on time or were early. The Perth Qantas Club lounge is huge but at peak hour is still somewhat difficult to find space to sit down. Qantas have very annoying and intrusive people mover buggies sounding their warning sirens while moving around their Brisbane terminal (also the same in Sydney and Melbourne) - and mostly just transporting crew and friends about - what's wrong with a bell or soft honking horn as is the case in terminals such as Hong Kong?

Seat was comfortable and service was very good - attentive cabin staff. Had a few hours layover in Brunei and then to Melbourne on older B777. Flight was punctual and the food good. Drinks freely available and plane very lightly loaded - only five in Business Class. Was a bit disappointed that the new 787 was not in operation as seat not so comfortable as a bed.

I had to wait 8 hrs for the plane to show up. I knew this ahead of time the Delta flight was a morning flight and the Royal Air Maroc flight was at 6:32 PM. Once it was time to board the line was ridiculous. Once on board the Boeing 767 I sat down and the seats were comfortable and reclined reasonably far. About 1hr into the flight they served dinner.

We found all staff to be professional and in general were quite friendly even if smiles were a little limited. The economy food was surprisingly good and varied plus of decent quantity. Alcohol limited without asking but always available. Call buttons seemed to get quick attention from what we observed. All flights on time or early except for one which was only 20 minutes late. I found economy seat comfort and legroom acceptable despite being 192cm tall. Very happy the QR 777 is 9 abreast and not the 10 across that some others try to squeeze in.

Check completed in under five minutes but surprised no fast track through security Qatar use the No 1 traveller lounge adequate but nothing special. Boarding was quick and staff apologised for small delay whilst a family with young children boarded in front of us. We flew the Dreamliner and had chosen window seats specifically with my partner seated directly behind me. Seat was very comfortable and the general cabin ambience was excellent the cabin layout is 1x2x1. Served a very nice rose champagne after boarding food choice of wines and entertainment all very good. Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in. Had more time to see the new Al Mourjan Lounge this time it's very large good choice of food and lots of seating although at 06.00 it was very busy.

The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find – I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge.

The Trans-Tasman service was the early business shuttle with a Jetconnect 737-800. Firstly the IFE itself was fantastic same provided on the A380. For a 3 hour flight it was more than satisfactory. The screen itself was large and at the perfect height for viewing. The seat itself was rather narrow and the seat pitch was rather narrow (and I have a height of 5ft 5!). However we can attribute this to the size of the aircraft. The Flight Attendants themselves were fantastic and were overall bright and cheerful for the early flight time despite one haughty young woman (no more than 20) who was leering and smile-less for the entire flight. When I merely asked her for a blanket and pillow she gave me a scowl as if it were the hardest thing for her to do. However the overall flight was great. On to the A380 service to HKG. The seat pitch was more than sufficient and the width was great. The IFE screen was large and had more than enough entertainment for the 9 hour flight. The Flight Attendants were bright and cheerful for the whole flight and the catering of lunch and pizza bread refreshment was hot and fresh - probably due to the introduction of induction ovens on the A380.

Flight from Santiago to Sydney did not get off to a flying start due to a ridiculous check in system that took 20 minutes at the counter and another 10 minutes waiting in a line for a point to point journey. Unacceptable for business class. Flight was on-time and the Boeing 747 was complete with comfortable fully flat beds which while in a conventional forward layout were incredibly spacious and converted into a full length bed. IFE was AVOD had a good number of options which while not as extensive as some ultra tech savvy carriers like Emirates was wonderfully edited with excellent selections. The food was wonderful with a clear emphasis on fresh food that included a number of options prepared onboard. I loved the flexibility of choosing from an extensive menu at any time instead of the conventional set options at set times. The crew service was mostly exceptionally warm and attentive save for one crew member who seemed totally out of place. SYD-HKG was on an A380 and once again the check in time was far too long although the agent herself was efficient and friendly. Boarding staff greeted me in Hindi. A380 had the same seats and was immaculate. The small lounge area was a nice touch. The catering on this leg was excellent beating the high standards of the previous legs and I can safely say that it was one of the best inflight meals I have had. Crew were friendly attentive relaxed and very efficient. I was overall pleasantly surprised. There are some issues however particularly check in and certain crew and ground members that are marring the work of other staff who are going above and beyond and an airline that is trying to compete with the best in the business and seems to be pretty much up there particularly in terms of product quality.

No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully.

qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2014-01-09,Flew First from Sydney to Heathrow via Dubai on A380 and was impressed by nearly all aspects of the trip. Check in at Sydney was a little chaotic as the First Class check-in area was overwhelmed by large families of Platinum members using the facility but then having the usual priority immigration and security available to premium travellers I enjoyed the Qantas First Class lounge. An enjoyable spa treatment. The food at the sit down restaurant was one of the best lounge restaurants I have been to. On board service was indeed First Class with staff making sure they knew all passengers by name and able to respond to any queries. The seat itself is comfortable and infinitely adjustable although the controls for it are rather complex and take a little time to get used to. Made up as a bed it is easy to get sleep with adequate privacy and space to sleep on one's side and upright it is good for relaxing eating and working. Inflight pyjamas were better than those provided by other airlines and the amenities kit more useful as well. The massage function is enjoyable although a bit noisy. Quality of food for dining was excellent although it would have been helpful to know that the supper menu either side of the Dubai transit was nearly identical. Large range of food items although I thought the dessert selection was rather poor and the champagne in the lounge was better than that inflight. Inflight entertainment system excellent with a good choice and high quality screen and headphones. Transit at Dubai is pleasant at the enormous Emirates First Class lounge although at the time I travelled the spa was closed and it wasn't entirely clear when the boarding announcement would be. On arrival at London we had the same experience as other travellers and it took 20 minutes for bags to arrive - hardly priority. As an added touch it was good to be able to use the AA Arrivals lounge for a shower and a quick cup of coffee before heading into town.

Service was very mixed - some flight attendants excellent some seem to have been in their roles for too many years and were keen to show it. Food and wine very good on Qantas PE possibly the best globally. The Big problem was the domestic connection on return in Sydney - what a shambles. The return flight from SCL was just 10 minutes late but already being aware from their schedules that I had about 70 minutes to make domestic connections I made special effort to ensure I only had carry-on luggage would utilise my APEC card to assist rapid immigration and have an Express Pass as well. Despite being a Platinum Frequent Flyer having my boarding pass properly checked at the International Terminal Transit Area as being valid for my next flight and then arriving at the new departure gate at least 35 minutes before the scheduled boarding time (an hour before scheduled departure time) when I was finally boarding I was then abruptly bumped off the flight 'as the Qantas computer advised it would normally be too late for someone to make my connection and so they had allocated my seat to another passenger'. By then I had been 27 hours without sleep and had to struggle to find a seat on that flight or next flight. It was an awful experience overall and one wonders how the IT programming and scheduling guys at Qantas develop such a program that causes such a problem. A final point is that maybe it is time globally for it to be acceptable to tip airline flight attendants for good service if they provide it. Although we are all aware flight attendants are primarily on-board for safety reasons surely it would be possible to tip the service component of their duties and perhaps make them happier.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,3,5,3,NA,NA,4,0

I agree with some of the points raised by Christine Woodward on 2 October. This is business class from the late 80's. The seats were wide and I found them very comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. Its true that if you are in a window seat with someone next to you you cannot get out without disturbing him/her. But there are only 5 seats like this. The cabin is configured 1-2-2 so there are 20 aisle seats out of 25 total. I didn't like the iPad system. You were always looking down on it you couldn't watch while eating or when the seat is in the recline position. However the staff were great - very friendly and offered excellent service. The food was good as were the wines. Priority boarding of business class - and they stuck to it - turning back economy passengers and telling them to wait. On time departure and we were allowed to disembark first. We a good flight but this is an out of date product as Qantas know and I'm sure they will put the A330 on this route as soon as they can.

Qantas has a great premium economy product: very good food and wines and generally excellent service in this part of the cabin. However on this set of flights I had unhappy experiences: for SYD- HKG I did not get my usual window seat preference even though I am a platinum frequent flyer. This is sort of ok but after take off I was asked to swap seats with someone who couldn't get his IFE to work which I was pleased to do but then found myself surrounded by a bunch of passengers who were it seems trying to drink as much alcohol as possible and who invited their mates up from the back of the plane to join in the party which generally took place in the isles or at the front of this cabin. This made for a terrible flight experience as one could neither work nor sleep due to the loud talking and calls for more drinks - which I was slightly surprised to see Qantas staff obligingly provided. On the return travel the staff at the boarding gate insisted on changing my boarding pass to give me one for someone of another name (it was a woman's name as well and I am not a woman) and then arguing with me that this other passenger was me! A bizarre and embarrassing experience to say the least especially as this also held up the boarding process for some time with other passengers glaring at me as if it was all my fault. My guess is that this boarding pass was for a woman who they had given my original seat to. Thankfully the situation was sorted out by a senior staff member as it turned out I was to be provided with a business upgrade - which was excellent.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,5,4,4,4,2,NA,NA,4,1

Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet.

Our plane (FR7974) left late (after a late inbound arrival). I was sitting in Row 2. There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair.

Check-in quick with friendly agents - given pass to Air France/KLM lounge in Chicago. Plenty of food and drinks literally next to the departure gate. Boarding priority for Crown Class - directed to my seat on the A340 by friendly FA from Romania. She and the Purser continued excellent service from take-off to landing - friendly and personable. Only 1/3 full so lots of space - older style seat but so much room! You basically had 5 aircraft windows of space when reclined. Food service old-style - on a cart for each passenger to be serviced individually - very classy. Quality and quantity of food excellent. Entertainment was ok - they need more options for films and TV shows. Arrived 1 hour early into Amman - transit in the lounge - more high quality food.

Excellent value and only travelled with cabin baggage. Due to the time of year I assumed the flights would be busy so asked at the Bag Drop desks at both Glasgow and Dublin if they could accept by bag into the hold, which they did free of charge and with no fuss. GLA-DUB flight was slightly late due to the aircraft arriving late into Glasgow, but the next sector was on time, arriving 10 minutes early. Both flights typical Ryanair, the service being consistent. Crew on the DUB-BRE sector had more time to chat and appeared efficient.

Boarding was slightly chaotic due to simultaneous departing flights to the UK, but this was not Ryanair's issue, being within the control of the airport authorities. The cabin crew were very welcoming, especially the cabin supervisor. She appeared efficient and along with the rest of the crew seemed to go out of her way to chat to as many passengers as possible when the opportunity arose. The crew were humorous in their charity scratchcard sales pitch and the flight arrived in Edinburgh around 15 minutes ahead of schedule.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2015-06-01,I opted for Ryanair due to needing a direct flight from Gdansk to London. I read all the small print and rules to be able to pay the correct price for bag fast boarding and emergency row seat. These extras added up to about 100% to the initial price tag but even then it was quite cheap (some 70USD one-way all inclusive). There was no trouble with booking as well as with online check in. I was even able to download mobile boarding pass through the app. At the airport I only spent abut 10 minutes for bag check and visa verification. At the gate my experience was not overly pleasant with some 200 people with screaming children left on the stairs leading to the apron for about 20 minutes. Then door opened and crowd went to the plane. Since I booked priority boarding I had no trouble reaching my seat and accommodating my bag. The crew were polite and helpful. Since their hand baggage limit is strict there was no problem finding space for bags. We took off on time. The inflight experience was up to expectations but not as annoying as some wrote here. No seat recline but plenty of legroom in emergency row. The plane was very tatty but clean. Toilet was ok. We landed 10 mins ahead of schedule. Then usual labyrinth of Stansted terminal and unbelievable immigration lines for EU citizens. Due to being Ukraine national I was directed to the non-EU line which consisted of some 15-20 people so it took me 10 minutes to pass border control. My bag was already on the belt I was off the airport 20 minutes after landing. Absolutely bearable experience; you'll have no trouble if you carefully read their instruction and spend extra 10 minutes on booking process.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,S Summers,Austria,2015-05-31,EDI-BTS on 17 May. I've opted to avoid Ryanair for the last five years preferring to travel on full-service airlines from central airports for a little more money. However in this instance Ryanair offered the easiest best times connection from Edinburgh to Vienna (well Bratislava). I paid £8 for seat 1C (extra leg room and priority boarding) and £15 to check in a bag online the day before departure. Bag drop at Edinburgh was efficient.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2015-05-22,MAN-PMI-MAN. Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for £200 per person in low season.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,4,0,NA,NA,NA,5,1

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2015-05-13,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about? All-in-all Ryanair are fine and are improving but it wouldn't be any harm to send mystery shoppers and auditors on flights occasionally to see what is really going on and realistically running out of the toilet paper hand towels. hand soap and saleable things like water is fairly unacceptable from a pax perspective.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,2,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,1

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Clarke,Ireland,2015-04-22,"Over the past month I have been on four FR flights. The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow.

As we were in remote places with an old blackberry phone we were prepared to pay the still unreasonable boarding pass printing charge.

The crew were very friendly and helpful. A passenger was unwell during the flight and the stewardess was very caring bringing extra drinks cold towels and checked how she was feeling every so often. The flight was approximately three quarters full. The small complimentary baguette tasted nicer than it looked and there was a chocolate bar with tea and coffee. In addition to this there was two rounds of soft drinks water apple juice orange juice etc all complimentary. Alcoholic drinks were available for a charge.

Flight was very smooth with the same complimentary drinks and sandwiches as the outbound flight. Cabin crew were friendly and very professional. When we landed in Manchester Airport there was some confusion. We knew before hand that we had to disembark the aircraft at Manchester. Some of the passengers were unaware of this and the crew only mentioned that the Gatwick passengers had to disembark when we landed. When the cabin doors opened all of the passengers for Manchester and Gatwick stood up and the crew announced that the Gatwick passengers should sit down to let the Manchester passengers disembark first. If the crew told us this before hand it would have made life much easier. The Gatwick passengers eventually disembarked (with lots of moans and groans) and the passengers were given an in transit boarding card. Gatwick passengers had to take all of their hand luggage to the security check point have the bags scanned and then board the same plane back to Gatwick.

I found the food and drinks to be rather expensive. $8 for a small can of beer! The worst thing about the flight was the old 777 plane. For some reason they revved up the left engine to full blast when the plane was parked and then throughout the flight that engine's rev level was continually and dramatically going up and down.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,M Simons,Greece,2014-12-22,Although some people had not spoken very well of Ryanair. I have the opposite to say. In both destinations in Athens and Stansted I found the staff very polite and very helpful. They were very organised and I was pleasantly surprised. The seats on the aeroplane were not too comfortable but for a short trip it didn't matter. The plus point was that travelling with a small child the arms of the seat lifted up and being flat it was easier for my daughter to sleep on the journey. The only down point that I could say is that the staff talking on the intercom I could not understand very well their English or Greek. This could have been a fault of the intercom. I found them excellent and compared to other airlines very competitive. It was the first time I had travelled with them and would do it again. I gave fair for value for money but that's because all flights from Greece to England are far too expensive. Please bring the price down or make more offers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,3,5,4,NA,NA,NA,3,1

sas-scandinavian-airlines,/airline-reviews/sas-scandinavian-airlines,SAS Scandinavian customer review,A Thomas,Sweden,2014-08-28,On booking I was given no alternative but to take a full-fare economy flight FRA-ARN with SAS on Mon 25 August if I wanted to return that evening. I was told on check-in at La Paz that it had been upgraded to Business Class which would have been welcomed after 26 hours travelling on two international sectors earlier. On boarding flight SK638 at FRA I found the seats to be exactly the same size and configuration as in economy class and every seat was to be occupied i.e. including the middle ones or all 15 seats. Yet the economy cabin itself was only one- third full and there were many rows with no passengers at all. Why was I then forced to pay a full-fare economy to fly that evening? We at SAS Plus were offered an alternative of either a chicken or cheese sandwich only and only then asked if we wanted anything else. When I asked what else was available I was shown the menu turned specially to the pages listing snacks with prices which I declined considering it an insult on business class of a non-budget airline. Yet I saw about 4-6 full-meal trays handed to an economy flight attendant. The meal clearance was conducted within 10 minutes of the completion of the meal serving. Soon after I spotted the business class attendants in the galley eating a full-meal tray each. Later I noticed that this was the evening meal on the menu which was meant as complimentary for business class (SAS Plus) passengers. Why were the flight attendants - including those in economy cabin - eating our meal entitlement never even having offered it to us? Shameful behaviour! The menu in-flight magazine and safety card were dog-eared and very old looking. The male flight attendant in business class had not shaved that morning - which is quite different from having trimmed facial hair. These are small symptoms of an airline in decline.

Usually fly with easyJet but Ryanair had a more convenient time for our return from Malaga. Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,4,3,NA,NA,NA,4,1

The pre-purchased meal (red curry) was inedible (the worst airline meal I've had in many years) and came with a can of Pringles and a can of Coke or Coke Zero (but not water which was sold onboard for $4 per small bottle). The onboard water fountains (common to B777 aircraft) don't work so passengers have no option but to buy their overpriced water. The wiser passengers were taking empty bottles and filling them after security screening to avoid this rip-off. Also several toilets were not working on the PER-SIN leg. I was not disappointed with the price (excellent) but Tiger Jetstar and Air Asia are much better and should be flown in preference to Scoot.

The food was not particularly satisfying and because I don't have a tablet device I couldn't take advantage of the free ""ScootTV"".

My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it.

Flight smooth with the exception of a couple of Arab children running repeatedly up the aisles - fairly normal on MidEast airlines where parents rarely discipline their offspring. Major stroke of luck on arrival at Jeddah as I was attending a conference for which Saudia was handling many of the arrangements so whisked through VIP lounge passport stamped and into a taxi within 20 minutes of getting off aircraft. Jeddah-Riyadh again a 777 an 80-minute hop. Aircraft packed which made the serving of a full breakfast particularly impressive : full marks to the cabin crew. Not a lot of smiles from them but understandable when concentrating on serving 300 people in such a short time. Riyadh-LHR another 777 but this time 10-abreast (3-4-3) and seats noticeably thinner and less comfortable.

We really hope Singapore Airlines introduces premium economy and newer aircraft join this route soon! (The airline is scheduled to launch P/E in September). Another letdown was the IFE.

They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat. After all who wants to gallivant around an unfamiliar foreign city looking for an internet cafe that may or may not have a printer. The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows!

Next leg to BKK on an A340. My seat 3H did not work took over an hour to get it down into position close to the lie flat bed (moving a few cm's at a time). Come morning I was overlooked by staff at first for breakfast as I was still lying down. Finally I snapped at a FA and finally got them to understand that the seat was broken. FA Barked at me to get out of seat then she got down under it and did what ever she had to and finally got the seat up. No apologies.

I made the mistake of not checking in online which I realised was against company policy and by the time I had tried to do this the two hour curfew was on and I couldn't do it. This meant checking in at the airport for the sum of £70 per head (£140 in total) for myself and my wife.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,B Thompson,United Kingdom,2014-05-25,Use of Ryanair is generally a last resort. Flight last Friday from Treviso to Bristol was due to take off at 15:20 but about 30mins beforehand a small storm arrived with torrential rain and lightning meant there was likely to be some delay. However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known! Eventually arrived back in Bristol over four hours late. Needless to say will not be rushing to use Ryanair again anytime soon!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,0

The main problem we had with our return trip is that we had medium haul 777 and on the way over the much more comfortable long haul product. The medium haul has an inclined bed seat that is far too hard and not at all comfortable whilst the long haul has the fully flat (and deliciously soft) bed- more like a cubby than a bed). It was a bit disappointing.

SAS has a habit of blocking off a number of seats so the choice can be somewhat limited during internet check-in. I noted a number of unused seats on the plane in rows ahead of us which had not been available. After a 45 minute Bus and Metro journey we arrived at Copenhagen T3. A fairly new terminal used almost exclusively by SAS. We were obliged to register and print out our baggage labels from one of the kiosks before we dropped off our bags in less than two minutes (having noticed that although the L/H side of the terminal had horrendous queues the R/H side had only one or two passengers – SAS really should have staff to direct passengers with bags). Security was reasonably quiet. The A-321 was l full clean and bright and we were offered a free cup of tea or coffee everything else was paid for.

The crews on both flights were outstanding and accommodating to our requests. Nonetheless there was a handful of crew members who whilst polite were rather cold and didn't appear to be interested in going the extra mile. I've noticed this lately on SIA but this was made up by the exceptional service rendered by the rest of the crew. We ordered special meals. Food on the outbound was excellent though our vegetarian meal on the inbound was very bland and not fulfilling at all. IFE selection was mediocre at best. Movie and TV selection was limited and disappointing. This tends to be the case on SIA it's a bit of a hit and miss. Emirates has its act together much better in this area. We got a refurbished 772 which was nice. Legroom was great. However the hard seat cushions made sitting down a bit uncomfortable after a while and ill-placed IFE remotes which were on the armrests. Your legs would keep knocking against the controls. Overall it was an above average flight and I would use SQ again. Though I wouldn't be adamant.

Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option.

Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest.

JNB-PLZ in B737-800 fitted with wider seats and more legroom in Business class. If you have to travel from Cape Town to Joburg book SA346 flight in the afternoon at around 3pm. They use an A340-600 from the Cape to JNB and you'll sit - or lie - in SAA flat bed seats for a domestic flight of just 90 mins. If SAA only managed to teach their ground staff the same efficiency and friendliness that their onboard crews have I would have rated both trips a10 instead 9. I've rarely met more attentive polite and friendly flight attendants than on SA flights. Some airport staff on the other hand prefer to give you the impression as if they were forced to work there.

I know enough not to pack valuables in a checked bag so nothing was worth stealing. Two other members of my tour group had similar experiences.

But my only issue on this trip and it is not a fault but rather a comment. Flying cross country non-stop on a 737 for 5 hours is a bit brutal. We did get on a brand new 737-800 for the longest sector from BWI to LAS which was nice but still a very long trip on a small plane that was packed to the hilt. The crew were pleasant on all sectors. The ground staff at BWI were great and the Skycap had us laughing. All in all a good product with no complaints really.

Main dissatisfaction was that after making very specific enquiries about weight and dimensions of cabin baggage we scrupulously limited ourselves to 7kg only to see people carrying large cumbersome and clearly heavy cases onto the aircraft. If they make rules they should enforce them and not rely on Brits to do all the compliance! On three out of four meal services the options shown on the menu card we had been ceremoniously presented with had run out. On one occasion a cabin stewardess made a special effort to try to provide something better than the default. Ordering a drink that came out of a can (eg beer) you did not get the can - just a glass! The safety demonstration was very poor. I was twenty rows back from the cabin crew and they simply seemed to wave their arms around to demonstrate the emergency exits. Terrible lack of rigour. Ironic that we had to make a safety stop at Frankfurt on return to London and the cabin crew we called upon to demonstrate emergency procedures again just before we landed.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,R Smith,United States,2014-08-15,Did a round trip from Dallas to Portland Oregon the weekend of August 9. Decided to upgrade to the front seats which for my brother and I it was worth the extra cost of $50 per seat. The front seats do recline. The only hitch on this trip is that upon returning to DFW we could not get our checked luggage for over 1.5 hrs. It was very frustrating. But if you need a cheap seat and you can pack light and either pay the carry on charge for you luggage or just put everything in a small backpack then Spirit may work for you. We also had to wait once we landed for a gate to open up so we sat on the ground an extra 15 minutes before our plane could get into a gate. I also brought my own snacks so make sure you do that. I chose to purchase water after passing through security and getting inside the terminal. I took my bottled water in my small backpack along with my snacks onto the airplane and this was not a problem. Other than these problems it went relatively well. I checked in online and printed my boarding passes online from my home. The Spirit staff and the airport and on both flights were acceptable. Also Spirit was one of few airlines that offered DFW to PDX non-stop which for me is important because I don't like multiple flights. Bottom Line.

Internet check-in is supposed to open 48 hours before the flight and when I flew was still not open 12 hours after this time (ie. 36 hours before the flight) – a phone call to their reservations centre produced the information that check-in was not working (IT problem) but they were willing to reserve my preferred seat for the way out and way back in one weeks time. Drinks served after take-off followed by a reasonable meal and then lights out. Because the flight was only one quarter full we could spread out. Unfortunately not all the armrests could be lifted so I had to wriggle a bit to get comfortable but it was far better than sleeping upright. Inflight entertainment old seat back non AVOD and the choice of films was poor. Breakfast edible if you were hungry.

The reason I chose Spirit Airline was price. On the outbound trip I had to pay $45 because my suitcase was 0.5 inch wider than their measurement. This suitcase has been used all the time for carry-on baggage with many different airlines never with any problems. Once on board the flight attendants one male and one female never smiled. Neither did they provide a single complimentary drink not even tap water for 3+ hours. They simply force you to buy their merchandise. Before the end of the trip the do-not-know-how-to-smile male attendant made three announcements to urge travelers to sign up Spirit credit card and how many benefits you would get with those cards all within half an hour. On my return trip things get worse. Though I gave away my half-an-inch-larger suitcase to avoid the $45 fee and my stuff in a plastic bag fits well in the free personal item measurement. The Spirit gatekeeper insisted I pay $100 for my things by calling out to close the gate - he knows perfectly well the mentality of a weary traveler and he hits them right on spot. I was the last one there trying to avoid this $100 expenditure out of nowhere. But I don't want to be left behind so I gave in. On board again not a single drop of complimentary water. At least this time the flight attendants smiled. They simply paraded with an empty trash bag to walk back and forth.

They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply.

Flight attendants were friendly and spoke decent English/Spanish in addition to their native Portuguese. Seats were comfortable and had lots of leg room and the AVOD was great. The meals weren't anything special but they were ok. The flight from Sao Paulo to Buenos Aires was on an old but well kept A320. Nothing special about this flight good or bad. My return from EZE to GRU was on a A321 which had minimal leg room. Again the attendants were friendly and the drinks and food weren't bad. The second long haul leg from GRU to JFK was just as good as the trip down. TAM is miles ahead of any US carrier that flies to South America.

Once we took off I was asked if I was alone and could move and was put in a biz class seat. Could have been due to my Continental booking or because of my Star Alliance status but I understood it to be since the father of the mother and child next to me wanted to be with them. Food consisted of the usual small ham and cheese sandwich (no options). The two attendants spent much of their time at the very front of the plane by the cabin door with the curtain drawn. One dozed.

Same story; the flight left so late that we got stranded (again) in Vitoria. Took 6 hours to get a voucher for an absolutely lousy hotel.

When we arrived there; the plane was 1 hour delayed and there were at least 30 empty seats in the plane!

The letter explained we'd be taken to a hotel and provided with 1 meal and a drink. The next morning we were made to leave for the airport at 6.45am again not great with two small children! Finally got to the airport to again be greeted by another letter and no rep saying we are now flying with HiFly airline and again delayed by another hour. What an experience that was the plane was awful there was no inflight entertainment and the staff didn't speak English and constantly argued due to the amount of pressure they were under. Not a great experience and definitely not worth the money we paid. This flight was worse than a budget airline so why it was sent to collect us I will never know. Very poor customer service and I will not be booking a package holiday with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,1,3,1,NA,NA,1,0

Took a shower as I had arrived from Chicago on UA and the facilities were excellent. Good food and plenty of seats in the lounge. Boarded upper deck of the A380 and warmly welcomed by the crew. Hot towels offered and a drink before take off. Was in the last seat of the Biz Class (27 K) and enjoyed it - the small economy section behind is nice as they don't allow children there so it is quiet. The food was average but had good flavor. AVOD Entertainment had plenty of movies and TV shows to watch on the 10 hour flight. The attendants were very friendly and accommodating but I was surprised that after dinner and before breakfast they never came through the cabin offering drinks and snacks. If you went to the galley they would happily deliver whatever you wanted to your seat but even on American and United they come thru every few hours with water (and that is in economy). Landed on time and bags out quickly. Overall a good flight and the A380 is so quiet.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,3,4,NA,NA,4,1

On this route Thai have to compete with SQ and CX and showed a huge improvement compared to an earlier flight I took from the Philippines where they were only competing with PAL and Kuwait Airways. 9 across configuration with a good seat pitch but the box for the IFE does get in the way. Seat back screen was a decent size but the content was a bit of a letdown. Catering was very good for economy with the main course on a china dish metal cutlery and milk for tea and coffee compared with foil/plastic/creamer on some airlines. The baggage allowance in economy is only 20kg and needs increasing to 30kg in line with most of the competition.

This 747 had old rock hard uncomfortable seats from 10 years ago the sound system was broken the menu has not altered for many years and BKK airport is too difficult for an older person.

Another problem was that every time we flew through any slightly unstable air the back of the plane yawed from side to side sufficiently to spill drinks.

The seats do not recline completely flat but I was comfortable enough to be able to get to sleep. Earplugs and blindfolds were also provided which gave me a more peaceful rest. Generally cabin crew were friendly especially when you talk to them personally. They could have smiled at bit more however in other situations such as when they are serving food and beverages. Special mention to the fresh fruits that I had for breakfast which had amazing presentation on the plate! Overall pretty positive experience just a few little things that TG should look at to enhance the experience for customers.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,3,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

It took over 3 hours for us to check our bags in and thus our flight was over an hour late departing. When we arrived at Zakynthos one of our bags was missing. We were told our luggage was still at Luton and would be flown out the next day. The Thomas Cook rep told me it had been sent to Amsterdam and would arrive later that day. After waiting for the luggage to arrive and it not being on the flight I again was abruptly told it had been flown to Athens.

Outbound the flight was about 30 mins late departing but that was probably due to ATC issues on the day and was no great hardship as we boarded pretty much on time. The flight to Thailand is about 11 hours going out and 12 and a half hours coming back. Service was great including the free drinks! The food was decent. Seats as usual were comfy enough. I would say that both Dreamliners we flew on could use a deep clean and a little bit of a tidy up. They are new planes but you can see they are heavily used.

Flight slightly delayed due to all toilets being out of action took off with 1 toilet out of order coped with that but food on both inbound and outbound was disgusting crew indifferent. Delayed on return from Cancun on October 25th check in computers went 'down' with 75 of us still waiting to check in. We were left standing for 2 hrs while they tried to sort out problem despite asking for info numerous times we were treated with utter contempt telling me personally to get back in the queue when I asked why we couldn't be checked in manually? The staff offered no explanation as to when we could board the pilot knew of the problem because when he & the crew checked in we had already been waiting for an hour. The staff were a disgrace and Thomson should look into their customer service approach. Eventually we checked in with minutes to spare and straight onto the plane no duty free shopping for us unfortunate 75 customers. The flight home didn't have enough duty free purchases the food was awful as stated & the mood lighting? What mood lighting? No apology from the pilot just a cursory sorry for the delay due to technical problems! I wasn't aware I was a technical problem just another upset customer left in limbo for 2 hrs with rude staff. On arriving at Birmingham we couldn't lock up with the departure tunnel & it had to be relocated to another door more delays. On leaving aircraft my husband said to 1 of crew 'we had trouble getting on plane and trouble getting off' his reply was 'just one of those things liking having problems with a new car'! If I had a new car with that many problems I'd be furious and staff who don't give a monkeys only added to the problem on a lighter note the plane did have better leg room and more choice of movies but apart from that no better than any other Thomson flight and I've been on plenty.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,5,2,2,5,NA,NA,2,0

I carefully booked in advance seats on all legs so I could choose seats with a lot of space (27J on the routes from Europe to Brazil and back). 27J has a lot of extra room for legs since it is near the emergency exit and is the first to be served. It is also close to toilets. The A340 is old with practically no IFE and food is very basic. However I found seats to be reasonably comfortable and could sleep in both flights. In the leg from Lisbon to Rio the flight was practically full; in the way back less than 50% of seats was occupied. European legs were also fine: food served is also very basic (including an uneatable sandwich) but at least there was some IFE with flight information.

There is no cabin wall at the rear of this seat. It is also conveniently furnished in black unlike every other seat which is a light grey so you can forgive passengers for not seeing it.

Both planes new. Negatives: Seating - cramped / uncomfortable. I'm 5ft 10 so not overly tall but 3.5/4 hours really is the limit. Food: You book a five star hotel but the experience on board is far from five star why on a 4 hour flight can we no longer order / pay for a proper meal? Being offered chips at 7am just doesn't work in my opinion / neither does a Kit Kat. East Midlands airport is an absolute joke and by the time you've 'dropped your bags off' and cleared security you have no time to buy something half decent to eat for the flight. Crew were OK. Miserable on the outward flight and to be honest they looked liked they'd had a rough night previous. Thomson flights aren't cheap but the level of service doesn't reflect this. I've booked this trip for my family independently for next year and booked TAP flights to Madeira. Just a note: why do people feel the need to say how bumpy their flight was?

At BKK it is always a delight to be able to use the Royal Orchid Spa in advance of flying C Class on TG and that proved to be exceptional although the lounges themselves are looking tired. Boarding was reasonably orderly with a warm welcome.

Only downside was an excessive level of high volume announcements so loud that it is deafening through the headphones.

Dismayed by the length of queues for check on but impressed with the speed at which they moved. There is only one queue for all flights. The flight was absolutely full. We were unable to have seats together but at 6 ft 3 I was glad of an extra leg room seat. The added bonus of being trampled on by people waiting for the toilets was not brought to my attention. The meal which was included was a breakfast and notwithstanding the difficulty of eating it on a tiny fold out table it was not too bad. The crew worked very hard and one had the impression that they were embarrassed at having to sell bingo cards. The return left about an hour late due to a bird strike inbound but we were kept up to date by the flight crew throughout although why we had to board on time and then sit for nearly an hour and a half was not explained. The meal on the return was in all honesty the most disgusting thing I have ever been offered. Overheated and shrivelled vegetables the smallest piece of beef ever and an awful pudding.

How one should know what to do or expect in term of time for board? I think they treat passengers with contempt and anger directed towards them; I have witnessed the so call air hostesses being rude.

Both planes were 737-800s but the seating was not identical. On the Dubai-Kiev leg the seating was cramped my knees were knocking the seatback pocket and anyone much taller than me (178 cm / 5'10"") would likely have found it very uncomfortable. The Kiev-Gatwick leg however offered what was clearly roomier seating with minimal knee-seat contact. The latter seating also seemed slightly more frayed; I gained the impression that slightly better legroom was in the older plane. Otherwise there's no getting around the fact that despite being Ukraine's national airline UIA are also a budget airline with no in-flight entertainment and no free food (only limited food options for a cost) on short or medium-haul flights - which includes Dubai-Kiev. If you go into the flight knowing this then the really competitive cost makes UIA worth considering as the flights seem to be punctual staff are professional and transiting at the UIA-dedicated Terminal D at Boryspil is easy fast and painless. If you go into a short- or medium-haul route with UIA expecting full service from a national airline then you'll likely be disappointed. I imagine that the Skytrax 2-star rating reflects the lack of entertainment and limited food options - but judge UIA as a budget airline and they're better than many of their European competitors in the similar price bracket and I've had much worse experiences with full-service North American airlines on (internal) flights of similar length to my individual legs here.

We didn't buy any on board food as is was too expensive and the flights were only a couple of hours in any case. My only real complaint concerns the lack of leg room; this airline really does 'pack em in' tightly. Not that bothered about lack of in flight entertainment or an airline meal but having flown with Thomson many times dating back to the Britannia days I will say without hesitation that the overall product and flight experience is not the same; it is something more akin to the other low cost carriers and Thomson should take note of this.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,1,3,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

Drink first offered about 45 minutes after take off in both directions (I got the impression that the crew were under orders not to serve too many drinks as part of a cost-cutting exercise). Food okay. No IFE on either of these flights. Check in at Kiev was hopeless. Despite there being no one in front of me when I arrived at the business class desk to check in the agent was disinterested and reading her magazine and directed me to a free economy desk adjacent. Beware of Kiev- you can't check in (and proceed to lounge) until 2 hours before your flight is ready to depart. Very limited choice of places to eat and drink at airport airside. I paid £7.50 for a pint of beer in airport cafe and at lunch a main course was about £20 £25. Lounge spacious but extremely limited range of drinks- no whisky only American bourbon.

My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti, we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food, nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals.

Check-in staff in Manchester were very good and helpful and Mombassa staff polite friendly and obliging too.

When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a ""water leak"". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn't have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting. Finally the pilot came back over the speakers and informed us that the ""water leak"" was actually condensation from the coffee maker that the flight attendants failed to wipe up after the last use.

One more good experience with THY all flights on time and service as expected good. No other European carrier serves this amount of meals on intraeuropean flights and service about the same on intercontinental.

While the crew were not overwhelmingly friendly they did their jobs efficiently and mostly with smiles. What sets Turkish Airlines apart besides their phenomenal lounge at the Istanbul Airport is the quality and quantity of the food that they serve on board. Whereas on most other airlines you get a choice of perhaps 3 different appetizers to choose from on Turkish Airlines they have a whole trolley filled with different Turkish appetizers from you to select. You can try as many as you want. The same logic holds true for desserts. You had perhaps 10 different options to choose from. The seats on both flights were not of the ""lie flat"" variety but were comfortable nonetheless. My only true complaint dealt with the cabin temperature. The crew kept the temperature fairly warm on both flights. I did ask one of the attendants to lower the temperature on the flight to Istanbul which she did. But in about an hour or two later the temperature was warm again. Offerings in the amenity kits provided were generous and the cabins and rest rooms were kept fairly clean throughout both flights.

After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care.

I liked Continental a lot so United when acting under the Continental side is wonderful. However I got a bit more ""tulip"" and less ""globe"" on my flight from Miami to Newark. The check-in and gate agents were wonderful as usual but the flight was delayed two hours before taking off from Miami. I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United's horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80's synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming. If I'm flying in and out of Newark a former Continental hub I deserve Continental service. Let Chicagoans keep their United I'll keep my Continental.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,4,4,1,1,NA,NA,3,1

us-airways,/airline-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Graubard,United States,2014-09-06,MUC-PHL-ORD on Sept 2. A330-200 from MUC - mechanical issue that delayed departure for almost 2 hours. They kept saying it would be 10 minutes but that stretched out every time. Once on board the flight was good - seat comfortable and good food. Great AVOD. Landed an hour late and ran through immigration and security to get to my ORD flight. A321 wasn't full - departed on time and sat on the runway for 2 hours due to a storm that came just as we were taken back to the terminal. Other planes were taking off so not sure if the reason they gave for the delay (air traffic couldn't route us around the storm) was honest. Landed 3 hours late in Chicago - crew was very friendly at least.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1

Crew was very friendly and came through multiple times for trash pick up after their drink run. Connection was 2 hours to a full A330-200 to Munich. Boarding was well organized. Had aisle seat in front part of economy - seat comfort was good and AVOD was slow but great content. Flight attendants were not unfriendly but not super friendly. Chicken for dinner was yummy and filling. Landed 30 min early to Munich. Overall I was impressed with my first international trip on US Airways.

The trip west was uneventful and Delta was fine. But the US Air flight from San Francisco to Charlotte NC at 1.05pm on Aug 13 2014 we saw two attendants ahead of us but as only one taking boarding passes. There was a second attendant who was looking at everyone's carry-on bags. When my wife passed the boarding pass scanner she rudely told my wife she couldn't board because she had three carry-on items - a purse a book bag and an envelope. She made my wife put the envelope into the book bag. I have no clue what made this US Air employee so spectacularly unable to deal with the public on this day but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Nearly every passenger on the plane about 190 of us were commenting about the scene we had witnessed. And all felt the same as I.

I decided to check- in for this flight as I would have to get up at 5am to catch it. At 7pm when I went to check in online I found out that my flight had again been cancelled (couldn't blame the weather - reason given was no crew) and I was re- scheduled for a flight at 1.30pm. There was no email sent to me nor was I contacted to be informed of this change less than 10 hours before my flight. When my flight 5876 was cancelled on 3 Jul 14 there were 2 staff members to re-schedule over 50 people - it takes about 45 minutes for the staff to re-schedule each person. How come United could not find more staff - this was known there would be cancellations predictable that flights would be cancelled. Overall a pretty shabby performance from United. Now again today they cancelled my flight - also did not inform me at all - I found out by accident by looking at their website. This was the only flight cancelled going to Harrisburg PA.

What a terrible airline. The staff are ignorant and unfriendly the aeroplanes are old and dated looking. I used this airline via 4 separate flights within 1 week and I will never do it again! Even the US Airways ground staff were ignorant and unhelpful. I missed my connecting flight due to standing at Customs (Philly) for 2 hrs and the plane was still at the gate when I finally arrived. However they then told us that the flight was oversold anyway! Then shoved onto standby for the next 2 flights only to be told that they were full and to come back the next morning.

Houston airport was a total mess with people milling around and scrambling for standby options. We had a package of frozen fish we did not care to lose. We would approach the podiums for standby only to be advised the flight was already overbooked. On top of that many flights did not have a crew on the ground and had to await arrival on yet another messed up flight. I feel for the employees.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,D Harvey,United States,2014-07-06,United's poor handling of airline operations and poor customer service led to two cancelled flights and nine hour in the airport on June 30 (ending on July 1 at 3.30am) for my originally scheduled flight #518 from Chicago ORD to Portland OR (PDX). After arriving 3 hours late into ORD on a flight from Munich because of an unscheduled stop in Boston to change pilots I arrived to find flight #518 from ORD to PDX delayed because of a maintenance issue. After three delays two gate changes and three hours the flight was cancelled. I was reassigned to Flight #627 scheduled to depart at 8.25pm. If my original flight had left on time I would have missed the weather delay that started at about 7pm and lasted for an hour or so. The weather delay did mess things up and flights were diverted to wait for the weather to pass. Our incoming plane was diverted to Rockford IL for a ground stop and then never made it to Chicago. We had 7 official delays several noted only after the original delay deadline had passed and then the delay was only another 30 to 45 minutes so not much time to go get food etc. We had 3 gate changes during the process the last of which brought us back to the gate where our plane for Flight #518 was still sitting still with its mechanical problems. Our inbound aircraft never made it no alternative aircraft could be brought to the gate even though there was an alternate aircraft available and the flight crew timed out at just before 2am when they cancelled the flight. They offered a hotel voucher but the closest hotel was 20 miles away. After 26 hours travelling the last nine being at ORD I left for a hotel I had to pay for an hour away in downtown Chicago.

Overall the product is decent for domestic first class. Crew on all 6 legs were generally very friendly and chatty with the passengers (all were DEN or SFO based). They worked the whole 4 hour flight and were constantly refilling glasses. Food was a little bland but was served well along with fresh baked cookies. Problem is inconsistency in on-board products with old CO aircraft having in seat TV and UA aircraft with old overhead monitors. Some aircraft's with WI-Fi and some without which makes it difficult to work.

The aircraft were clean and seemed relatively new. All flights ran early - with the exception on the last one which had a minor 20 minute delay. The US immigration pre-clearance in Dublin was very good. The food was not great but not bad either and the same goes for the inflight service. The wine was unpalatable. IFE on the A330 was great - lots of new films. No IFE on the short flight but this is not expected. All in all - good flights and as expected. Nothing to get excited by.

Maybe the merger with AA is a good thing. Drink service was offered and otherwise FA's walked the aisle a few times for trash. Landing was smooth and great views of Philadelphia. Bus transfer to commuter gates - its strange that if you want to walk to that concourse you have to recheck through TSA but they have a bus transfer that keeps you within security. YQB flight was a CR7 and packed - but FA was nice. Left 20 min late but arrived just 1-2 min late. Overall a nice flight.

United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music. An hour before landing we were offered a snack consisting of a chicken empanda fruit salad cucumber salad and chocolate. We landed 1/2 hour early and were the first off the plane.

US Air was the low cost carrier for this route and it showed. Food was fundamentally inedible but I was grateful to have brought my own. Crews were mostly friendly and helpful. Flight seemed to be a non-stop sales pitch to buy duty free upgraded snacks etc. I thought several times that this unnecessarily disturbed what could have been a serene flight. Had the new Airbus planes both ways. Someone had broken off the tip of their headphones in the receptacle and the poor FA could not remove it even after returning with tweezers. Thus I could not use the AVOD for the entire eight hour flight. US Air got me there mostly on time but this was not a very enjoyable or peaceful experience.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,1
united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,2014-03-17,YQB-ORD on 13 March. One reason for such low rankings is that I never actually ended up on a UA plane. Scheduled to fly out on the non-stop from Quebec City to O'Hare at 8am. The day before UA emails me that the flight is cancelled and they put me on a flight at 11.50am via EWR. Nope - not on United. Online showed the plane from EWR on-time into YQB but it never landed. Around 11.30 am the departure board shows a 3 hour delay for departure. There is not a single UA rep at the gate - and no one ever shows up to tell people what is going on. The pilots and flight attendant who are to work the trip to EWR didn't have any idea and were embarrassed that one heard it was a mechanical problem while the other heard it was weather. Every other airline into YQB was operating on-time or with 10-15 min delays due to snow in Quebec - all but United. I spent over an hour on the phone with my corporate travel trying to get on another flight - the first United agent wouldn't help my travel agent so she called back and got someone else willing to help. I ended up on Air Canada to YUL and then to ORD. Air Canada was fantastic! United - what is wrong with you? I never say never but unless it is mandated I fly on UA I won't do it.

A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means.

Finally we left again and were served 2 tiny cookies. We of course missed our connecting flight in Philly. They threw a voucher at us for a hotel 15 miles away.

On my occasional previous flights with Virgin I'd noticed that they're inferior to Qantas in every way but not by much. Now that I've flown at a peak time I've seen what cost-cutting at check-in does. There was a queue for the small number of self-check-in kiosks (at least one was broken) then you can't drop your own bag like at Qantas so the queue for the measly 4-5 bag drop counters (they kept closing them due to baggage system problems) stretched to the terminal door. There were 5 proper check-in counters so some people took a punt on those being faster than kiosk + bag drop. 30 minutes to check-in should not be expected for a domestic flight (Qantas will take 5 minutes even at peak times). Given the price difference is usually small I'll avoid Virgin at peak times.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,2,2,2,NA,NA,3,0

The seat was pretty comfortable for the first time ever I actually got a decent amount of sleep on the way out and didn't have any problems with legroom or numb bum even when on the return day flight the people in front fully reclined their seats. Though to be fair I do not like the fixed armrest between seats it makes you feel more enclosed. Service on board was good staff kept busy were friendly and very well turned out a credit to their airline really. Food and drinks were served regularly. I do think the food has declined in quality for the main meals. They were a bit lacklustre and the desserts were just not nice I left mine on both legs. What happened to the Gu pots? They were always of a reliable quality why change a winning formula.

I found travelling Virgin slightly confusing - it was sort of trying to be a full- service airline but sort of not. For example because I was travelling on the flexi-fare I was given a bread roll which the person next to me had to buy - not sure the bread roll was worth an extra $700. Available refreshments were basic - would have thought that for a 4 hour flight something more substantial would have been available. For IFE you needed your own tablet just as well I had a good book. Plane was on time was full (as expected) but no delays with luggage in Sydney. In flight service was friendly and quick.

virgin-america,/airline-reviews/virgin-america,Virgin America customer review,J Teoh,Australia,2012-11-09,SAN-SFO-SAN in Main Cabin Select. Flight out was on A319 and flight back was on A320. Both planes were new and clean. Check-in at both airports was fast and easy with priority lanes. Priority lanes for security at both airports provided. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew generally friendly. Ample legroom in MCS with free AVOD food and beverages. No hot meals available on short flights. Mood lighting upon boarding was interesting but definitely made it harder to see seat numbers especially on evening or night flights. Both flights generally on time. Can't comment on luggage delivery as I only had carry-on. Overall a great product and definitely the best domestic US airline out there. It's a shame they don't have their own lounges but they'll probably be my first choice for flights in the US and they offer great value for money too.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,4,4,5,NA,NA,5,1
vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2014-01-21,MEL-SGN-TPE-SGN-MEL with breaks in between various legs for business meetings. I can only say excellent all round. Vietnam Airlines offer close to 5-Star Service in Business Class if my own previous experiences with other airlines are any guide. I found check-in on Vietnam Airlines can occasionally be rather chaotic mainly because so many apparent first time and naive flyers seem to crowd into the business class check-in or boarding areas with their relatives seeing them off and with no idea of accepted boarding processes. Nevertheless on-board food and wine first rate with an amazing 4-choice main menu on some flights which were all on-time unless airport control dictated otherwise. Superb service from extremely well groomed flight attendants. I would prefer more in-flight comment from the flight crew especially as the flight map on some flights was not working. The Business Lounge in Saigon is quite good and adequate with good views of the tarmac and shared lounges (VN Airlines use the Qantas lounge in Melbourne and China Airlines in Taipei) - quite good. My only gripe was that management of in-flight turbulence and warning seemed poor as was the management of some passengers who completely ignored safety instructions (the guy next to me on one sector put his seat into the fully flat bed position during taxiing for take off which would have meant I would not have been able to quickly leave the aircraft in an emergency). However to be fair to the cabin crew they could do little to solve this problem as they were required to be strapped into their crew seats at the same time of take-off anyway. Very good inflight reading on Vietnam Airlines.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1
virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,B Smithson,Australia,2014-09-19,MEL-PER-MEL A330 Coast to Coast Business Class. What a brilliant domestic business class. We were fortunate enough to have the new 2-2-2 configuration both ways and both flights were flawless. Fantastic food excellent seat with plenty of storage fun yet professional crew great IFE and just a really pleasant ambience in the cabin. Everyone was happy to be there – both pax and crew. Crew happily suggested opening a bottle of champagne despite a 9am flight which was a great start to our holiday. Nothing was too much trouble. The dinner main course I had on the return flight was probably the best dish I have ever had on a plane.

Two very enjoyable flights up to international business standard on a domestic service. The VA lounges were comfortable the seat on board was very nice to sit in and the service in both directions was excellent. Both flights arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Only two small complaints: the menu was the same in both directions. From Melbourne I was transferring to an international service in Perth (having a South African Airways codeshare flight on VA).

virgin-america,/airline-reviews/virgin-america,Virgin America customer review,A Skidmore,United Kingdom,2012-07-15,MCO-SFO 7/11/12. Not sure what I was expecting from this flight I guess being English I expect a 5+ hr flight to be treated as long haul and the service to match. Surprised when I saw they were using an A320 on this route by the end of this flight I struggled to straighten out. If you're over 6 feet tall I'd recommend paying for additional leg-room. Other than the leg room the seats were comfortable and the interior of the plane was very trendy. Mood lighting and condensation keeping the cabin relaxed with music whilst boarding gave a relaxing ambience. Entertainment system was impressive with a large range of on demand TV and movies (albeit at a charge). Being able to use the entertainment system throughout taxi take off and landing is a nice sensible approach. WiFi is pretty good and fast seems a little overpriced but it is a very fast service compared to other airlines carrying this feature. Main disappointment was that nowhere on my reservation did it mention there was no meal or snack provided during the flight so having boarded hungry I only managed to last 3 hours before purchasing a meal. Meals come as a large snack box which is very competitively priced at 7 dollars. Free soft drinks is a nice touch but alcohol is overpriced and being able to order drinks on demand from your seat is also handy when you're settled. Generally cabin crew were friendly and the pilot giving his announcement stood in the cabin adds to the edgy nature of end airline. Dressed down uniforms and a relaxed approach is a little different to other airlines but I think Virgin have found a good balance. All in all I would use them again but I wish they'd make a few of the inflight charges more obvious prior to ticket purchase. And 5 hours is a bit too long to be in such a small seat!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,1
virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,M Lau,Australia,2014-07-06,VA 43 Brisbane - Denpasar on 29th June 2014. To be fair the flight was not so bad but I have to agree with other passengers that Virgin should really consider using a larger aircraft for this popular route as the whole journey took 6hours or so. Otherwise it was not bad at all. The seat felt big despite the standard 737 3x3 configuration. There was no inflight entertainment but most passengers had iPad/iPhone/Laptop etc to keep themselves occupied. The inflight magazine was actually quite a good read. The food was mediocre but I was not expecting 5 stars treatment after all so it was OK. FAs were fine. All in all a pleasant flight and will consider booking Virgin again in the future for other routes.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,3,1,NA,NA,4,1

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,J Wyatt,Australia,2014-05-25,I recently had a trip booked and paid for with this airline from Rockhampton to Brisbane. We had plenty of time to get from Rockhampton to Brisbane for our connecting flight to Bangkok. The afternoon before our planned flight Virgin sent a TEXT message stating our flight was changed with no further details provided. When I called Virgin I discovered they had placed us on a much much later flight meaning we would miss our flight to Bangkok by several hours. Virgin made no attempt to rectify this issue. I then had to drive 8 hours to Brisbane and was initially told I would not receive a refund! After over 2 weeks the airline finally contacted me back and told me I was lucky to receive a refund and it would take up to 12 weeks to process this. It has been over 3 weeks since the flight was cancelled (by Virgin) and I am still yet to receive a refund for this flight.

Leg room was generous but the seats were a little thin cramped and short in the legs. The inflight entertainment system was good with a decent sized screen though many options were not available free of charge. Drinks are provides complimentary though no food was provided.

The seats are hard the armrests would not fold up the leg rests dig into your legs when folded up particularly the aisle seats have a metal box underneath them which further limits the leg space. The inflight entertainment either does not work or is very limited. The food is very bad.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,W Coulton,Australia,2014-04-21,PER-SYD-PER Easter long weekend. Both flights A330-200. A330 for the flight to Sydney had a broken APU so had no ground air conditioning until engines started. It was a sauna until 20 minutes into the flight. Obviously old video system individual screens but continuous loop (not AVOD) with poor vision and sound. Food OK and complimentary beer/wine. Return flight much newer A330 with good AVOD. Once again food fine and sufficient along with beer/wine. Significantly less legroom on this aircraft. Check-in for both flights was OK despite being busy days but check-in staff could show some enthusiasm for the job or find another one. The biggest disappointment was the lack of even a casual smile from any of the cabin crew except when first entering each aircraft. After that it was glum faces for the entire flight. The odd smile makes the journey go so much better for both passengers and crew. I normally fly QF but gave VA a go this time based not only on price/schedule but also looking for an alternative to QF for regular travel needs. VA did not stand out as any better than QF I'm afraid.

Virgin America straddles a weird and fairly confusing space between full- service and budget but is surely the most innovative airline in the US. So many simple touches - playing music at check-in captain farewelling passengers and explaining delays at the boarding gate instead of check-in staff ordering food from seat-back screen. The legroom is fine by domestic standards but would be tight internationally. My flight over was without incident but the flight back was cancelled. This is where Virgin America completely fell apart. They could not handle the mess of 180 angry passengers trying to get out of New York. Despite sprinting back to the check-in desk it took them 3 hours to get me a hotel and food voucher and they couldn't tell me when I could fly next but said they would call. They never did and it was up to me to contact them to try and get to LAX. There was no communication - we were not told the ticketing system was down - to us it appeared that they were just incredibly slow taking an hour to process each passenger.

Arrived at the island airport to travel home and the check-in line went out the terminal down the ramp and into the car park. After about 35 minutes we made our way up the ramp and into the check-in area. One person to check-in 150 passengers. I did notice another Virgin staff member coming and going waving a radio around check a passenger or two and then disappear again. We had now been in line for 1.4 hours and it was apparent there was no way this plane was going to leave on time. 30 minutes before scheduled departure the staff member waving the radio around and another staff member arrived and the check in intensity increased. The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crèche. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight. We downloaded the app but alas the entertainment system on board was not working. Being in the 2nd back row the food cart eventually arrives and there is only a few crumbs left that that the other passengers didnt want. All the decent food had gone. Maybe they could start the service at the back of the plane and then move forward or carry enough of the good stuff for all. We were offered a complimentary noodle dish but it was too spicy for the kids. Once the food service was completed they started the rubbish collection I tried to hand over the rubbish to the flight attendant as they passed me but was told to hang onto the rubbish until they got to me later.

Also happened on return. A message at the outset would have been much more helpful. Check in agent at terminal was very jovial and pleasant and seating as requested was honoured. Outbound flight delayed by an hour due to passengers disembarking an AirNas flight. It was not possible to board the Virgin flight as there was insufficient space in the walkways!

Flight OK but I find the Fokker 50s poor and noisy in comparison to the 146s. Overall the same level of mediocrity and couldn't give a stuff attitude that affects so many airlines these days.

Flights were cheap which is why we went via Guadalajara - which is a pleasant airport for a quick layover. Boarding system is among the strangest I've seen - each seat is assigned a group with which to board (1-4) but the group assignment seemed completely arbitrary and not related to place in the cabin as would be expected. Also they make you line up in your group rather than just call one group at a time felt like primary school. Legroom is absolutely horrendous. I'm 6'2 and my knees were banged up against the hard back of the seat in front even before it had reclined. Would have been somewhat forgivable had the seat back not been so hard. The seat itself is also quite uncomfortable. I'd actually say this is probably the worst airline seat I've sat in. Staff are expectedly inattentive for a low cost airline. They're also very inconsistent with their decision to translate from Spanish to English - some announcements are more important than others obviously? The lady next to me on one of the flights ordered the buy-on-board nachos which looked awful (canned cheese plus corn chips) so I didn't bother with any of that.

I do not understand how anyone can say VLM’s food is good you get offered half a brown sandwich in a plastic wrapper or fruit not even both and no plate.

The food wasn't as good as usual tiny portions and fairly overcooked. Good choice of IFE and although the bed lets you get some sleep they seem to be getting harder and harder. Temperature control was cranked right up so it was a hot and sweaty snooze. On the return leg the FAs were friendlier but it seemed quite slow getting drinks served and there was no welcome drink on boarding. I managed a decent night's sleep but breakfast took a while and for once was really unpleasant; undercooked bacon overcooked egg sausage with negligible meat content and baked beans with the highest sugar content known to man. I've had better at motorway service stations! The decaf coffee was served in a mug (nice touch especially as the mug turned out to be made by someone I know) and was fantastic. Reasonable croissant but no hot towels offered. Cabin temperature was better this time. The planes seemed a little tired and the bathrooms were clean but nothing special.

I would happily have paid extra for more/better quality food. I would strongly recommend eating before boarding (as we had). Reasonable drinks selection. Decent range of inflight entertainment but handheld control had one broken button which made it very difficult to select options. Overhead locker space limited due to failure to enforce baggage rules (very large trolley cases allowed on board). Amenity kit blanket and pillow all provided and all decent quality for an economy cabin. I managed to sleep for several hours.

Once on the plane my sister asked if she could go to the back to stand with her 5 month old child to put him to sleep while the plane was loading. The flight attendant said no there was no room so have a seat. After take off passengers were bombarded with merchandise play books (as there was no in-flight entertainment provided) headsets food drinks duty free. You had brief mins. of opportunity to go to the washroom as the aisles were always blocked by carts and you were told to sit down and wait while they finished their task.

I shouldn't have been worried all 4 flights were great. The aircraft's were clean and tidy grey leather seats and colourful headrest covers. The crew were very friendly and polite they moved one of our party who was over 6ft to an emergency exit seat on 3 out of the 4 flights service you don't get on other full service carriers. You do have to pay for drinks and snacks which is common on any low cost carrier. Although Vueling isn't a well known airline in the UK I would certainly book them again without question.

However having travelled to Cluj and back this weekend with them I have to say I was wrong to doubt. For everyone who complains about the luggage charges can I suggest they read the conditions carefully. They are very clear about the size of luggage. I booked priority boarding and extra leg room. Boarded fine got the seats plenty of room. Plane pushed back on both trips dead on time and left without a hitch. Ok the cabins are low cost and no frills - don't expect more but the staff I found to be smart highly presentable professional and assertive with customers who tried to pull a fast one with the seating.

I decided to squeeze things in my bag and not purchase any luggage for the flight. This time WizzAir at airport in Paris Beauvais put a special box before customs and each passenger has to fit its hand luggage in the box.

Purchased extra-legroom seats they were honoured and had loads of space although it should be noted that these seats do not recline so you are also losing some comfort. The return flight was not full and some passengers moved to these seats for free but then again its only 12 euros extra. Flight attendants were young friendly and professional. Flight to Amsterdam left the gate more or less on time but spent 20 minutes taxing to the runway.

Also Monarch have stopped doing teas and coffees in those silly little cups on a tray with the most awful stewed cheap tasting coffee.

My criticism revolves around the food on the flight and the wait times once landed. The food going out was just ok but the return flight food I found totally unacceptable both diner and breakfast. The wait time to get off the plane on arriving after a nine hour flight was over half an hour the excuse given was the airport was too busy to accept us immediately. On the return to Manchester we were also left sitting on the plane for more than half an hour this was due to parking the plane off stand and waiting for buses. The excuse given was the airport was very busy which was obviously not true because we were the only passengers going though passport control. After paying what I feel a premium price for a Virgin flight (a party of 10) it was just not good enough.

Said that they would do their best for a quick de-plane and have us in Denver at 9pm a mere 5 hours after we were supposed to be there. Ten minutes later gate agent announces the flight is cancelled. No explanation. Since we were only taking a two day trip this destroyed the weekend. Then a badly-managed group shuffle to the ticket desk where five Spirit personnel stood around for ten minutes presumably to figure out what they were allowed to say and do. Long story short not much. No vouchers nothing to recompense us for hours waiting and a ruined trip no effort to find us other options beyond ""there's another flight tomorrow"". Just a refund and the ticketing personnel handled the entire situation poorly (or resignedly). When we told people we were flying Spirit to Denver we heard two people say ""Oh no. Bad idea. Get ready for a lot of delays."" We were sure it would be fine. It wasn't and the kicker is that it was ineptly handled. I have had some delays in many years of flying and I understand mechanical issues and weather happen but they are generally handled in a manner that suggests the company would like my business in the future.

Want to print your boarding pass at the airport? $10.00. Want a water on the plane? $5.00. Want to check a bag on the plane? The cheapest that gets is $30 for the first bag and $40 for the second bag but that is only if you can figure out how to sign up online to check bags ahead of time. If you register for checked bags at the airport it now costs $50 per bag. Oh and there is no such thing as a carry-on bag for this airline. If it is bigger than a backpack you have to check it. And if they fail to tell you that your backpack is too big to be considered a ""personal item"" and make you check the bag at the gate? Now it costs $100. If you call their customer service to help you jump through all of these ridiculously complicated hoops you will be on hold for 20 minutes followed by a conversation with a person who refers you to their website where you have already been trying unsuccessfully to register an account.

Big contrast between the first and second legs of the journey. First leg of the journey was surprisingly smooth and comfortable. After queuing in long queues at Ataturk the flight departed on time. The plane was the new B737-900. Surprisingly comfortable seats and beautiful LEDs in the cabin. FAs also spoke very good English. Dismemberment to Terminal D was very efficient but the boarding of passengers on to the Gatwick flight was very long and tiring. Connection time was supposed to be 1hr 55min instead it was over 3hr! The second plane was a B737-300. Incredibly uncomfortable cramped seating and noisy air conditioners. Food was not great either.

lufthansa,/airline-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,Michael Thumm,Germany,2014-12-22,LH431. Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,2,5,4,5,NA,NA,4,1
thomas-cook-airlines,/airline-reviews/thomas-cook-airlines,Thomas Cook Airlines customer review,Kevin Coote,United Kingdom,2013-09-24,Without doubt the worst airline I have had the misfortune of flying with. I have recently had a fantastic holiday in Mexico the only downside was the flights. Outbound I managed to pay for the premium seats no problem with these comfortable and roomy but homeward bound only extra legroom seats were available.No problem with the legroom but the seats are ridiculously small and narrow. I can only compare the width to that of a child's car seat. Uncomfortable hard and so narrow that to get comfortable is impossible. It would appear that Thomas Cook have tried to cram in as many seats as possible and ignored the comfort of its passengers. On a long haul flight of 10 hours it can only be right that you would expect a degree of comfort but with Thomas Cook forget it. I and I would expect others would willingly pay a little more especially on long haul flights just to not be crippled by the time the flight is over. Virgin and several other airlines have got it right and I for one will never fly with this cattle herding shower again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,1,4,4,3,NA,NA,0,0

First flight was good with an on time departure reasonably friendly cabin crew staff and a decent and comfortable journey. However from our stop in Koln/Bonn the trip deteriorated. We were segregated into a small area of the airport with very little to do see or even eat/shop. The second flight was 45 minutes late and had some of the most miserable cabin staff I have ever experienced. I wasn't even offer a drink to purchase.

The plane was dirty with rubbish on the floor and in the back of seats chewing gum stuck to the side of the chair.

Both flights departed on time and arrived early. Cabin clean but a little dated. No personal in-flight entertainment systems even though it was a 20-hour journey. Crew got the job done but did not go beyond that - spoke limited English. Meals served did not always correspond to time (whether at the origin or the destination) - on my flight from Singapore to Shanghai a full meal of rice/noodles was served 2 hours into take-off at 2am and no breakfast was served even though the flight was scheduled to land at 6am. Similarly the 14-hour flight from Shanghai to JFK only saw 2 meals served 2 hours after take-off and 2 hours before landing. Stereotypical airline food served somewhat tasteless but is not inedible. Best to bring your own food on board if you (1) are not inclined towards Chinese food (2) are picky or (3) are easily hungry. Toilets were clean. Many passengers (especially on the Shanghai-JFK leg) were loud and pushy.

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S Wahl,United States,2014-06-10,The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft. The main difference was that none of these trips included United Airlines and Denver International Airport.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Why can't the Tiger staff give us this information so at least we can put our minds at ease? People just want to know what is going on. This is just poor customer service and totally unacceptable!

aerolineas-argentinas,/airline-reviews/aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,Blair McRae,Australia,2012-10-08,We flew on direct flights Sydney to BA return in September 2012 - the attraction of a lower business class fare than competitors and a direct flight swayed us into trying the airline. The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,3,4,4,1,NA,NA,5,1

There are no internet cafes in Sliema Malta so thought would print off boarding pass at machine at the airport. On arriving at Malta airport 2 hours 20 minutes before my flight a particularly grumpy Ryanair agent took up 10 minutes of my time telling me I was too late and should have done this in Malta (How exactly if there are no internet cafes and you do not stay in a hotel?) before finally pointing me towards the computer where I could do this. This touchscreen computer was slow and unresponsive and so I was 2 minutes late to meet the 2 hour deadline because of this woman's complete lack of customer service. An EUR 140 fee and a horrible stressful end to the holiday. What gets me is that I knew I had to print the boarding pass off 2 hours before and made a fair effort to do so leaving 20 minutes to do this on arrival at the airport. I noticed Lufthansa had dedicated machines clearly visible for this purpose. I had to beg this woman to tell me where was the Ryan Air machine before she pointed it out to me all the while telling me I was too late etc when I still had time. However reading other reviews it looks as if even if I had been at the airport much earlier that the fee might still have been charged.

Inflight service was the usual Little Red complimentary offer and was again nice to be offered a Tiger Beer and Tyrell Crisps which was part of the joy last time - the additional round of Love Hearts distributed was a nice touch too! Staff on both outbound and inbound flights friendly and attentive outbound my seat had been changed from the seats I pre-selected online flight wasn't full however and staff were happy for me to move to another empty row by a window. Inbound flight was on an Aer Lingus branded plane substituted for a faulty VS one which was fine although that plane did look a bit tired - I think if anything Aer Lingus should learn a thing or too from running this service on behalf of Virgin and the polish and joy that they manage to pull off - if they applied it to their own service I think they would be to an industry leading product especially by European airline standards which have lacked somewhat in comparison to their Middle- Eastern and East Asian counterparts. Once again however Aer Lingus staff should given a massive pat on the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic - Purser on my Inbound flight was the same gentlemen as the last time I went to Edinburgh and his enthusiasm and attentiveness should be commended. I am still not enamoured by Heathrow but do appreciate the improved Terminal 2 and on this occasion it wasn't such a bad experience due to it being particularly a quiet time during the day.

Relatively new plane with comfortable flat bed seats and a good entertainment system. Good selection of movies.

turkish-airlines,/airline-reviews/turkish-airlines,Turkish Airlines customer review,C Watson,Switzerland,2013-10-20,"GVA-IST-KTM return. Inconsistency is the hallmark of Turkish Airlines. It was very nice to have free drinks a nice dinner and an in-flight movie (screens above the seats) on a 3 hour European flight. However on the next leg to Kathmandu there was no seat-back IFE and when they played the movie you got English in one ear and Turkish in the other. (I would have liked a movie to block out the sound of the 3 infants near my seat.) On the way back there were seat back screens all the way even on the short-haul flight back to Geneva. The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation. On some sectors the pilots didn't address the passengers at all and other times they did. Finally the complementary tour of Istanbul for transit passengers (including food) is a nice touch. Clearly Turkish have the right idea they just need to standardise their product.",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,3,5,4,NA,NA,4,1

Entertainment was old drop down TV but that wasn't a problem as slept and read. Food and beverages plentiful and served at regular intervals on our 11 hr flight. If flying with them they are very strict on stored and cabin luggage weight which we think is great as people bring on far too much cabin luggage. We witnessed many people having to re-pack or pay the excess fee which is very expensive. This problem is well documented on reviews so we were well aware of this before we booked with Condor so had no problems at all. Condor was very helpful with obtaining our Visa for Cuba which we purchased at their counter at check-in time. Check-in desk was easy to find at the Frankfurt airport after arriving by train.

They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits.

Generally a good flight with excellent service good food and fantastic entertainment. The big downside is the new seat / bed. This has been ineptly designed and suffers from several really irritating issues that should have been resolved before it was rolled out. The seat is wide and has no side or lumbar support so whatever position you adopt it is not good for the back and not comfortable. The armrest to one side contains the table and a a small locker. Both are opened by pushing down. As these are exactly where your arm naturally rests they keep popping up which is annoying. When flipped over into bed mode the mattress is very hard. You have to lie at a diagonal angle due to restricted length and this is not comfortable. A further problem is that seat belt when in bed mode is an inertia reel seat belt - it is far too sensitive so if you turn onto your side or at least try too it locks and stops you turning and then you have to stop again very gently pull it out before completing the turn. It is nearly a great seat and bed but suffers from too many basic flaws which could and should have been spotted and resolved by the designer. Disappointing.

Prices were incredibly good, however they do fluctuate day to day so make sure you check dates around when you'd like to fly - they may be a lot cheaper on other days. The only drawbacks was getting through check ins on the flight back. We ended up being separated on the plane which, with me being a nervous flyer, didn't bode well. Also the queues for check in at Keflavik were rather long even though we were effectively just dropping our bags off. On the whole though, excellent!

In January, the delay was due to ""insufficient crew"" this time, the almost 1.5 hour delay was due to ""awaiting aircraft"". This flight had incredibly cramped seats that are hard and have almost no recline. The pocket in fron of the seat was very low on the seat in front so that when I put my book in the pocket it bulged out so much that I had to keep my knees apart. The entertainment is only for a $7.99 fee per person, and there was only one offer of a four ounce cup of a liquid for the entire 3.5 hour flight.

china-eastern-airlines,/airline-reviews/china-eastern-airlines,China Eastern Airlines customer review,Seet Adrian,Singapore,2015-03-28,I flew on two domestic sectors KMG-JHG JHG-KMG and one international sector KMG-SIN. Domestic flight was interesting. I checked into the Domestic Skyteam Elite counter at Kunming Airport and gave them my Garuda Gold card (Skyteam Elite). They had never seen the card nor heard of the airline before. Thank goodness I could speak Mandarin and understood the question the counter staff was asking another puzzled colleague and could tell them it was an Indonesian carrier within the Skyteam. After checking in for me she tagged my luggage with priority baggage handling which was only accorded to Skyteam Elite Plus members but hey I wouldn't complain. The one hour flight from KMG to JHG was short. It was operated on a B737-200 which was relatively comfortable on the second row of the economy cabin. I had the aisle seat and slept through the flight. There was no personal IFE on board. Water and a packet of candies were distributed as you boarded the aircraft. On my flight back from JHG-KMG I had the same puzzled look from the check in counter staff about my Garudamiles Gold card. The Skyteam/Business Class counter was not open which was strange. The domestic queues for economy class was long. Flew the B737-300 and the aircraft had a slightly newer configuration than the flight from KMG-JHG. It was a full flight and the crew were just busy trying to get every one on board. Flight was okay. Same bottled water and a pack of candies as you board. For the KMG-SIN International leg we had to clear immigration at KMG and collect our luggage. Get out of airside and proceed to landside departures to check in. Checked into the business class counter as there were only two counters and which every was empty served me. Again had to explain to them about Garudamiles. Flew on an A320. The best configuration and seat comfort with blankets provided. Before departure a cabin crew came to me and spoke to me in Mandarin welcoming me as a Skyteam Elite member and offered me a bottle of water and politely told me to speak to any of the crew members should I need anything. Thought that was a pretty cool gesture to recognise the Skyteam Elite members even for the lower of the two premium tiers. There was no individual IFE but there were screens on board which you could watch Just for Laughs without the sound. Earpieces were not provided but given the flight was at 1045pm scheduled to arrive into Singapore at 2am I slept through most of the flight. The supper was just a box of bun and cake some peanuts and water. You could ask for other beverages which I got an orange juice. This flight carried only 60 passengers and i was fortunate to get the fourth row of three seats in the single aisle aircraft all to myself with room to stretch. Overall I would fly China Eastern again. That's also because I speak some Mandarin and it was easier to communicate with the crew who were always polite.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,4,4,0,0,NA,NA,5,1

However on my return flight from Ottawa a week later I was back in economy seating as I had purchased economy for both inbound and outbound but when I sat down I had to squeeze myself into the seat. This has never been a problem before and I was sitting at the bulkhead on the 737-6 so I requested to move from a flight attendant. I am 6'4"" so flights have always been a little tight but this was like nothing I have experienced.

Not sure what happened to QR this evening but from the start it is not what one expects from this carrier. My last four trips with QR including this one have entailed lengthy business class check-in waits at IAD. Why can't QR at IAD have enough dedicated business class check-in counters to manage the flow of checking-in passengers in a way that prioritizes high yield customers? Waiting 30 minutes to check-in from the business class line while watching economy class passengers who arrived well after me breeze up to the counter is just not acceptable. QR needs to look at this seriously. This isn't the first time I've encountered this while checking in for this flight at IAD. The flight left early. Turbulence early on delayed the dinner service. However once it started the left aisle of the business cabin was on to their second course before passengers on the right aisle even had a drink. The purser should ensure consistency throughout the cabin. The FA working in my aisle asked if she could clear my service items before I'd even been served the main course. I informed her that I hadn't had dinner yet. When ordering appetizers I was told that one of my appetizer selections might not be available as many other passengers had ordered the same thing. Really? The business cabin is not full and I'm in row 3. My main course for the dinner a lamb shank with root vegetables was entirely under-whelming. When put in front of me the sauces were congealed. Once I started to eat it it was only tepidly warm. The purser came around and asked me how my meal was and I told her it was not hot and that it looked like it had been sitting for a while. I got a nice smile and an I'm sorry Sir but no offer to have it re-heated or replaced. What particularly irked me was that just minutes after take-off the purser went around the cabin summarily closing everyone's window shades. A hand appeared from the row behind me to close the window that I was looking out of at that moment admiring the night time view of New York. There's lots of time remaining just after take off on a night-time transatlantic flight for FAs to go around the cabin and discretely close the window shades before sunrise. Believe it or not some passengers may want to see the night-time lights of New York Boston Halifax or St. John's. If they want to close all the shades early on in the flight they can at the least ask passengers if they want their shades drawn rather than just briskly machine-like marching around the cabin closing them. Passengers typically chose window seats for a reason. Sorry QR not one of your better days.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,6,5,3,3,4,NA,NA,4,1
eva-air,/airline-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,P Heath,Australia,2011-09-10,BNE-LHR return Premium Laurel Class. We chose EVA on the basis of ticket pricing and were not disappointed. Whilst we found the website less than helpful we did find dealing through a travel agent was the way to go. You must accept that the trip will take a little longer however the planes are modern and the seating arrangement the same as the more expensive airlines. In Premium Laurel Class the seats whilst a little hard are good and leg room ample. We found that by placing a pillow at the small of the back we got good a good sleeping position which allowed 10 hrs of good rest over each of the forward and return trips. Food was very good and drinks readily available. The best part is the attention that is afforded by the cabin staff who are most attentive and contributed to a very comfortable experience.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

However the overall experience was disappointing. Seats have three positions: upright slight recline and flat bed. Upon request the flight attendant will reposition the seat into a bed and provide a duvet and coverlet with pillow. The bed is satisfactory for sleeping but it is not possible to readjust to a seating position without vacating the seat and removing the linen. The entire configuration is uncomfortable and impractical. When the seat is configured to a flat bed reading and watching TV is near impossible. A far better seat would allow the passenger to readjust the bed to a comfortable recline which would permit reading watching TV or eating which is the case with most other carriers.

No-one took responsibility to help with onward travel plans that were now destroyed. Meals not great (not enough food to ensure your choice was met). Movies poor choice.

It was a short notice trip as such I had no checked luggage so I can't comment on that. My seat was 2A on both legs of the trip. The seat is a normal economy class seat though the pitch is only marginally better than in economy class and definitely much worse than in exit row. Seat comfort was the same as Swiss economy which is to say not great at all. The food consisted of a regional Swiss vegetarian dish and a standard chicken dish with a nice dessert. Portions were small cutlery etc was good though. I paid a fairly low price for my semi-flexible (mid of the range) D class ticket. The value is pretty good if you need to carry a lot of baggage as you may check in 2 times 32kg and carry on 2 times 8kg. In comparison to other airlines such as Turkish airlines business class in Swiss is not ideal. Service quality was unexpectedly blunderous with an almost overly friendly cabin chief and a totally inadequate business class FA who couldn't even recall whether alpha is on port or starboard and was desperately searching for some imaginary economy class guest who may have been lost in business class (why anyone would attempt that on Swiss in Europe is a mystery to me - though it's possible as an accident since the seats in business and economy are identical).

Flight on time outbound and return with efficient boarding at LGW although free for all at Windhoek; however crew curt to the point of being rude except for one female cabin attendant on return leg. Food barely edible especially going out. Seats have plenty of leg room but are uncomfortable as the lumber bars do not work. Some problems with the heating - cold going out and excessively hot on return. IFE very basic largely with third rate films. Business lounge in Windhoek too small as a number of largish flights to CPT and JNB all going at at same time as LGW flight.

royal-brunei-airlines,/airline-reviews/royal-brunei-airlines,Royal Brunei Airlines customer review,K Pascoe,Australia,2013-10-10,My Husband and I travelled from Melbourne to Hong Kong with a stop over in Brunei. The staff on the 7ish hour flight from Melbourne to Brunei were lovely. They constantly came around with drinks and were happy to hand out blankets and pillows. Plus they handed out peanuts. The only problem was that the headphones they supplied wouldn't go into the plugs in the armrest but I used my own with no problems. The flight was great one of the best I have been on. Entertainment is a little limited if you compare it to someone like Emirates but it is a cheaper airline. Provided good movie choices some TV and music and some games. Flights from Brunei to Hong Kong and back again were on smaller older planes. They still served a full meal despite it being a much shorter flight and the entertainment was drop down overhead TV's. I don't have a problem with this on the shorter flights and usually take my own entertainment anyway. On the return flight to Melbourne it was an overnight flight. Blankets weren't provided but handed out when people asked. They were also around quite frequently with drinks and I had no complaints on the food either. I am vegetarian and am a little hard to please but I was quite pleased. No problems with the toilets on board. Clean whenever I went and I couldn't smell them at any time. Only complaint was of course the bathroom facilities in the Royal Brunei terminal in Brunei. Terrible! My suggestion would be to use the ones in the shower rooms as they were a bit cleaner. Would fly with Royal Brunei again no problems!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

This is the second time we've used this airline the first being Business Class to and from Australia from London last year. Our overall feelings? The reputation of the airline as 'the best' seems to us to reflect (if true) on how bad other airlines must be though our experience of Emirates flights London/Melbourne have always been better. We had ample airmiles for upgrade on one leg back but were told these classes were 'sold-out' which on observation passing the seats on exit was patently not the case! The Etihad seats for a tall man like me are a nightmare no way to get a headrest into high position to rest head. The space is confined and restrictive. Although Silver Guest card holders we were never advised that we could book actual seats well before the 24 hour on line service. Whilst many of the aircrew really are very nice some are poor at communicating. The food? Well this time much worse than before mostly inedible and boring. I'm afraid we feel this airline is terribly overrated and will never travel with them again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,3,1,2,NA,NA,1,0

air-mauritius,/airline-reviews/air-mauritius,Air Mauritius customer review,Y Limalia,Mauritius,2014-01-14,Recently travelled to India on an Air Mauritius flight back and fro on MK748 and MK 749 respectively. However I am very disappointed by the services offered on board. I travelled together with my spouse and infant of less than 2 years old. On departure on 27th December we requested a baby cot (ticket booked on 11th November 2013 - more than a month before) and on check-in same was requested again and approval obtained. However to our disappointment we did not get one on board. The reason given was that the baby was too big for the cot and the weight was too heavy. The infant weighs: 10.3 kg and his height is 73 centimetres. The crew did not even bother to check if the infant fits the cot or not but bluntly refused. We had to hold a crying baby whole night which not only disturbed us but we had an earful from other passengers. On our return (10th Jan 2014) same scenario. Despite request no infant cot and even worse we did not have a front seat to handle a baby. Instead we were put on a seat with other seats in front which was really uncomfortable. I and my spouse had to carry the infant whole night. There was another couple who benefited from a cot and we tried it on my infant and he fits perfectly well. In fact we had more rooms than expected. When I told the cabin crew they told me that you are not in a front seat and hence cannot give you one now. (The irony is that a cot was requested and approved at Check-in in Mumbai). We did not even get an infant meal on both trips. The service we got on the flight was very disappointing and frustrating. I am frequent traveller on Air Mauritius and as from now I will rather use other carriers for my overseas trip be it personal or business related.

On trying to book in there was a long queue which did not move. No announcements were made and eventually another passenger told us the computer system was down. The ground crew were exceptionally rude and our party was split despite having reserved seats before we left the UK. The cabin crew were almost invisible. They disappeared to their rest area shortly after serving the meal. Call bells were ignored. When they did appear they were disinterested and barely polite. The meal was unappetising.

The flight to Shanghai was canceled due to airport facility problem and stranded passengers were taken to a hotel. Around 0:00 AM we were suddenly required to depart and took a flight to Kunming. We arrived at Kunming around 2:30 AM. The airport staff said the passengers to wait in a hotel until the alternative flight to Shanghai which departed at 10:00 AM. However they said I (and another passenger) had to take another flight which departed at 9:00am and did not give us a hotel room. Instead they took us a dirty smelly office and said us to sleep there. Since the only one sofa was occupied by the other passenger I had no place to sleep other than the floor. I complained about the change and requested a decent place to sleep but they were just saying ""No"" and did nothing except saying I was not the only one who had no room and what I could do was to wake up an employee and ask him to share his room or sleep on arrayed chairs. I tried to get a room by myself but the nearest hotel was full and they said there was no taxi or bus in the midnight. I was forced to spend the night on a dirty hard floor while the others were sleeping in a hotel. Of course I was not able to sleep at all and felt sick.

No mention of needing to pre-book ipads. The inflight magazine even advertised to contact your friendly flight attendant if you would like to hire an ipad. We couldn't find a friendly flight attendant and they had no ipads available for anyone who hadn't pre-booked and paid at the time of ticketing. We even had looked on the website a few days before the flight and pre-ordered the comfort package (which was useless) and there was no mention of pre-booking ipads. Approx. 75% of the plane load did not have ipads and many like us wanted them so we were not the only passengers enduring the boring flight. Does Jetstar think it is acceptable to provide zero entertainment for an 11 hour flight? We did not pre-book the food package as we were of the opinion that we could buy food on board. Unfortunately most of the available food options were poor and ran out less than half way down the plane in the first serving (we were near the back). No pies no ham and cheese toasties. The male flight attendant was somewhat rude to a number of passengers and not sympathetic at all just saying you needed to pre-book. Perhaps they were just as bored and frustrated as the passengers. I would assume Jetstar wants to make as much money as possible and this would include hiring as many ipads as possible and selling as much food as possible to bored and hungry passengers?

As mentioned in many other reviews here there was an extremely long check-in queue with only two check-in desks open. The flight was over an hour delayed in departing. This was followed by a very long delay in luggage retrieval at Gatwick which to be fair might be more the disorganisation of Groundforce. Return flight on the 27th was appalling. I was probably one of the first people to check-in so did not know there was no inflight service available until we had been in the air for almost an hour. I had to virtually beg for a cup of water. What I would like to know is how TAP thinks it can hold on to its share of the market in this way. The Star Alliance has given them a huge advantage by using the names of other well-reputed airlines to sell tickets but I warn other to ensure that their Lufthansa flight is not run by Tap Portugal because the flight I took on that occasion was the worst flying experience I had ever had.

Luggage did not make the flight was given the option to wait have it delivered the following day or to come collect it the following day our self. We decided to wait as we were told it was on another flight that was due to land within 45mins and we needed things from our suitcase that night. We waited over 2 hours for our luggage. During the wait we were told we would receive vouchers for some food/coffee. The vouchers were valued at $5 but this late at night no restaurants were serving main meals anymore. When we checked in to this flight  we paid extra to choose our selected seats. When we checked in we were told that we would not be sitting together we showed our receipt which had our seat numbers on it but that was completely ignored. Flight from OOL-SYD was due for take off at 12.30 pm did not leave until around 1.10-1.15 pm. On the return flight my chair did not recline this seat was broken. Will never fly with Tiger again.

Assigned a bulkhead seat from MUC-PEK. Legroom is therefore excellent. Cabin crew spoke very poor English and showed little enthusiasm. The food is nothing extraordinary - portions were small and bland. IFE is AVOD with a reasonable section. PEK-HKG operated by a wet-leased Air Macau A320 - no IFE same mechanical service and poor food options. Service on return leg was mediocre.

allegiant-air,/airline-reviews/allegiant-air,Allegiant Air customer review,Meghan Oatman,United States,2015-07-28,"My family and I have flown with Allegiant Air at least two or three times a year from Cincinnati to Orlando/Sandford (back and forth) for several years now. Until Friday July 24 2015, our complaints have been minimal and at most had delayed departures because the planes weren't there yet! However, as of Friday July 24 2015, my family and I will no longer be flying Allegiant. We had an early flight out (6.45am), had checked in the night before, and arrived at 6.00am to depart as the airport is so small, it never takes more than 10 minutes to check in and get to gate. We couldn't find any signage indicating where to check bags through for Cincinnati and simply got in a line curbside because I had five days earlier experienced the same thing when dropping my son off to fly same route and had been directed there for checking his bag. We got in a fairly slow, long line and just as we reached the check-in attendant, after having been interrupted several times, she made the announcement baggage check in to Cincinnati, and several other cities was inside! We go back inside the Allegiant terminal, get in another line only to find out as we approached counter, we're told baggage check for Cincinnati was in Terminal A and pointed to a different area (one we never knew existed)! The attendant then tells us the flight just closed and we'd have to find another flight home and the fees would be $75 each person to do so. We explained we'd been there in lines trying to figure out where we were to check in and saw no indication Cincinnati was in Terminal A. To top it all off, the flight we were supposed to be on that closed at 6.10 had a thirty minute delayed departure. Had we known prior to arriving, we were to go to a different check in terminal, I would not be wasting my time sharing my negative review. We will be back to using sky miles again which is most likely less expensive in the long run as discount airlines like this one seem to nickel and dime customers anyway!",NA,FamilyLeisure,Economy,Orlando/Sandford to Cincinnati,1,3,3,2,NA,1,NA,1,0

During the past the service has been getting better and better. Some irritants during flights such as flight attendants bumping in to your elbows (aisle seats) or waking you up for meals have disappeared. Meals have got better. The old 757 interiors are being renovated. Long flights know offer personal entertainment systems for each person in Economy. All the ticket prices have been reasonable though it is hard to build up miles with Air Astana's Nomad Club. That is one complaint I have with Air Astana. With most airlines I would have gotten free upgrades by now. Many of Air Astana's low fares exclude you from accumulating frequent flier miles. I hope this changes in the future.

NB: no noise cancelling headsets (or sleeper suits/pyjamas) so if this is important to you bring your own. If space on a budget is what you want I think Sri Lankan will please.

Qantas lounge in Melbourne is a dark dungeon and not particularly worth the visit. Boarding was pain free although cabin crew were not well versed when it came to assisting parents with two young children. In most cases on all flights I found all cabin crew friendly but unable to take the initiative to offer services. in most cases if you wanted something you had to ask instead of being offered. These were not lazy crew, they worked hard but they were just not polished crew used to premium service. First of the two business class cabins is the better of the cabins as it feels more spacious and open. Seats are lay flat and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is lacking with random titles from the 80's and not much more if you select the Hollywood option. Hamad Intl is great and the lounge is huge and fantastic. No one explains the options available to you and your left wondering what's on offer. Great flights and great lounges in Doha and London. Food is exceptional bit staff need more training though not because they disgruntled. One incident did concern me though. The A380 has a inflight bar which on one flight was serving up excessive amounts of alcohol to two passengers who subsequently were almost restrained in their seats by crew.

The food was good and the service was friendly. The seats don't allow much leg room and they seem a bit narrow but we managed. The real problem is with the Condor staff that check you in and I would give them a 1 out of 10. The web-site did not allow us to pre-select our seats from Canada so we went to the airport early so we could get window seats. We were the 2nd people in line when the wicket opened and when we asked for a window seat the woman said that they had all been assigned online. We told her that because we were the 2nd people in a line of hundreds we were hoping she might be able to switch our seats. She said no. There was no smile no apology - nothing - just a flat no. And our experience back to Canada was just as bad. It took almost 2 hours for the check-in. The lines were incredibly long and while waiting to board I must have heard six different passengers complain that they had to pay 20 Euro for each kilo their carry-on bag was over the 6kg limit. One person said that they would gladly throw out the chocolate they were bringing home for their children but were told that it was too late and they would have to pay 60 Euro penalty. And of course we were sitting in the middle section again. But the young pregnant woman sitting beside us was not even allowed to sit with her husband. They told her they would not try to find any seats together for them so she spent the 10 hour flight alone. Would I fly Condor again - not on your life!

This last 3 months I have flown from Auckland to Los Angeles last month on Virgin this week on Air New Zealand. The problem flying Virgin is that I need a stop in Sydney having said that the fare is a good price the service between Auckland and Sydney and Sydney and Los Angeles was good - very good. On the return I had to fly Virgin to Sydney but an Air New Zealand code share between Sydney and AKL that was the down part of the journey. Narrow seats tatty aircraft pay for a meal pay for everything - the complete opposite of the similar virgin segment on the outward journey. I figured it was because it was a transtasman that Air New Zealand treat passengers like cattle and nickel and dime them but this last trip I decided to go Auckland-LAX direct. Air New Zealand charge $300 more than their rivals you get 1 bag unlike Virgin where you get 2 the plane is dirty the cabin crew are ok a couple were a little off hand to the person in the seat beside me no blanket no eye cover no little pack of toothpaste.

Departure flight delayed 2.5 hrs but the update online is too late was already stuck at the airport. For return flight I checked with Sunwing reps at hotel many times of the morning we suppose to leave still said on time until noon that day however when we get to airport at 1pm we learnt that flight was delayed 2.5 hrs. The airline must have know that the incoming flight was delayed at the other end. After waiting 5 hrs at the assigned gate 17 suddenly sign on the screen is gone no announcement nothing communicated until one of passenger asked the rep at the gate she learnt that the gate was changed to 14 instead of 17. Another hour passed by still no update no info and suddenly we see all the run around from the flight crew to pilot to the reps and flight is cancelled. Now we have to wait another hour to take luggage back out another 2 hrs to check in at a dirty hotel for the night. The next afternoon we had to line up to check luggage back in re-issue another boarding pass and the system doesn't know that our flight has been cancelled so none of us can get any pass another 2 hrs in line for nothing until they have to write boarding pass by hand!

One of the cheapest choices. First off the Pro's: The service is excellent and the staff friendly and helpful. It felt like any request could be met and I saw myself and other passengers receive such. The food was good but not as good as I hoped. Don't sit in the middle of the plane as your choice from the menu will have run out. Cons: Plane seemed clean but a little old and the seat was uncomfortable. There are boxes underneath the window seats and some inner seats so stretching your legs was impossible. The entertainment system is awful for today's age presenting around a small choice 5 Hollywood movies plus some foreign ones and TV but you cannot pause them or restart. So choose one film at the start and that's it. 2 of the screens I looked at didn't work and a 3rd had bad audio.

It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel.

They offered a padded mattress (duvet) to some passengers but not to me. For the most part I was ignored. The Inflight Service Manager introduced herself at the beginning of the flight then disappeared for the remainder of the flight. The cabin crew delivers the meal then hides in the galley. They ran out of Heineken beer about 2 hours into a 16 hour flight. Don't get me wrong…the flight is not awful. The seat really is big. They serve 1 can of caviar Krug champagne Johnny Walker Blue and so on but how much of that do you really consume?

After reading so many negative reviews my expectations were very low and I was dreading the experience as I had never flew business class before apart from Jetstar business. Having said this we were pleasantly surprised at the service food and the cabin. Both flights were without a doubt the best trip I've had. Comfortable beds totally lie flat in Airbus around 30 in business class so it was extremely quiet and personal. Toilets were always clean FA were attentive whilst they may have had difficult in speaking fluent English we got by. Inflight entertainment was the only drawback in terms of selection not up to date movies but nonetheless there was something you could see. As this was a night trip I enjoyed the sleeping arrangement more. We had a layover in Beijing to break the trip. The other leg to London plane was newer and business class had about 80 people so I think the attentiveness from FA was a little less but that's understandable again food bed and toilets were great. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Air China I would certainly fly with them again.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,10,5,4,4,3,NA,NA,5,1
aer-lingus,/airline-reviews/aer-lingus,Aer Lingus customer review,N Francis,United Kingdom,2014-08-28,NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish.

Normally we would have taken an Air New Zealand flight, but flights all full and we had a time dealing to get to Wellington. Cramped seating, and sub standard service from start to finish pretty much sums up this awful excuse for an airline. Qantas must be ashamed to have an association Jetstar. We get to Wellington and in a rush to make a function and in true Jetstar form, no bags arrive off the conveyor. After almost 20 minutes and about 40 plus customers all standing about awaiting bags, several customers like myself started making approaches to Jetstar. Apparently the machine that unloads luggage from the plane is broken and they didn't have another. Made worse because they were too cheap to hire one from Air NZ to get the plane unloaded. 50 minutes later customers were starting a small riot wanting to know what was going on. Jetstar never made any PA announcements, nor did they apologise when we finally got luggage 1.25 hours after the flight landed. They aren't a cheap airline to fly on anyway. By the time you buy a ticket, then a meal, pay extra for a bag etc, you could have purchased an economy ticket on another airline and had all the extras for free and excellent service.",NA,FamilyLeisure,Economy,Auckland to Wellington,1,1,2,1,NA,1,NA,1,0

Air Canada's flight arrival and departure times to Lima have always been inconvenient-arriving in Lima well after midnight, if the flight is on time, and departures for the return flight to Toronto leaving Lima at around 2 am. I returned to Canada from Lima on Air Canada in April. For my June flights regular Air Canada economy service is no longer available, only Rouge. Rouge is simply awful, unacceptable. The seats in Air Canada Rouge economy are the worst I have experienced in more than 40 years of international flying. They are narrow, with limited leg room and thin padding. The flight to Lima was bearable as I didn't try to sleep. The flight back was intolerable. Falling asleep in the seat resulted in back problems. I will not take Air Canada Rouge in the future if I can possible avoid it. There is no regular inflight entertainment system, the food was awful, although not necessarily worse than normal economy, and drinks cost extra. For entertainment you can supply your own mobile device and use the inflight service, if you don't have a device you can rent an ipad for $10.

gulf-air,/airline-reviews/gulf-air,Gulf Air customer review,P Weeren,Oman,2014-10-22,Mediocre at best. I live in the Middle East in Oman. The national carrier Oman Air is consistently ranked among the best and its product is very good when compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. Unfortunately however that ranking seems to have gone to Oman Air's head lately and they have not only increased prices dramatically but are apparently also considering cutting a lot of the services and features that have made them a stand out in a field of also-rans. Because they are above what I can afford for last minute leisure trips I chose to fly Gulf Air to London on the routing MCT-BAH-LHR early this month. The pricing is very competitive and their website originally showed me a wonderful pair of flights that would have only meant a short layover of under two hours in Bahrain. Once the payment screen had been completed however I received ticketing on two flight sets that incorporated a 9.5 hour layover in Bahrain on the way to London and a 7.5 hour layover on the return trip. Amazingly while I was lured in with such a terrific original offer I was now going to be spending nearly one day of my break in Bahrain's mediocre International Airport (and in that facility's mediocre Dilmun Lounge - see separate review). At Muscat we were delayed in boarding and is usual with many Middle Eastern airlines no reason was given for the delay - it just was. Boarding the A320 for Bahrain legroom was quite adequate at 34 inches of pitch I had experienced this on previous short-haul flights with Gulf Air and therefore thought they might be just the ticket to avoid rival Oman Air's new inflationary price structure. After landing at Bahrain International and a lengthy stay in the wildly overpriced Dilmun Lounge I boarded the leg for LHR and was amazed that on an A330 any airline would tighten the seat pith to a measly 31 inches which made for a 7 hour torture ride. Luckily on that leg I had a short row (two seats) to myself and was able to mitigate the pain a little. Sadly Gulf Air has revamped its A330s with new leather seats from Recaro arguably the worst airline seat maker out there. Each of their seats on any aircraft features rough Philips-head screws at precisely where my knees are forced to contact the seat in front of me as I am rather tall and have long legs - sheer torture. If the person in front of me then reclines things are beyond the pale of bearable. Again the flight was delayed and of course there was no explanation of any kind. Gulf Air needs to pull up its socks in terms of food service. While the food was excellent there was precious little of it - only one meal service barely two beverage services and nothing more on an intercontinental price. No comfort packet with eye masks no direly needed ear plugs nothing more. Basically the return trip was the same in reverse although push-back from Heathrow was on the dot. Will I fly Gulf Air again? Probably yes but I'll try to limit it to short haul which is their vastly superior product.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,2,3,3,3,NA,NA,4,1

These flights and the return in March were booked with Trailfinders UK in summer 2013. Seats were requested on the LHR-AUH flights both ways but seats on the AUH-HKT sectors could not be requested as it was operated under a code share agreement with an Etihad partner Air Berlin. The day before departure I visited the online check-in site at the permitted -24 hours to find seats on the first sector had been allocated window and aisle as requested. There was a very limited option for change so it had been well worthwhile requesting at booking. However second sector seats were allocated as 16K and 15D in opposite aisles making travel as a couple impossible. No option for change. I made a request for more equitable seats at baggage check-in LHR and the agent was able to offer us seats together in 20AC on the second sector less attractive seats due to the missing window in this row but otherwise fine. Once underway on time service on the first sector was in the modern CX/SQ mode a little better in some respects a little less so in others. Food was acceptable even tasty with a pre dinner drink and wine with the meal. Missed was the CX mid flight ice cream. Great IFE. Abu Dhabi was a work in progress crowded busy and confusing with the need to pass through security again. Better is promised for 2015. The second sector on Air Berlin was OK reasonably efficient slightly brusque cabin crew attitude and edible rather than tasty food. No pretence of offering a superior service. No alcohol offered on this breakfast flight but I believe it would have been available on request. Slightly primitive IFE. A quick route from Heathrow to Phuket slightly under 15 hours including stopover. Competitively priced 30 kg baggage allowance and service levels as you would expect but such a pity you can't pre-book seats. So home at the end of the return trip and time for a final verdict.

It was a standard luggage bag that she would have known was in regulation size and visually you could see it was the smaller of the two.

As this trip was university-related and was paid for by my Russian university they naturally bought the cheapest tickets possible-Transaero. The trip from Vladivostok to Moscow was on a relatively new 777 with good personal IFE and decent food with reasonable legroom. When I arrived in Moscow I expected the Moscow-New York flight to be even better than the domestic flight. Boy was I wrong. The plane from Moscow-Vnukovo to NY-JFK was an old 767 with no personal IFE. The one plus side was a lot of leg room but it was a long flight with no IFE and rude staff. The return trip to Moscow was pretty much the same but when we arrived in Moscow and switched airports there was a slight problem. They had accidentally deleted our group from their flight manifest! We showed them the e-tickets and out boarding passes from the previous flights. They re-booked us on the same flight and gave us a free upgrade for their mistake which was nice. the flight back to Vlad was great with great IFE and food.

Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation.

The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer.

Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great.

Plenty of leg room comfortable seats and attentive cabin crew. Pushed back 10 minutes early and kept updated by the captain. Food and drinks good. Return flight on Sunday 31 August. What a difference! We arrived at the airport to be told the return flight would be on a 767 not a Dreamliner disappointed but not big problem. On board the Captain had a rant amongst the things he said was ""its not my fault that we are not flying the Dreamliner and its not the fault of the cabin crew so I expect you to treat them with respect"". It seems the crew were rostered at short notice and what a miserable lot they were. One female member banged into me every time she walked up and down the aisle without once apologising. After dinner an announcement was made that if you wanted anything else you were to come to the galley for service. The curtains were drawn and the cabin crew were not seen again for several hours. Having crossed the Atlantic at least 20 times I have never heard such announcements. The seats on 767s are very hard and the leg room minimal.

I feel this company has lost sight of there core value Customer service. The idea of adding 6 extra seats to there Boeing 737 configuration is a travesty. The loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks. My luggage was lost on my last trip from SMF-PDX I was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag (golf clubs) could would not be delivered to Bend OR where I was staying. The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight.

On our outward flight we sat on the plane for an hour whilst baggage was being loaded. The aircon wasn't functioning so we sat sweating for an hour.

The senior cabin crew member on the flight was only interested in selling and was continually annoying passengers on the PA and being in the cabin selling things. Whilst I appreciate the airline and crew make money from revenue I have never seen such a cheap and nasty service offered and something I've never seen or expected of Aer Lingus. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on as the lights were on bright the entire flight home. Other passengers were complaining but the crew were more interested in selling than making it comfortable for passengers. On a positive note the crew out on Saturday 18th were very good and the crew coming home could learn a thing or two from them!

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,Jason Fisher,United States,2014-02-11,An awful flight experience for me. I flew from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and we were delayed. The announcement explained that the delay was waiting for the flight attendants. I shouldn't complain though because while waiting in the terminal other Spirit airlines flights were being canceled all over the place. When we finally boarded the plane it was pretty dirty. The seats had graffiti everywhere and there was still trash from previous flights scattered all over the place. The flight attendants were obnoxious during the flight they did nothing but sit in their seats and play games on each others phones. Regardless of the money you save by booking with Spirit the bag fees are extremely expensive and you have to pay for everything once inflight. I would recommend eating before boarding.

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,Hardy Dennis,United Kingdom,2014-10-28,Flew on VS7 from LHR to LAX on 21st September and back on VS8 on the 9th October (upper class). The return flight was exactly the same price (to the penny) as BA business class which I have used before on a different route. I chose Virgin because the seat layout is better. Check-in was efficient at Heathrow and was given directions to the Clubhouse lounge. It’s in a different league to BA business class lounge. Super food great at table service great ambience. The flight was an hour late departing with late arrival of the aircraft as the reason. But we watched it arrive 2.5 hours before the scheduled departure time? The gate was chaotic and they started boarding premium economy before Upper class so we just walked through onto the aircraft (didn't pay a small fortune for this). On the plane the staff were great. Very friendly and helpful. Replaced my main course which was inedible (braised beef) with a delicious piece of salmon. The seat was very comfy and went completely flat. The entertainment system needs updating. The screen is small and picture quality and audio is poor my system needed a re-boot twice. Returning on VS8 we arrived at terminal 3 check in early (4.5 hours before departure as our connecting flight landed on time from Tahiti). The check in desk was closed and we had to wait for an hour and a half before we could check in. Not a fan of LAX staff are cold bordering on rude but the biggest gripe is a complete lack of seating. Standing around with luggage for an hour and a half is not fun. Once check in opened it was ok. The lounge is the Air New Zealand lounge which is ok. Boarding was fine and properly prioritised. Onboard the aircraft the staff were great in every respect. Again the food was only ok. We had a main course of fillet steak which was great but a starter of 2 small cold scallops with some puree was very poor. Breakfast was a disappointment. The bacon was cold and the sausage tasted bitter. Would I use Virgin upper class again? Absolutely but they need to up their game with the onboard food and entertainment system.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,7,4,5,3,2,NA,NA,4,1

Pushed close to schedule and were soon on our way. Announcements describing the service to come were clear and accurate. IFE was on a rolling loop and some channels weren't working so I read instead. Meal was very basic - curried fish with rice a bread roll a small dessert but adequate. Trays were cleared away promptly and cabin lights extinguished allowing plenty of time on the 9h25m sector for sleep. Two hours before landing another hot meal of similar proportions was served. One other bonus the crew were not too obsessed with making pax close their blinds permitting some sunlight in for the last few hours which made waking up a gradual process as blinds were raised one by one.

I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United.

When we were on the final row with only 15 people in front of us a Jetstar person removed the guide ribbon to allow people who had been waiting for only a minute or two to jump to the head of the line. This is annoying for those who had been waiting for 35 minutes. Boarding for the 11.00 departure commenced at 10.30.

This is as close as I have come to being treated like cattle I was made to feel guilty when I asked asking for a fruit juice or a drink of water. Crew very nonchalant addressing my wife and myself as Guys or me as Mate which I wasn't. Also very intent on emptying their trolley this was stacked with paper cups containing tea and coffee or a pre-packaged food menu which most people left scratch cards & some charity nonsense was thrown into the mix. Boeing 737-800 very noisy cabin in comparison to Airbus single aisles. Skipper provided excellent updates on flight progress and highlighted areas of interest first class.

However on our way back we were delayed for 3.5 hours 1 of which was inside the bus in the heat with no air conditioning. Then 2.5 hours on the plane. The hostesses were ignorant and rude and when I asked for the complementary blankets she said I should have kept the ones from the first trip even though I had paid for option plus both ways. She gave us a this dirty used blanket to cover my son who was cold in the bassinet. A few hours later when I asked for a glass of water she asked me why I missed the ""bar call"" and I had to explain why I was in the toilet changing my son. Once we got to Toronto they refused to give me the stroller that I checked in at the gate and told me to get it with my baggage! They got me a loan stroller that had broken wheels and I had to take my son off of it and carry him through customs etc. If I wanted to receive my stroller with the luggage I would have checked it in and not have it ""gate checked"" the whole point is to receive it as soon as you arrive.

thai-airways,/airline-reviews/thai-airways,Thai Airways customer review,P Marsina,United States,2014-11-06,NRT-BKK on A380. This was my second (and hopefully last) flight in Thai first class. They should just not be allowed to call it first class business class on Singapore or EVA is better. Last year I flew Thai from ZRH-BKK on A340 and was disappointed - I thought maybe I just had an old plane and a bad crew. Turns out it's the standard for Thai. A380 is a fairly new plane but it was already quite worn. The F cabin just isn't designed that well - there is a lot of wasted space on some lounge in the front that no one used. Much better to put another bathroom in that area like Emirates have. The seats are OK but the armrest is only on one side which I didn't like. The TV screens are big but the entertainment selection is quite poor. The service would be ok for business class but it's definitely not polished enough for first class. Again I don't want to compare them to their major competitors but Thai is miles behind. It just feels like it's not genuine it's very mechanical. About the food. I ordered a speciality meal thinking it would be better boy was I wrong! The white fish was inedible. I don't know what they did to it but it tasted like a shoe. I had to ask the flight attendant to give me salmon from the standard menu fortunately she had some left. It wasn't a culinary miracle by any means but at least I was able to eat it. Not sure what champagne they were serving but it wasn't good either. Now since this was only a 6 hour flight there were no PJs and it didn't seem like they had bedding for anyone either (at that point I didn't dare to ask just slept on the seat). Also we didn't receive the standard Rimowa first class amenity kit but rather a business class amenity kit designed by Porsche. So disappointing.

The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg.

The little red service is great quick efficient and perfect for connecting it's a shame this service is being discontinued as even though BA service is fine enough connecting from Terminal 5 is always a nightmare I find terminals 2 and 3 much more comfortable. As for the long haul service I struggle to understand how Virgin can put an ancient A340-300 on a 12 hour long haul route the entertainment was shocking the old Vera Reel system should of been replaced years ago. I could tell they had put there most battle hardened cabin crew on this route obviously to deal with this I have never seen a cabin manager talking to so many passengers mid flight though it must be said she did a great job. Luckily the return flight from Shanghai was on a newer A340-600 and the on demand entertainment was much better. The crew on this flight though were clearly struggling with the majority Chinese passengers and while there were Chinese crew to help there was no communication between the British and Chinese crew. I find the crew on Cathay Emirates Qatar and other long haul airlines to have a much more professional attitude.

The first class cabin is nice and I liked my seat. However, service onboard was horrible. The flight attendant barely spoke English, and when she asked what I wanted for dinner, I didn't understand half the choices. There was no printed menu, so I had to make a choice based on what little words I were able to grab from the flight attendant. The food was okay. There were maybe 5 dishes that were mostly good, except for the main dish which was some type of meat that didn't taste good. I didn't get a wine list at any point. The entertainment system was ok, but not that many choices in terms of US films and shows. And the ones available had Chinese subtitles that you couldn't turn off. And before each title started there were long commercials. After the flight attendant turned my seat into a comfy bed, I didn't see her for the next 8 hours or so. She didn't set foot in the cabin. So no way to order more drinks or snacks. And there was no bar or lounge area. I saw the flight attendant again maybe an hour before landing when it was time for breakfast.

Luckily I had the reservation number with me and they admitted me to their flight without any apology for their mistake. to the contrary I got scolded by the check-in supervisor for complaining about their service. The fact that I had bought a ticket did not automatically guarantee me to get on the flight according to her.

Not much of a big difference seat wise was a bigger seat but wasn't able to fall asleep comfortably. Water is given at the beginning of the flight. Food tasted better than Economy and also included a menu to choose. Liked the fact that haagen dazs ice cream was offered after one of the meals. The table is stored in the arm rest which is better than the table in Economy because it offered more space. Overall Elite class was better because of the food and the table.

In fact the staff were full of smiles and very efficient. The food was good and the Inflight Entertainment very good. I felt the Airbus was a bit old and clunky with a roaring take off so the airline will need to invest in more modern aircraft. Muscat Airport is somewhat basic in areas but there is brand new spanking Terminal which will open soon. The second flight to Trivandrum was also good and we were served a delicious Indian fish curry. The return flight from Muscat to London was a different story. The food was atrocious. Tough Beef and the other choice was pasta and only pasta in a tomato sauce. That said the breakfast warm egg wrap was better. On all flights the toilets were very clean and smelt of detergent. The economy seats are comfortable and much more so that those on Air India's Dreamliner. All in all a good airline.

air-berlin,/airline-reviews/air-berlin,Air Berlin customer review,Hugh Dillon,Australia,2015-05-20,In May 2015 I caught the flight from Chicago O'Hare to Berlin Tegel. The aircraft was an Airbus 330. I was allocated a window seat but had no window. A woman who had paid an extra $50 for a window found herself in the same position but was not given a window. The aircraft was very overheated and had no individual air vents above the seats. The individual lights above my seat illuminated my neighbour rather than my seat. There were inadequate numbers of toilets for the large number of passengers. This resulted not only in severe discomfort for passengers but the water supply ran out in the toilet closest to me resulting in toilet paper not being flushed. The food was as cheap and nasty as I have ever had in Economy. I am not tall but had very little leg room. I could do very little work not only due to the shortage of space but the intense heat of the aircraft. The TV and movie selection was OK but not great but the TV screen in the back of the seat in front of me kept skipping or freezing every time the passenger in that seat vibrated the seat - extremely irritating. On approach to Berlin droplets of water started to drip on me and the passengers around me. On arrival the aircraft parked a very long distance from the terminal building. We were bussed to the terminal - this took about 10 minutes. We were then kept on the bus for another 10 minutes before being released into fresh air. The terminal for Air Berlin at Tegel turned out to be a shed with only 4 customs officers for hundreds of non-EU passengers. It took about an hour in a line to clear customs. (EU passengers cleared in minutes due to their automated passport readers.) I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and ended up on Air Berlin because it is a One World partner with QANTAS. How Air Berlin managed to join that partnership of good to excellent airlines is a mystery only the executives of those airlines can answer. I will be complaining to QANTAS and Air Berlin directly. The small number of flight attendants worked very hard and were pleasant but I felt sorry for them.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,2,1,2,NA,NA,1,0

I paid $59 to stretch my legs and I choose the first row after business class. There was a division panel so in fact there wasn't much room.

The seats are uncomfortable and cramped the choice of in-flight entertainment poor (even if you could see it on the minuscule seat-back screen) or for the 2 hour flights pay-TV and the food absolutely disgusting. No snacks offered (I guess they are worried people will fill up on these having tasted the food) although available to purchase and no complimentary alcohol. Attendants fairly average and could certainly do with a better corporate uniform on trip out. On way back distinctly poor. Most worrying was the man who was on our plane and about 20 mins before take- off realized he was on the wrong flight only when somebody else came to sit in his seat. How is that allowed to happen on United from Washington? From a security point of view it is unbelievable and I wonder how the poor bloke fared trying to find the correct flight.

Air NZ does not provide toothbrush and toothpaste which are available on Cathay Pacific and Singapore long haul flight. In terms of in-flight entertainment movies were out dated.

As you can see I travel a lot on Saudia and know this airline well. The thing I really like about SV is that it's such a punctual airline. Flights are almost never late. Saudi domestic flights are not that expensive and are fully changeable fares with no penalties. If you are traveling domestic travel light and carry it all on. Security at domestic airports in the kingdom is not that strict so you can get a bottle of water and toothpaste through security. Does not charge extra for exit row seating. They also allow a free checked bag on domestic flights. Food service and inflight entertainment on international flights are pretty good actually. But 10 across on Saudi's 777's make it for a very tight flight. I certainly recommend taking SV to the USA during the low season! My flights to JFK were empty. We're talking 75 people on a 777. The amount of personal space on an empty widebody is amazing! I am very disappointed that Saudi has decided to cut costs and downgrade domestic food service. They used to offer hot chicken and rice the local dish on domestic flights. It was always delicious. Now they offer cold snacks only: a muffin cheese sandwich or a tuna or chicken sandwich. I used to get the sandwich but not any more. It is truly a mystery meat sandwich with very little taste. Flying during Ramadan is always a treat. They pass out the snack boxes and tell the passengers when they can begin to eat even if it's 10 minutes before landing they will land with the trays down with the catering items still on them! The cabin crews are friendly all the time. Saudia gets you from A to B without all the fuss of American carriers that's for sure. I recommend Saudi if the price is right you can't go wrong with them.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1

Airport check-in was good. The China Southern Lounge is far below the standard for 4 star airlines. It is very small and only has tables and chairs. There is food available including 2 freshly made hot dishes to order. The beverages are average. This is not to say that it is not comfortable and there is wif-fi. But compared to what I would consider 4-star ""standard"" such as ANA United etc. is does not come near that. There is only one row of First Class seating on the 787 and the seats were semi-pod. They did go fully flat and were comfortable for sleeping though if you are over 6 ft. tall you might find them a bit short. In the non-bed position they were comfortable though they do not really have foot rests - the leg rests stop mid-calf. There is a small shelf at the far end of the pod that does work so I would say the seating is quite adequate. VOD was in my opinion quite good with a large selection of Hollywood European Asian and Chinese films and lots of TV music and games options. The only negative is that the screen is fixed at the opposite end of the pod from the seat so it's a bit far away. The English proficiency of the cabin staff is not great so asking for anything that isn't in a narrow band of expectations can lead to confusion or your not getting what you wanted. This was as basic in my case as asking if they had any type of drinks beside red and white wine. Ends up they did but it took the purser to recognize my request. She then provided an extensive list of the drinks available on board which was very good. The food was good as well - no complaints. The staff was also quite attentive and ready to please.

We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices.

The food ran out the audio didn't work one toilet was out of order to the the extent the flight crew actually removed the toilet pan right next to my seat. When I said my audio did not work staff checked it and totally agreed with me but did nothing to help even though the flight had 9 unused seats.

Brussels flight late connecting time tight for LHR (scheduled for 70 minutes more like 25 with the late flight and you have to go through security to get to US). Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service). As usual the flight attendants on UA were generally friendly and polite but are not formal like the European or Asian airlines which is fine with me.

The dedicated check in at Vancouver meant that check in only took 5 minutes. We were first on the plane. The seats were wider and deeper with good leg room and reclining ability. We got a complimentary blanket neck cushion earphones eye mask toothpaste and brush and slippers. We also got champagne as much alcohol as we wanted. The meal was of a much better quality than in economy with proper cutlery. The entertainment system was the same as economy but we had a remote control as well. Our luggage came out first and all together as it was labelled priority which was very nice. The flight was on time and arrived early. It only took 30 minutes from getting off the plane to getting through customs with our luggage. Air Transat were at least as good as BA Air Canada and Virgin but much cheaper.

We got to the airport to wait in line for over an hour to get our vouchers. The flight rescheduled for 0600 Wednesday and we waited in line for two hours to get rebooked (airport was unorganized and complete mess). Air Pacific agents allowed us to carry on our bags but airport security wouldn’t let us carry on our bags because we were over their ridiculous 7 kg limit – our bags were the right size but a bit overweight 9 kg and 11 kg but we had nothing but original clothes we carried to Fiji! The plane was delayed another 6 hours after we boarded the plane so we de-boarded and waited. Total delayed time of 16 hours plus missing our connecting flights which Air Pacific said they would re-book but failed to deliver on – we worked it out with our connecting airline Virgin America which was great about re-booking us.

Manoeuvring through the cabin trying not to disturb sleeping passengers is tricky and I'm just a 1.80m 78kg guy. That same average goes for the food served. Flight crew was friendly and efficient. But the worst is that you have to transit Abu Dhabi airport when flying with them. By far one of the worst airports I have ever visited and I travel extensively for the last 30 years. For some reason they forgot to install a sufficient number of toilet facilities resulting everywhere even in their business and first premium lounges for waiting lines of 10-12 people.

One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over.

During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied ""oh you said you did not want breakfast"".

The flight home via Newark was on a small almost domestic sized planes which allowed no real room for comfort or sleep. Other passengers taller than myself didn't cope quite as well.

I was seated at the window seat on several occasions I had a request for food water in the middle of the flight I pressed the attendant button waited more than 20 mins then an attendant went by and just went past no stopping on our side of the aisle and asking if anybody needed anything this happened in the middle of the flight when everyone was asleep so I didn't want to call out loudly but was waving my hands. This went on for 3 more attendant passes me before I was able to get the attention of an attendant. On the way back flying from Tokyo to Toronto I opted for an aisle seat thinking it was easier to get their attention it was but they were not the friendliest or most cordial I was asking for snacks in the middle of the long flight I was asked to go to the back myself to get pretzels and cookies.

Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less.

To my surprise when I got to the airport and tried to get my on board tickets they charged me $25 per seat assignment so if I wanted to seat next to my husband we had to pay $50. To that they charged for carry ons $45. So add to your airline ticket another $70 per person each way for a total of $140 each. The seats were very uncomfortable and very thin with no cushion. They have the pre-reclined seats and they are stiff not to mention you have no leg room at all. We tried seating near the emergency door so my husband could have more leg room and that would have been better. I will definitely avoid traveling with Sprit.

IFE costs $10 otherwise for unlimited movies and shows or $4 for shows only. Legroom is very cramped but is acceptable for short haul flights.

This saw passengers approach staff at the desk who had no idea what was going on or about the new take off time. Finally they told us the plane needed a part which would be flown in from Brisbane so we would have to go home as there only a few hotel rooms available. After several hours we were given a cab voucher and finally had to leave through immigration and customs all off whom looked really peeved. Left the airport at about 4am to find no taxi's. Melbourne Airport staff made frantic calls to taxi companies. 45 mins later we were on the way home. Up at 11 am to get ready to head back to airport to find an SMS saying the flight was delayed to 10.30 pm that night.

The 330 had the ""foot box"" which restricts movement and is quite annoying and doesn't go flat. Service on all sectors was excellent as was food and wines. Couldn't fault the staff at all. Having a 7 hour layover on the outbound trip we went on the free Doha city tour which was well worth it. Back in time to relax for a couple of hours in the enormous lounge.

alaska-airlines,/airline-reviews/alaska-airlines,Alaska Airlines customer review,S Sparks,United States,2013-12-19,"I have been flying Alaska for many years. For the last several years I have been flying first class only and have been very satisfied with the food the service and the extra space. This last trip though made me wonder if I should continue to pay the substantial difference in price to be in first class. It was the space in the new plane. The space between me and the seat in front is closer. I had to struggle to get my bag under the seat in front of me when the passenger in front of me had his seat back. I'm 5'5' and 125 lbs. Also there used to be three big spaces under the 1st class seats for two people. Now there are two with one other smaller space big enough to fit a purse maybe. I don't like to use the overhead but I can change. There still seemed to be plenty of space between me and the passenger next to me. I like the three moveable light fixtures and the ability to direct air flow on the ceiling better. The food is still good and the service good. Although staff service on the majority of my flights has been ""excellent"" I can only honestly rate this last trip as ""fair."" I am grateful to her though for this information. I heard her tell the two passengers in front of me that staff call the new planes ""slaveships"" because there are 44 more seats (!) but no more staff (still 4) to serve passengers. She said something to the effect of ""I feel sorry for the people in back. They get served so late or barely at all."" I'm thinking that on my next trip coming up shortly I will go coach one way just to see if I can still justify paying the difference in price. But thanks to the overheard words of the staff attendant I will sit in the middle or closer to the front in coach so that I will get better service and won't have to wait forever. I will also plan to bring on board some food and a beverage. Overall I really like Alaska although I haven't flown any others for a long time. Maybe I will venture onto another airline just to compare. I never have trouble checking in no lost luggage airport gate staff friendly and professional.

The last two times I have booked a holiday with them I have attempted to use their online check in almost 48 hours prior to my flight and each time it has shown me an empty plane with sufficient seats to be had and yet from the outset we are placed in adjoining seats on both sides of an aisle while a prompt asks if you would like to pay extra to move to seats that are next to each other. You can't even move just one seat next to the other as it charges you double as if you had moved them both! Last time this happened I decided to wait and check in at the airport just to see if they had since allocated those seats to someone else and given us new ones but no they had specifically allocated the same ones to us from the outset even though the plane was empty at that time still. I have just gone through the same process and once again they have placed me and my husband on two sides of an aisle. This company can claim all it likes that it attempts to sit people together when possible but the fact remains they are now deliberately carrying out this practise so that people are forced to pay extra for holidays they have already paid for. This will be the last holiday or cruise I will book through this company until they become more honest in their dealings will their passengers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,5,0,0,NA,NA,4,0
bmi-british-midland-international,/airline-reviews/bmi-british-midland-international,bmi British Midland Airways customer review,Dan Ross,United Kingdom,2010-09-05,LHR-VIE. Booked via Austrian Airlines to VIE as part of a trip to Macedonia. 6am departure meant an early arrival at Heathrow. Had printed boarding passes so straight to fast bag drop which never lives up to its name with any airline. People in front had problems with excess overweight baggage children or groups trying to sit together. Eventually get to the desk and have my printed out boarding passes replaced with proper ones! Not much open at Heathrow and was worried about food onboard. At T1 the first shop you see open is a Costa and its likely to have a long queue. Walk deeper into the terminal and there is a Pret that was also open with no queue. Gate was miles away. Boarding was slightly later than anticipated but handled by rows. Comfortable seating onboard. Once airborne there is a drink run and food service - a hot egg cheese and tomato panini which would rank as one of the most tasteless meals I've had on an airline. Given that this was a 2 hr breakfast flight more could have been provided. I remember flying BMI from LHR to AMS and they served a full hot breakfast in 45m of flying time. Here there wasn't even a second drinks run. The crew seemed intent on clearing up before most people had even finished their breakfast! Crew were fairly robotic.

Almost a 6 hour flight with no movement for the seat was very difficult. I recommend Row 16 if paying for Elite Plus as row 16 has the extra leg room and the seat movement. I believe row 14 does not have reclining seats as well but that would need to be confirmed. We left the gate 50 minutes late but I knew this was possible and brought my own snacks and drinks on board as well as my tablet with books and movies so I was able to entertain myself for the trip.

With the only exception of this aeroplane type being much noisier than usual near the back this was pretty much as good as any economy class service I have been in. The plane was in a 2-4-3 configuration which gives various group sizes more options than the standard aeroplane layouts. Despite some negative reviews that I have read the fixed shell seats were excellent and gave one all options for what to do on the flight - work or rest. With this type of seat and good legroom one is no longer at the mercy of the passenger in front. The seat design was as good as Singapore's A380's and had top-class in-flight entertainment including the best flight progress maps and data that I have seen.

Generally speaking I nearly always get to the other end at the promised time and also quite often a little early. The turboprops take some getting used to but they are comfortable and you seem to get plenty of leg room. The jets are superb. Baggage space is a bit tight in the overheads but a recent change now allows the same carry on bags as Ryanair and others. What makes Flybe shine is their crews I now prefer them over other carriers. Choice of on board food a bit thin but then most flights I take are only an hour or so in duration. Lastly on the few occassions it has gone wrong they have bent over backwards to put it right.

Both ways a fairly new Airbus A330-300 with great entertainment system and average seating for transatlantic economy class. Our issues with US Airways is not with their international service it is with their horrific domestic service and the worst customer service experience imaginable. We live less than 2 hours from the Philadelphia airport and spent twice as much time as we did on the plane from London Heathrow to our home. They're cancelled all flights to our local airport and after 13 hours in an airport less than 2 hours from our home we had to rent a car (at our own expense) to drive home because US Airways cannot complete a transaction. This has happened now 3 times. Avoid Philadelphia completely and be warned that US Airways customer service will treat you horribly.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,2,1,3,4,NA,NA,3,0

A group of 5 of us were travelling from Delhi to Kochi via Bangalore. Our flight was late arriving in Bangalore (landing at the time our connecting flight was due to depart). We were unloaded onto the tarmac (not at a gate). The ground staff immediately directed us to a waiting special bus organised to move the 5 of us to the connecting flight. We jumped on the bus and then a few moments later the ground staff came up with our luggage. Within 10 minutes of landing at Bangalore we were on the connecting flight (with our luggage!) and taxiing for take off.

I have always rated them as one of the best low cost airlines especially now that they allocate seats. However they don't have their own staff an EDI and the handling company can be hit or miss. There is no bag drop so even if you've checked in online you're still going have to join the regular queue. Having checked in on line and eventually dropped our bags my wife and I were sitting in our allocated seats onboard - 10E and F when another passenger appeared with a boarding pass for seat 10F. After a few minutes a stewardess arrived with a computer printout showing us in seats 15A and B. Since these weren't extra leg-room seats for which we'd paid we flatly refused to move. Eventually the stewardess backed down and the other passenger was seated elsewhere. The flight itself was fine and the 'Happy Picnic' was tasty and good value. Travelling on from CGN to MUC a few days later we checked in by machine at the airport and dropped our luggage at the fast bag drop which really was fast. The whole process lasted under 5 mins. Again the flight was fine although air traffic restrictions led to a delay of about 25 mins.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,1

Both flights were on-time and comfortable. The planes were very clean and the cabin crews were very friendly and professional. 1) On LED-SVO I put the sandwich in my bag as I was not hungry at that time. The flight attendant who was serving tea/coffee saw I did not have a sandwich on my tray table so she asked me very kindly in English whether I was hungry and why not take a sandwich for snack. 2) On SVO-STR after I walked into the back cabin the flight attendant greeted me and offered to guide me to my seat. 3) The SVO-STR flight (3hrs) included a full lunch with a very generous portion of cold cut salmon and potato salad as the starter and lamb and buckwheat as the main course. The dessert was a granola bar with honey chocolate cherry and apple coating. It was very tasty! Overall from my 4 flights with Aeroflot within two weeks I have to say the level of service is quite good and consistent.

I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats.

All 4 flights were late. I can see why they are late because they obsess over checked luggage being 3 pounds over and then make you re-pack and carry one of your formerly checked bags. It certainly delayed everyone else in line. The next flight we were chastised because we had an extra carry-on which of course the other agent made us use. Finally and most egregiously - on the last flight we had been booked with a supposedly legal one hour connection in Bangkok. Of course the in-bound flight was 55 minutes late but we were met at the gate by an employee who was there to 'help' us.

On the last leg on my return flight from Cancun Chicago O'Hare to Portland as well as two others flights were cancelled after being delayed for over two hours. I was not given a reason for this cancellation until I was told by other passengers that the flight staff from the Portland flight and Vegas flight had been pulled to the Houston flight. After that all three planes worth of people went to the desk to try and get refunded for at least the leg that was cancelled or maybe a voucher for a hotel room for the night. I stood in that line from 11.30pm to about 2.30 or 3am. After bonding with many people over mutual disgust of Spirit Airlines I found out that some people had been waiting to get to Portland or Vegas since their flights were first cancelled on May 28th. It was now the 31st. That took care of my idea to just re-book with them for a morning flight to Portland. Next I heard that the vouchers they were giving people for hotels were useless.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,C Van Heerden,Australia,2014-02-05,30 January 2013 flight 9W10 from Mumbai to Singapore (Business Class). Technical problems with plane resulted in an hour delay. Repairs were attempted while on runway and after again trying to depart plane was moved to another part of runway close to airport building. We were parked there for 6 hours. During that time absolute mayhem took place. For the first few hours there were no communication and it became clear this airline has no contingency plan and should not be flying. As business class passengers we received no support and passengers were physically prevented from leaving the plane though we were about 25 metres away from an airbridge. Half the plane without connections were put on another plane to Singapore and we were kept detained on the plane for another few hours. Eventually a Customer Service Manager appeared. We were then told it would take 3 days before we could fly due to tickets not being available. After insisting on tickets it took another hour before we were offered economy class tickets which were rejected. After another hour we were offered premium class tickets to Bangkok and then Melbourne. The flight was 2 am and we were offered a hotel room which I had to share with a stranger. I was very relieved to get on Thai Airlines from Bangkok. As for Jet Airways I will never fly with them again!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,1,2,3,2,1,NA,NA,3,0

They stated they were going to ask for people to give up seats for those who truly needed to fly. They only called for volunteers once and in Spanish so 2/3 of the flight didn't understand. They were rude and had no compassion. A few of the others that were supposed to have got bumped got on the plane. I had priority on the list and yet other people got on that were far down the list. Copa Airlines said they had the right to determine who got on the plane by their own guidelines - who they wanted to bump they bumped.

No airline should be using the A321 for flights longer than 2 hours. It was extremely cramped for a 6 hour flight. The least they could do would be to prevent seats from reclining as space then became impossible. On the way out a seat back broke! Fortunately there was a spare seat don't know what they would have done without that option! Return flight we allegedly ran out of fuel due to strong headwinds! Oddly enough we diverted to Luton and the crew also changed. I have noted on this and other forums this appears to be a regular occurrence with Monarch. The decision should have been made earlier say over Europe and we divert to nearest airport but decision was made over North sea [from what I can gather] so if you cant make Manchester but can make Luton from there then there was clearly no need. We landed at Luton at the same scheduled time we should have landed at Manchester! Finally I was never told if a meal was to be provided they come out and sell you food and drink first without telling you food and drink is also provided then about half an hour later they come round with a hot meal and drinks!

Because of my seat being at the very rear of the cabin seat 67A I was able to board earlier than some. Cabin Crew were very friendly and responsive. The food was pretty good I had the fish option which consisted of Baked Salmon with black pepper sauce lima beans and carrots and spinach mashed potatoes. On the side was a warm bun with butter and a chicken salad. There was also a haagen-dazz ice cream for dessert. As this was a 16 hour flight we were offered a second meal in which I got the chicken with rice option that came with a peach yoghurt cake topped with honey toasted oatmeal a fruit salad and once again a warm bun with butter. The seats were fairly comfortable and I was very thankful not to be on a flight with the old fixed shell seats. The AVOD at my seat was horrible. It would not respond to my touch at all or would take more than 5 minutes. I alerted the cabin crew they told me that I had to take it slow. After showing them that it didn't work they went back to the galley apparently ""reset"" the AVOD and told me to try again. They ignored me after that. A tip for all you others out there traveling on long distance flights on the 777-300ERs.

Further conversation revealed that she had AF Flying Blue status, although she's a US citizen. It appears from our chat, that AF allows its own customers to reserve seats in business class up to a few hours before departure and thus bump passengers like me and my husband, paying passengers, at will. This leaves the check-in staff at Dulles to flounder for explantions as to why we are separated.

Food is nice and nice to have a choice but in a premium cabin on any airline that's what I expect and the liquors after lunch or dinner is a nice touch. Only other offer of drinks is juice or water throughout the 11 hour flight.

Well 2 months ahead you don't really find any flights which are less than 2 times expensive than the original booking. Beware of baggage restrictions they check this without any tolerance. Food onboard is below every expectations and should be avoided. The plus part is well maintained and clean planes fast connection good space on Q400 and 757 the rest are ok.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,M Krista,United States,2014-09-19,I have a mixed opinion of Norwegian airlines after having flown them R/T LAX-ARN (Stockholm). Flight out from LAX went without a hitch. The flight from LAX to ARN was not on a Dreamliner and the service was traditional with complimentary food and drinks (and headsets) and the flight departed on time. The return flight however was 14 hours delayed. The airline ate the cost of putting all the passengers in a hotel on site at the airport and included vouchers for lunch and dinner. The return flight was on the Dreamliner and that aircraft is so smooth and I'm glad that I got to experience it. Nothing is complimentary on the return flight. Even basic drinks like coffee and soda are $4. Video entertainment however is complimentary and there was no shortage of things to watch.

Nice and quiet. Crew pleasant with enough English to get by. No pilot announcements as is typical of Chinese airlines. Seat very similar to Emirates version albeit without a lot of the bells and whistles. Gone is the soft drinks minibar replaced with a solitary small bottle of water - probably all you need though. Seat is fully flat and plenty of room and foot room. No massage function but again is it really necessary? Never got to try mattress or quilt. I hear they give PJs too but never saw any. Storage is plentiful especially for a window seat where there are two storage boxes under the windows. AVOD is pretty good. OK not the vast selection of Emirates but enough to keep you occupied with reasonably recent films. Not far off Qantas. Screen is maybe 17"" and touchscreen that responds well. Controls are under the screen as is headphone socket. Brought my own headphones which were just long enough to work from a comfortably seated position. Food. Not too bad but: the cabin crew bring out the main (lamb rack) and I'm not even half way through the entree (nice salmon and beef pastrami). Attendant left the main on top of the side storage. What's the rush? We've got eight hours left. For the next meal it was a very tasty chicken pie with a fruit plate. To become a 'great' service this should've been brought out one plate at a time. And the pie was lukewarm at best but tasty and I was hungry. Plenty of seat belt sign action throughout the flight but he crew didn't seem too bothered about it to the extent Qantas would be.

Was aware that there was a short stopover at Cardiff but was given the impression that Glasgow bound passengers stayed on board. After all we had cleared security only a few hours earlier. Some on board had even purchased duty free at CDG believing that Glasgow was the only airport they would pass through. How foolish was I (and they). All Glasgow bound passengers had to uplift their belongings leave the plane pass through border control re check-in and then clear security before boarding the same aircraft. Those with duty free over the 100ml limit had to put their baggage in the hold. There is possibly a good explanation as to why this happens but we were never given it either by staff on board or at Cardiff Airport.

There were only 2 services this year - fewer than last year. You are expected to serve yourself if you want any snacks. Last year they brought them round to you every 15 minutes. On our return there is no lounge in McCarran airport and no drinks or food vouchers supplied. Again the crew were condescending in their service. I was told off by the purser as my table was at an angle and not directly in front of me. As it wasn't blocking the aisle I didn't see a problem. As others have mentioned the planes are old and it's a nuisance that the DVD player has to move when food is served. The service has gone way downhill in a year although the plane was full. I'd just returned from an economy flight with KLM to China and the service onboard KLM was better than that supplied by Maxjet. The only thing in it's favour is the extra seat width and length. Last year I was keen to book again. This year I'm not so sure.,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,Athallah Arsyaf,Indonesia,2014-07-08,Flew from CGK-HKG. Very disappointed with the service and the product CX actually offers as a 5 star airline flew with CX798 on the way to HKG. Upon boarding I had very high hopes for CX. Very surprised with the FA's on this flight - they rarely interacted with passengers and some were chatting with colleagues in the cabin upon boarding. The food was not reasonable for a 4.5 hour flight received a cold and not very nice sandwich in a box. My back ached due to the poor quality seats in economy. We hardly saw the crew in the cabin. The entertainment service was the only decent part of my journey movies were very up to date and kept us occupied for 4.5 hour flight.

Their business products were professional! The flight from SYD to Perth was on an A330. The seat pitch and width were excellent for this 5 hour flight. Staff members addressed you by last name and they showed great courtesy and professionalism. The dinner was served in a 3-course manner and each was accompanied by different glasses of wines. They had quite a substantial drinks list too. Excellent! I was even able to catch on sleep on its angled flat seat. Loved its amenity bag too! However its IFE Didn't have much selection.

jetstar-airways,/airline-reviews/jetstar-airways,Jetstar Airways customer review,G Cook,Australia,2014-10-12,Our family of four flew with Jetstar not by choice but because I booked a discounted fare through Qantas and the only option was to fly one leg Adelaide to Sydney with Jetstar. As we had a 2.5 hour window before making the cut off check in time for our international flight I thought it was worth the risk. I say this because we travel a lot and there have been a number of times when we have been in an airport and heard the delay messages regarding Jetstar and thought 'Lucky we are not with them'. When we checked in we were told the flight was delayed but 'only by an hour'. No panic as there was still plenty of time. At 4.05 when the delayed flight was meant to be departing it still had not landed in Adelaide. When we did finally depart at 5.25pm we had resigned ourselves to missing our international flight. This review is fair so I must mention the check in staff who arranged for our luggage to be in the first container off the plane in Sydney and the cabin staff who got us to the front so we could run the moment the doors opened at the airbridge when we docked. If it weren't for them we would not have made our next flight. A $20 tip to a taxi driver and a sprint meant we made the check in desk of the international airline just as they were closing the flight. My main comment is concerning the lies fed to us by the ground crew in Adelaide. I can not understand how they can say a flight is delayed 'one hour' when it could not have possibly even been in the air!! It's not the Adelaide staff - its the people in operations. By not telling passengers the truth (seems to be a common complaint) they are effectively denying them any chance of booking a flight with a rival airline so that connections can be made. If it weren't for the poor staff in the firing line on the ground and on the plane I would have been a lot less complimentary. Next time we pay more and fly with anyone but Jetstar.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,4,5,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

virgin-atlantic-airways,/airline-reviews/virgin-atlantic-airways,Virgin Atlantic customer review,S Morris,United Kingdom,2014-02-05,Travelled to St Lucia in January premium economy out and upper class return. Online check in was very easy but twilight bag drop at Gatwick not possible on arrival at 4.30pm and we had to queue for 1 hour to check our bags in probably because they have reduced the twilight check in time from 2pm to 5pm and only 2 staff were on duty. The new 330 wide bodied aircraft is much more cramped in premium economy than the 747 when travelling in the bubble which was a joy. The aisles are narrow causing more disturbance to passengers and some people are allocated seats in 3s with the loss of privacy for couples. However the lighting and the entertainment were a big improvement and the food was good so overall the PE experience was acceptable. The return in upper class was poor value. Similarly cramped compared with the jumbo and it is no longer feasible to share a meal with your partner as the aisles are too narrow. There is some personal privacy at night and the beds were OK although you are quite near to the seats opposite the herringbone pattern works. Service disturbs sleepers due to the narrow aisles as stewards constantly knock into feet or the ends of beds. During the day it would be impossible to talk to you partner unless you got up as the screens do not fold down so you are very much in your own space which is probably good for business passengers. The upper class meal was truly dreadful. It was impossible to eat the steak so I exchanged it for chicken which was also dry and tough. The stewardess suggested the only decent meal was vegetarian and several people were sending their food back but by that time I had lost interest. Why do they serve lumps of meat which have to be re-heated? Food was much nicer in PE. Overall the service in upper class has deteriorated with reduced costs evident and we were very disappointed.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,3,3,1,5,NA,NA,2,0

Arrived in Manchester after my second flight had left had to buy a new ticket for the next day and had to pay for a hotel for the night. I learned the hard way that taking the train is the best option. They wouldn't tell me why the flight was cancelled but as the evening flight had a total of around 20 passengers on a 78-seater aircraft I can put two and two together and see that they cancel flights when they consider there aren't enough passengers. I have booked my next flight with a full-service airline and have paid nearly 3 times as much for the ticket.

On the way back I decided to try Economy class from Abu Dhabi to USA and found out it was the most horrible flight experience I had in the past 26 years flying back and forth from USA to other countries. Let me make it clear it was all about flight attendants. Sixteen hours of journey itself is not that easy. One needs to be hydrated constantly to keep with the long journey.

Swiss show a picture of a throne-like seat on their website and represent that as their Business Class seat. But there are just a few of these in the cabin and the other seats are different. You can't get the seats they show on the web site only their senior frequent flyers. So my wife and baby were stuck in a middle seat with an unfortunate stranger next to them despite me having reserved the lone window seat online. The seats themselves are lumpy and uncomfortable and the in-flight entertainment is the worst I've seen. It is painfully slow clunky and simply doesn't work much of the time (we took two long haul legs Zurich - Singapore and Hong Kong - Zurich and this was true on both legs). The food is ok though not a patch on what you'd get on Emirates Qatar or one of the first-tier airlines. Swiss have no lounges of their own outside of Switzerland so in Hong Kong we ended up being sent to a packed noisy pay-per-entry lounge which had no seats was utter chaos and had one type of beer in the fridge. When we disembarked in Zurich we were told with no apology at all that we'd miss our connection to Manchester because Swiss were late arriving. My wife left her bag on the plane accidentally in our rush to get off. 5 minutes later we told a Swiss ground employee that the bag had been left in Business Class and would they mind retrieving it. They passed me a card for a third party lost and found company called Swissport and was told to file a web report with them when I was back in the UK.

She sent me to the other end of the airport where the people sent me to another lounge and each refused to let me in. The employees of the Aeroflot as it turned out did not know their own airport: they did not know any telephones to call nor they had any directories at and they did not know even the telephone of their own lounges in different part of the airport nor were they able to provide any reasonable assistance. Eventually at my insistence one of the supervisors after calling around for 10-15 minutes found out that I was indeed eligible to get into the very first lounge.

If you want luxury convenience etc for a few hours hash out the extra $300 dollars for first class Delta. I've flown with Spirit about a dozen times and never had a bad moment. Most of the complaints are from people not paying attention to clearly printed baggage fees or whining that they weren't given a complimentary 25 cents worth of soda on a 4 hour or less flight. Seriously pay attention check in at a decent time like you're supposed to show up to the airport at a decent time again like you're supposed to and buy a soda or snack in the terminal if it's so important to you.

SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).",NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,3,3,4,NA,NA,5,1

Back then the return economy flight cost me £250 the flight had better entertainment and proper games with consoles was offered newspapers and the food and drink served was offered practically non-stop in fact I was given 2 main meals! Also very lucky on the return flight as it was practically empty we were given a glass of champagne! This time got 1 small main meal (and didn't eat the salad as it consisted of one small leaf and lots of dressing that tasted of dish water) afternoon tea consisted of 1 biscuit and tea or coffee steward gave me a look when I asked for 2 drinks and only good thing about the entertainment was the selection of films. I don't know why the stewards seemed stressed when the plane was half full! Also on return flight back staff at the airport had an attitude and didn't even welcome or say hello to me! They insisted I put items from my hand luggage into my suitcase as it was 1 kilo over! All this wonderful service cost me just under £800 for a return ticket!

The food was acceptable curry was the only option and I suggest that all passengers opt for the ""veg"" option. Entertainment is mainly aimed at Indian audiences and I expected and agree with this. I suggest taking a tablet loaded with your favourite movies or shows - but I would do this on any airline. The 787 is by far much more comfortable that the 777. Very impressed with the 787 (Dreamliner) - leg room is normal the seat pitch is incredible the cabin environment is lovely and the atmospheric conditions are noticeably better on the 787. (I didn't think this after the outbound journey which consisted of two 787 sectors. The return journey was a 777 sector followed by a 787 sector this is when you notice how great the 787 really is). Transit via Delhi: Information around this process is extremely hard to find on the internet with mixed reviews on sites such as this. If you are an international transiting passenger (i.e. you have landed in Delhi and are connecting with another Air India flight within 24 hours) then you do not need a visa so long as you are not exceeding 24 hours and are not leaving the terminal. There are two options inside the terminal for accommodation. I have done both. Eaton Smart Hotel - transit hotel - This is the option for a transit greater than 4 hours. If you stay here you can also leave the hotel and access any facilities in the terminal - just keep you passport and boarding card with you. Sams Pods - Ideal for less than 4 hours. $10US/ hour. You have access to a bed TV and desk in a small pod in the terminal building. No access to wash facilities other than those provided in the terminal. If you have a flight with Air India and have a long transit it would be well worth you questioning your ability to get a hotel paid for by the airline. I paid for mine as advised for by my flight centre agent. All other passengers on my flight managed to get this included in their ticket free of charge.

Was met with a flat out no saying the baby was too big for a bassinet. He is 9kgs and according to Thai's own website the cut off is 13kgs. I asked 3 other flight attendants and they all said the same thing. Whenever I have travelled Singapore Airlines or even Qantas this has never been the case. So disappointed with the service levels.

air-transat,/airline-reviews/air-transat,Air Transat customer review,M Tushishvili,France,2014-02-15,Paris-Montreal. I had mixed impressions: The positive side is that Terminal 3 in CDG airport is very pleasant to use check-in staff are very competent and the security area was moving quickly. Boarding was done using buses but very well organized by the ground staff. Inflight attendants were very helpful throughout the flight. The negative side is that seats are so narrow that you cannot move a finger. The plane A330 was redesigned for configuration 3X3X3 (9 in total in a row instead of 8) which is extremely uncomfortable. It is just impossible to seat 7 hours without any changes in a position. The food is just horrible. My advice is to bring my own meal. The comfort kits costs 9 Canadian dollars which includes pillow blanket etc. This is definitely the low cost airline and overall it is an average experience. I will report about the return flight as well.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,1,5,1,4,NA,NA,3,1

Despite this we were only a few minutes late leaving and that was partly because 2 elderly passengers had gone to the wrong gate. When they arrived they were gently guided to their seats and as they apologised for getting lost the stewardess simply said ""Never mind you're here now"". The boarding agents at Palma were equally amiable and very tactful when 'non - Speedy Boarders' joined the Speedy Boarders queue.

vietnam-airlines,/airline-reviews/vietnam-airlines,Vietnam Airlines customer review,Rowan Robertson,Malaysia,2015-01-14,KUL to LGW (via SGN). First time I've used Vietnam Airlines and overall I was fairly impressed. On the short KUL to SGN leg we got a pretty substantial meal of decent quality - certainly much more than many other airlines seem to offer for a sub 2 hour flight or in some cases for longer journeys than that. The A321 aircraft for this leg was also clean comfortable and fairly new looking. For the longer SGN to LGW part it was a 777 and the state of its cabin was the one negative aspect of our Vietnam Airlines experience. It looked pretty worn and it was actually less comfortable in regards leg room and seat comfort than the A321. Personally I don't really care about how good or bad the IFE is but I could see what this 777 had probably wouldn't impress passengers who do care about the IFE. In spite of those negatives I thought the service provided was really good. Again good quality meals and I found the cabin crew to be pleasant and helpful. I would not agree with other reviewers criticisms of English abilities. Granted none I came across could pass themselves off as native English speakers but they were perfectly good enough to do the job. I with zero Vietnamese ability had no problems communicating with any of them at all. So a little unfortunate I thought that their staff's good work was somewhat undermined by the less impressive state of the cabin they were working in. I should mention another positive was the transfer at SGN. I'd been warned by a friend who used to live in Ho Chi Minh City that it was a terrible airport. Indeed it was rather dated if glitzy shopping mall but it ticked the boxes that matter for me. Toilets were plentiful and all were spotlessly clean. Transit process was fast and efficient and simple food and drinks seemed much less of a rip off than many other international airports I've transferred via. Overall the pluses outweighed the minuses and I'd fly Vietnam again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,5,5,2,NA,NA,4,1

First time on an A340. Once in the air the flight went smoothly. The plane was clean. The 2 meals served were adequate in size and somewhat above average as far as airline food goes.

All planes were 737's of some variety. The seats were comfortable with adjustable headrests but legroom was terrible. I'm short so this was only a problem when I (or someone else) wanted to use the restroom as the person on the aisle seat had no choice but to get out of his seat to accommodate us. The cheese platter is an excellent meal available on all flights. Availability of hot meals was inconsistent and confusing (available one direction but not the other on flights before 9 am or after etc.). Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can.

They are cheap unless you have extra bags or extra weight or make last minute changes or miss a plane out of Manila. (get to MNL airport early!). Sometimes the flight leaves before the posted time. Their website is frequently not working correctly. Tried to pay for extra bags and kept getting an error message until after it was past the deadline for adding bags. Then had to pay at the airport extra. You can expect a last minute gate change frequently and you can expect to walk or bus to Term 2 in Manila from the plane even though the plane is sitting right at the enclosed walkway. Carry-on policy is sporadic so going from an International flight to a domestic flight on Cebu Pacific can be tricky and costly.

We chose Malaysia Airlines because of price short connection times and the extra baggage allowance. The flights to NZ were not bad: food was better than expected and service very pleasant too. We had a less than positive experience on our return flights. On the plus side when we noticed that the plane was half empty on the AKL-KL leg and we asked to move to seats with more leg room our request was granted. This made for a very comfortable and pleasant flight. However our second return flight was delayed in KL for some time so we were exhausted and severely sleep deprived by the time the flight finally got clearance to take off. The plane was very full and it was an older plane with rather an incredibly noisy engine and rather tired seats - not in the best condition. Both of our entertainment units were not working properly so we couldn't watch movies and the staff seemed too busy and stressed too help. The fish we were served was too spicy to eat (and we are used to eating fairly hot curries and Indian food) and later we were offered 'spicy prawns' for breakfast - no thanks!

Brussels airport a much nicer place to be than Paris CDG the other main hub for Africa flights. Only let-down was the in-flight entertainment. It's a modern on-demand system with a nice big touch screen and useful USB port but choice of movies and music was poor and the flight map function too clever for its own good - it seemed to endlessly show places hundreds of miles away with silly captions like 'historical city of Venice' and only occasionally made it clear where you actually are!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,10,5,4,4,3,NA,NA,4,1

The outbound flight AI 116 was delayed by 1.5 hours due to technical issues on the aircraft - Boeing Dreamliner. Check-in was breeze and staff were professional and friendly. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to business class. Seats and cabin was extremely comfortable and seats reclined flat. Service was good and friendly but it lacked the professionalism experienced on other premium carriers - the younger staff not as diligent as older staff. Food was good although the red wine was exceptional. Inflight not great but still had enough variety to pass the time. Return flight was on Boeing 777 in economy- surprised by the amount of legroom and comfort of seat - better than BA! Again found older staff better than younger staff. Food was disappointing although no worse than BA - I found the pre-landing snack inedible. Also I found the control functions for lights games and tv were not working. In fact the tv for both my wife and son were not working at all. Luckily I had my tablets and iPad! Overall I found AI no worse than travelling on BA. Service could be improved and some the aircraft facilities need updating but the same can be said for many other flag carriers.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,3,2,3,NA,NA,4,1

My travel was booked with a partner airline (who performed the next two legs of the journey) and as such when I tried to purchase extra leg room seating was refused. The only saving grace was that both flights were not full and was able to move to spare seats. Top marks for effort for those on the transfer desk in Singapore.

sas-scandinavian-airlines,/airline-reviews/sas-scandinavian-airlines,SAS Scandinavian customer review,J Aberg,Sweden,2015-03-04,CPH-LHR earlier today. I am travelling on this route every week and fly both BA and SAS depending on price and schedule. This morning I was booked on SAS and suffice to say it was not one of their finest moments. The flight was delayed and it turned out to be a two hour-delay before we finally reached London. The staff working onboard today's flight must have been through an unusually rough patch before getting onboard this flight. I have rarely seen a slower and more disengaged team of employees in any line of work. It took almost 45 minutes to dish out a few sandwiches and drinks. Need I say that at that pace the crew did not have the time to clear the trash before landing. Compared to BA and their upgraded cabins I think the SAS Airbus 321 is looking shabby. There is no finer way of putting it. If I am not mistaken this aircraft has not really been revamped since it was put into use about 15 years ago and it shows! I think it is high time for SAS to take some action here. All in all SAS are generally more expensive than BA on this route and I know this after flying every week on this route for a while. However paying more to go with SAS also means that you have to pay extra for food and drinks travel in a run-down cabin and may run into the team I had to endure today. Given that this is probably a very attractive segment for SAS I just do not understand why they provide such a poor-quality product and expect to get away with it.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,1,1,1,NA,NA,2,0

Whole family starving so whilst waiting for main meal we wanted to order from the Virgin inflight menu which was poor but we were hungry and happy to pay for the limited morsels on the menu. However there was no food to be ordered. After a long wait the main finally arrived which was fine.

On the 4th of July the plane was supposed to take off at 7.25pm (local hour) but at 9pm the plane was still taxiing to the runway. Except for this detail I enjoyed both flights. On the first flight (Lisbon-Rome) I found the breakfast surprisingly good (for an airline meal). The sandwich had a strange appearance but I wanted another one when I finished. On the second flight a light meal (not a full dinner) was served. I also found the potato puree with turkey sausages and bacon pretty tasty. The flight crew were also very nice and attentive although on the first flight they seemed a little tired. At least they were not rude and on the same flight I saw the flight attendants speaking Portuguese English Italian French and Spanish to the passengers. The seats were comfortable and the plane in general was clean. I also thought both landings were quite rough. If you are going on shorts flights with TAP please take a book or something else. If you don't you might get stuck watching the cartoon version of Mr Bean. In general if you are going on vacations and you don't mind getting late to your destination TAP is surely a good airline. If you are going on business trips don't fly with TAP: the flights can get late and the business class didn't seem much different from the economy class. It doesn't matter anyway: most of their planes only have one class (economy).,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,3,5,4,2,NA,NA,4,1
scoot,/airline-reviews/scoot,Scoot customer review,David Wright,Australia,2014-11-17,"I flew ScootBiz on two flights from Bangkok to Singapore and then from Singapore to Perth. The aircraft's were Boeing 777. The business class cabin was okay but the seats are not able to recline very much. The food was very basic but okay with just one drink being provided with the included fair. This airline needs to improve business class experience to make it worthwhile to ensure that there is priority boarding and exit from the aircraft using separate gate entry lanes and also priority luggage handling. There was no ""crowd"" control by flight staff on leaving the plane in Bangkok - with only 4 passengers in their business class on that flight the cabin was rapidly filled with passengers from economy competing to exit via the business class exit. There is no priority baggage handling for business class passengers. I had been unable to determine from their website how to access the inflight entertainment system with my tablet device so I had not downloaded the appropriate application before boarding the flight and could therefore not use it.

flybe,/airline-reviews/flybe,Flybe customer review,C Sharman,United Kingdom,2014-07-17,Possibly the worst airline in Europe. I travel regularly between Birmingham and Hanover on average once a week. In all the flights I have taken none have arrived on time. Some have been early I admit but none on time. This makes it extremely difficult to book onward public transport. The flight schedule appears to more of a target time than an actual departure/arrival time! After recently booking 6 flights each one had its schedule changed some of them twice. In the last episode the flight from Hanover to Birmingham arrived into Hanover late. Just to make things worse Flybe had forgotten to book assistance to remove the four wheelchair passengers from the inbound flight thus another twenty minutes to sort that out. The it was clearly a surprise to the staff in Birmingham that we actually made it back that night as they had forgotten to book the bus to get us off the aircraft and back to the terminal building another twenty minutes delay. This caused me to miss the last train out of Birmingham International and resulted in a £75 taxi fare to get home (more than the flight cost). I have taken nearly 30 flights with German Wings in this period of time from Stansted to Hanover. I would recommend anyone thinking of using Flybe use them. They have only been late once that was by twenty minutes. Their flights all use jets the flight is met with the gangway so no buses and most of the time they are cheaper! They also are pleasant and welcome your custom unlike Flybe who don't.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,3,1,0,0,NA,NA,3,0

I had a cruise booked from Southampton on the 31st August. We booked seats on the 10.45 flight from Manchester which would give use plenty of time to get the cruise. The first indication that something was wrong was at about 10.00 when the departure board detailed 'More info at 11.00' as 11.00 approached this was changed to 'More info at 11.30' then at 11.30 a departure time of 14.30 was given on the departure board this would have meant that we could just about make it to the cruise terminal in time. Alas this departure time crept ever further forward until reaching 15.35 which ‘surprise surprise’ was the time of a second Flybe flight to Southampton and which was cancelled earlier. Now call me cynical but it would appear that the two flights were rolled into one with the passengers being treated as numbers on seats and nothing more. It was more than likely known by Flybe that the departure time was always going to be 15:35 but they chose not to let the passengers know this.

I would highly recommend bringing your own food and snacks on board as the food served is absolutely dire. I know this is budget travel but seeing as the food service is about the only thing to look forward to while sitting for 10 hours surely they could do a little better!

I chose Royal Brunei based mainly on price but also friends experience but was still apprehensive. They proved to be a very good choice and certainly equal on balance to most full service airlines. From a service point of view I did not have one bad leg and the staff were very attentive - at least equal to Cathay and Qantas and better than the European carriers. The food on all legs was good. I had a special meal order and on each leg a crew member discussed it with me just after take-off. The 777s are about 12 years old but are in very good condition. The seats whilst starting to show their age are inclined flat beds and if you can't get comfortable and sleep well particularly with the big pillows and doona then you may just too picky. The IFE isn't the latest but does a reasonable job. I took and iPad with my own selections and the seats accept a standard power connector so no need to by special attachments. They use the Cathay business lounge in Melbourne a shared business lounge in Dubai and the excellent Etihad one in Heathrow.

Wonderful service from ground staff throughout. Smooth hotel stay (all inclusive) provided and perfectly arranged by EK in DXB due to long transfer.

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,Connie Green,United Kingdom,2014-05-19,Recently for our honeymoon we took advantage of a BA promo to fly in to Singapore and then to Hong Kong via Cathay Pacific and back to UK. Our flight out to Singapore was easy and relaxed because I think it was not a busy flight. We did ask to have a wedding photo canvas to be checked in to save us the hassle of lugging it around but was flatly refused. The canvas was less than 1kg properly packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. We understand BA has a one bag check in policy and no flexibility but we were not too bothered anyway although a little kind gesture would have been appreciated. Our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong was great! We were allowed to check in 3 pieces of luggage between 2 of us that weighed less than 40kg food was fantastic and the service was immaculate. On our way back to London we were excited as we knew we were flying the A380. SQ and Emirates have A380 we have flown. This turned out to be a mistake from the start. When we were checking in we were not allowed to check in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight of less than 40kg for all 3 items. When we got on the plane we were shocked to see how tiny the seats on the BA A380 were in comparison to SQ or even Emirates. Next we struggled to find an overhead cabin compartment for our hand luggage. The staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats. The ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. By the time the trolley came to us there were no more options for our breakfast and the food was just plonked on our trays. No apologies no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles! I was quite upset by now as I had to ask the stewardess what was being served. I have never felt more humiliated. With BA it was just silence. Miserable unhappy lifeless crews at work who can't seem to care less with their customers. No smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. Needless to say the highly unpopular dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched! Our overall flying experience with BA has been anything but pleasant friendly generous comfortable with delicious meals.

I've had several flights with them and it's been delayed countless of times. I fly enough to know that delays are inevitable and I do not blame them for this. However the problem is the lack of communication in their part to inform passengers about these delays. With any other airline if there is a delay all I have to do is wait a bit later in my home or office before heading out to the airport. But do not expect the same from them. Passengers find out about about these delays 30 minutes before the flight is supposed to board. The reason I am writing this unfavorable review is because every time the plane had never left Atlanta and/or another location that is literally 3-4 hours away. That means that while the plane has been sitting somewhere for 2 hours we are told about it 1 hour later and according to them it is only delayed for an hour - which I'll find out later on when they announce another flight delay.

monarch-airlines,/airline-reviews/monarch-airlines,Monarch Airlines customer review,B Gross,United Kingdom,2014-02-25,Last week I flew from Gatwick to Gambia. I have travelled world-wide in Economy with other airlines for much longer periods of time and although being cramped I have never had a problem. I never recline my seat however this journey was made extremely uncomfortable not by the person in front of me but the woman behind. For the first few hours of the flight she had had her feet digging into my back. An hour before we were due to land she woke up and I heard her tutting and mumbling then quite violently she shoved my seat forward and held it there. I was in a window seat in row 17 and had previously had the full view of my window and a bit of the one behind. Now I had half of my own window which shows how far forward she had rammed my seat. In response she hurled abuse at me saying that I have been squashing her the entire 6.5 hours etc. I was also quite relieved that I had just finished my cup of hot coffee that I was holding only minutes before. This of course is not a fault of the airline. I do however believe that if they want to reduce the space of the seats then they should not have the seats be able to recline or be moved at all. The plane was old and shabby and not ideal for a flight that long. I have been on shorter flights in Monarch planes that looked a lot better than this one. On the return flight I was at the back of the plane and nowhere near the group but as we geared up ready for take off suddenly all the power went out and there were a lot of ashen-faced passengers who were no doubt thinking that had better not happen in the air. We were switched to auxiliary power and told by a very apologetic pilot that it would not happen again. I will not be flying with Monarch again.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,3,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,0

It is only through desperation I use the airline now and I would willingly pay over their price to avoid it. As a frequent flyer from Saudi Arabia I find AF charter Saudi Air flights and pass them off as their own. For me this is unacceptable. If I wanted Saudi Air I would book Saudi Air. The toilets are always dirty and smelly the flight crew generally miserable and there are always extremely badly behaved kids crawling over the seats. What I've also found is the passengers here cannot wait for the plane to stop before they're out of their seats and there is no admonishment from the staff. The food is always bland and as cheap as possible they can't even be bothered buttering the sandwiches and the excuse for dinner is laughable. There is zero inflight entertainment. I've also had occasion to speak to the staff at CDG airport possibly the most frustrating airport in the world and they are the rudest I have ever come across.

Check-in at Athens was very slow and I ended up checking in after supposed closing time as a result which delayed flight. Staff couldn't give me a boarding pass and was advised to pick it up on arrival in Kiev. The flight from Athens to Kiev was on one of the newer aircraft and was fairly comfortable apart from the appalling legroom which seemed worse than Ryanair. One person at transfer desk was working at Kiev which lead to a very long queue and irate passengers who were afraid of missing connections. Another girl behind desk refused to serve anyone although seemed to be doing nothing. Kiev airport is new but lacking in personality and facilities. One small kiosk with long queue serving drinks and a few snacks. Flight to Kiev to London was on an older aircraft but had plenty of legroom. There were no air vents above seats which meant there was no way to cool down if hot. Constant air conditioning meant it was loud and uncomfortable and I began to feel ill after a while.

So on the return journey I lowered the bed close to but NOT to the lowest level and slept much better. Service was generally good although food variety and quality cannot be compared to SQ Biz class. But then we got the Swiss Biz class tickets during their promo period and thus we are not complaining. Lounge in Zurich was huge with good food and shower facilities and luggage arrived from Rome to Singapore via Zurich with no incidence overall a great airline!,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,4,4,4,NA,NA,5,1

Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport has a lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport. On the way back Qatar had a sand storm the terminal building was filled with sand and people were really suffering.

The 1st leg of the flight (Australia to KL) was in the premium flatbed seats which were quite comfy but the service on board was woeful some of the attendants treated us as an annoyance or inconvenience rather than a customer we had to ask 3 times to get the Entertainment tablets Samsung they were not handed to us automatically even though we pre-booked and we got a no answer as to if they were coming after asking for them hence asking 3 times. The flight attendants just left us alone the whole flight never checking if we needed anything or asking if we were OK or needed anything ie drink etc this was very poor customer service indeed. The food was rubbish the selection of movies and TV shows on the tablets was just dismal only a very small amount of movies or TV to choose from very disappointing indeed. Now after paying $4000 (premium seating) to fly you would expect that the 2 hour KL to Bangkok leg would be in a comfy seat as well?

cathay-pacific-airways,/airline-reviews/cathay-pacific-airways,Cathay Pacific Airways customer review,J Cooper,United Kingdom,2015-02-11,Our second experience flying with Cathay Pacific. Flew Manchester to Narita via Hong Kong and return in Business (January 2015). The service food and seat were all excellent on outbound and inbound legs on the 777-300 apart from the Hong Kong to Narita leg which was a regional configuration. I found the shell seat to be a little uncomfortable as I am 5ft 3in and could not get the leg rest to a comfortable angle with my legs and feet left dangling. Cathay uses a third party lounge at Manchester Terminal 2 which was small but adequate for a light breakfast. A member of Cathay ground staff escorted us all from the lounge to the boarding gate and we were boarded before the other passengers. A short transfer at HKG but the Wing lounge was very crowded. The First Class lounge was being upgraded so First passengers were allocated half of the Wing business section. It was almost impossible to find a seat. The return leg we found the Cathay lounge at Narita quite disappointing so used the JAL lounge instead which had a better selection of food and more comfortable seating. Boarding was a shambles however as we were called to the gate early. The flight was not yet open for boarding and the gate area was not big enough to accommodate everyone. Although there was a separate First/Business boarding lane this was so clogged with Economy passengers the staff gave up and just let everyone through regardless. However once on board the service was excellent and luckily the 777-300 had the long haul flat-bed seats. Transit through HKG was swift and we decided to use the Bridge lounge which was not very crowded and had a very good selection of food and drinks. We had time for a shower and relax before the HKG-MAN flight at 01.00 am. Unfortunately when we got to the gate for boarding the plane had not been towed onto stand so we had to stand around for about 45 minutes before boarding started. Here though once started the boarding was much more organised and the First/Business passengers were boarded first with less of a scrum to get on board. The flight was very bumpy which meant we did not get as much sleep as we had hoped but we arrived on time even though we had departed late. Manchester airport immigration was empty at 6.20 am so we got through and collected our luggage in about 15 minutes. Apart from the chaotic boarding at Narita and the poor lounge we would certainly choose to fly CX again.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,4,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

Much to my disappointment I found the flight was quite empty at check in the flight looked full when we left there were 6 to 8 rows empty. Air Asia send out so many promos enticing us to buy empty seats for a flat bed. My only conclusion would be that the airline books them out to try and make the flight full to get us to upgrade. Staff were excellent and friendly food was great value for money. Arrived in KL on time there was queues just to get into the airport itself and immigration would not even fast track people with flights that were leaving soon. KL LCCC is a huge let down but the fact is for the money you pay for you need to put up with it.

We also noticed that our seats had bigger leg room unfortunately the ones behind us had less. Why this is I don't know. Did we pay a bit more so that we were afforded this comfort? We were also assigned no 13 seats on our return flight so we were anticipating a comfortable ride but we were fortunately upgraded to premium Rouge so it was even so much better! Can't explain this either but I'm not complaining! Food was not the best but reasonable the premium rouge was not that much better but was ok. Drinks were constantly offered in our outbound journey no alcohol though. In premium alcohol was free but it was the cheap kind. Nothing different from what other airlines offer. Air hostesses and stewards friendly and helpful the toilets were relatively clean so nothing to complain about really! Check in both ways were easy boarding was ok.

Most recently was kept waiting in terminal at Kabul for 9.5 hours to finally leave for Istanbul only to then make a stop in Tehran that was unexpected even for the Iranian officials that boarded the plane on the tarmac asking the flight crew why they had stopped there. The flight attendants give very little customer service particularly to those in business class (unless you are paying for just the extra space dont bother wasting the money) and usually spend most of their time applying makeup or talking to one another while they make each other drinks (but neglect their customers who are watching). Have had office staff give incorrect flight schedules to me resulting in extra days of layovers in various locations and when I complained about this to management we were openly laughed at by counter representative.

I see that the same aircraft is going back and forth between Honolulu Lihue and Lanai and Kapalua but when the delays piggyback the Molokai flight will be pushed back to accommodate the passengers on later flights to other destinations. Customer service podium is empty with no notification of delay until you look at the flight board. We can see the customer service personnel on the ramp laughing and chatting with co-workers they show no concern for all the passengers in the terminal waiting for someone to come in. When you finally get a hold of someone and ask them what's the delay they say its due to the late arrival of the aircraft. We were delayed 3 times because management changed their mind on where the plane should go. It was announced that when our aircraft comes from Lihue it will continue on to Molokai however when the plane lands they change their mind and inform us its going to Lanai on time. This causes us to be pushed back 2 more hours. Don't get on the new planes they cant land on Molokai and Lanai with more than half a load of passengers. It takes 3 times longer to board and unload.

Well no longer so: Since 15th February CSA has quietly reduced service for economy passenger in a way that puts them just one step ahead of low cost/low service carriers like Air Baltic or Easyjet. They still offer one small sandwich and one non alcoholic beverage. If you want to drink more or have a wine you must pay for it. In addition they have nearly doubled the fees for excess baggage and have adopted a strict zero tolerance policy: If you have more than 20 Kilos you pay. In the past they were a bit lenient.

pegasus-airlines,/airline-reviews/pegasus-airlines,Pegasus Airlines customer review,F MacKillop,France,2014-04-19,Pegasus ok for short haul only.

Chaotic unfriendly and unpleasant boarding process. Domestic flights feeding international flights almost always significantly late with no reasons/excuses offered. SAW airport a pain to get from domestic to international; thought it'd be better than IST but is very similar in terms of very poor circulation between the two terminals badly organized immigration procedures (a Turkish forte if ever there was one) and an abysmal 'food' selection at extortionate prices (just like IST in that regard).

My partner was flying to Stansted which is about 40 Miles north of London. After 5 minutes of standing in the queue the Ryanair person working at the desk disappeared and was talking to her friend at the hand luggage and boarding card control desk. I went over and asked her why she was not manning the desk any more and she said ""because I only take luggage 40 minutes before take-off"". When I said ""but we were waiting there and you closed the desk without even telling us"" she then lost her patience and got really rude. Subsequently we paid the 60 euros.

This is fantastic option to increase the number of destinations that you can fly too. However after a recent experience I was disappointed to discover that some code share options with Air NZ have concealed conditions that are not in line with what you normally expect from an Air NZ flight. From the check in to the amount of baggage to the inflight entertainment - nothing in this case. Yes this is the Virgin Australia and Air NZ code share agreement. The Works is far from 'The Works' that you would receive on an Air NZ plane. Yes good bye unlimited drinks hello one drink. Good by movies hello you can rent one if you would like. I maybe misreading what the works means but to me that generally means everything not a limited sub-par arrangement that they currently have with Virgin.

The Lounge was full to capacity and it was difficult to find a seat with flights going via Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne all around the same time. However the food in the lounge is exceptionally good compared to competitor offerings at the moment. Onboard the business class standard on the A380 was poor in hospitality comparison to current competitors. Young inexperienced staff surprisingly lacking basic etiquette and manners. Staff looked tired and despondent. During the flight I was either served twice or not at all. Despite the new A380 I was surrounded with broken and depreciated equipment. Meal service very average. The staff just seemed to want to rush and close down the service as quickly as possible. The pricing is definitely competitive and if hospitality isn't important and you just want to nod off this could still be a good way to travel. For me the quality is just not good enough in hospitality for business class. Its not just about the IFE and the swish seating capsule. The outbound flight with Air New Zealand may have lacked the latest technology and wizardry in cabin design but made up for it in spades in terms of hospitality professionalism and overall comfort. Have used Emirates a couple of times over the last few years and couldn't fault them previously. Will avoid them for a while. Clearly lost something as I didn't feel looked after on this occasion.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,2,3,1,2,3,NA,NA,4,0

united-airlines,/airline-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Tom Wooge,United States,2015-01-30,In-flight service is long out the window video entertainment is endless infomercials and the last scraps of legroom have vanished into thin air. On a recent full flight from Newark to Los Angeles a new super skinny seating was encountered that climbs to a whole new altitude of pain and suffering. When reputable airlines change to slim seats the airline gets more seats on the plane and passengers get a bit more legroom but at United this would never fly. United now using Continentals short-haul 737-900s on long-haul routes has extra extra seats that don’ t quite fit. To make passable exit row clearance seats behind are compacted to even less than their typical 30-inch seat pitch on this aircraft - less than the 31-inches specified for many other flights - and much less than the 32-inches United advertises when selling economy seats. My seat had only 2-feet clear butt-to-shin with perhaps an additional 4-inch knee-high seatback thickness - probably a 28-inch pinch - or less! When the passenger in front tried repeatedly to recline - there being no extra room it was impossible. The passenger drew a cabin attendant to complain that I would not allow the seat to recline. The attendant seriously explained to me that the passenger had purchased a ticket entitling them to my leg space and may fully recline the seat. Unfazed the attendant told me that if I wanted extra legroom I should have purchased an“Economy-Plus” seat. I asked how much it would cost but there were no free seats - at any price. I explained that I did not need extra legroom just sufficient room - which they were not providing. Not reconciled to the laws of physics the attendant continued insisting that this was all my fault - that I was taking up space that I was not entitled to - and had me turn sideways putting my knees in the aisle so the seat could recline. My shoulder was now in the way of the seat. I could not turn back either and complained that the vending carts would hurt my legs even more than the seatback. Only then did the attendant finally suggest that the other passenger switch seats with their adjacent small child. For $25 a luggage bag had more space than me - and was treated much better!,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

Arriving 45 mins before is mandatory as the check-in closes immediately 45 mins prior to take off. I arrived 1.5 hours early to be sure and that was plenty of time. The plane took off on time and landed on time- all I required. Staff are friendly. Seats are smaller than other airlines which may be a problem for some people. Flying in and out of Melbourne means T4 which is a smaller terminal just south of Tullamarine's T1 T2 and T3.

We had booked an all inclusive holiday thinking it would be easier and stress free for once. How wrong can you be! We arrived at Gatwick on 11th July at 3pm for a flight due to leave at 5.20pm to be told at check-in that it was delayed by over 6 hours! We were given £15 each towards food and drink and as everybody will know that didn't go very far at the airport. On the plane they tried to convince us to buy bottles of water telling us it would be too late to get anything from the hotel - this was not the case. We finally got to our hotel room around 4 in the morning. The Rep wasn't particularly apologetic for the delay. On departure day 18th July we were picked up at 6.55pm and told our flight was delayed by an hour. This seemed ok after the dreadful start the week before. We got to the airport was left in a queue by the Rep who wished us all a good trip back. After around an hour in the queue without much happening somebody came back to say that our flight was now delayed until the next afternoon. The Rep should have known this and not taken us away from the hotel. At this point it was chaos the Rep didn't reappear until around 9.15pm and despite everyone asking him for information he didn't seem to know much and was very slow to sort transport back to the hotel. We finally made it to our hotel around 10.40pm nearly 4 hours after leaving for no reason. We were picked up again to go to the airport for a second time at 10am the next morning and the flight was delayed even more - instead of leaving at 1.10pm we finally took off at 2.50pm.

The trip down on flight 581 was severely delayed. Taxied down the runway only to have to come back to the gate when a warning light on the navigation system came on just before take off. At the gate 20+ minutes later they thought they had it all sorted out and were wrapping up paperwork went to push back from the gate and the light came on again. Thankfully after a few more minutes they let us off the plane and kept us in the terminal. Flight eventually was given permission to travel without the navigation systems but had to redirect flight path and had to fly at a lower altitude to avoid traffic. This crew was friendly and polite and the pilot kept us informed of all the things that were happening. The major downfall our flight landed almost 4 hours later than scheduled and the only compensation we received was a free $2.00 beverage. Flight 580 the next day was better in some ways worse in others. Again taxied down the runway and were next to take off when a warning light came on. We sat on the runway for about 30 minutes waiting for the issue to be fixed. Sadly the crew was very rude both in person and on the intercom barking orders and coming dangerously close to a yelling tone with passengers. This was not my first poor trip with Allegiant but it will be the last. The low ticket price is no longer a selling feature since they gouge you on fees for everything including printing a simple boarding pass.

The leg from BAH-MCT was in a fairly old plane and the seats were showing signs of wear. The lounge in Bahrain airport was comfortable and spacious though they don't give announcements for flights so you just have to make your way down to the gate at about the right time (which for us was always too early).

american-airlines,/airline-reviews/american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N Smith,United States,2014-08-06,My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products). The flight attendant was also quite attentive and spoke with us by name. We felt very well taken care of.,NA,NA,First Class,NA,9,4,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

We were devastated by the transformation from the old Cub to the new Club class. The seats were very uncomfortable there were more seats added to the cabin and the service was anything but good. On the way home September 28 2012 we were treated to the old Club class on a plane that had not been refurbished. The difference was amazing - smaller amount of club seats much more comfortable and roomier seats with absolutely great service.

In my humble opinion it just not worth flying premium class for a two hour trip. HK to London (CX255) quite disappointed compare to my excellent flight to HK The seats was a little worn and hard the cabin had a lot of scruff marks one hot towel before dinner and one hot towel before breakfast dinner was good breakfast wasn't. Hardly saw any cabin crew between dinner and breakfast. I really do feel they need to make the premium class a little bit special small touches such as proper cups for tea or coffee proper glass and not plastic cup for drinks armchair style seats perhaps in leather would be nicer the TV was awkward to raise (seat 30G) dinner tray was a tad too small charging point for mobile phone was awkward.

Wasn't impressed with their business class offerings compared to EK Qantas or SQ. Comparable to the old biz class seats from their 777 and 747 which reclines at an angle. The saving grace for this airline is the exceptional crew. Genuine hospitality and very warm personnel. The highlight of this trip has be about how bad the food was. Was served satay which was excellent as usual but they now serve a menu done by Chef Zubir of Masterchef Malaysia. Huge disappointment. Beef ribs were inedible as it was tough changed to the cod which was surprisingly too sweet.

Like many on this site I had assumed that I would be flying Egypt Air but was very surprised when I arrived at the airport with the tour group and saw the ancient DC9 on the tarmac. I'm a nervous flyer anyway and so really had to weight up how much I wanted to see the sites. I decided seeing as my tour manager does this every week and that he's still here that there must be an element of safety! The safety announcement lasted approx 30 secs and did not involve lifejacket demonstrations (you also fly over Lake Nasser not just desert). They omitted the safety demonstration on the flight back. People were using their mobiles throughout the flight and the cockpit door was propped open frequently. Security was a joke. Our boarding passes had random names on (no form of ID was ever seen nor asked for) and we were allowed any type of fluid with us they just didn't bother to check. Everyone beeped as they went through the walk through scanners and no one was patted down. The plane was in a poor state with many seats broken what appeared to be parcel tape holding things together and the constant smell of fuel. I would never choose to fly Air Memphis again and would recommend that people make their own arrangements to fly Egypt Air instead.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

All flights were way above average - and I know what I am talking about because in the past 12 months I have flown on TG QF VN SQ NZ and PX on more than 50 return flights. I actually hate flying but have to fly to my place of assignment but flying Turkish Airlines is very good. Most cabin staff - male or female - are very good to excellent (several among the best I have ever dealt with) the food is very good IFE way above average and aircraft in very good condition (staff make sure toilets are always kept clean and are up there TG QF CX and NZ). My only real grip is rush rush at transit - Istanbul Airport not the best in the world although Turkish Airlines Lounge must be one of the best - and one of the A321 I flew on from Istanbul to Tashkent had several rows of non-reclining seats (mine 9C) so I must read Seat Guru more carefully in future.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,9,4,5,5,5,NA,NA,5,1

We boarded plane on time but sat waiting for over 1 hour with no explanation from the pilot or flight attendants. One passenger finally fed up made a comment to one of the flight attendants stating that someone should make some kind of announcement as to what was going on. Shortly thereafter the pilot made an announcement that the problem was an oxygen tank in the cockpit. Flight attendants were very rude and chatted amongst themselves most of the time. Our second and last time was the end of April. It should be noted both flights were booked at the same time otherwise we would have gone with another airliner. Flight was to leave at 7.20am but arrived late. Announcement was made that there will be a further delay because apparently the plane had hit a bird and it was to undergo an engine check. Pilots and flight attendants left the plane and 2 hours later it was fixed pilots boarded however no flight attendants were to be found another 1/2 hour passed before the attendants arrived. We finally boarded and made it home. On both flights the attendants could have been more respectful and just polite. Food purchases available could broadened.

ScootBiz was awesome and well worth the extra. I have flown Premium Economy with JAL before and it was terrible compared to ScootBiz.

Staff were helpful and attentive plane left on time and arrived on time. Flight back to London two weeks later was just as good despite being an overnight flight. Although the seats do not go flat they reclined enough to allow me to get some sleep.

When we finally took off the pilot soon broke the news that the fault had re-occured during take off and we had to return to Luton after burning off some fuel hence the flight going no-where. When back on the ground at 0400 the ground crew really tried their best to provide options but when you have such a tiny fleet these options didnt include transfering to another plane sadly.

Another time I was reading a magazine and they turned the cabin lights off - the flight attendant passing by turned on my light without me even looking up. On the plane they introduce each staff member by name and do a little on board circulation exercise with you before you land. If you book their Spring plus seats you also get an exclusive van to take you to the tarmac instead of cramming onto the bus. There is also complimentary food.

Nice friendly and subtle staff unlimited tea and coffee and if you've been good and somehow found yourself in SAS plus (no idea what I did to deserve this but it was cheaper than economy) you can have as many treats from the buy-on-board menu as you like. The lounges in ARN and OSL were both nice well lit and calm but with very traditional Scandinavian food (which I love but perhaps not everyone does.) Generally on time but OSL-LHR was 20 minutes late due to the ""absence of the crew"" (did they get lost?!) They seem to be moving over to letting you download newspapers and magazines through their app rather than giving so many out - hard to read on a phone and doesn't work on the Kindle so it wasn't ideal for me as I didn't have a tablet. SAS is an airline I want to love.

Never again! The Premium check-in queue turned out to be slower than the 'normal' queues. The Sydney lounge is utterly awful worn out furniture (holes in the arms of chair I sat in) and dreadful food. Yes the drinks are free but t's a huge price to pay for a couple of G&Ts.

Two were on the A380 one on the B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant.

On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all.

The biggest let down about Spicejet is the fact that they have a very extensive food menu but they don't have any food or beverages onboard (except for water). I had pre-booked and paid for a meal (Chicken Sandwich) for my onward flight which was never served to me. The reason given to me was that there was no food available onboard. Don't get fooled by the pre-booking discount (20%) they offer as they charge a convenience fee which eventually escalates the price more than buying the same meal on flight.

My mouth went sandpaper dry and I felt quite faint only to arrive at the next flight to find the gate closed! It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay.

Mid section washrooms should have been back 5 or more rows to balance 'demand' front and rear.

The airline changed their baggage allowance in mid October and on their website they give carry on dimensions that are wrong. My bag was an inch higher than their metal box that the carry on has to fit even though I had done the measurements before leaving on the trip. I was charged the equivalent of $25.00. I had also booked and paid for emergency row seats and was told that I hadn't booked them. Then I realized that they had given us someone else's boarding cards. When I spoke with an agent I was given my appropriate boarding cards without any apology at all.

When I boarded I found my seat 3-A to not fully recline. The amount of leg room wasn't enough to cross my leg at the ankle and the general appearance was worn out and dirty. Once we were in the air the man in front of me reclined and I was no longer able to reach my bag under the seat. Now I would expect this in a coach seat but again they're calling this first class. I was served a lacklustre although well presented breakfast of eggs with tomato and asparagus a potato cake and fresh (ish) fruit. The flight attendant in my cabin was prompt and polite but the announcement about Alaska air credit cards droned on for what seemed like an eternity.

Business Class almost fully lie flat. Service on board top notch though food options limited on this short sector. They ran out of prawn salad when they came to my seat and option was only a hot snack plate nothing top brawl about. I could have as many as I wanted however. Denied my so much wanted cheese plate as this is not offered for short sectors (likewise no amenity kit). FA's were in a sparkling mood lifting the whole thing. Drink service quick and fairly frequent. Many drink options inc. three different champagnes and pre-take-off drinks offered. Economy class on way back was also about as good as it gets.

This one and-a-bit hour flight was due to leave at 1430. Be aware that when you fly on Libyan Arab Airlines you will be bussed to a very distressed 30 year old 727-200. We boarded the plane only half an hour late because of a “security” agent in dark glasses and an Armani- type suit (jacket draped over the shoulders) who laboriously checked documents of all passengers on the 40 degree tarmac. The interior of the plane was so hot probably 50 degrees) that the older passengers were dropping like flies which further delayed the departure by a couple of hours. Sitting beside me fanning himself at high speed (the interior was now like 120 large beserk butterflies) was a flight engineer for LN who explained that there were no spare parts for the Auxiliary Power Unit that provides the AC so that’s why it was hot. I thought that this was not the moment to ask if there could be similar spares shortages for the main engines. People perked up above 10000 feet when they recovered and the cabin crew were not as aggressive as they were on the ground. Your heart goes out to these folks who are on these planes it’s both unpleasant and dangerous work.

air-canada-rouge,/airline-reviews/air-canada-rouge,Air Canada rouge customer review,A Johnson,Canada,2015-03-18,I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for. I'm sitting here in the airport probably with 100+ passengers looking as exhausted and frustrated as I am and probably thinking the same thing - never again.

The service if you can call it that was terrible not one apology for the delay and a complete lack of interest by the cabin crew. We were lucky to be staying in Havana for three days so did not have to get an internal flight. Our flight back was by another airline as Cubana has problems with its planes again Euro Atlantic which is a charter airline just as bad as Cubana no entertainment toilets not serviced etc. We can only say that we would not fly with either of these airlines again even if they paid us to. If you have the opportunity to fly with another airline even if it costs more then we would suggest you take it.

This time however they informed me that they have introduced the new 777-300's and they have Business Premium. They assured me it is ""Better than the old first class"". They convinced me so I booked. I am now en-route and have hit my first obstacle in LAX. Even though I booked as high of a class offered on my flight I cannot access the First Class lounge. Quite frankly I've put in over 25 years of the Asian travel and during my lay- overs the First Class lounges are much nicer than the Business class lounges. I am now at the Taipei airport Business Lounge and the food and amenities are spare. I have been told they do not offer bottled water. Sounds like I'm complaining I'm really not. Just disappointed. The fare that I paid was in the same ball park of what I've always paid for their First Class and when I have longer lay overs it's nice to have the amenities (food etc.) especially when your paying first class fare. It's clear that China Airlines can get many more of the Premium Business class seats in the airplane but I think they need to understand what their customers seeking First Class ( and are willing to pay for it) expect. The seating compartments on the plane were fine however the food and service was not like First Class.

I checked in with no problems at Gatwick but as soon as I got through security I saw that my flight was delayed by 1.5 hours - could have been communicated at check in. This meant that I would miss my connection. Onboard crew apologised for the delay (which was due to the aircraft waiting for passengers transferring from a delayed Buenos Aires flight - but lots of people on my flight were transferring across Spain and to Caracas and missed their flights.) The seats were comfortable and crew very friendly. On arrival in Madrid people were waiting for us to give new boarding passes. I was put in business class on a Spanair flight 2 hours later and Air Europa paid for a meal and to use their lounge.

One hour delay on the flight to LHR due to a passenger off load but I can forgive that as it's outside of their control. New 777 business class is excellent particularly the seat comfort. Agree with comments about the food a bit hit and miss and strange that you have to say which of the wines you want when you order from the menu also a bit odd to make your choice for the meal served just before landing before you actually take off.

My flight was scheduled to depart LAX at 9.40pm and I checked in at Delta's Priority counter around 8:00pm and proceeded quite quickly thru security and found my way to a very crowded SkyClub. When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA.

Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline.

On disembarking the aircraft we had requested airport assistance but were told just to make our way to the doors of the aircraft where we would be met by porters with wheelchairs along with everyone else leaving the aircraft not an easy proposition for a 80 year old disabled person.

That becomes a real hassle if you coming back into the US and have to go through immigration and border control. The airline does not allow enough time for this! Study their website in every detail and do your math before you book you will end up being better off initially paying more with other airlines. There is a boarding check-in charge of $10 per person each way if not done on the internet which is hard to do for your return trip since you need to print your boarding pass.

Air Canada's new inflight entertainment system is incredibly responsive and has a great user interface. It is by far the best system I've experienced on a plane. It kept me occupied for the entire flight. The armrest controls on the other hand could have used some additional thought as it was placed on the surface of the armrest rather than the side and resulted in frequent accidental presses.

Good looking and clean planes and pleasant crew even if not super friendly in some cases. The food quality is slightly above average even though they should serve bigger portions. On the minus side I have to mention the entertainment system which should be upgraded as the selection is rather limited and it needed to be rebooted several times during the 12-hour flight from Milan to Sao Paulo. All flights were on time except the GRU-ASU which left one hour late because of a missing passenger whose luggage had to be offloaded (this apparently simple operation seemed to take ages).

They then booked us on two different flights - one for the evening in question the other a few days later. It took another hour to convince them to fix this. The plane was about 2 hours which meant that we arrived in Melbourne after 7pm and consequently wasted an entire day. The in- flight crew were pleasant enough. The return flight was also cancelled and re-booked for earlier on in the day - meaning we lost the 2nd of our 4 day holiday in Melbourne.

virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,J Denis,Australia,2014-06-16,Recently flew Athens-Abu Dhabi-Sydney with Etihad. We had pre-allocated our seating (2 seats down the back A&C) as my wife and I wanted to avoid people climbing over us at night. We got shunted to BC seats with A also occupied and Etihad would not change it or offered a reason. Exactly what we did not want. Unbelievable. The plane was only 60% full and there was no need to cram us into ABC seats. Unbelievable? We checked our original seat allocation and found a 5 year old occupying AC spots with parents in middle section with spare seating alongside. Pretty Poor. When I moved after takeoff into a spare aisle seat with no one beside me the flight attendant moved 2 people beside me in the middle of the night. Unbelievable again when there were spare seats around. Never again with Etihad.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,1,1,1,2,4,NA,NA,2,0

Make sure you understand the bag charges and pay for them if you can before you leave your house. Otherwise it will cost more at the airport.

The lady helping me, who was trying very hard to try and lower the price, ended up knocking it down to about $300 US. Part of this issue was that they charged me for oversize and overweight for my ski bag. Most airlines charge a base $100 and the weight doesn't matter unless it's over the 70lbs max weight. Another lady working had rudely told me that I was not allowed to have three pairs of skis in my bag, even though there was nothing I could do about it. She ""let it slide"" and charged me instead.

Poor trip back (Colombo/London). Scruffy old aircraft with broken seats. Every seat taken. Cabin crew had attitude problems towards passengers and disappeared behind their curtain. Annoyed if disturbed. Water/juice which wasn't offered. Although menu given most dishes were not available so you had no choice if you were hungry. Crew obviously had no idea how to serve alcohol as was given 3/4 glass full of gin and virtually no tonic. This might sound good but not on 12 hr. flight! Toilets dirty.

We were allocated seats near the back of the plane which were fine but a little noisy. Legroom was adequate. Seats were comfortable. Flight left on time. Inflight entertainment we had pre-booked was limited with games and movies particularly for children's entertainment. We had pre-ordered a tablet each and the battery life was inadequate on the tablets and did not last the entire flight. The entertainment was collected 1 hour before landing. I think half an hour would have been fairer. Flight attendants were pleasant but not overly approachable and when I ordered a couple of bottles of water they took at least half an hour for me to get them. We brought our own snacks so didn't order from inflight service. The communication from the pilot during the flight was appropriate.

We flew with a toddler and they took extra care of us. Our travel agent made an error and booked an infant meal when it should have been a child's meal the staff went out of their way to find suitable food and made sure that the meals were correct on the next to legs of the journey. It was good to get off the plane in Brunei and Dubai to stretch your legs. The fasten seat belts sign did not come on for turbulence once the whole way from Auckland-London and I felt the flight crew were trying to avoid bad weather to make the flight more comfortable.

At 13.00 informed the flight was delayed due to some unknown and unexplained technical fault and we would get more information at 14.00. At 14.00 a very brief announcement was made over the airport public address system that “the flight has been cancelled and travellers are requested to reclaim their baggage and report to the Flybe desk”. We were shunted from pillar to post. Eventually we reclaimed our luggage and waited in a long queue at the Flybe desk. We were luckily given 2 seats on the next Glasgow flight (BE129 due to leave at 16.10) and a paltry £5 food voucher!

Why bother to watch a movie on a 2-3 hr flight as you would never get to see it all. No more place to charge devices either. Air Canada had a pretty good thing going and now it has taken a turn for the worse again. Whom ever thought up Rouge was obviously not the sharpest knife in the drawer.

These planes are quite comfortable with more legroom than 737-800's. While service was good it was also a bit slack in parts. Plane was full (125 pax) dinner was served but no drink service. Dinner would have been nice if not overcooked. Dried pasta and limp bok choy with chicken. We were told drinks would be served after dinner after we buzzed flight attendants asking for a wine. That is fine though a bit annoying but the flight crew took their time in serving as they fussed over some baby.

Breakfast tasty if only lacking in quantity. On 5 hour domestic flights only water and 1 non alcoholic drink served plus coffee/snack on outbound. Effectively operates a no frills model domestically even if you travel on a transatlantic ticket. They should issue free vouchers at least for people travelling long haul although no charge for checked bags on such ticket. AVOD installed on transatlantic temperamental but did work and headsets now free. Would not pay a premium to fly this carrier but as price paid for an open jaw return significantly lower than more premium carrier options was worth doing.

For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets.

Both sectors quite full and the flight RUH-BAH was on time and uneventful basic snack for such a short sector seats in economy not overly generous with space but sufficient. I then had a long lay-over in BAH before boarding my flight to LHR which give me time for shopping at the airport! The next sector was comfortable except for a couple of ladies sat behind me kicking the back of my seat as they were trying to move family all over the cabin. in addition I found these same ladies to be quite selfish with the passengers behind them insisting on reclining their seats while the meal service was on. I was pleased thought to see the GF Cabin Crew to take control of both situations in a pleasant but firm way and eventually the ladies calmed down. The flight itself was pleasant and fro an economy product the food both super and breakfast and entertainment was excellent. The crew made me feel comfortable and the offer of refreshments were plenty. I even managed to get a few hours’ sleep on the flight which left me refreshed when I arrived at LHR. One minor irritation was when we arrived we had to wait over 40 minutes for our baggage to be delivered to the belt.

United has gotten me back to and from in one piece but nothing from my 10 hour journey with them in a single day has been impressionable which brings me to conclude that perhaps that's all this airline is trying to achieve unlike some of its peers. Back and forth from Los Angeles to Austin I was able to get some rest and the buy on board food purchase wasn't half bad. The flight attendants on most of my flights were much younger than the usual veteran crew that I encounter on their flights therefore enthusiastic.

The plane had a new fresh cabin smell with the latest seats and AVOD entertainment. The AVOD was easy to use and had up to date movies. Music selection was really good for Asian music with new mandopop albums available. Inflight service was conducted but there was barely any 'proper' service. Due to the midnight flight we were given a snack box containing cold food. Terrible offering. A box of iced lemon tea was given. Service was by request after that and I got a gin and tonic on request. Trays of water were carried out twice.

Unfortunately it wasn't until I made my reservation that I noticed a review (1/2 stars) that they are consistently delayed.

Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile. Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off.

I do not know how Air Canada can pass off this ""Business Class"" on their Rouge flight as equal to their normal Business Class accommodation which they offer. Clearly I questioned the Aeroplan representative when told we would fly home on Rouge and was told it is the same as regular Air Canada Business Class although not the pods but with adequate comfort and leg room. To say that the seating was inadequate would be an understatement. We have traveled Air Canada Business Class annually YVR to OGG and have never encountered such sub-standard cramped seating with minimal leg room. My husband and I are tall people this being one of the reasons we choose Business or Executive Class. I was barely able to walk when we finally landed in Vancouver. This type of accommodation can cause a health issue for many people. You charge for Executive Class and provide less than adequate Economy seating. Since 2004 we have travelled to Maui annually and paid the extra Aeroplan points for the comfort of the Business Class. In our estimation we got less than Economy. Most of the Canadians whom we encountered on Maui who had flown Air Canada Rouge Business Class were horrified and the reports we received were of great concern to us. Even though we had been privy to these negative comments we felt that being Air Canada it could not be that unsatisfactory. Therefore based on past experience we embarked upon this flight with open minds. We were quite incorrect it was far worse than anything we could have imagined. This is gross misrepresentation on the part of Aeroplan and Air Canada.

Food was decent and plentiful. Both flights departed exactly on time. The de-planing process upon landing was very quick. The Bad: Exceedingly uncomfortable seats. They are lumpy and hard which, for a long haul (12 hour) flight, was terrible. In Tokyo, I was absolutely dreading my return flight home on these seats. To mitigate the discomfort, I purchased an inflatable ""donut ring"" cushion and sat on that on the flight home. If you take JAL, please consider bringing an inflatable cushion along. The USB charger outlets that are so prominently advertised as a great feature of the Dreamliner do not work. On both flights, I tried the outlets at my seat and my husbands and asked several fellow passengers if j could try theirs. I tried at least 7 or 8 outlets on both flights. They do not work.

Security marred by a family carrying unrevealed bottles and liquids that was a field day for the security staff and simply a pain for the rest of us queuing behind them. The Cyprus airways lounge whilst much better than its predecessor is still third rate with a poor selection of food and wine and on this occasion overcrowded. Wandered to the gate in good time for boarding to be confronted by a flotilla of wheelchair-bound passengers all of whom get ultra priority boarding. So boarding took longer despite the fact that whilst Business class was almost full economy wasn't. On-board service was ok.

The A380 was nothing special at all unless you were in first class. There is no economy comfort you just pay extra to sit in the exit row. The flight attendants bring drinks and food exactly twice and no more. The plane is gigantic but somehow they really squished all those seats in there. I don't normally fly this route usually I fly with KLM through Amsterdam and I am always pleased with their service.

Since it was 2am and I would be in the plane for 11 hours I wanted to sleep For some reason my seat didn't recline. I told the cabin crew they smiled and changed my seat. I then slept. I woke up toward the end of the flight and breakfast wasn't served yet. Even though it was like 10 am.

Received an SMS that the flight had been delayed to 18.00 then further delayed to 20.00. When I arrived at the airport to check in told that the flight was delayed until 00.45. No information coming out of the Kulula desk other than mixed reports. The only compensation we received was a meal voucher. Flight further delayed until 01.30 in the morning. The Kulula desk took our details and assured us there would be a taxi at the other end. When we arrived at Lanseria airport - no taxis in sight. When the 'shuttle' arrived it was a lone taxi driver. At no point did we receive any apology or plausible explanation. On top of that the 'quirky' in-flight announcements were not funny (not at 01.30 in the morning).

This, one might be able to understand  until you see a JetBlue flight taking off with a departure set for one minute past Spirit's set departure time to the exact same airport allegedly experiencing weather problems. I should also add, the Spirit plane was at the gate and the crew were on board. They deplaned! With zero help from Spirit, I managed to get a JetBlue flight to DCA. On my return flight I tragically stayed with Spirit. The flight was on time, but there were no gates for the plane to use. We were one full hour delayed due to slow scheduled flights. Then, while on the plane, we had to wait for 20 planes ahead of us. I've flown tightly packed jets before so I didn't think it could get any more ridiculous. Suffice to say it was more ridiculous. If you are a man of simply avg height you will be extremely uncomfortable. There might be 12 inches of leg room on an airbus 320. That is being generous. It feels more like 10. Pity the fool in the middle or window seat. Beyond this I had to fight over the price of my bag. I paid for a bag both coming and going. They claim I bought one way for the bag. So because I got refunded the trip to NYC, including the bag, I had to buy another bag fee. If there is any good thing to say - spirit has non reclining seats.

Two crew were working in the J cabin (including senior crew member). Load of J cabin only 6. They handed out the menu for the service before take-off which had hot breakfast choices. After take-off the crew started the service. Without any interaction the crew member came and passed me the tray. Tray consisted of a fruit yoghurt croissant and a selection of cheese. Never asked me if I would like anything to drink or which hot meal choice I would like. I got up to visit the toilet before the seatbelt sign came on. The J cabin toilet was unusable for its respective cabin customers as the crew allowed a Y cabin customer to use the toilet and he threw a whole tree of paper in the toilet. The other crew member asks me finally if I would like to have anything to drink. Asked for a Turkish coffee. After I came out asked a crew member to take my tray. Then comes my coffee. That's when the seatbelt sign came on. Nobody came to secure the cabin before landing. Landed in Thessaloniki. Waited for our luggage on the carousel only to find the priority bags arriving last.

We had hoped we could make other arrangements that day but that was out of the question. They could 'maybe' get us to our destination the next day, late afternoon after an 8 hour excursion (I believe Denver is a 1 or 2 hour flight from Minneapolis) but there were no guarantees either. No food allowance or room accommodation would be given either. As we were attending a conference this didn't make any sense so we ended up getting a refund. We did find out later there were other flights on other airlines that could of got us there on time, the Spirit staff are not or maybe are not allowed to be that helpful. There was no empathy on their part, it was almost like they had grown used to this, judging by the many reviews, this is a common occurrence. You have to feel bad for the front line staff at Spirit.

However they did manage to have time to walk the isles offering duty free for purchase. Considering the flight didn't leave until 23.30 even small things such as socks were not available until approx an hour in to the flight which was quite frustrating for those wanting to get quickly in to the night time routine.

philippine-airlines,/airline-reviews/philippine-airlines,Philippine Airlines customer review,Oscar Medina,Philippines,2014-08-28,PR731 BKK to MNL on Aug 25th. I am a very tall overweight guy. I simply do not fly economy ever. PAL changed the plane to the very cramped A330 with no business class available. Wish they had told me in advance so I could have bought a business ticket with Thai. At the counter they gave me 150 usd credit per ticket which in no way covers the fare difference I had paid. They said even with Premium Economy seats they would give Business service. Not true at all. Seats are a nightmare food was horrible and I got a cranky face when I asked for a drink refill. They can keep their money because I'm not flying PAL again which should be tricky living in Manila but doable.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,NA,1,2,1,3,NA,NA,1,0

(DCA) to Tokyo Narita (NRT) on Air Canada flying DCA to YYZ to YVR to NRT. I returned from Tokyo Haneda (HND) via YYZ to DCA. Flight 1175 from YYZ to YVR was horrible - a 777 with 10-across cattle-car seating. Never again! Flight 3 from YVR to NRT was a great disappointment. Poor food (no taste and meagre portions) and a lacklustre cabin crew - lazy and not helpful. I had decided never to select Air Canada again (and was dreading the return flight) however Flight 6 from HND to YYZ (also a 777) had 9-across seating and a much better cabin crew.

Food is economy and fair at best - only expect to be offered wine or alcohol during meal service. Crew do come often with water and juice. While seat pitch is good similar to domestic F-class seats are almost as narrow as economy and the leg rest is of little use. Found highly rated 777 seats in rows 23 to have significant vibration and noise over the wing. Cabin and lavatories are kept clean and fresh.

Only about a dozen people in front of us but it took an hour to check them in. Of course no lounge but I expected that. Priority boarding was people at the back of the plane board first oh and Business which meant a rush to the queue. The seats relined a little more than most standard seats. I asked to watch a tablet for entertainment and was told they were having technically difficulties and were not available. I since found out they haven't been available for months. Despite leaving at night and arriving in the morning you only get 1 meal and 1 drink. A comfort pack was extra we paid $8 for 1 blanket. We paid an extra $250 for: 1 Meal and 1 drink. Over 70% of the passengers boarded before us which meant the Gold Coast customs line was out onto the tarmac by the time we got off. They had 3 international flights arrive at once as they do most mornings. This airport can barely handle 1 international flight.

New Business Class lounge at Phu Bai has a very disappointing boring design just a squared room and some industrial snacks plus some drinks. Only advantage is the view to the runway and a printer. The printer didn't work but the staff took the trouble to print out for me at VN counters downstairs. A funny complete nuisance is a compulsory bus drive from gate to aircraft hardly 20 meters. This goes for arrival as well departure and creates a lot superfluous efforts waiting and hassle in an airport where it is rare to see more than one aircraft at a time. The flight was full but service was on par. Newspapers handed out. A cold meal and drinks were offered (inc. 2 kinds of beer). A ring on the bell was addressed within seconds. Service began instantly after seat belts could be loosened and went on until touchdown. For a flight of 70 minutes duration the onboard service went on for 60 minutes quite impressive and better than most other carriers. Full business class seats in 2x2 configuration (compared to 3x3 in economy class). Priority luggage a joke and arrived as the latest but within 15 minutes which is tolerable. Annoying checks of luggage tags when leaving the terminal.

It's very nice to have a gin and tonic for a pre lunch drink but do I need the pretzels they also serve in economy. There were only two mains offered a hot and cold option hot being duck which I don't eat and the cold being couscous. The meal was nice enough but expect a bit more for Business Class. A warm bread roll and small bowl of fruit made up the meal and later Maggie Beer ice cream. A beautiful Riesling was served throughout the meal while partner opted for red and assured me that both were extremely good labels. While the overall experience is very nice I would like that little bit extra in Business food wise that distinguishes it from Economy. Perhaps because the economy product is generally very good is the problem - after all you get cheese and crackers on some flights a hot meal and ice cream too.

I think that was their only highlight of flying with the Dreamliner. Food - there are no options to choose from if you ordered a meat dish then you take what is given there is no alternative which is annoying. On the way back they gave us a beef dish which me and my husband do not eat. After asking for a vegetarian option they said sorry all meals are counted for. So we went without food. There was no blanket on the way there or on the way back. We had to keep our headphones that were given to us on the way there and use them on the way back. The pouch with magazines was covered in bits of food. The general condition of the plane was tatty it definitely wasn't clean. No soft drinks you have to pay for that.

It was my first time on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 in upper deck economy. Boarding was quick and efficient for both sectors having it about 40 minutes before departure and with boarding queues ending quickly. Legroom was excellent (I am 170cm tall). Food on the Beijing sector was delicious however it was not served hot thus making it a little disappointing. Service was great as the crew smiled gracefully during meal service. However a crew forgot to refill my orange juice (She did not have enough orange juice so she told me she was going to get some for me but did not come). The entertainment was spectacular with tons of movies and music. However the movie tends to lag when viewed. So I settled down to listening to music instead. The seats are comfortable but the pillow is too big so I feel they should make it smaller thus having it to use lesser space. The return sector was much better. The crew were more friendly and efficient compared to the Beijing sector. My dad's luggage had some issues so he told me to board the plane first. As I boarded the plane the steward welcomed me warmly and kindly guided me to my seat also helping me to find an available container to store mine and my father's large carry on.

I didn't realize that I had reached the airline hinterlands when I booked through Delta. (The first leg of the trip was KLM which I would fly any time). When we boarded the plane it was freezing cold so I walked down the aisle in search of a blanket. Found some. Was told by the flight attendant that I could not have one they weren't officially offered on this flight. That was a first. Then the drink cart rolled down the aisle. We asked for water and a cup of hot water. Then they waited for payment. My husband handed back his bottle of water and I was informed that my waxed paper cup of hot water would be 2 Euros. In the most condescending voice imaginable he explained that the purchase prices were listed in the seat pocket. I said it didn't cross my mind that there would be a price for water and I handed it back. The flight attendant said he was quite sure that low- cost airlines in the US charged for everything. End of discussion but never in my airline experience have I paid for water (or any other soft drink). Just saying pay attention to the co-carriers and know what you are getting into.

Staff provided very limited support in trying to find another flight on another airline.

Self service check in bag drop security boarding all uneventful. Seat comfortable enough and FAs smiling friendly seemingly enjoying themselves. We were offered tea coffee or water and choice of a (yes one) biscuit or a little bag of cassava chippies. I don't mind if Air NZ wants to be cheap or save money but I'd like the option to get something a bit better than that even if I have to pay. Some years ago I regularly flew with Air NZ WLG-AKL and they used to provide a full cooked breakfast and substantial snacks during the rest of the day . Disappointed with the change. Toilet was spotless but nothing else was. Bulkheads arm rest seat back seat all filthy. Noting has been dusted for an age let alone wiped down. Gross. We hit turbulence en route and gratefully the pilot managed to drop us down below it. Baggage misdirected at CHC so took almost an hour to retrieve it. Ground staff were aware of this but surprisingly didn't bother to tell anyone we had to go find them. Little competition appears to not have done anyone any favours and so will have to fly them again. Oh well. Word of caution...Always use the NZ website to book flights. When Iwent to book my multi drop NZ itinerary on their UK website only the full fat (most expensive) fare was offered. I switched to the NZ site and saved several hundred dollars.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,4,3,5,1,1,NA,NA,3,0

The flight to Lisbon was delayed for more than 2 hours no apologies - nothing. That was still ok as we were going on holiday. On our return flight TAP ground staff refused to check our luggage straight to destination stating we had two separate tickets - our connecting flight was on Etihad which is also a partner with TAP on Star Alliance. We were told to retrieve our luggage from T1 at Heathrow and check in again at T4. The check-in staff were not very pleasant when we still asked for our luggage to be sent to final destination and told us to go to customer service and not surprisingly the person there was quite rude too. So we had no choice but to check-in to London and hoping with the 3-hour connecting would be sufficient. Then the flight was delayed 30 minutes and then it was delayed 2 and half hours which would be impossible for us to catch the connecting flight.

jet-airways,/airline-reviews/jet-airways,Jet Airways customer review,Warren Moore,Canada,2014-01-08,When it comes to airlines ultimately whether they are any good or not really depends upon how they act when things go bad. In the past things have gone wrong with Air Canada and I've had to fight to get a hotel and a seat on an upcoming flight in reasonable time. My flight on 3rd January from Toronto to St. John's was cancelled because of a terrible snow storm in Newfoundland. Within 30 minutes I was in a hotel with meal vouchers. On the 4th the plane was cancelled again and the same thing happened no questions asked we were all shipped off again. On the 5th WestJet had put on 2 extra planes to deal with the backlog WS 4150 and WS 4175 leaving at 7am and 8am respectively. I was on the latter plane which was a little delayed because the attendants had just come off the inbound Halifax flight. Nonetheless it was all in good humour and no one had any cause for complaint. WestJet had gone beyond what anyone could ask for to get us all home. Air Canada flights were cancelled at the same time and some of those waiting to travel have been told they can't go until Wednesday. They may well argue it's not economically possible to put on an extra plane but if WestJet can do it the flag carrier can. I read a lot of reviews here about how a plane was a bit late the seats not that comfy and the food of a not great standard. All that actually occurred on my flight but these are small things in the main. An airline needs to be judged on looking after the best needs and Westjet delivered.

When we reached Tijuana we stayed on board and we asked if we needed to change seats as we were given boarding pass with different seat assignments. Again I was assigned seat 12A which still does not exist in the plane. We were made to sit in other seats and we had to bring our blankets and earphones because they do not issue fresh ones.

The aircraft cabin was in excellent condition. The cabin crew were smiling and immaculately groomed which is more than I can say for Qantas with whom I usually travel. I pre-ordered a Lacto Veg meal. I was offered a glass of champagne prior to take-off but when I requested one with the meal service I was told there was none and I could have red or white wine no mention of what it was and it was served in a disposable plastic tumbler. The veg main course was good. The dessert on the tray was fresh pineapple which I cannot eat because of medication I take. When the standard meal ice creams were offered I requested one but was told I couldn't have one as it may not be vegetarian. A second meal was served a few hours later but to my surprise the main course on my tray was exactly the same as the previous one. Cups of noodles were offered once during the long night flight other snacks listed on the menu were not offered but had to be obtained from trays in the galley. If you are seated on the left side of the 777 to get to the lavatory which is on the right side at the front of the Premium Economy Cabin you need to go back through the E/C cabin cross over through the centre galley and then back up to the front and vice versa to get back to your seat. On the HKG-SYD sector I moved seats to enable the person next to me more room as he had to go straight to work on arrival. When breakfast was offered I told the cabin attendant I had moved and that I had ordered a veg meal. I did not want to leave them short a breakfast tray. I was told they that would get my meal. When it arrived what I think was an economy tray was put in front of me on which was a bowl with 5 cubes of melon half a plastic tumbler of apple juice a dry bread roll and a main course which did not appeal.

I am a seasoned transatlantic traveler and have flown all airlines from North American to either Shannon or Dublin Ireland. On boarding the 767-200 aircraft I was astonished that there was no AVOD on the place only the large overhead screens which went out 15 years ago. Everybody sitting around me was annoyed as we all had to watch the same movies for the 7.5 hour flight.

meridiana,/airline-reviews/meridiana,Meridiana customer review,Guido Luzzatto,Italy,2014-07-06,Notwithstanding full price tickets bought months in advance Meridiana fly changed the flight schedule for the second consecutive year thus messing up my plans and partially ruining my holiday. The average low level of customer satisfaction found on the web alerted me but I tried last year the company because of its no stop flight to Crete. Due to the above mentioned schedule change that I may suppose is caused by intentional overbooking they made me lose one day of holiday. Monitors were turned off at check in so that it was difficult to find the proper line that was interminable and badly assisted. It took more than one hour to clear it. Aircraft was not properly cleaned and seats were uncomfortable. This year despite a sharp increase in prices the trick was just the same: they sold an evening ticket and pretended to re-program us on the morning flight. The call center answers after 15-20 minutes and they say they can't help. Never again on Meridiana.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,2,2,2,1,NA,NA,1,0

I had chosen seats via the TAM call centre in advance and they showed on my booking online but for some reason on check-in the system had allocated totally different seats which irritated me. Boarding in Frankfurt for GRU was chaotic with different groups being called at the same time. Seats onboard have a footrest which folds up meaning if raised it sticks into my shins but when dropped it is too high for me to put my feet on. Departed on time and soon dinner was served. No menu choice - a small salad a roll and a small pasta box. Not really enough for 12 hours. One drink was served then rubbish cleared away lights dimmed for the night and the crew vanished. It was only about 10.30 European time. The only drinks available were glasses of bottled water so if you fancied a nightcap or something else it was hard luck. AVOD is average but there was enough to keep me entertained. Breakfast was a reconstituted ham and gouda panini with some fruit and a tiny polystyrene cup of coffee. Horrible. Swift transfers at GRU with an uneventful flight to Florianopolis on a modern and clean 320. In future I will not fly TAM to Brasil I will opt for one of the European carriers as TAM is now too basic when I can pay a similar amount and have a much better journey with another airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0

The first leg was on July 1st 2015, starting from Orly Paris to Prague on 9.55am flight, arriving Rome at 12.00pm with a connection to Prague at 1.00pm. We arrived at the Airport 2 hours ahead of the flight time to find extremely long lines. Vueling process all flights thru a single line. We made it thru the line 7 minutes ahead of the departure time. As they checked our luggage and processed our boarding passes they advised us that there was no flight that day to Fiumicino airport where we have our connecting flight, but that it was diverted to Ciampino. Told we can pick up our luggage there and connect to our flight to Prague. The flight left 30 minutes late, arriving in Ciampino at 12.30. Transportation between the two airports is a bus that leaves every 15 minutes after the hour and the travel time is about 30 minutes. It was impossible to make the connection. Since the flight was scheduled to Flumicino our bags were labeled to that airport. We tried to pick up the luggage at Ciampino to find only one bag delivered and the other one lost. We took a taxi to Fiumicino hoping there may be a later flight to Prague, to find out Vueling has only the 1pm flight. We had to wait in a line for four hours to talk to a rude agent, that advised us that they would put us in a hotel and provide transportation to and from the hotel. We headed to the airport the next morning at 9am to catch 1pm flight. After 30 minutes in line we were advised that the flight was delayed to 4.30. Since I had the time at the airport, I went to Vueling lost and found, and fortunately I located the bag. While waiting for 4.30 departure, Vueling announced that the flight time was changed to 2.30 pm! We hurried to the gate to catch the 2nd bus transporting passengers to the plane. We waited in the bus for half an hour before they told us that the flight time had been delayed again to 5.40pm. The second boarding at 5.10 was manual since all the electronic boarding passes were collected the first time.

We took this up in June for a California flydrive via LAS.

First leg fine nice crew comfy seat decent meal. Second leg - not so much! Almost 4 hour flight landing in TPA at 6.30 am - breakfast should have been served but all we got was a teeny bag of not very good pretzels. When questioned about this shabby treatment US customer relations (first time around) said that no meal should have been served. Upon a second communication they said sorry yes - breakfast should have been served. Their solution was to offer a small voucher (which expires in a year) toward a future US flight which is completely useless to me as my travel plans for the coming year are already in place. They feel this represents some kind of value and is acceptable as reparation for the shabby treatment. The seats were uncomfortable they had a built in pillow which prevents you from putting your head back. It is not removable.

We also ended up corresponding with their Goodwill Department and they were very kind to us. Their in-flight entertainment system is a very nice touch screen monitor that allows you to charge your electronic devices via a standard USB cable and there is a nice selection of music for free although there is only one movie and one TV show free for viewing. Their in-flight meals are terrible to be honest but I'm happy to be fed at all considering I've been in 6-hour flights with other airlines that barely give you a snack.

After some exercise walking around the terminal to check in found the Biz class check in and found the service courteous but the area run down in appearance. Made it through immigration and security easily but struggled to find the correct lounge. Once there it was not worth the effort. Uncomfortable seats and well worn furnishings. Strolled down to the gate and learned that departure time is the real boarding time. Fought my way through the line onto the bus and then shoved my way to the stairs and made the climb. I found if I didn't assert myself I would keep getting cut in front of the line. Once onboard seats were old style angled beds. Service was courteous and smiles were plentiful. My jacket was ignored until about 3 hours into the flight. My meal order was taken chicken ordered and beef delivered. Debated pointing this out but decided between my language skills and the crew's skills I should enjoy the beef. I think there were inflight announcements from the cockpit but they were difficult to hear. I did have to ask for water about halfway into the flight and after asking got regular top offs.

In all fairness the Captain did the correct thing and didn't take off - he kept us all up updated via the loud speaker. Finally took off 2 hours later. Missed my connecting flight - then had to go on stand by - what a joy that was. The actual trip back to Aust was a very smooth flight - very little noise. Cabin crew were quite good.

Would I Fly Star Class Internationally again? Most defiantly - Its far cheaper and you still get the feel that your special. I would sooner pocket the savings I would make on traveling with Jetstar B/C to Qantas B/C. By the way my outgoing flight to Tokyo was on a very old rattly 747- although they have upgraded the Business class to flat beds.

ana-all-nippon-airways,/airline-reviews/ana-all-nippon-airways,ANA All Nippon Airways customer review,T Ugasucia,United States,2014-08-26,This review is for an economy class NRT-JFK trip. First off I would recommend ANA when flying to the US because overall the inflight experience is excellent thanks to the fabulous cabin crew. So much better than dealing with any of the US carriers and their surly service. However my numerous experiences with the ground staff at Narita airport makes me absolutely dread the return leg of my trip between NY and TYO. The check-in process is so confusing and takes so long. All the agents seem to be either new or have no concept of processing passengers quickly. It always takes 20 minutes from the time I reach the counter to when I leave it. Despite being polite and smiling the agents don't really give good advice and are not very helpful to be quite honest. If it weren't for the great cabin crew I'd rate the staff service as very poor. Inflight the economy class seats on the B777-300 are uncomfortable because of the head rest that juts out pushes my head forward so I'm sitting with my chin on my neck. I noticed a lot of passengers sleeping with their heads resting on the tray tables probably because of this. The economy class meals are just horrible. I have learned to buy or pack my own. The drink selections are good. The inflight entertainment is mediocre especially their music selection.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,2,3,2,2,NA,NA,3,1

british-airways,/airline-reviews/british-airways,British Airways customer review,G Alexander,Australia,2015-04-23,April 3 2015 Sydney-LHR. Staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. The cabin looked very new was clean and comfortable. IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again.

Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them?

So no need to waste also time in reviewing it. On the way back I asked on board the upgrade against 800€. The seat is a real lie flat but somehow is feel a bit cheap and ""fragile"". The mattress is also a bit hard and is very uncomfortable for tall people the foot space that is very narrow and requires a lot off efforts to turn your body on the other side.. The grey design doesn't help as well: a bit boring. The amenity kid is just ok. The entertaining system is fine even thought he selection of film is not as nice as on other higher level airlines. The food is the only nice point: different choices of antipasti first course second course and dessert offered you on a tray: you can even taste a bit of everything. Also good selection of wines. The disappointing thing is professionally and the level of the service. I won't comment the ground customer service that is just shameful: nobody knows nothing or would better to say everybody gives you info that most of the time is just a personal guess.

The short haul trips CT to Mauritius were a complete waste of money. As far as I can see there is no real benefit to paying for business class. The seats are a three-row of which they only use two so a bit of extra space but not much extra comfort and the food etc was identical (according to a friend who was in economy). The long haul was better but even then the seats are the most uncomfortable business class seats I have ever experienced. The strange pitch means you are always sliding down and there is some kind of hard ridge right in the middle. Horrible.

Champagne (Ayala) /beverage selection was excellent and the food was pretty good - I got my first choice each time - the starters were a bit lacklustre (some sort of tuna on chickpeas - virtually tasteless) but the mains were pretty good (lamb cutlets - slightly overcooked but delicious). Service was attentive and friendly - just spot on - these guys definitely know what they're doing and no request was too much.

AeroMexico had a good selection of non-stop flights from LAX to PVR. Seats were more expensive than connecting flights on the U.S. based airlines. We were willing to pay extra for the non-stop flight. A week before our departure AeroMexico moved us to an indirect flight connecting through Mexico City. Our only other option was accepting a voucher from AeroMexico and rebooking on another airline at our own expense. Due to the short notice all flights (even connecting) were two to three times more expensive than they were when we had originally purchased the tickets. The annoyance doesn't end there. In Mexico City we only had one hour to change planes. Normally this would be easy. We didn't know we had to go through customs. There were hundreds of people already in line.

At 14.25 asked the lounge staff to confirm if we needed to go to the gate as the Departures board had not changed. They had no information and could not get a reply by telephone from TAP so we were advised to go straight to the Gate. No TAP staff there and very few passengers. Went back with other passengers to the Check-in Desks which were simply chaotic. Offered seats on an alternative flight by BA but warned by other passengers that BA were not honouring TAPs tickets. This was because of the difference in value and even after wasting an hour walking round the airport with a TAP staff member the best we could get was an economy ticket in exchange for our TAP Club equivalent. Ended up paying 650$ extra for World Traveller Plus upgrade so we could at least sit together on what was a full flight. Finally departed 28+ hours late. Claim going in to TAP.

ryanair,/airline-reviews/ryanair,Ryanair customer review,A Fiddies,United Kingdom,2014-06-18,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return.

Passengers up and about while the plane was still on the runway in Tbilisi and again in Istanbul on return - again crew didn't bother. All in all pretty chaotic. What they do seem to get right is the friendliness of the cabin crew - chatty and generally helpful. Onboard food ok (avoid hot breakfast) and by booking them ahead you get served first and it works out much cheaper. On all 4 sectors there was a problem with paying for my drinks with a credit card but eventually they somehow managed it - otherwise my flight on Christmas Day would be pretty gloomy. Great onboard tv's with aircraft location which you don't usually get on a budget airline.

norwegian,/airline-reviews/norwegian,Norwegian customer review,R Paterson,United Kingdom,2015-03-20,Used Norwegian Airlines to fly from LGW to LAX. Overall satisfactory but one incident on the return flight spoiled it all a bit. The outgoing flight was around 45 minutes late departing but did arrive to LAX on time. Food was pretty poor on this flight undercooked risotto is not a particular favourite of mine! Sandwich snack towards the end was also a poor vegetarian option a couple of pieces of bread with some cucumber and tomato thrown between them. Staff were pleasant enough mainly Americans. The plane itself was comfortable with good entertainment facilities. The new design made flying through turbulence a lot more pleasant than normal. However on the return flight we seemed to have mainly Scandinavian flight crew and I was disappointed with how they treated the older gentleman sitting next to me. His entertainment system was broken as soon as we arrived on the plane. He caught a male member of staff as we were taking off who just waved a hand dismissively at him and walked on. He caught another male member of staff who said that if he had already reported it they were probably in the process of resetting his system. Still nothing and eventually a female member came up asked if it still wasn't working and then disappeared to the front of the plane. The screen was never fixed no other member of staff offered help or even an apology. There were empty seats at the front of the plane so he could have been moved. He was wearing a hearing aid and had to put this in every time he was trying to catch a member of staffs attention. It was heartbreaking seeing him rushing to do this and being ignored. I did offer him my TV as I could share with my husband but leaning over someone else isn't quite the same. The flight itself was on time and the American flight food was much better just a shame about the crew.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,6,3,2,3,4,NA,NA,4,1
eva-air,/airline-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,John Peters,Canada,2014-04-23,San Francisco to Taipei. After a couple hours spent in the EVA lounge in SFO my expectations were rather low. The lounge was small located down a long narrow corridor and offered a very modest selection of food. Once on board the flight though everything changed. The flight attendants guided the guests to their seats and were very attentive throughout the flight. I didn't want to eat the entire evening meal (the flight only leaves after midnight) and that was no problem. The food was excellent with a good selection of wines. In-flight entertainment was certainly adequate. The somewhat angled seats had lots of storage areas and once the seat was brought to the flat position I could stretch my long body out fully. The only reason I didn't give them the highest mark was due to the mediocre lounge.,NA,NA,Business Class,NA,8,5,5,5,4,NA,NA,5,1

Using American airline JFK flagship lounge it is probably the best American lounge. I have been told I must go to gate at 8.50 for 9.30 flight. Well I was there by 8.30 pm waited until 9.15 pm I have been told the flight delay because crew is not on board. Another 30 minutes I walked to the counter again and I have been told engineers are on board fixing problems. By 10.45 pm I went to the counter again and I have been told there is another plane will arrive in 10 minutes and they will change aircraft. 11pm the pilots walked out the arrived plane and ready to go home. Half way the terminal one ground staff called them back and after some phone calls pilots back on the plane again. 11.20 boarding started 11.45 took off at JFK. Cabin crew only did safety demo and hand out landing card. No drinks or anything served. Pilot just said try to get to Montreal as fast as he can. We landed at YUL 1am.

airasia,/airline-reviews/airasia,AirAsia customer review,D Van Hove,United States,2014-12-10,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers? I hope we never are faced with that decision.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,2,3,2,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

The comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows the passengers around us and the service. Staff were not very friendly and motivating all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. Seemed that they were more interested in talking than working.

Sat on plane in Hong Kong on day of departure for about 8 hours in total with short break for lunch in terminal. Told unconvincingly that the problem was bad weather in Beijing. About to take off at 5pm when told fuel had overheated and flight cancelled. Following day had to be up at 2am for 6am flight that was then delayed. Told in Hong Kong transfer would be on to Gatwick not Heathrow but at Beijing told we were back on flight to Heathrow. Asked staff to ensure baggage was put on correct flight and assured it would be. Baggage did not arrive with us and two days later Air Canada who deal with Air China baggage problems do not know where it is. Air China seem to be impossible to speak to directly.

Every single US Airways flight at the terminal was oversold. If it wasn't for volunteers we would have had to wait 8 hours for the next flight home. The plane was dirty and dusty. They don't even provide any free snacks. You had to pay $4 for a tiny bag of peanuts.

Overall Virgin has proved to have better service better planes and an overall better atmosphere than the likes of American Airlines and United when I have flown in the past. Their fee policy wasn't bad compared to other airlines. For the most part at least water and soda were free. The cabin crews had no problem on either flight providing me these at all. From baggage drop-off to disembarkation Virgin provided a quality service. The one caveat I had was having to use the rear-lavatory each flight because the front is reserved for First Class only. Because I paid $30 for Main Cabin Express (it's worth it despite this) I feel it to be a slap in the face to exclusively use the read one when the front is less of a hassle. As far as the seats go they are the most comfortable I have ever sat in for an aircraft. I always had smelly or worn fabric when flying American. Plus I wasn't scrunched up in Economy with Virgin coming from a 6ft guy.

Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical ‘old United’ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served – no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger. Much of the US hub counter staff is now outsourced and they are of little help when something goes wrong. The hard product and service is average to slightly below average. Economy Plus on UA is still great value but I am starting to avoid United when flying on an expensive ticket or an itinerary requiring connections.",B737-800/B777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Chicago O'Hare to Milan via Newark,3,3,2,3,2,2,NA,2,0

The flight attendants are awful they never smile do not show any interest in their work and never use the words please and thank you and overall as a passenger I was made to feel like a burden to them. The plane was dirty upon boarding AC5 many of the seats were still reclined meaning that safety protocol for landing had not been adhered to. The in-flight route map lasts 20 minutes then crashes the food is awful and the speed of service appalling. The trash from dinner was sat on my tray table for 55 minutes as the flight attendants were all eating and chatting in the gallery.

meridiana,/airline-reviews/meridiana,Meridiana customer review,S Delrio,Italy,2014-09-06,I flew more than a few times from Cagliari-Linate and Alghero-Linate. Planes used were mostly old McDonnell- Douglas MD-80 although the company has recently renewed seats and overall furniture flying on these planes still has an 80's flavor. On MD-80 seats are ok but a very tall person could feel somewhat unease. There is not a lot of space for the hand-luggage on the over-head lockers. Meridiana also own much newer and more comfortable Airbus A320 but they are less numerous than MD-80s. On the numerous flight I took I don't remember major delays. Staff was always nice. Snacks and Drinks service could be improved. Overall I will for sure fly again with Meridiana but for flights from Sardinia to the Peninsula I will always prefer Alitalia.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,3,4,2,2,NA,NA,4,1
virgin-australia,/airline-reviews/virgin-australia,Virgin Australia customer review,L Carter,Australia,2014-05-06,VA23 MEL-LAX Premium (11 H) connecting from OOL. Luggage checked entire way through had to pick up express boarding pass in MEL (not sure if comes with premium or not I'm a Platinum FF). Cabin was practically full with only a couple of seats spare. Plenty of legroom although the 2 heights that the footrest sits at doesn't make it overly comfortable the seat width difference is definitely noticeable vs domestic economy. Amenities bag comes with socks eye mask toothbrush/paste hand cream tissues and a pen (which is more than I can say for SQ business). Headphones provided are noise blocking - and they definitely work. Every meal had tomato and cheese in it which was not only a little disappointing but seriously lacking in originality the chicken was nice and tender though once I scraped the tomato off! Breakfast (scrambled eggs) was so/so the bacon the only redeeming factor in a pretty lacklustre meal. Inflight entertainment (RED) didn't have a massive choice. The best bit would have to be the service. From the FA's to the pilots keeping us up to date on delays could not have asked for better - the staff are definitely what make flying Virgin Australia a happy experience!

No tax or duty free service. On a couple of occasions the Purser left the flight deck door wide open whist chatting to the Captain. 3 hours and 15 minutes we landed and we were all glad of it.

Even though Airblue has acquired bigger plane for this non-stop route the seat width and comfort is still same as before put simply its uncomfortable for such long haul flight. There is no inflight entertainment as they have taken the Seat-back TV screens off every seat so 9 hour long flight is pretty boring unless you take your iPad or a book with you. Got served two meals firstly a very minimalist dinner with rice chicken and some salad. About 2 hours before landing they served second so- called meal which was just a chicken role and a drink. Staff seemed clueless and not very helpful. Return flight on 20th October from Islamabad was again delayed by 3 hours. Airblue staff checking-in the passengers on their laptops so it seems that they are not allowed to use proper airport facilities either or could it be a cost- cutting measure. After the announcement for boarding all the passengers were filled into mini buses to be taken to the plane. When reached near the plane the buses took U-turn and came back to terminal without any explanation. Staff then told that due to catering service delay captain has asked them not to start the boarding process yet! They lack service commitment care and are a very poor value for money.

spirit-airlines,/airline-reviews/spirit-airlines,Spirit Airlines customer review,Jeremy Ehst,United States,2015-06-07,"This round-trip flight was my first experience with flying Spirit Airlines. The initial price was significantly less than comparable round-trip flights. However the consumer should be aware that it is virtually impossible to travel Spirit Air without additional costs unless you can travel with just a backpack or other small carry-on item that will fit under the seat in front of you. Any additional baggage whether stowed or carry-on is charged. There is no complimentary food or beverage service and there is a fee to select your seat. After selecting my seat and paying for two bags (charged for each bag each way) my cost savings over other airlines was insignificant. In addition the in-flight service from the flight attendants was mediocre at best and the seat space was very cramped. The worst part about the experience however was the delays on both the outbound and return flights. My outbound flight was delayed nearly 3 hours and my return flight delayed 45 minutes. In neither case was the delay related to the weather air traffic control or anything related to the airport. In the first case the explanation given for the delay had to do with the aircraft being delayed for previous flights thus arriving late for my flight. On the return flight takeoff was delayed due to one of the flight attendants scheduled for my flight arriving late to the airport on another Spirit flight. The one gentleman in my row of seats on the return flight said how his outbound Spirit flight was also delayed. The other person in our row said when she booked her flight through a travel web site that she received a warning prior to confirming her purchase stating that 60% of Spirit flights are delayed. I can respect an airline for being ""no frills"" with the goal of keeping their costs low. However there is a difference between ""no frills"" and poor business practice. The delays appear to be the result of nothing other than airline inefficiency and the apparent consistency of delayed flights is inexcusable. To me that is not ""no frills"" but evidence of a business being poorly run. An airline can also be ""no frills"" but still provide friendly polite in-flight service. I'm not even talking here about the fact that they charge for all in-flight food and beverages but rather the general lack of friendliness and courteousness from the flight staff. I'm grateful to have been able to have a direct flight to my destination via Spirit and to have arrived to and from my destination safely. Beyond that my experience with the airline was mostly negative and I would not recommend Spirit Air unless it is your only option. If you do choose to fly Spirit beware of the specific costs travel light and plan for delays.",NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

We looked for airline reservations in February and were a little dismayed by the Vueling airline reviews. Since Vueling was the only option we decided to book anyway. Our 2 friends - the other couple also tried to book 2 excellence fares - but only our sale for 2 Excellence fares went through (there are only 4 Excellence seats total) - and then the Excellence fare doubled in price - so our 2 other friends purchased optima fares. Our 5pm flight was on time - no problems checking in baggage - no extra charge although our friends each had a large suitcase. With the Excellence far we used the lounge with snacks and drinks and on board received complimentary food and drinks as well. The seating is arranged with 2 seats an aisle and 2 seats so the other 2 seats for the Excellence fare (at the bulkhead) were empty as double the cost was crazy!

We were then told we will not be flying till 9am next morning. Limited hotel space for all guests and families were lumped into single rooms. The next day we were flown on a A330 to Camaguey. The ground crew on the other end were totally unprepared for the flight. All in all our family vacation was reduced to losing a day and a credit given for future flight at a cost of $250/pp. Since this is the second time I've flown Air Transat and twice in-a-row that my vacation was reduced by a day (the first time was on my honeymoon to Italy) I will not fly Air Transat again.,NA,NA,Premium Economy,NA,NA,1,3,1,1,NA,NA,1,0

iran-air,/airline-reviews/iran-air,Iran Air customer review,Hassan Safdari,NA,2008-11-07,"I had 4 flights in July 2008 with Iran Air. There were the worst flights I've had in my life. The first flight was London to Tehran. The airplane was so old and the washroom was a big mess. The flight attendants were so rude and I’ve seen at least 2 load arguments between passengers and the attendants. The second flight Tehran to Tabriz. The airplane stopped in the middle of runway for the last minute maintenance. They didn't let us go back to the airport and we had to stay in the airplane for half an hour without air condition in mid summer. Well these are nothing comparing the nightmare I had when I was coming back from Tehran to London. The flight had 5 hours delay; which seems normal. There were at least 50 passengers among those people including me had a connection flight to other destination. When we asked the status about our next flight; which we lost it we've been told every thing has been organized and they already reserved a seat for our destination. Even though the Pilot in the airplane made a commitment few times that every thing is ok and we don't have to worry about our next flight. It was a joke. When we arrived to London nothing was organized and Iran air office even didn't know we are coming. When we asked about our connection flight he said"" Why did you come here? I already called Iran and asked them not to send them here!” After fighting about 3 hours we got the hotel to stay over night in London.

Air India said sorry that is only flight to Dubai so nothing they can do. They refused to transfer him to another airline out of Delhi to get him there on time. He would just have to wait until he gets to Dubai and see if someone could help him there. To make matters worse we had booked this reservation through Travelocity.com so now we had a third party involved and they all blamed each other. Nobody at airport or their so called ""customer service"" number could help. My son stood at Air India ticket counter trying to get someone to help with no luck kept telling him to come back in an hour. He is now in Dubai and we need to start process all over again.

We made up some time because of strong tailwind (the pilots were trying hard to arrive a few minutes earlier). The pilots landed in the wind smoothly. The only thing I dislike about this airline is that you have to pay to select a seat even upon check-in. When you look at the price tag ($400 for 2 ppl round trip) all those pay drinks could be forgiven even the expensive carry-on.

us-airways,/airline-reviews/us-airways,US Airways customer review,Joel McLean,United States,2014-04-06,My wife and I live in NC near Wilmington. US Airways is one of the few airlines that fly out of ILM airport so we have flown with them numerous times. My wife flew to Ohio for a two week visit. The return flight as it was listed on the flight itinerary was to fly from Cleveland OH (CLE) to Charlotte NC (CLT) have about an hour lay over and then fly onto ILM. The flight was supposed to be into CLT on flight 1955 and out again on the same flight an hour later. This seemed odd since US Airways typically lands at one end of CLT and has you fly out of another gate all the way across the terminal. We questioned this flight into and out of the same gate when we purchased the tickets when she went to board her flight in ILM to go to CLE and again in CLE when boarding to return. All three times we were told that was accurate. The flight from CLE was delayed due to weather for 35 minutes and landed in CLT about 50 minutes late. People were scrambling to make connections as this was the last flight of the day (about 11 pm). My wife made a comment to one of the flight crew that she was lucky since she just had to stay on the same plane. The staff member told her that plane wasn't going anywhere for the rest of the night. US Airways had changed her flight plans while she was in the air. The flight she had to catch was only 8 gates away but it had already boarded and was pulling away by that time. She was stranded in CLT for the night. I ended up driving the 3.5 hours one way to pick her up to save her from having to sleep in the terminal. I would highly recommend that if you have any options other than US Airways for making flight plans you do it.

Few things that they may need to look into: Check in staff at Dubai yawning at 8am in morning not as welcoming as we expected. Doha-Colombo sector too cold inside the aircraft for many passengers but repeated request by us to make it a little warmer did not yield any result. Aircraft was clean and well maintained good entertainment system and options. This was 1'st Qatar airline experience will fly them again but not worth becoming loyal to them.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,5,4,3,3,4,NA,NA,4,1
qantas-airways,/airline-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,S Hassan,Australia,2014-08-20,Flew on QF2 from Dubai to Sydney in Economy class. I had the option to get on Emirates EK417 too for the same price (departs after an hour QF2 departs) but took QF2 to reduce the transit time at Dubai and in the end regretted my decision. After making the booking Qantas changed the flight time which reduces the gap between the two flights just to 30 minutes. This was not a big issue however simply put the seat pitch and width made it one of the most uncomfortable long haul journey with my wife and two kids. EK417 seat pitch is 32-34 in with 18in width whereas QF2 seats were 17.5in wide with only 31in pitch hard to move in and out very painful with the front seats reclined. Besides that the service was better than Emirates (flew on Emirates Sydney-Dubai on the same trip). Emirates served meals thrice whereas on QF2 it was twice. Emirates had also an edge with onboard wifi. But in the end the seat pitch mattered the most.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,7,1,4,3,3,NA,NA,3,0
frontier-airlines,/airline-reviews/frontier-airlines,Frontier Airlines customer review,A Mccook,United States,2014-08-11,"Flew in and out of Trenton from St. Augustine. A little nervous after reading review however our experience was great. I didn't go in with high expectations and was very pleased with the outcome. First we flew Classic Plus which allowed more leg room (my son is 6'3"" and needs extra space). This allowed us to check a bag each and have carry on for free (in addition to the allowed personal item). The seats were roomy and comfy. The staff at each airport was friendly (we arrived 1.5 hours before the flight with boarding passes printed at home as instructed). Had read horrible reviews of Trenton but found it very nice though small. Restrooms available at the gate a nice little eatery upstairs (before security). If you plan well and read the fine print you should have no complaints. It was 100 times better than my latest flight on United to Newark last month.",NA,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,4,4,NA,NA,4,1
interjet,/airline-reviews/interjet,Interjet customer review,Ashil Lunka,Mexico,2014-07-20,Flew MEX-MID return just a week ago. Flight there went smoothly great jetBlue-like service with free snacks and drinks and friendly cabin crew. No seatback entertainment system (only dropdown screens) and the in-seat audio system didn't work at all but I didn't really mind since it was only a 1 hour flight. On flight back due to change of plans I ended up arriving at MEX much earlier than planned and to shorten the wait for the flight I asked for an earlier flight got one that departed 1 hour earlier at no additional charge (which may not be a plus as seen later in the story). Boarded the flight everything went just as well as before until approach to MID. Pilot comes on the radio and says that there will be a 10-15 minute delay because of weather. So the plane circles around a bit (in heavy turbulence I might add) and 20 minutes later the pilot comes over the radio and says that we're diverting to CUN. We diverted to CUN waited an hour on the ground and went back to MID. At MID I checked the board and the flight I was originally booked on had arrived on time. Thankfully I wasn't connecting or doing anything important but still. However I can't blame the airline for the weather and it's a good airline.,NA,NA,Economy,NA,8,4,5,5,3,NA,NA,5,1

Seats far too cramped. Lady in next aisle complained about lady in front of her who put head rest back. Lady in front was also sitting in extra leg room seat. Her behaviour was awful she had all the leg room but still put her head rest back and got none of the blame. She stormed off down the front of the plane for the rest of the journey and wouldn't let anybody else sit in her seat. None of this would have happened if there had been more leg room in first place.

IFE guide featured latest Hollywood releases but the system only had Bollywood movies. Seat was OK. Flight on time. KUL to SYD on A330 was only 30% capacity yet the service was still very slow and not very friendly. No drink rounds were offered. Food was reasonable but on the small side. Seat had plenty of room and many customers had 4 seats to lie on. SYD to KUL 100% full A330. Service was as good as the earlier virtually empty flight. Staff looked harried as if they had to meet a deadline yet they were so slow One flight attendant looked as if she were about to cry. Food again reasonable. KUL to BKK on 737.

Jetstar were almost obsessive about punctuality and to their credit these 4 flights were either right on time or earlier. The aircraft were all clean staff appeared friendly and helpful. Most enjoyable flights that met my expectations. Only thing is the seats are nearly always so hard that my backside becomes numb. Thousands of pax sitting for hrs on these seats soon destroys much of their cushioning. I never buy onboard. Bring my own food and bottled water. Here in New Zealand we regularly travel CHC- AKL-CHC and only use Jetstar. Punctual good fares and we are always satisfied in every way.

Seating is unbelievably tight and the seats still recline which makes the space between you and the person in front unacceptable.
