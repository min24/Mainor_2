aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Klaus Malling,Denmark,2014-02-11,"A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well.

Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly.

The seating in the gate area is not that comfortable most often you get on and off the plane by steps-rarely an airbridge as in many other airports.

aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,S Reid,NA,2010-04-02,Avoid this airport on outbound flights in the afternoon particularly on Friday. Allow up to 1hr for the security screening process. You can pay an additional £5 to jump to the top of the security queue. I have not seen this at any other airport. Staff are friendly but another one/two security screening stations are required to cope at peak times. The luggage arrivals belt is small and if three flights land at once you scramble for your bags. On exiting the airport the smokers are just outside the door with the discarded cigarette ends on the pavement. Not a very nice welcome to Aberdeen.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Jay Sitlani,United States,2015-07-14,"Transiting through AUH is an ordeal, and lets down the very good inflight product of its dominant hub carrier Etihad. Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd. And if you're connecting to the US, then you have to repeat this farcical performance. A new terminal is being constructed, and while I suspect it will be posh and modern and beautiful, it will still be burdened by these transit procedures. Etihad is a fabulous carrier, but the transit at AUH will make me think twice before I choose it for my long haul travel needs.",Transit,14-06-2015,Solo Leisure,4,2,2,2,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,0

Terminal 1: This is where all the other airlines (not low cost) flies out to and out from. Small considering its Abu Dhabi, where all the money is at. You are required to scan your luggage prior to check in and 'apparently' only passengers are allowed to go there, even if you're just there to buy flight tickets which is located inside. Only one small coffee shop before the immigration check for you to hang with your loved ones before you say goodbye. Inside the terminal past security, only few stores available, and all are tiny. Terminal 2: This is where the low costs airlines such as Rotana Jet flies in or out from. Terminal is tiny, looks like a ghost town with only one coffee shop that surprisingly has good food. Coming in to the terminal was another nightmare. I've flown in twice here and both times were jam packed. It's as if the queue is never ending. Terminal 3: This is where all the Etihad flights come in and out from. Much better than the other 2 terminals and you can actually check in at the counter with another person accompanying you. Shops inside the terminal passed immigration is better than Terminal 1, although still not as amazing as Dubai Terminal 3 or Doha airport. Still, not recommended for transit more than 3 hours. I had to give mix stars for this airport due to the different service quality that is displayed across different terminals.

It did not catch up with its growth over the past few years and passengers have to pay dearly for that shortcoming. It took me 2h from stepping into the building until I reached the gate. There are long queues everywhere check in passport control security and even toilets. Staff are stressed and grouchy. There are at peak hours no seats anywhere in or near the gates.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,R Jones,United Kingdom,2014-12-21,Terrible airport! For a growing carrier like Etihad and the traffic growth all around the gulf Abu Dhabi seems to be lagging behind everyone else. In terminal 3 there are 6 bag drop desks for most of the Etihad fleet (that's over 100 a/c) and around 10 normal check in desks. Average queue time can be anything from 10mins to 1hr plus. Then all the passengers move across to boarder control where of course it is chaos again. Finally when you clear immigration and security you are presented with a terrible selection of shops restaurants and cafes and no seating what so ever (unless of course you don't mind sitting on the floor or the edge of a flower bed). Then when your flight is ready to board there is a single file queue to one maybe two people checking passports. So the queue here for a B777 or A340 is 15mins+. Then you board the a/c and you are away. From the moment you enter the airport to boarding the plane it is a nightmare. I hope the new midfield terminal will be better. I cannot imagine what the A380 with 450-500 passengers is going to look like in terminal 3! I really feel sorry for those passengers. The staff are very rude and not interested in the passenger experience and queuing for security is chaos as staff are shouting almost every world city for passengers to skip the queue for imminent departures so the flow of people in the queue is limited as people skip the queue.

The staff behavior near the immigration counter is very rude and partial. Just 4 or 5 counters for foreign passport holders (GCC Passport holders have separate counters) and the queues were long.

In a way I'll be sorry to see it go as its tiled doughnut satellites have stood the test of time architecturally speaking. Compare this with the monstrosity at Charles de Gaulle which seems to have aged in less than 10 years. The biggest problem in landing at the international airport is it take about 15 mins to taxi to/from the runway as the new airport terminal construction means that there are a series of contraflow taxi ways.

I travelled from Turkey to Australia with a stop-over in Abu Dhabi and it was not a pleasant experience. Apparently 1.5 hrs hour is not enough to catch your flight - unless it's delayed which mine (luckily) were. It took about 25-30 minutes to get out of the plane onto a bus and drive to the airport. Then you had to walk to the transfer gates and stand in line for another 30-40 minutes for another security check meaning you are left running for your gate because boarding closes 20 minutes prior to take-off. You do not get to skip line because boarding for your flight had already started - quite frankly they make a huge deal out of stressing the difference between economy and first class passengers - only the latter are treated nicely. The information boards are not updated so only once I had arrived at the gate was I told that the plane would be delayed. At that point you're stuck in a gate with no access to any facilities.

T1 is clearly more cramped than T3 which I have used before and I found the ATMs hard to locate without directions from staff.

Only back-up was at document checkpoint at the gate. If you don't want to be forced to go through the duty free shop simply use the toilets after security as they have a second exit that leads to the gate concourse.

Clear signage made it easy to navigate along with plenty of Departure screens. As previously stated quite busy so seating can be a bit hit and miss but they can be found. However after 7 hours in the air a walk about was most welcome. Boarding through Gate 18 was bizarre a doorway that actually led to Gate 17 and 18. Even weirder was that two flights were through this door at the same time which led to confusion for passengers. Security was a drag with two flights passing through one metal detector and two x-ray machines. They got it sorted and we were bussed to another remote stand. Return was at night. Arrived at another remote stand and again a bus to the Terminal. I was travelling with an infant access to a stroller would have been advantageous at the gate. Upon arriving at Flight Transfer we found a fleet of strollers. Why position them here? A reasonably long walk down to Gate 34 (10 mins) with plenty of seating at the Gate in a clean and airy environment. Overall not a bad experience. Terminal 1 is rather dated but great for people watching and shopping. Terminal 3 is modern and bright but can involve a fair trek down to the Gates in the 30's. Be prepared is my advice.

It is bright and spacious and there is free wi-fi which is painfully slow. Arrivals is a bit of a let down with you being forced to go through an arrival duty free shop. There is only one baggage carousel for international flights which makes it a problem if a large aircraft lands let alone multiple long haul flights. Customs is slow with numerous people asking you the very same questions. Perhaps they should consider having more people man the immigration booths and less customs staff. They obviously have little to do in such a small airport so are overzealous. On return check-in facilities were good friendly staff. There were many shops in the departure area which is a communal area for both international and domestic departures. The actual immigration and customs for international flights is a small area which is hard to miss! One other drawback is the pick-up and drop-off area what a mess!

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,M O'Connor,NA,2010-09-14,When the new Adelaide airport was first opened they had a great system of long term car parking where a friendly guy in a van would pick you up after you parked and take you the terminal and vice versa with very little waiting time often from the car and back. In recent years they have introduced a bus that goes every 20 minutes. Most of the time we walk to and from the terminal because inevitably the bus is not in sync with the arrivals of planes particularly at night and the bus just sits at the car park and waits until the 20minutes is up and comes over the terminal so you are at your car before he has even left. They also used to have an area that was undercover for you to sit and wait at the car park so if it was raining you didnt get wet. Well last night at 7.30 we arrived back in Adelaide. it was pouring and we waited 25 minutes for the bus (he must have fallen asleep) and then he dropped us off at a point with no shelter and all the passengers and bags got very wet. No one was happy with the service and when you pay $50 to park your car I think it is reasonable to expect something better. First of all it there is no point in having such a large bus it is mostly empty and most people dont have 20 minutes to spare to catch the bus when the arrive at the airport and don't particularly want to wait 20 minutes when they arrive back from their trip.

Departing through the domestic terminal early morning there were no queues at check-in or security plenty of seating was available and free WiFi was available.

On arrivals I find it inadequate to have to walk down stairs after coming off the plane. I did not see an elevator available. The wait for the luggage is too long. I was told it was due to the luggage scanner being undersized for the traffic. One important deficiency is the absence of English signs; they are all in French and Arabic only.

Handcrafts at the Duty Free are expensive but from my experience are of first quality that you do not easily find outside. Just beware that Ariival affair is always a hit and miss: if your plane arrives when there are no other queues ahead then fine but be prepared for a very chaotic and one hour long baggage collection if several flights arrive at the same time.

OK the new terminal was conceived during boom times (and is far too large for current needs) but they obviously decided during construction work to cut the budgets and many of the finishes (loos being the biggest area) are cheaply done and showing wear already. The public address system is useless and they are clearly saving money by not using the air-conditioning as even in October the place was like an oven.

The domestic side is on the right side with no connection to the international part. You have to exit the building to get to from domestic flights to international flights. You are not allowed to go to the airside terminal before your flight is announced for check in. This means you have to wait outside in the departure hall. WiFi is available for free but do not expect great speed. Check in is in a rather small area. Passport control is reasonably swift as is customs control and safety control. There are no shops on the domestic airside. The business lounge is almost always closed. And the local airline Air Astana does not provide this service for domestic flights. There is a small restaurant in the old and new part. There are shops in the international airside. There is a small restaurant/bar. The business lounge is available and open 24 hours. Use of this service is based on the airline. Lufthansa gets a limited menu of drinks and food. KLM seems to be more generous (no apparent restrictions). But it is an old room with plastic leather seating and not much else. There are enough ATM´s available to get cash. There are no newspapers/magazines for foreigners. Only taxis ordered or outside at the official taxi stand have decent fares. But agree on a fixed price no meters installed. Ignore offers inside the building.

The flight was late (probably airline's fault) half the passengers could not hear the local announcements there were 4 staff members at the desk 1 working and the others looking bored. Overall a tiring experience - and compared so badly with Helsinki Airport which is brilliantly laid out chilled and courteous.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,2014-07-20,Check in kiosks worked well and there were plenty of them. Only problem was that as well as our own boarding passes it gave us someone else's as well. It just churned it out after ours. Queues for the automated bag drop machines were horrendous and would have been cut by maybe 75% if there had been more than one staff member allocated to help those who had not done this before. Weird system of going through security at the gate meant that people were having to abandon soft drinks they had purchased after clearing passport control and because the process of doing security at the gate is obviously time consuming people were at the gate with no access to drinks or toilets for up to an hour before they were boarded onto the aircraft and there were too few seats for the amount of passengers.,NA,NA,NA,6,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

The airport does look a little old now but still very well-maintained. The only thing that I think can be improved is the immigration counters and queuing areas.

Why can't security screening be done just before/after immigration and then there will be no need for the gate lounges (shouldn't the whole airside be ""sterile"" anyway?).

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,S Norton,United Kingdom,2012-09-27,On the whole I like Schiphol the signage to the BA check-in is non existent - I nearly always struggle to find them and I travel through several times a year. BA Lounge is small but tranquil the staff are always welcoming. It is a long walk from check-in and the walk to the gates is usually quite long as well. In some ways I prefer the gates that are the furthest as they have a mini 'central security' which means that premium passengers can have priority boarding. Most of the gates have individual security which means queuing up at the gate for security and again to board the plane. It seems an inefficient use of manpower. As I usually only stay in the Netherlands for a short time I avoid checking in baggage - the wait for bags to arrive is lengthy. The only other complaint is the taxi to the gate when arriving it can be in excess of 15 minutes. In summary not the worst used to be one of the best - but definitely needs more than a band-aid to put it in my favourites again.,NA,NA,NA,7,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

One thing I missed was a proper sit-down service like. Signage and layout is easy to navigate however distances can be long but on a positive note it at least allows for healthy exercise between flights.

After 5 flights not once did I have to wait longer for security then 3 minutes. The H-gates offer only a small overpriced place where you can buy drinks before boarding as do the vending machines at the gate area The M-gates offer a small lounge with possibility to buy a few items but don't go in there too early since there is not much to do you better of in Schiphol plaza. H or M gates use preboarding which means you are put into a holding pen but as they only open the gate when the flight is due to arrive you not have to spend ages.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,Justin Bell,Spain,2010-12-14,I have been through Amsterdam many times and know the airport well. My main comments today (2010) is that it is a fairly easy airport to use great shopping lots of airline lounges if you have time between connections and are a privileged member of a frequent flyer programme plenty of toilets / rest rooms some left luggage safes restaurants internet access etc. It has the advantage of not being as big as London Heathrow or some of the large USA airports (JFK or Chicago) and having lots of flights all over the place. I have used the Yotel (airport hotel where rooms are booked by the hour) and it is useful if you arrive late at night and leave the next morning. The airport has 2 main sections - international (Gates D - H) and EU (Gates B -D). Note that some of the D gates are in the international section and some in the EU section. The biggest problem with Amsterdam airport is if you are connecting between a EU flight and an international flight you might have quite a walk and will most likely (unless you are very lucky) have to wait in a ridiculous immigration queue to get from one section to the other. There is a separate queue behind each immigration officers desk so if you get stuck behind someone who is being questioned you could have quite a wait. They also never have enough immigration officers for the amount of passengers passing through here and so they have now started a first / business class separate queue. Basically this bit is a mess. Someone else's comment about security at the gates meaning you can't buy water after security is a good point. Just take an empty bottle and fill it on the plane. Also if you buy any liquids in any other airport make sure they seal it in a an approved EU plastic bag seal otherwise you will leave it behind in Amsterdam! Overall it is an easy airport to use.

There are no KLM staff available and the airport staff misdirected me to the Economy queue. Once through security you are made to wait in an inadequately fitted cattle pen with insufficient seats and then a scum to get on board.

The few open counters are not enough at all when the flights from SQ Delta and CX are arriving at the same time (and many others)! I was through quickly as have EU passport but my friend had to wait nearly 30 minutes. Baggage delivered quickly. I love the great connectivity of AMS to trains bus taxi etc. On our return flight check-in very quick and no problem but again very very long queue for passport control there were two queues only for non EU passengers and one for EU passengers - my friend was waiting 45 minutes myself 30 minutes!

I was travelling to Manchester from Antalya along with hundreds of other people. Some people were travelling to different countries such as Holland Russia Germany. There simply is no queuing system. Everybody chooses anywhere where they can have their luggage and passports and tickets scanned. It doesn't matter where you are travelling to or what time you just pick your own check in point. This may sound ideal but believe me it isn't. If your flight it due in an hours time from check in then you will be very lucky to get on your flight. After checking In you then are scanned. Then you have to have your passport checked again. Believe me this was so traumatic!!! All nationalities were pushing and squeezing to get their passports checked. There were thousands of people some who only had ten minutes to get on their plane before take off. There must have been only 3 or 4 people to check all these thousands of people's passports. Travellers were becoming irate distressed and someone with a weak heart could easily have collapsed. There needs to be a much better system. I will never use this airport until I hear the system has improved. Somebody could have been very seriously hurt or even worse. Children were crying people were shouting at each other and the workers checking the passports were extremely stressed out.

Porters were very pushy and hard to get rid of. Departed on 3 Nov - a nightmare. Flights were very full and so there were long queues to check in not helped by the fact there are no self service machines. None of the ATMs at the airport or the nearby Bank of Antigua were working so we ended up having to borrow money off other passengers to pay our departure tax. Not sure what this tax is for given the woeful state of the airport. Again long queues for immigration – perhaps they were wary of our NZ passports? Very few shops not enough seats café inadequate.

Once cleared immigration had another queue to get through customs then the worst thing is you have to recheck your baggage and go through security why when you have got off an international flight and not left the terminal do you have to go through security. All this queuing took over two hours and i made my connecting flight with minutes to spare avoid Atlanta if at all possible. Also food outlets at the international departures is abysmal and very expensive just had a beer at the bar and for a large Bud they charged me $12.55 and had the nerve to include an 18% gratuity charge.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,J Krinsky,United States,2014-01-08,I agree with previous reviews of the shuttle system between the international and domestic terminal. I have been to almost every international airport in the US and overseas and I have never seen such an inefficient and stupid system. I found that the airport does not allow any outside ANY shuttle pick ups at the international terminal. This includes regional shuttles such as Groome Transportation to Columbus and Macon. You must go to the domestic terminal and ground transportation on a tiny airport shuttle bus. Try getting heavy suitcases onto one of these tiny shuttle busses and the driver yelling at you to hurry up.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,J Krinsky,United States,2013-05-06,My main complaint concerns ground transportation at the international terminal. The airport does not permit any pick-ups by regional hotel or downtown shuttle services (they do permit drop-offs). On arrival you must take a small shuttle bus to the domestic terminal and the ground transportation centre if you need a regional hotel or downtown shuttle van. Try getting 3 heavy suitcases on and off this small and crowded bus. I have never been to an airport with such an inconvenient and insufficient system. The airport should permit pick-ups at the international terminal! Otherwise I found Immigration and Customs to be fast and friendly compared to my last trip. I was out of the airport within 60 minutes of exiting the airplane. Even airport staff were friendly and helpful.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,J Krinsky,United States,2012-08-28,The new international terminal is very nice. However the airport does not permit regional shuttles to pick up passengers at the new international terminal (they are permitted to drop off passengers). When arriving if you need to catch a regional shuttle (Groome Transportation) to another city such as Columbus Ga. or Macon Ga. you must first get on a small airport bus that takes you to ground transportation located in the domestic terminal. It is very inconvenient especially with several suitcases. I have never seen an airport with such a system. Regional shuttles should be permitted to pick up passengers at the international terminal. Also when exiting the international terminal there are no signs indicating how to get to downtown Atlanta or other areas. The signs only say I-75 North I-75 South and I-285. This is confusing.

First there is only one place to eat in the departure level outside the security check point. It is rather small and often crowded. Second the customs area is too small to handle all incoming flights. Customs officials are rude and bark orders to arriving passengers. Third to catch MARTA or regional shuttles you have to get on a shuttle bus to go to the domestic terminal and ground transportation. That means lugging your heavy luggage onto a shuttle bus. The domestic terminal was much more convenient and offers more services. The only advantage of the new international terminal is that passengers do not have to recheck their luggage and go through security before exiting the airport.

Only 4 customs officers on duty and very surly people then shouting at you to clear the area even if you were just waiting for friends or family to come through. On the journey back you see the new terminal facility and whilst gate areas are spacious the facilities are very poor. There is a fast food court and a few shops and that's it. There was far more catering available in the domestic piers.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,J Krinsky,United States,2011-11-28,In my opinion ATL is a very efficient airport considering the amount of passengers served. ATL is easy to navigate and you do not have to go outside to change terminals. The down side of this airport is international arrivals as you are required to recheck and claim your luggage and go through a security checkpoint before exiting the airport. However this will change in a few months when the new international terminal opens. If your final destination is Atlanta you will exit the airport after clearing customs no more security checks and rechecking of luggage.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,John Doe,United States,2011-01-14,"This airport has it's good and it's bad points. From the point of view of arriving at this airport it is mediocre at best. Once off the plane you frantically search for the baggage claim signs. This could be improved upon greatly. Once getting downstairs to the shuttles between concourses you are rushed to the baggage claim efficiently. The rental car facilities are well maintained and usually staffed. Leaving the rental car facility is simple then you enter and head directly into the hell that is baggage check-in. If you are fortunate carry-on you are in luck not much waiting. Typically we travel with odd engineering tools which can be a hassel to explain to TSA ""agents"" who apparently moonlight as Walmart employees. So a carry-on is usually in favor. When you approach the desk and I've only struggled with Delta check-in agents are often discourteous. Many stand around under signs which indicate that terminal is open and when you approach them they are quick to inform you to choose another line. The lines are long because only one person usually checks bags per every 25 people standing in line. Once through this heading for security is simple. There are many places to chop and eat both inside and outside security. The frustration here is their ""expert traveler"" security point. Located at the end of the hall quite often you get stragglers who miss the main security gate. I have no problem spending a few minutes in security if means I get home safely. My frustration is with those who are completely unprepared and think the world has to wait on them. Once through heading to your gate is simple - at the gate the shops and eateries throughout the concourses. But there isn't enough seating in the gate area for those on each plane. Often crowds and lines form into the main aisle putting you harms way of being run over with impatient shuttle (golf cart) drivers chauffeuring loads of elderly and morbidly obese people. Grab something to eat if there's room and if you have time to stand in line. Do some shopping or find a seat four gates away. People watching is always a good way to pass the time.",NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

It is fortunate that the flight was late because its arrival at the same time as EK's other two A380s would give Auckland some fearsome problems. Apart from the puzzle of two separate duty-free stores charging near-identical prices I quite liked it: the EGates worked fine not too long to wait for baggage (but only because the other EK flights were on time) and the customs/agricultural processing has been sharpened up by getting only a proportion of passengers' baggage through the X-ray machines and waving through the balance.

The E-gates work fine. Departure was much better; EK had extra staff on to speed up check-in and the two Pier B gates have enough room just to cope with two A380s' worth of departing passengers.

There were not enough seats at that gate to accommodate more than 25% of the flight no one could hear the boarding announcements there were only four toilets and it was generally not an good experience.

I prefer quiet to some of that stuff! For the Starbuck's fans there's one in the terminal now. There are ""Austin-inspired"" murals above check-in. Great to have local artists but the art is rather pedestrian showing scenes of poor Hispanics. I think there's probably more to Austin than that.

Blue Van may be a long wait and long drive as they drop off others. Early am flights (6:30am and earlier) are insane. Long long lines at security as all airlines seem to have flights at this time.

bandar-seri-begawan-airport,/airport-reviews/bandar-seri-begawan-airport,Bandar Seri Begawan Airport customer review,Edmund Carew,NA,2007-08-08,A dreary airport that is showing its 33 year old age. Even the tropical fish tank lacked the illustrated number of species. Upon transiting between SIN and SYD with a five and a half hour stopover I paid $25 for an unexciting city tour. At 2000hrs passengers were called to the departure lounge for the 2105 BI flight to SYD. After placing our handcarry through the X-Ray machine transit passengers - about 15 to 20 - all had duty free liqour purchased at airports such as SIN and DXB confiscated. Many passengers repeatedly argued with the airport police and a so- called 'supervisor' to no avail. I spoke later with a senior staff member of Royal Brunei Airlines who claimed he had not heard of dutyfree liqour being confiscated but agreed that it was exempt from the February 2007 introduction at many airports of a '100ml individual one litre total' rule for handcarry liquids aerosols and gels. No RBA staff member offered to assist at Brunei Airport. The airline has since informed me that it is receiving many complaints from passengers and that those affected should write to it whereby claims will be forwarded to its Brunei head office for consideration for compensation. The arrogant Brunei Airport staff claimed that the liquor bottles would be broken : some wags interpreted this to mean the seals would be broken in private parties or that the liqour would be resold on the black market. One English couple lost an expensive bottle of Scotch and as usual many passengers were purchasing liqour as gifts for relatives and friends not for their personal consumption. Presumably this scam occurs with every flight that has transit passengers. It must net such officials a veritable mountain of spirits each year. Avoid this airport should you have purchased duty free liqour elsewhere. I did not observe whether cigarettes or perfumes were similarly confiscated.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

All the immigration counters were open and it helped the passengers to move out of the section quickly.

They don't stop at examining whether you have a visa for the country you are proceeding to. I was asked why I was flying out of Bangalore when I have taken most of my previous flights out of Chennai. Every passenger was being asked for the return ticket which is something that is never asked for in Chennai. I always buy one way tickets because my programme is variable and my departure airport is never fixed in advance. On a previous occasion when I was flying BLR-SIN on a one way ticket I was denied immigration clearance for a long time till I told them that I could open my computer and book a return ticket on the spot. I told them that nowadays even the entry airports at foreign countries don't ask for a return ticket. My explanations seemed to infuriate the officer who started raising his voice and it was only the timely intervention of a senior officer who had come to investigate why the queue was not moving that I finally got through immigration.

bangalore-airport,/airport-reviews/bangalore-airport,Bangalore Airport customer review,Kurt Müller,NA,2005-08-07,One could be forgiven for not realising that one is at the airport of what is trumpeted as India’s IT capital. Checking in with any airline using Air India’s computer terminals at BLR passengers can forget about obtaining boarding passes to their final destination if their trip involves a transfer at an intermediate point – the system cannot handle anything but the leg departing from Bangalore. The immigration desks have no scanners for swiping machine-readable passports. However there is uniformed personnel in abundance – some of them doing nothing else but checking whether their counterpart a few yards away has placed a stamp in your documents. Where they are really needed these officers do nothing. Boarding a TG flight on 7th August the procedure was a disaster. Instead of providing the announced priority to families with children and those needing special assistance (and then allowing business class passengers on first) the uniformed guard at the gate was happily (yet again) checking for the numerous stamps on boarding passes of anyone who was rude enough to push their way through (and such people are in abundance in India let me tell you). On the infrastructure side matters have deteriorated even further. Last week I witnessed the collapse of a new structure designed to hide the aircon ducts in the domestic terminal burying the Kingfisher check in desk and one of their agents under the debris. At the international departures building buying a visitor’s ticket has become a farce as passengers and visitors are now separated at the front door and have to use separate escalators. And judging by the state of the seats in the international departures lounge I wonder whether the stray dogs that are omnipresent on the apron area are allowed to use the seats during quite periods – it is simply unimaginable that humans could soil cushions to that extent – and even more so that no one seems to realize they need cleaning.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Lots of signs have incomplete information. Map slightly confusing. Not a lot of restaurants and interesting shops. Stingy food servings. At least service personnel were nice enough spoke good English. Waiting gates and the check-in procedures tedious uncomfortable. Free WiFi available required tedious registration. Only available showers are in Lounges - my one (CIP) provided only basic one for 350 Baht. The 2nd time I went to the better one next door which cost 1200 Baht complete with WiFi computers food drinks couches. Hope this place will be improved.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,2,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

I use BKK at least 2-4 times a month and aim to spend as little time and money in the place as possible. Check-in for TG business class is the only good thing about the place (however the TG lounge is worn out and offers snacks I wouldn't feed the dog) Duty Free is not only more expensive than other major duty free shops in Asia it's more expensive than downtown Bangkok. The toilets are disgusting even the new ones. The F&B outlets are all very low quality yet charge high prices. The car park doesn't accept credit cards - it's cash only and you don't even get a receipt.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2013-11-12,I think reviews of this airport depend on arriving or departing. I've rarely had difficulties flying out of Bangkok although I do make sure I'm there well in advance of my flight times. This is a very busy airport and always seems crowded due in my opinion to the lack of seating which leads to people walking up and down the concourse while waiting for their gates to be confirmed the duty free is very expensive and most of the shops seem to offer the same range of goods. The choice of food is quite good although the eating area again tend to get very crowded as people linger long after they've finished their meals just to have somewhere to sit. As all my flights are with Qatar I know which gates are usually used I have a Qatar Privilege Club Silver card so I can check in at the business counter and usually get a fast track pass and invitation to one of the Thai business lounges. Perhaps I'm just lucky in the fact that Qatar seem to have very efficient ground staff it's a pity they can't organise the arrivals also.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Took over an hour just to get through and by the time I got to the baggage claim belt they were already putting bags through from another flight from Dubai which landed an hour after mine! BKK need to be more efficient when it comes to handling passengers! However despite being an enormous airport I'd say it's fairly easy to navigate around (well signposted etc) and fairly clean. Journey out of BKK was a bit of a nightmare the woman at the check-in desk was quite rude. I was looking around for the resealable bags for the liquids in my hand luggage and none were to be found despite various empty desk slots for them and signs reminding you about the security procedure. Tried asking airport staff and they were completely useless. Decided to go through with it and by the X-Ray machine there was a stack of them! Luckily security and passport control went a little smoother and staff seemed friendlier. Plenty of shops in departure lounge which was nice but departure gate was such a long way from security! Then at departure gate- plane was delayed and passengers weren't informed until about half an hour after scheduled flight time! Overall not such a great experience this time.

Upon arrival on Friday afternoon the queues for immigration were very long and many of the desks closed. Took around half an hour to get through which after a long 11 hour flight is poor. Going out on Saturday early morning it took over an hour and a half to check in go through security and then immigration. Once through we had to run to the gate to ensure we made our flight. The shops were empty - presumably because everybody was late for their flights! Coming back in was terrible - 45 minutes to clear immigration again hardly any desks open.

It only took five minutes to clear immigration. The bags took awhile to arrive but this just meant that I had time to exchange money at one of the many (competitive) vendors in the arrivals area. Departure - Horrible airport. It hard to believe that it is only six years old. The design seems like something from another era. Up through security I have no major complaints but then the entire experience really goes downhill. The first priority does not seem to be getting you to your gate but rather making sure you are exposed to every single one of the very high end shops. I did not see one newsstand or bookstore anywhere although I did finally see a great drugstore. There are some normal food options toward the end. The gate situation could not have been designed by anyone who travels much. You sit outside the gate area in a place with few seats until shortly before boarding. It is a crowded miserable experience. Your boarding cards are submitted as you enter the (secure) gate area where more seating is available. It is odd to have precious little seating where most people wait.

My luggage appeared promptly on the inbound as well within 10 mins of clearing customs.

On departure no lines at check-in as all Thai Airways desks looked open passport control I had 2 people in line before me and would have been quick but one of them had lost their departure card. Security lines were longer but nothing huge.

The airport is functional and if you are lucky like me immigration can be quite fast (less then 5 min on the last few occasions). However without access to a lounge you can't expect many amenities only bare bones seating areas. Other modern airports in the region such as SIN KUL HG and ICN are way ahead of BKK in terms of customer amenities.

The problem simply worsened exponentially now as the airport is undergoing ""renovations"" - in short the original VIP channel was shut down and they had to ration out the non VIP channels as the temporary VIP channels making the already chaotic scene even worse. Yesterday I queued for 1.5 hours to get through immigration. It was impossible to find where the queue started and which queue led to which counter there was hardly any staff to maintain the order. Security staff are poor mannered and sometimes can be very offensive. Once passing through security things started to get better: the food selection was good and plenty of cafes and shops.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,Terence Verney,Netherlands,2011-07-11,Spacious split level airport with plenty of restaurants and seating facilities. Immigration can be a headache if you arrive around midday and in spite of 12 available aisles it can take around 30 mins to clear during peak periods. Departure is even worse and you'd be well advised to allow at least 1hr to clear immigration during peak periods in order to avoid missing your flight. Toilets are clean but there often seems to be a lack of paper hand towels. Also they don't seem to enforce the no smoking ban in the toilets and one is often greeted by the pungent smell of stale tobacco smoke. Navigating between floors can be a headache since the lift often skips a floor for no apparent reason and you end up at a different level than the intended one. Security staff subsequently refuse to allow you to use a walkway to get to the floor you intended to go to. So you're forced to return to your starting point and look for an escalator to go to the floor you actually want to reach. Only two banks available (Siam and TMB) which offer very poor exchange rates. On the plus side Thai SIM cards are available at either the AIS (1-2-Call) or DTAC (Happy) service desks on level 2. Staff will set up your mobile for you and extend the validity period if you wish to keep the same number for a subsequent visit. Provided you use the AOT taxi booths on the ground floor and pay the 50 Baht service charge you'll have no problem with the touts who hang around the upper levels looking for gullible travellers who don't know the ropes. Taxis are metered and unlike Phuket are cheap. There is also a non- stop rail link between the airport and the city centre with a flat rate fee of 150 Baht.,NA,NA,NA,5,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Still relatively new as far as infrastructure goes and plenty of facilities to keep one distracted during a long wait. The building itself is rather monolithic and therefore lacks the bright and airy feel of terminals like HKG and the arrivals concourse can seem rather stark. My only two gripes with this airport are: air- conditioning. It never seems to be working properly and queuing at immigration outwards and inwards. Individual queues in front of each counter is a hopeless set-up. It is frustratingly slow to the point of desperation. I wonder why they haven't set up a single queue and have the first available counter call the next person in line.

I try to choose early morning arrivals or departures which seems to eliminate the queuing problems - I wouldn't consider a flight arriving/departing in the late morning or afternoon. Immigration officials are not very talkative even with Thai people so it might be a little unfair to comment on their seeming unfriendliness it's the way they are with everyone and is quite common with Thai officials everywhere not just at the airport. Shops are outrageously expensive compared to Thai street prices but we counter that by buying snacks & water outside the airport. Seating can also be a problem at times. Also be aware that scams and rip-offs are not uncommon at the duty-free shops and have been known to get people in trouble - items you haven't bought being put in a bag with legitimate purchases without your knowledge or as a gift unintentionally wandering outside the limits of the shop with an item you haven't yet paid for maybe to show others; both of these have been known to land travellers with the threat of prosecution and expensive fines (ie. bribes) to avoid jail.

I noticed that the toilets are more well-maintained. Taxi queue is also efficient. However on departure horrors! First the Customs Office was not manned at all (I arrived at 10am) so I was not able to have my VAT Refund validated. I couldn't wait any further after seeing the extensively long queues to passport control and subsequently to security check. I must have queued for almost an hour. Naturally since my refund forms were not validated I was not able to get my refund back (was told I have 60 days) to claim my refund (if and when I return to Bangkok during this time frame). After reading a lot of reviews re duty free prices I decided to skip shopping. Most restaurants are filled with customers so I was not able to grab a snack and decided to wait for the inflight meal served at almost 2:30pm. Overall Suvarnabhumi Airport is comparably better with other airports in Asia (except Changi HKIA and KLIA in that order).

This being my 7th time to this airport I have grown used to its ""unique experience"" however I was in for a pleasant surprise as this was the first time I had been here since the overhaul of the arrivals and departures facilities. These were immediately visable as were were taxied iinto the gate. Still no jetways in sight. Passengers use steps to board/disembark. The new air conditioned immigration facilities mean one fast moving queueing system to all immigration booths as opposed to individual queues of varying lengths to each immigration booth. A new air conditioned reclaim area with working belts is a breath of fresh air for weary air travellers. Licenced airport taxis are available at the outdoor meeting point immediately after customs clearance. We were approached by several touts who tried to coax us over to their cars in the car park however we insisted on a licenced cab which advertise their rates to all the main points on the island in BDS$ and US$ at the meeting point. The overall impression to arriving passengers is now one of a well run and efficient airport. Departure back to Gatwick on 30th June 2007 also a pleasant improvement over the old. Extended check in facilities run the length on one half of the departures area and then run as far into the terminal itself. Departure tax is now collected at the time of purchasing your ticket so no need to keep $25 in cash handy for leaving the island. The only downside to the revamped departures area is that there isn't a great deal of seating before going through security. The new immigration and security screening point is also air conditioned and queues were managed well to allow 4 wide bodied jet loads of passengers to pass through seamlessly without too much delay. New retail outlets are positioned after security which all passengers have to walk past in order to approach the gate areas. All jet departures board from this gate area where there are plenty of seats. There is also a small VIP lounge airside which allows you to buy access on the day (subject to availability) for BD$40 per person. Regional prop flights board from their original ""open air"" gates however regional passengers still wait in the same area as international passengers. There are also extension ""remote"" gates with shuttle busses to/from the aircraft for when the airport gets really busy. Toilet facilities clean however sparse in number. In summary a thoroughly pleasant experience only let down by by a few niggles. a complete change in experience from my expectation. It now feels like an efficient airport facility.",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport is situated in France and run by French staff most of which are impolite or not bothered to say the least do not speak any foreign language (i.e. German or English - bearing in mind that they work on the Swiss side of the airport and should at least have some rudimentary understanding that they may have to converse in German at Basel or the lingua franca which is English and not French) and have a 'cannot do' attitude to customers. The security staff simply do not understand that BA's Club Europe is Business Class and try to refuse entry to fast track. This is even more surprising given that only Turkish Airlines Swiss Lufthansa Air France and BA operate from and to Basel as proper international airlines and surely it cannot be that hard to learn their business class products. This has been happening for the last three - four months now. The airport facilities are extremely poor.

Bus line 50 connects the airport to Basel central station every 10 mins - reliable service at CHF5.80 one-way travel time around 20 mins. On the French side more limited service - no direct connection to Mulhouse: a shuttle bus brings you first to Saint-Louis railway station from there you can catch a regional train to Mulhouse. Upon departure check-in at the self-service machines hassle-free. No queue at security but staff prefers speaking French than English. In the public area large terrace with nice views on the apron. The restaurant on the Swiss side is truly delicious with decent prices; but I would rather avoid the bistro on the French side - gloomy with only basic food. Boarding gates are lacking proper airconditioning so that it can quickly become very warm there.

beauvais-airport,/airport-reviews/beauvais-airport,Beauvais Airport customer review,Mark Wadham,NA,2008-11-18,This once great little airport has outgrown itself. When there were just 2 or 3 flights a day this airport was a pleasure to use. The problem is that there are now many flights and further expansion is planned. This would be fine if the facilities were developed in parallel. I arrived one hour before my flight having checked-in online to find the car parks at near saturation point. A helpful attendant invited me to leave my car at the end of a row but outside a normal parking space. In the terminal there was a very long queue to go through passport control & security. This was because insufficient staff were on duty for the number of passengers. This is inexcusable as surely the authorities must know the number of passengers expected beforehand. it also represents a loss for the airport as many passengers - myself included no longer had time to visit the shops. Although at the airport one hour before the flight I only boarded 10 minutes before departure due to these inadequacies. The other major problem at this airport is access. If your destination/departure point is Paris there's no problem. If it's anywhere else there is virtually no other choice than to use a car and be subjected to the monopolistic practices of using the airport car parks. There is a bus to Beauvais but its infrequency is as good as to render it useless. This airport needs to invest fast in additional parking quicker security and larger departure lounges. The bus service to Beauvais needs to be increased to at least one bus per hour to allow the surrounding communities to benefit from what is after all Beauvais airport rather than Paris airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Instead you must transit through dusty tired old Terminal 2 with very limited food and shopping choices. Lounge areas for premium passengers are equally drab with old furniture and lacklustre food. The good part is that T2 is uncrowded most of the time since most all other airlines except Skyteam have moved to T3.

Airside once again there was insufficient seating (the airport is designed as a shopping mall with optional access to aeroplanes in the currently fashionable style). The seating shortage was particularly unreasonable at the departure gates where people know they need to assemble en masse if they're flying with an airline that offers no seat allocations.

Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus connection with Berne central station upon each regular incoming and departing flight - one-way costs 5.20CHF.

Departing is usually not the problem but arriving and waiting for gates and sometimes steps or an air bridge is a joke, it often appears as if the plane has ""dropped in"" unexpectedly and taken them by surprise. Luggage collection is also a bit of a joke, can wait up to an hour for luggage to appear on carousel. It's worth noting that BHX is trying for more long haul flights now that the runway has been extended for larger aircraft, but heaven help arriving passengers if this come to be, it'll be a nightmare under the present system of baggage handling on arrival.

Choice of shops was good but prices were not a lot better if at all than on the High Street. Duty free in the UK seems to have gone downhill rapidly over recent years. Boarding was good and efficient with plenty of screens around to tell you about the flight so no worries about missing the boarding call. Very good.

At 5.30 in the morning you don't expect to be greeted by any queues! I dread to think what the situation will be this Easter weekend or in the summer. The problem is easy to see and the designer of the security area wants sacking. You cannot pick up a tray until you get to the X-ray machines so there is no way to start preparing to remove liquids belt jewellery coat boots laptop coins and everything else that has to go in the tray. Hence the delay. Once through there are only a couple of tables and chairs so you struggle with the largest tray imaginable and have to sit on the floor to put everything back again.

birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2010-08-17,Birmingham Airport seems to be going down the road of ripping customers off at every opportunity.

It used to be free but according to one of the police officers at the airport due to anti-terror measures the charges were brought in along with a new drop-off area. The airport luggage trollies cost £1 (you don't get your £1 back). The plastic bags cost £1 at the security point. Upon arrival at the airport baggage always takes about an hour to arrive in the baggage reclaim area and you are stung again for a £1 luggage trolley.

bogota-airport,/airport-reviews/bogota-airport,Bogota Airport customer review,Richard Winger,NA,2010-08-23,BOG is turning into a total disaster under the twin pressures of increasing passenger loads and a long overdue incredibly slow renovation. Inbound immigration is often understaffed and the wait can be upwards of an hour. Domestic connections on the main local airline Avianca require another long wait for a long ride to their domestic terminal. Because the buses don't run frequently enough they are always packed and uncomfortable. Outbound if you are a premium passenger check in at Avianca is efficient. If you are just a normal person count an hour to get to the check in desk. Security and outbound immigration have improved and are now mostly quick. Avianca's international lounge renovated only two years ago is already run down with minimum food and beverage offerings but blaring TV sets all over the place. The second security check on US bound flights is a free for all. Surprisingly Avianca the main carrier at the airport has except for check in no fast track for premium passengers so regardless of how much you pay for your ticket or what elite status you have you stand in line with everybody else.

bordeaux-airport,/airport-reviews/bordeaux-airport,Bordeaux Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,2010-06-09,The new low-cost terminal is awful. Not quite as bad as the inhuman misery of Marseilles- Provence but not far off it. Laughably it is called Billi - are we supposed to feel better about being treated like cattle if the shed has a stupid name? As you enter leave your dignity at the door you are now a piece of self-loading freight. They have not wasted money on seats information screens (there appeared to be one) staff computers and other luxuries. Surprisingly they have found the money for a 'duty free' shop (most prices seemed higher than in the supermarket). You will stand in queues with your luggage to show your boarding pass passport and of course a good 20 minutes at the 'gate' (ie a door). What really puzzles me is why they have done this; I have used the main terminal at Bordeaux several times with low cost airlines and found it perfectly adequate and not overstretched - why is 'Billi' necessary? I can only assume it is about putting people in their place and if you are a low- cost passenger that place is beneath contempt. If the people who design these horrible places read this have you ever tried using one of your terminals under normal circumstances? Probably not you are too busy enjoying the business class lounge. If you are responsible for managing one ditto and put someone who knows what they are doing in charge; also invest in some new technology - checking people by hand went out about 20 years ago at most airports. If you are a passenger complain write reviews and fight against this they have nothing to do with efficiency and everything to do with increasing profits through sub-standard facilities.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

brasilia-airport,/airport-reviews/brasilia-airport,Brasilia Airport customer review,G Villela,NA,2009-04-08,The apparent discrepancy in previous comments is easily explained. The BSB terminal's quality is strikingly different between the boarding gate area and the pre-security one. The latter is really nice. The city's high-altitude tropical climate makes for amenable temperatures almost all year around and makes air conditioning dispensable in the wide open entrance area which is a really pleasant place. Check-in is usually fast and efficient (except on late Thursday and on Friday because of the already mentioned busy traffic of Congressmen and their aides going to home states) there is a fairly complete shopping-mall-style food court with many options including movie theatres good shopping with not only the usual luxury-item style but also plenty of those last-minute simple essentials. Once past security however things change. It wouldn't be bad were it not for the fact that the boarding gate area was simply underdimensioned for the traffic it gets. Pray to get a jet-bridged gate because the ground- level boarding area for bussed remote positions is very small and can be really chaotic at times. Arrivals are usually fine though - enough conveyor belts and luggage arrives fast enough to ensure a quick turnover. Signage could be better on arrival and transit areas. Transportation is indeed a problem - the buses mentioned are regular urban buses with no space for luggage and are infrequent. Taxis are really expensive but are mostly the only practical choice. But a light-rail line is planned for the next couple of years and that should improve things a lot.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Accessible by bus No 61 from train station but drivers are sometimes angry and buses not suitable for easy baggage transport. Tickets are sold in machines or news-stands only (no driver sale !!!) so look around for coins. Terminal - absolute lack of seats inside and not visible security precautions. Most vulnerable point that can make you upset is security check - just after passport control you stay in line mixed from few streams and only one from two x-ray gates is open goes very slowly every stuck stops the people behind (executed by state policemen not security service - they don't pull people aside when beeping but stop them all until trouble solved !).

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,Roger Stone,NA,2009-03-17,As a regular travelling through both the international and domestic terminals at Brisbane Airport I thought I would add my comments here. Compared to many airports throughout the world I have travelled through Brisbane Airport compares very favourably. Airbridges and steps to the aircraft tend to arrive quickly (unlike Heathrow for example) and immigration is mostly very efficient although I would recommend evening arrivals rather than early morning arrivals if you can plan it that way. Sitting next to passengers arriving from other countries I have noticed some confusion regarding transferring to the domestic terminal which is only about a kilometre or so away from the international terminal on the same airport and suburban trains are available for the transfer. However an odd problem I have noticed is that many in Australia seem to confuse the term 'terminal' with 'airport'. This means that you may be asked to transfer to the 'domestic airport' when arriving at the international terminal in Brisbane. Please do not be dismayed. This is in fact the 'domestic terminal' which is located on the same airport. There is no other airline-used 'domestic airport' in Brisbane separate from the main Brisbane Airport (as would be the case for example in Bangkok) The same issue applies in Sydney where the domestic and international terminals are located on the same airport despite what the confusing signs may tell you. The other main issue with Brisbane Airport is that although many flights now arrive from international destinations between 1030pm and 1am there are no trains into the city at all after about 7.30pm. The railway authorities do not seem to have realised this need. Otherwise both domestic and international terminals offer good shopping with airy walkways and plenty of parking and plenty of taxis are usually available.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Mark Taylor,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,First the good news. Given this is a small airport averaging around half a dozen departures per hour you are unlikely to face a long queue on the runway for take off or for that matter to have to circle around for ages to land. Also the check in queues were not too bad albeit I flew during the off peak season. But that is about all there is good to say. The whole point of little airports is they should be easy to use very short walks from the plane to the exit. Instead it has been designed without airbridges so you usually need a bus to get to the plane. You will also face long walks with no moving walkways (mine on return was over 1/4 mile) along with going up and down stairs (again no escalators). Anyone with young children and pushchairs or elderly and infirm should take careful note. Access is horrendous as the airport is in the middle of nowhere without any sensible connection to the M4 or M5. Most people will either have to go through Bristol or across windy minor roads. The parking is basically in a dirty great big field poorly concreted and open to the elements so if it's raining you will get drenched. All this for parking prices on a par with LHR and Gatwick despite the airports rural location. Helpfully the short term car park is also sited in a dip so you face a big uphill lugging of your cases while the rain pelts you. If you want a trolley it's £2 per trolley non refundable.

I sent an email to the airport politely asking why this happens as it seems inefficient on a number of levels and inconveniences passengers for no apparent reason. Two weeks have passed and no reply I assume there is no rational explanation. It also indicates the indifference with which the airport's management appear to regard their customers. For all this I am not entirely negative about the airport I have never encountered rude staff at security or border control as mentioned by others some appear rather bored and disinterested but to be honest it is not the most exciting job however they have always been polite.

My wife and I recently flew from the airport at Saturday lunchtime a very busy period in summer. We paid £29.99 for 8 day's parking in the long stay admittedly a promotional offer but open to anyone. We were through security in 3 or 4 mins (about six or seven security stations open) and found strolling to the far end of the western walkway no problem at all and we are both in our late sixties. Before that we enjoyed an inexpensive lunch and wine (admittedly again on promotional offers open to anyone) at one of the eateries. We returned a week later on a Saturday at teatime and were one of six international flights 150-seat plus sized aircraft to have landed in a twenty minute period. Everyone to whom we spoke was polite which is our usual experience at Bristol (with the very occasional exception down the years) perhaps because we are always polite to them and try to co-operate with all requests. We were driving out of the car park within thirty minutes of our landing wheels touching the runway.

As the previous report said the walk to flights leaving from the western apron is lengthy; they allow for this by calling flights well before they are due to leave. OK if you are reasonably mobile but are there more seats when you get to your gate? Guess. So that is another 15 minutes of standing around.

I do not know if the on-going expansion will address this problem but if not there will be major problems in the summer - the amount of physical space available even for standing has been reduced drastically. Where is one supposed to go if one does not want overpriced food and drink? There are still good things about Bristol: the long-stay car park is expensive but a two minute walk from the terminal building and on Saturday we checked-in went through departure control and security in about five minutes total (it was a quiet time of day).

brussels-zaventem-airport,/airport-reviews/brussels-zaventem-airport,Brussels Zaventem Airport customer review,M McManus,United Kingdom,2012-10-10,Been through this airport literally hundreds of times in my working life. There are two terminals; terminal A serves flights within the Schengen zone terminal B serves those outside. Terminal B takes slightly longer to get through as there are passport inspections before you are allowed to pass through to security. Terminal A only needs you to swipe your boarding pass on a scanner but it is a surprisingly long walk from the entrance of Terminal A to the gates. Both terminals have a decent choice of cafes and restaurants although the best restaurants are before you go through security you'll find them on the food court on level 3. There is wifi but you need to buy a scratch card with a password to use it. There are yellow vending machines security side selling them. Be warned that the shuttle buses (number 12 and 21) don't take you to the city centre they go to the European institutions which are a couple of miles south east of the city centre. Shuttle bus journeys are €5 one way or ten journeys for €25 which makes a lot of sense if you use it a lot. If you want a cheap way to the centre the SNCB train on level minus 1 will take you to Gare Centrale for about €7. A taxi is around €40.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

brussels-zaventem-airport,/airport-reviews/brussels-zaventem-airport,Brussels Zaventem Airport customer review,M Masters,United Arab Emirates,2011-07-20,BRU is quite inefficient. The design of the airport maximises transfer times due to large distances and a design combining multiple walkways and escalators. It took us more than 10mins to walk to the passport control from our flight gate. Several passport control desks seemed to be unmanned resulting in a wait of approx 90 mins to clear it. The only advantage of an almost 2hr transit between the flight landing and baggage collection was that the baggage was on the carousal when we arrived there. Upon arriving at the train station at the airport we had to wait approx 15 mins to be served as only 2 counters were open. During departure via Brussels airlines we had to wait 45mins to drop off our bags (checked-in at the airport kiosk) which is probably not the airports fault. However the long walks and 20mins for security check definitely are.

Generally it is a well-organised easy to use airport with good facilities. However two things are very irritating and both could be improved at little cost. Firstly if one arrives from a non-Schengen state and the aircraft is parked in a remote spot (as is often the case) you are taken by bus to the terminal. This is fine except the bus drops passengers at a door that is a good 200m from the immigration control point so a rush of people up the stairs and along a very long corridor develops. Why not simply drop everyone closer to the passport check point - there appear to be doors already in place? Secondly there is a train into the centre of the city: frequent regular and efficient.

This airport is much too small (extension works on-going). There are only 5 booths open for all Malev Economy flights and the queue is terrible. They urge you to use the self-checking screens but you have to queue anyway to leave your luggage. Attendants do their best. When you are at least out of this queue you are in for a second one for the safety check which is aslo vastly undersized. Not much in term of shops or drinking/eating. The number of seats available at the gates is ridiculous. then you have the luck to board by Bus.

Prompt passport control (non-EU national) but baggage was slow. Travelling out : a 15min BA check-in queue but aggravated by 20 minutes to get through a crowded security area. The extension of T2 now underway is well overdue. In terms of landside access a ticket for the 200E bus can be purchased from the newsagents but to get a 3day or 7day pass you need to get to the underground station at Kobanya-Kispet.

Immigration queue was OK took about 20 mins which meant our luggage was waiting on the carousel. Then it all went haywire. Air France Iberia Lufthansa and Alitalia flights all arrived within an hour of ours so imagine about 1000 people plus suitcases trying to get through customs. 6 lines all formed in a very haphazard way which then moulded into 4 lines for 4 x-ray machines.

International Terminal A and the surrounding roads can't cope at peak times for all these arrivals. Our departure was much smoother I'm pleased to say.

buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2010-08-26,Unlike other reviews I found EZE a fairly unpleasant experience. The boarding gate areas were almost always crammed and stressful places. The terminal seems to have very few good shops and poor information on arriving flights. In fact no information was available for arriving flights on any monitors I could find. I was looking to see how delayed my colleague's flight was on an arrivals monitor but cound not find one anywhere including the American Airlines- One World Admirals Club lounge (although the staff there were very helpful). Another reason for referring to arrivals monitors is to assess how honest the departures monitors are - eg: if the arriving aircraft from a certain airline is running many hours late it would be unlikely if its associated departing flight was on time. I found the general staff overly officious the business lounges incredibly small and crowded (don't use the Iberia One World Lounge - it reminded me of a very small regional airport lounge in Australia) and the restaurant and food outlets extremely limited. In winter poor foggy weather can cause major flight delays so be prepared!,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,B Diener,Canada,2010-08-22,I arrived and departed from EZE. To fully enjoy this airport you really have to like waiting in line. Upon arrival you have to wait in line at immigration which is normal at most international airports. However when you depart you have to wait in line at the check-in as the check-in kiosks aren't common at EZE yet. In addition you have to wait in line for passport control and of course security. The security check is fairly thorough but they only have a few stations which causes huge line ups. I really appreciated the smoking room in the departure level as well as the pretty large duty free shop. When you depart from EZE in the evening you need to leave for the airport on time.

We arrived early for departure having read all of the comments about delays - it took us about 45 mins to check in pay our tax and get through security and immigration.

Check in is OK but from there on it's an absolute shambles. Several flights have passengers in the one queue and you don't have any idea if you are in the correct one. The Airlines P/A is inaudible and there is very little seating in the common boarding area. Once you have worked out that you are in the correct very long queue it's a long wait to get through to the boarding check in and then it's almost a marathon walk to the aircraft. It must be at least 800+ metres and after walking up and down concrete ramps you then end up on an airbridge.

Sometimes (if your 'number comes up') Mexican customs makes a more thorough search of your baggage (including x-raying) but even this wasn't too much of a problem. On departure I’ve found that the airport processes people quickly and that security line-ups are minimal. There is plenty of comfortable seating in the departure area and many options for the shopper or traveller with time on their hands (including one of those typical Mexican pharmacies that sell just about any kind of drug without requiring a prescription). I only have two issues with Cancun: Firstly the number of time share hawkers waiting to pounce on you right after you exit customs some masquerading as representatives of the tour companies. Just ignore them and keep walking. The other issue is temporary – Cancun is building a new runway and the road network is a little messed up while construction is in progress making it slow driving in and out.

You will arrive and discover that there are no taxis (these must be ordered) no trains (although there is a train link some distance away requiring a taxi!) and (most shameful of all) buses that depart once every 45 minutes! The latter are poorly signed and the whole this is a fiasco. I arrived on a flight at Cardiff Airport at 7.30pm and the terminal was closed. We were escorted through an area by airport staff to an exit and dumped outside to fend for ourselves (see above about lack of transportation). It was like flying to Uzbekistan circa 1953!

The building itself is where the positives end. The facility is hopelessly inadequate. There are good dining options upstairs and they can be reached by an escalator at the very far south end of the terminal that is is you can make your way past the thronging check-in queues. Looking for the toilet? Back downstairs you go and through a labyrinthine corridor and you will find them but if they are not closed for cleaning they will be reduced to an unusable state. Once you make it past the interminable queue for the security check be sure to keep an eye on the one central FID. Announcements regarding delays or gate changes (for those flights lucky enough to be parked at a gate) simply do not exist. Seating and toilet facilities airside are extremely limited and you will almost certainly have to take a bus to your aircraft on a stand-off bay.

cebu-airport,/airport-reviews/cebu-airport,Cebu Airport customer review,Edmund Carew,NA,2008-06-16,Cebu is a more convenient and less hassled entry point to the Philippines than Manila. Taxi travel to and from Cebu's CBD is efficient aided by the two bridges in lieu of the former one connecting Mactan and Cebu islands. Provided one arrives on an airline like SilkAir that flies at off-peak times to Cebu immigration queues can be non-existent. However leaving can be a different story with a 20 minute queue to obtain entry to the checkin area and then a 25 minute wait in the mid afternoon through immigration. Cebu's beautiful resorts are popular with Koreans so make sure that the departure time of your flight does not coincide with flights to Seoul or Pusan - you will not be able to get to your gate in five minutes. The restricted entry to checkin is designed to stop hordes of well wishes from clogging checkin but it does add a delay not found in many other non- Filipino airports. There is a limited range of shops once through immigration and they do not stock basics like 'load' for a local cellphone - so come prepared with snacks if need be. It is possible once you have checked in to hand in your boarding pass and re-enter the 'outside world' but you do have to then queue to go through security to the checkin area so some may conclude it is not worth the hassle to bid a final goodbye to family friends or business associates.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Miller,United Kingdom,2015-05-02,I had the misfortune to fly home from Chennai airport just under two weeks ago. It must be the slowest airport in the world. I've been to India six times now so am well acquainted with the slowness of almost everything in the country. However one expects better of an airport especially one that's fairly new and modern-looking and no other Indian airport I've travelled flown home from has been as bad. The first queue was a long one but no longer than many other airport queues I've been in but unlike in most other airports it hardly moved the queue for immigration at Heathrow when I got home was just as long but constantly moving so didn't take too long. The Chennai queue was unbelievably slow. Then came the queues (plural) for security. I understand that they have good reason to take security seriously and I'm glad they do but they kept recalling bags to have another look at them and then someone would search them by hand. One young woman who was just in front of me had her handbag taken from her and put through three times and searched by hand twice - this really can only mean that the staff didn't do it correctly the first time unless it was the result of a malicious desire to make passengers miss their flights. My bag was put through the scanner twice and searched by hand. I saw this happening to other people too.

Couple of coffee shops outside which is welcome if you have friends / relatives seeing you off. Inside there are multiple options now in terms of coffee shops restaurants (couple of them are due to open) book -shops and other small shops. Ample seating space and the quality of announcements is also very clear. The washrooms have received a lot of bad press since the terminal opened but that seems to be improving now. Not everything can be blamed on bad maintenance here some of it is also dependent on user behavior. Also noticed that there was no regular cleaning of the trash bins and most of them were on the verge of over flowing. Something needs to be done about this.

Surprisingly the airport terminals were shut! The cityside has no passenger facilities - no toilets no food outlets no phone booths and no security. For a crowd of 300 about to catch the first few flights there were just 4 security guards. Terminals opened at 3am. This 'new' airport has just two outdated X-ray machines for baggage screening. Horrible queues. Airside area is equally pathetic with horrible loos. No clarity on boarding gates as there were no announcements the screens spent an unusually long time displaying information in Tamil. Additionally the design highlight of the new terminal an in-terminal garden is hardly viewable for dust on the glass curtain walls.

chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,Vijayakumar Arumugam,Australia,2012-06-12,I recently used Chennai airport's international and domestic terminals for transit to Madurai from Sydney as well for the return trip back to Sydney. The international terminal has some improved facilities with the inline baggage scanning system reducing the time to check-in. The immigration customs and baggage arrival are quite smooth though the customs and immigration officials could be groomed a bit to be passenger- friendly. They let domestic passengers enter the terminal even if the flight is 5 hours away which is a positive. However the biggest gripe is about the toilets. The toilets are smelly unkempt and very poor both in the international as well as in the domestic terminal. The domestic terminal doesn't have enough seats which forces passengers to sit on the floor. They still use the buses to get the passengers to the aircraft on the domestic side of the terminal.,NA,NA,NA,3,4,1,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,NA,2008-11-05,Recently went through MAA for an international flight for the first time in a long while. The interior is still rather drab much like the Indian airports of yesteryear but the airport is much less congested than Delhi or Mumbai. Upon entry signage for the baggage screening machines (i.e. which one to use for your airline) is poor so you end up having to guess. Immigration counters were well-staffed and took no time at all and customs no longer goes out of their way to harass you like they used to 10 years ago. Shopping/food is dreadfully limited inside the terminal so if you need something to eat try the small food court outside the departures entry gate (the Anjappar restaurant serves decent local fare) or the restaurant on the second floor between the international and domestic terminals. The best thing about MAA is that unlike BOM or DEL the domestic and international terminals are next door to each other so if you have an inbound/outbound domestic connection it's a short 5 minute walk over - thus saving you from getting harassed for tips by the touts running the terminal shuttles or getting ripped off by the taxi/auto drivers.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Narayan,NA,2008-09-24,"Arrivals has continuously improved in the past 4 years. Passport control quick. Luggage arrival may take a while (30 mins to 1 hour); Customs is quick and easy. Smoking permitted inside terminal - a nuisance. Duty free can be purchased upon arrival not much of a choice though. Basic stuff. Foreign exchange - Thomas Cook office within the secure area available. Free local phone call permitted from assistance booth near baggage collection area. Most staff speak good english and respond well. Long-distance / international calls can be placed from telephone booths (labeled ISD/STD) which are manned and you can get receipts. If you have someone to pick you up at the airport: Clear customs; Exit immediately after customs and wait there. You will turn left to exit the ""secure area"". Do not do this unless you have seen the people waiting to receive you. If you have do not have someone to pick you up: Clear customs; Exit and as you turn left you will see two private travel agencies within the secure area (one is Akbar travels and the other is Airport Express). Both of them are prepaid safe reliable. Akbar costs 350 rupees (less than 10 USD) (as of Aug 2008) to a ride anywhere in to Chennai city. Tip the person who rolls your luggage (about 20 to 30 rupees); and tip the driver about the same. Walk very closely to the person who takes your luggage to your car since you might get lost in the crowd outside. MAA International Departures: Arrive at least 3 to 4 hours prior to departure time. Must have a ticket / itinerary printed and in your hand with passport to get in to the airport. No other options allowed. Check-in queues are very long and slow. Elite status helps (depending on airline). No food for purchase prior to check-in. Passport control is usually quick (max 30 minutes with a 100 people in line). Duty free available. Overpriced food available prior to and after security check (for your handbags etc). The food is actually good in the mornings (between 6 to 9:30 AM) and after that its not that great. Make sure you have a luggage tag for your hand baggage - this is true for all Indian airports. They will make you leave the line and go and get one. Also make sure you have exactly one piece of hand baggage...no matter what it is.(so fit everything in to one bag). Did not use any lounges. MAA Local airport: NEed ticket with ID to enter airport. Some food available prior to check-in. All luggage is screened with X-ray machines similar to international airport. These queues are long. Otherwise its generally quick to get through to check luggage and clear security. Individual airlines may be slow depending on quality of service. After security check there is extremely overpriced stuff to eat. A coffee dispensing machine. Its pretty boring otherwise. Nothing to do except people-watch. Most airlines need you to take a bus to the plane. Watch for the gates being called out.

There are now two separate check- in areas for all domestic carriers as opposed to only one previously (which was always overcrowded). So checking-in (and particularly baggage screening) is less stressful. Also: new are separate airline lounges but I am not sure whether they are a real improvement. For one the combined Paramount/Sahara lounge does not serve any beer whereas the airport restaurant does. Second all the new lounges lack windows - the airport restaurant offers a spectacular view across the tarmac and runways. Security uncrowded despite my flight departing at 18.50. I checked the prices at the refreshment stand in the departure lounge and the prices are effectively daylight robbery (Rs 60 for a can of Coke). Still a lack of airbridges and most domestic pax have to be taken by bus.

It is reasonably spacious given the passenger numbers and never as chaotic as for instance Delhi. The airline lounges are definitely better in Madras than elsewhere in India.

Wow what a change from old Midway. Chicago Midway new terminal does not even resemble the old crowded Midway airport. A lot of room around the check-in counters and in the departure hall. A large corridor that connects the departure hall with the gates area. This corridor serves as a security check-point waiting line. Very large and roomy and can accomodate easily everyone. Departed during the peak hours of 7-9 am. Large food court and decent shoping option. The new gates area is roomy with plenty of seating space. If you are unlucky to use the old gates though (Southwest still uses some of the old gates) the same old very dense area with very tired look and feel. But these are phased out gradually. When returned docked at a remote gate and had to walk quite a bit to connect to the new terminal arrival hall. Once in the arrival hall luggage carousels are quite big and not too crowded. There are security personnel that make sure before you leave that you picked the baggage that belongs to you and not someone's else. Good connection to the loop via train only $1.50.

Terminal two lacks in outlets and other similar amenities but I only stayed there for a short while so no need. On the return I flew United from Pisa to Chicago via Munich. The international terminal five is horrible. We arrived at peak hour and it was hopeless. There were dozens of flights from Europe and Asia that all seemed to arrive at the same time. This caused lines that stretched almost down the entire hallway just to go through passport control. After that the baggage hall was chaotic. With mountains of luggage being taken off early from the conveyor belt just to make room for more flights. The entire terminal unnavigable with the amount of craziness that was going on. There was a line that stretched through the baggage hall and all around it just to get land side. The line took an hour an if someone had any connections they wouldn't be able to catch them.

However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare.

Once through any domestic security checkpoint you can access all domestic terminals (1-3). There is a wide variety of places to eat and drink or grab something quick at a broad range of prices. While not a shopping mall like many newer airports there are plenty of places to shop and browse. The Blue line train is an inexpensive and reliable way to get to or from downtown Chicago or its neighborhoods. I use O'Hare regularly and find it as tolerable as any airport - none of which I would describe as pleasant places to spend time. The main complaint I hear is from non-US citizens arriving at the International Terminal (Terminal 5) waiting in very long lines.

On both occasions we were met by huge queues for passport check both times taking 2-3 hours to get through. As we made our way towards immigration we were ordered by a young lady to 'stand against the wall' get against the wall'. We queued there for about 45 minutes before getting to a hall best described as a cattle market crammed with hundreds of visitors. People were taking photos of the unbelievable crowd. Only about 1/3 of passport desks were manned. It took 2 hours to get through the queue plus the 45 minutes in the corridor. Many people were missing connecting flights. When they asked staff what they should do they were rudely told 'stand in line there's nothing you can do you just have to catch the next one'. I guess for some that meant spending the night in the terminal. One parent tried to offer food to their bored child only to be ordered to 'put that food away- no food' because they were using sniffer dogs. There was not a hint of courtesy politeness or helpfulness in any of the staff. US citizens seemed to be getting through in about 15 minutes. This was obviously not an isolated incident since it was the same on both occasions we passed through. This is the worst airport I have ever passed through.

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,H Lee,United States,2012-12-19,Flown into Terminal 3 and then waited for others at Terminal 1/2. Although it is not a fault of anyone this airport is just unreliable especially in the winter anyone can lose connections due to delays that can be triggered not just by snowfalls but also by mere rains coupled with low visibility. I was affected by exactly that and ended up arriving at O'Hare an hour late. Airport's location itself is already a reason to avoid this airport especially for connections. The airport offers a cheap rail link into the downtown in addition to the expressway option and considering the frequent congestion's on the expressways around Chicago sometimes the metro option is a must for travelers. Except for T5 - the international terminal - the other terminals are also nicely grouped together in the central terminal area so walking over to a different terminal is not that difficult at all there is a free and efficient Airport Transit System that links all terminals and the remote parking lots. The terminal facilities however can have some upgrades to be more appealing. Airside had seating available for passengers around each gate but landside had a very limited number of benches. The wifi was not free and even when I wanted to pay for it the signal was not even strong. The power ports were virtually non-existent. Flight information displays were lacking both in terms of its quality and its size. Information was incorrect for some delayed flights. Some flight information was not even clear as to which terminal they were expected to depart/arrive many first-timers would be in trouble finding their ways to the correct terminal/gates. Other aspects of evaluation seem to be on par with or slightly worse than most other major airports in my opinion. In short I would discourage others from flying in and out of ORD unless it is unavoidable (e.g. Chicago is their final destination).

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,A Johnson,NA,2008-08-10,Despite being one of the world's busiest airports and a hub for two major airlines O'Hare seems ill-equipped to process an influx of passengers at peak times. During the mid-afternoon international arrivals window the customs area was mobbed. Lines for US citizens moved swiftly but the processing of foreigners was glacial thanks to the multiple fingerprint scans and photographs that need to be taken. Baggage belts were also swamped with people to the point where it was difficult to elbow in and grab your own bag. Recheck was a mob scene with people becoming so frustrated at the slow service that they left their bags in a pile for the airline staff to figure out. In order to transfer to a domestic flight you need to take the airport transit system which ran so infrequently that it became dangerously overcrowded. At the terminal all passengers must squeeze onto a narrow escalator which effectively required everybody (and their rollaboard) to form a single-file line. Domestic departures proceeded more smoothly with only a minimal wait at security and an adequate number of shops and restaurants airside.

I've also never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes at immigration though granted the flight I use from DEL comes in very early in the morning when there aren't any other flights around. The main complaint I have about ORD is the utter lack of information concerning delays at least for AA flights.

No fast track for F/J class passengers no help whatsoever with flight connections. You just wait in the queue at immigration and take your chances.

I can handle the idea of needing extra security but if you US immigration can't find a way within this to accommodate the realities of an international hub then come clean and tell people not to try connecting at this or other US airports operating on this basis- which is many of them I believe. To their credit the airport and airline staff are pretty good at managing the situation and getting you on a later flight because they are well used to this farce and ashamed of it too. I know LHR immigration is bad but at least there's an effort to get people to their connection. If this is truly where US government/immigration has arrived at post 9/11 I'm afraid you've conceded a clear victory to the terrorists on this one.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

chongqing-jiangbei-airport,/airport-reviews/chongqing-jiangbei-airport,Chongqing Jiangbei Airport customer review,G A Bray,Australia,2012-12-23,Flew domestically into Chongqing on Sichuan Airlines and for some reason our aerobridge was at the small International Terminal 1. Requiring us to walk 100m around the edge of the terminal concourse and walk down stairs to a shuttle bus to carry Terminal 2 which being winter was bitterly cold especially with the doors opened while the bus waited for a full load. Once inside the proper domestic terminal it was pretty straight forward and standard routine. Once excellent feature was a lady handing out bi-lingual cards listing taxi fare prices to over a dozen destinations around the city to discourage touting and rip offs. For the return I found out the single domestic Terminal 2 is actually split into 3 separate halls A B and C. If you flight is leaving through hall C you can not enter via A or B security points. This also means you are technically shut off from the shops and facilities in the other sections too such as the McDonalds in hall A. However you are able to walk downstairs to the Arrivals level and use the transfer signage to direct you to the other areas making the segregation of the terminal areas pointless. Lastly with the security it was the only place I was asked to take my boots off beyond the X-Ray machine which all passengers were made to do. However with only one seat it meant a longer wait as you could not progress until the person in front had taken off their boots was examined and then re-laced them.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Clark has the makings of a good airport but attention to detail is sorely lacking. First of all there's free wifi - but only outside the airport (and maybe in Arrivals) airside you'll have to pay 800 pesos to use the VIP lounge. Airport tax as of 1 Feb is up to 600 pesos so don't spend all your local money! Then there's the bins - what bins? If you want a bin landside you'd better head to the restrooms. And while you're there bring your own toilet paper. There's no spray either. Airside (after you've paid your 600 pesos) there is toilet paper and some bins although they are few and far between. If you're downstairs where the ""cheap"" airlines leave from don't expect aircon or PA announcements. Upstairs there is aircon and PA but good luck hearing sufficiently to understand anything that's said in most announcements (Qatar Airways was the exception). So-called duty free stores are quite egregious here I saw packs of 6 beers with a normal retail value of 180-200 pesos priced at 500. News stand? Actually there was a small kiosk that at least sold a few magazines. Free drinking water? In your dreams. As for vegetarian food options - just head towards the exit keep going turn right and wait for the next jeepney back to town. Are there any good points?

I was expecting better given that it's a privately run airport. The facilities on offer are almost non existent - just a couple of shops before the check-in area but nothing beyond check-in except for a Cafe Coffee Day. The airport also seems rather small given the high amount of tourist traffic to Kerala these days; only one line for security and only two gates. We got to the airport quite early and thus had no problems with lines but the departure area became badly overcrowded by early evening. Toilets were disgusting. On the plus side the building exterior's colonial architecture is nice free wireless internet is provided the chairs in the departure lounge are comfortable and the small size means just a short walk from the terminal to your plane as opposed to an uncomfortable bus ride - and if you have a domestic/international connection the terminals are walking distance to each other.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

However they do serve Red Bull - go figure. They charge Rs 240 (around US$ 6) for a cheese sandwich - outrageous in a country such as India. Duty Free Shop prices are in US$ but no flights depart from here to US. If you elect to pay in a currency of any destination country (e.g. UAE Dirhams) they will overcharge you on the exchange rate and then again by not having small change. Total premium: 15%.

Terminal 1 has an open airy feel to it and it manages to have a good range of shops and eating places without giving the impression that retail is more important than aviation. Surface transport links are excellent although signage can be a little hit or miss - my first attempt to find the bus to Bonn ended in the car rental area. Most recently inbound from EDI border control was painless with a welcoming smile from the officer at the counter. Baggage wasn't the quickest but it was still acceptable and I was on my way within 30 mins of landing. Outbound to MUC a few days later check in with 4U was a breeze I had time for a bite to eat and a visit to the Besucherterasse. However things were spoiled when I went through security. It wasn't busy so there were no significant delays but the staff who dealt with me were brusque to the point of unpleasantness.

There are very few eating joints and couldn't find a single international chain (KFC/McDonald/Burger King). There were only a few SriLankan restaurants serving SriLankan local food.

The facility has gone through a major renovation some time ago and it is still well maintained. Most parts including the restrooms are very clean. The main terminal is not so big but not too small to be overcrowded either. The parking garage is attached to the main terminal so travelers can avoid being exposed to the wind/rain/sunlight to reach their cars. A McDonald's is located within the airport complex. The landside and the 3 concourses are also fairly well laid out and dotted with decent number of eateries. In most cases the check-in and security check procedures altogether took only about 10 minutes for me and as the terminal is not too big even walking to the farthest gate takes only about 5 minutes. Of course TSA agents sometimes can be less than courteous. Baggage handling was fairly quick I did not really have to wait for more than 5 minutes until my bags were placed on the carousel for pickup. This airport offers free wi-fi and plenty of power outlets in between seats including USB power ports. My only concern about this facility is the lack of public transportation options. This airport is connected to the city by only two bus lines (52 and 92). Of course as this airport is only about 15 minutes' drive from downtown even a taxi ride costs only about $25 which implies a low demand of public transportation options in this region.

These automated gates allow entry on reading your boarding card much the same as the London Underground ticket gates.

The airport is fantastic as one almost always get direct gate access to flights and do not have to walk far anywhere – i.e. bus transport to a/c are not frequent. Secondly after check-in one gets easily to the 1st floor and from there no more ups and downs as all the rest happens in the same level.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Ticket kiosks easy to use but check that you use the correct machine - DSB kiosks sell tickets for all Danish destinations grey SJ machines are mostly for long-distance cities in Sweden red or violet Skanetrafiken machines sell tickets for Southern Sweden. Transfer to the Swedish city of Malmo is convenient - modern regional trains shuttle over the Oresund bridge every 20 mins. Travel time is around 25 mins and costs 105SEK one-way. Departing CPH is a mixed experience. Self-service machines did not work properly so had to lose half an hour as only two check-in desks were open. Flying back on Saturday evening meant no waiting at security. However staff there very unfriendly not to say downright rude - no words spoken only some vague gestures. Airside the terminal resembles a large shopping mall. Catering facilities overpriced but of good quality - spent around 150DKK for an orange juice and three fresh open-faced sandwiches.

And when departing check in (Jet2.com desks) was relatively quick and painless. Unfortunately for others they had, once again, to queue outside for ages in strong hot sunshine before even getting to the check in desks.

I hadn't used Corfu Airport since my last visit some 35 years ago but things do not appear to have improved! Typical Greek Airport - lots of flights on the same day (and probably all crammed into the same hour). There are now two luggage belts but the TV screens telling you which belt is for your flight are almost unreadable as you have to look directly into the sun to see them. Chaos reigns when you come to depart - queuing outside in the sun for an hour or so absolutely rammed through security into the departure lounge as all the flights now depart at or about the same time! This was an early June Monday morning - nowhere near the peak season - and the airport isn't really fit for purpose. Facilities once through security are minimal and there are just not enough seating areas. I suppose one of the charms of the Greek Islands is the laid back thing - but with their airports much patience is required just think of a cold beer and a nice Greek salad.,NA,NA,NA,2,0,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Travelling with hand luggage only made things even easier. Passport control in either direction was very casual to say the least but security on departure seemed reasonably thorough without causing any serious holdups. We only bought a bottle of water airside as we know buying anything at Corfu airport can be expensive. Only one agent to handle boarding for our flight but she got us through the gate swiftly and efficiently.

corfu-airport,/airport-reviews/corfu-airport,Corfu Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2009-09-28,"Plenty of time to study Corfu Airport as we had a 6 hour delay for the return flight courtesy of easyJet. In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples? Overall a mixture of pluses and minuses but I would give it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the surprisingly positive impression we gained of the security staff.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Departing follow Phil's suggestion we got to the airport about 30 minutes before check in was scheduled to open were marshalled by a very helpful Monarch rep and checked in a few minutes.

dallas-fort-worth-airport,/airport-reviews/dallas-fort-worth-airport,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,P Jenkins,Australia,2013-05-10,Flew into DFW from Sydney last month on a Qantas 747 with the intentions of comparing it to the other common gateway for similar travels Los Angeles International which I had used on the previous 4 trips across the Pacific. The perceived advantage that Dallas has over LAX is that it places travellers like me geographically closer to my final destination of New York City. After weighing all of the positives and negatives this is the only real edge that I experienced. Immigration took longer at Dallas than any of my prior trips through LAX. DFW had plenty of immigration lanes but unfortunately a very large percentage were closed. My craft certainly was not the only international jumbo on the ground at the time either. People sometimes complain about the supposed hassles of connecting at LAX but again the process took longer at DFW than it ever had at LAX for me. Yes you have to exit and then re-enter the terminal after the international flight here just as you do in Los Angeles. Maybe Dallas' airport light rail is more comfortable and easier with luggage than the internal bus system that Los Angeles has but not really enough to sway me. The real disadvantage for now is the fact that DFW does not have the physical infrastructure to handle the large A380 Airbus which is a leap above the Boeing 747 in many aspects. Until that changes it is really back to LAX for my travels.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
dallas-fort-worth-airport,/airport-reviews/dallas-fort-worth-airport,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,E Mabley,United States,2011-10-20,The terminal design is such that you can pass from gate to kerb in under 5 minutes upon arrival and security queues tend to be short and manageable upon departure. American dominates the airport and takes up 4 terminals - if you're making a connection between A/C and B/D (on opposite sides of the central highway) it can take a while because the SkyTrain is slow and makes many stops. Terminal D was recently renovated and is quite smart but A B and C are older and could use a refurb. Dining options are outstanding in D but mediocre in A B and C. For whatever reason the airport operators crank up the aircon at all hours and the terminals feel unnecessarily cold.

dallas-fort-worth-airport,/airport-reviews/dallas-fort-worth-airport,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,A Chang,Taiwan,2011-09-20,While it cannot compare to most foreign hubs DFW is a functional airport by American standards. Amenities are on par with other large US hubs but security checks rarely take more than 15 mins of queuing. Customs/Immigration is probably the fastest I have experienced in the US and although int'l transfer passengers must exit the secure area and undergo an additional security check this is not really different from any other US airport. Gate-to-gate transfers can be quite a trek given the size of the airport but are quite simple if your gate is closer to a Skytrain entrance. The biggest gripe is the fact that the baggage system is slow and outdated.

The decor was a bit bland but that's not the purpose of the facility. The real kicker was in the security clearance for the domestic leg. There was a mother with two small children--an infant in meltdown mode and a two year old who was doing his best after flying overnight. The gatekeeper was a sour looking woman who seemed most delighted by having the authority to say ""no"". The mom in all the confusion had not removed her shoes and was sent back to rectify this open challenge to the rules. She went through with the baby and Little Miss Sunshine noted that the boy had both shoes and a sweater on! Her response was two-fold first she prohibited mom from going back to help and responded to the child by telling him that mommy was going to leave him unless he played by the rules. There was not a person in line who was not ready to tackle her and beat her senseless but that is not the best approach these days. Finally a decidely non Latino TSA male came over squatted down and spoke at length to the child in Spanish. Big credits for his help. But overall it was ""security"" at its most absurd.

However, I was so pleasantly surprised when departing from T3 (domestic) - particularly with the seamless connection on the Metro. The building itself is quite modern and new, the selection of eateries and shops (both before and after security) is good and there are lots of bathroom facilities near the gates. Our flight was at 2am so the airport was fairly quiet and there were no long queues anywhere, the only issue was that a number of cafes were closed for the night.

Then arrived and transited to flight back to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. When we landed it took a while with the bus to get to terminal. It was early morning in winter so wasn't too hot fortunately. A few flights seemed to have arrived at same time so there was a long queue at immigration. But there were plenty of staff working and they were very polite. Domestic terminal for flight to Goa was a little chaotic. But terminal is bright and clean. Security is heavy but understandable. Good range of cafes in domestic terminal. On return transited from domestic to international terminals. Quite a long distance. Had to wait a long time for bus and it was very cold outside. International terminal was very pleasant experience. We arrived there at 11pm and our flight wasn't until 4am. But we were able to check in early and go through security. Duty free shops had a great selection and very cheap.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Rohit Raj,India,2014-11-11,I have started most of my international journeys through this airport. After having visited several international hubs (LHR CDG DXB AUH SIN HKG BKK KUL CMB) I have to rate Terminal 3 of Delhi Airport one of the best among them. This is a busy airport in terms of flight and passenger volume. Despite this I have never seen this airport very crowded be it check-in counters immigration desk security channel or boarding gates. This is due to the fact that the terminal is very spacious. It has a large number of check-in counters immigration desks and boarding gates. The airport is ultra-modern and very clean. The interiors are great and no less than the interiors of Terminal 3 LHR Terminal 2 SIN or DXB. They have sufficient number of restaurants duty free shops. You are never short of seats once you clear immigration. I hate its traffic which makes the flights wait for longer during take off and keep hovering in air for some time during landing. I think they need to make additional runways functional. Another bad thing about this airport is for transit passengers. If you are transiting through this airport to another destination you may not get proper guidance from staff for new boarding gates. This is mostly to Air India passengers as this airport is the transit hub for Air India. This is the problem of Airline and not the Airport Authority.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I have read reviews here where people have criticized this airport for being too strict but this is for good measure and I think it cannot be ridiculed for it. I have experienced worse (stricter and longer) queues in Heathrow than the T3.

This is stupid and takes a long time - why do they not have airside connections to Domestic we wonder? Hence the three hours connection time we had was only just enough.

Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge).

Also as it is not allowed to take Rupees out of the country it would help if Thomas Cook staff would change ones money for you. They seemed most reluctant to change money into sterling trying instead to give Euros or Dollars. Eventually we managed to get Scottish notes as long as we had a minimum of £40 so we had to club together with another traveller.

It is well laid out and very spacious. I'm not sure about the brownish carpet throughout though! With a few improvements mainly in attitudes it might one day achieve the status of some of the better airports like Singapore although I'm not holding my breath. First of all immigration and security staff need to learn manners. Security staff in particular are incompetent and surly. Secondly toilet attendants need to attend to their cleaning duties instead of hovering about trying to extract tips. Thirdly WiFi needs to be free. There is supposed to be free WiFi for 30 minutes. However the PIN code was not fully sent to my mobile phone and as a result I was not able to log on either at the time of my first visit or upon my return visit a fortnight later. Finally FX facilities need to be provided in the departure area after immigration so people have the possibility of converting unused Rupees into an alternative currency since it is not possible to exchange those in one's home country and it would appear taking Rupees out of India is actually illegal!,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Very important even if you are checked in online you need to get in a line for your boarding pass because your airline is not allowed to let you print out your document. I was told the check-in closes 2 hours before departure I don't know I arrived 25 hours before. When your hand luggage has been screened you get a stamp on your luggage/hand luggage/airline sticker with the date. This stamp will checked before you get on the plane. If you do not have this you are in trouble. So after security you should check your sticker/leaf for the stamp. And you need to get in the line many times. Without air ticket you are not allowed to enter the terminal. For the whole building there are 4 old blind men to check this documents. Imagine how fast this is. Then check is line immigration line security line enter the waiting room designated for your flight than one more old soldier who checks the stamps. I was lucky I did not find any crowd at any time. Every line took me about 3-4 minutes there were only a few international flight out that time (8 am). The terminal is huge to get to your flight you need to walk 2 miles.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Tapani Utunen,Finland,2013-03-18,Have travelled a few times through T3 and every time the experience has been quite good and hassle-free. This time arrived at 5.30 am from Helsinki and connected to an Air India domestic at 9 am. Bags were out quickly and immigration was a breeze then quickly upstairs to Air India departures with a security check on the way upstairs - we were at the Air India counter by 6.30 am and had plenty of time until AI departure that was on time. The same story on the way back to Helsinki: easy and hassle-free. Maybe this is due to the fact that Finnair lands in Delhi in the morning instead of midnight and takes off at 10.45 am when there is not that much international traffic at T3. Moreover there are some pleasant eateries and cafes there plus great views to the runways to do some plane spotting. Cannot understand some very negative feedback from fellow travellers about Delhi Int'l Airport. Sure Delhi cannot compete with Hong Kong Singapore Changi KLIA or Bangkok Suvarnabhumi but it's still modern bright rather functional and clean.

There were plenty of free baggage carts available and clean free toilets although in both cases it did not stop an airport employee trying to get a tip because we wanted to use the free service. Our bags were on the belt when we got through immigration and leaving the airport was easy. We then flew internal from T3 and it was surprisingly easy and orderly. Very short queues pleasant staff and seats in the waiting area for our delayed flight. The drive from central Delhi to the airport took about 30 minutes but the roads were relatively jam free for Delhi on a mid Monday morning. Arriving back a few days later at the Domestic Terminal we were quickly bussed to the terminal our luggage arrived within minutes (it was a full jet so we were prepared for a long wait) and we were quickly out of the terminal past the numerous food stalls outside. Departing from T3 a couple of days later to London was a struggle. Check-in was fast but the queue for immigration took 30 minutes and that for security took nearly an hour – the problem being not enough staff on duty for all of the scanners (and this was at a peak departure time).

You then take the chit and walk to an unmarked bus stop (beside a bridge in the open air) where a shuttle bus takes you to the international terminal. The shuttle bus has its quota of scam artists who try to ""help"" you with your luggage and then demand a tip. On arrival at the international terminal you have to show your ticket to the Indian army personnel just to get inside (we had to try to get in three times as the soldiers at the first two gates had apparently never seen BA tickets before).

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2010-10-22,Used the new T3 international terminal during a recent trip. You no longer have to deal with the masses outside the entrance doors much more space to move around the check-in area and the security check has been moved to immediately after immigration meaning you no longer have to worry about missing your flight due to security if you go to the lounge. The main terminal area is much nicer than the old one though as another poster has noted the shops are overpriced lounges are nicer as are gate waiting areas. Queue control also seems to be better though I was leaving on a Saturday night when traffic seemed pretty light. Alas there are still some teething problems. My main complaint was the shuttle service from the domestic terminal (1D) to the international terminal. The bus itself is fine but you're dropped off at the very bottom level where there are no luggage carts to be found. This forces you to lug your heavy bags up a seemingly endless series of travelators to the 3rd level - no easy feat when you're tired. There is still insufficient place to sit if you arrive too early to check in for your flight. And although Wi-Fi is free you must have a working mobile phone to obtain a password by SMS - a big problem if you're a visitor without an international-enabled phone. They don't even offer a pay option anymore. And finally I don't care for the gate setup - similar to Bangkok or Singapore where you have a second (useless) security check then a waiting area to sit until your flight is ready to board but the waiting area itself doesn't open until about an hour before boarding. If you're too early there's really no place to sit in the main terminal unless you have lounge access or patronize one of the overpriced restaurants.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

They have at least 8 entrances to the terminal but only 2 were open to passengers after checking of tickets and passport. Why not open a few more to ease the flow of passengers getting in!! Once inside another long queue at the check-in counter of Jet Airways who seemed to be checking in all domestic and international passengers at same counters. Security check didn't take very long and I was just in time at the gate to board my flight. The washroom near the gate had no lights. Apparently was still in a state of construction.

For the millions and millions of dollars the Government makes through the arrival tax (USD $35) and departure tax ($200K Rupiah) surely they can get their systems right. Firstly the queue's on arrival to get your passport stamped and to pay the arrival tax were staggering. They did have almost all the booths open yet it took at least 35 minutes to get through. Then the fun starts - the monitors showed the planes that had arrived but did not show the carousel numbers where to collect your baggage. There were 4 carousels with hundreds of bags on them and people (including us) were going from carousel to carousel trying to locate their own baggage. Don't bother to ask a Airport employee as they have no idea or just don't answer your question. After 45 minutes (yes 45 minutes) we found our bags. Very frustrating. Yet more frustration on our flight home - we checked in and went through the various 4 or 5 steps even before you get through: check in - go to another counter to pay your departure tax - go to another counter to have the departure tax receipted - go to the next counter to have your passport stamped and then at least your through. But wait there's more - our flight we were advised would leave from gate 11 and we proceeded to gate 11 (which is downstairs). When we got to the stairs to go down 2 guards at tables were checking bags etc. for water bottles. When he asked what flight and where we were going we weren't allowed through as ""you have to wait for the current flight to leave before you can go to the gate"". I'm not sure why but there was no way we were getting through. Once they packed up and left (20 minutes) we then went downstairs to the gate and waited for our flight. But it doesn't end there! There was a monitor above the departure gate but no details - then 30 minutes before our flight was due to leave 2 employees rolled up and placed the various flags and placards of their airline next to the gate - and these were of a different airline to ours. Upon enquiry as to our flight they had no idea (which was understandable as they are a different airline). Result - upstairs again and in a hurry to find which gate we were supposed to be at.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,L Carter,Australia,2014-09-06,After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took Due for a 2.45 arrival on a Thursday landing delayed as we had to sit in a holding pattern for over 30 mins. 1.5hr wait to get through immigration word is that you can't purchase the VIP pass anymore to get through quicker but you can go up to someone and pay then and there if they are in a good mood. I was already 4 lines into my wait when I found this out so didn't want to risk it. Flying business or having premium FF gets you nothing on arrival at this airport every foreigner queues together. On top of all of that took an hour to get to Seminyak. Departure was a completely different story. 20 min drive from same Seminyak location at 6pm on a Monday. Waited 5 mins at priority check in (here I was provided an entry card to the temporary lounge) around the same to pay the departure tax (yes it's annoying but most if not all other imports have this it's just built into the taxes when you book your flights!) then maybe 15 mins at immigration? In there there's also 2 security check points that had less than a 3 min wait. Decent sized duty free but pricey from what I saw (alcohol in Australian airports is cheaper). The temp lounge was packed could probably fit 100 or so people seated. Food selection consisted of sandwiches vegetables soups fried rice salads and some fruit. Refreshments include sodas water beer and wine as well as hot drinks. Severe lack of power points which seems to be a growing trend these days. I walked past 3 food outlets to get to the lounge but can't comment on the quality or selection. If is written this review based purely on arrival you'd see 1 star but I'll bump it up a bit because of my departure experience.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

What a disgrace: arrived 3pm on a Tuesday in July queued 2-3 hours for visa fee booth and passport control was exhausted after this not-so-happy start for a holiday.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-03-10,My review will be less inflammatory than others because I have the good fortune to only ever use Bali airport at off-peak times. So I'll acknowledge that it's a massive improvement over the old terminal. There's more space and it's much more comfortable and attractive. There were still hints that despite spending a lot of money on a new terminal they still didn't cater to the existing demand (immigration took 20 minutes and there was a relative lack of seating airside otherwise things moved quickly). There are definitely still problems - hopefully some are temporary - that people should be aware of. Most flights are using buses at the moment and the terminal entrance where they drop you has 2 big steps and no wheelchair ramp - I saw 3 staff struggling to get a disabled guy up them. We didn't get arrival cards on the plane and there is very little in the immigration hall to tell you that you need one or where to get one (there were piles on some - but not all - of the VOA counters) plus there was one single desk in the entire cavernous hall where you could fill them out. Signage is not finished (or it's intended to be terrible) and it can be hard to see how to get from arrivals to departures (with a new terminal they really should have catered for airside connections) or where the taxi booth is. There are rigorous security checks before AND after check-in - the first one seems like an afterthought since there isn't enough room to do it smoothly. There are no ATMs in departures so if you forgot the R150000 departure tax (I had miscounted and I ended up R500 short!) it's back down to arrivals and then through security again. And what is the stupid serpentine gauntlet of shops that you have to run to get to the gates? I wonder where this horrible trend started - I know Sydney's done it for decades (but mainly in arrivals). All up a massive improvement over the old terminal in off-peak times.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Arrival at about 5pm wasn't too bad VoA payment was quick Immigration not as quick but there was a fair queuing system in place and it only took 20 minutes to clear. My departing flight was at 1am so I made sure to reach the airport by 10pm. Check-in departure tax and Immigration were all quick - I sympathise with the reviewer that clocked check-in at 20 mins per person but maybe some airlines are better than others. The compulsory walk through the shopping area seems to have got longer funny although signs in the airport say it is ""smoking and tobacco free"" I distinctly remember seeing a tobacco section in the duty free shop. After the shopping area things start to show signs of stress; too few toilets with queues spilling out VIP lounges just fenced-off departure lounges; not enough seating people all over the floor. There are a few food stalls which look pretty temporary but prices are close to western airport prices. Surprisingly there is free drinking water to be had but only a couple of dispensers and supplies were running low. No information counters and no PA speakers in the toilet.

I was arriving on Malaysia Airlines from KL and our flight was delayed for 1 hour. Maybe that was the reason that there was nobody queuing at immigration and we were outside within 20 minutes after arriving. Immigration and customs took no more than 5 minutes as my passport allows for a visa free entrance to Indonesia. Once you leave customs there is a long row of money changers but don't be a fool and change money there. The rates in town are much better. Our arrival was very efficient and I could not fault it except the long walk from our gate to immigration which took about 5-10 minutes as gate 2 is at the far end. Departure was not as good as you already have to pass through security just to enter the building. Check-in was ok and took a while even though we were already checked in online. Paying the exit tax was pretty straight forward and involved no queuing. Once pass immigration there are a few shops but the prices are not competitive if you compare it to other Asian airports in the region. The airport is old but I have seen worse. You pass through security again at your gate and once inside there is nothing much so do not bother going to early. Boarding was civilized but the infrastructure is really outdated. The gate agents set up a microphone and stereo set to announce the boarding calls as the gate did not have a speaker system.

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,M McManus,United Kingdom,2011-04-27,Arrived from Dulles. Has three terminals (A B C) and they are connected by a train which is very quick. You could probably get from A to C in 5 minutes on this train although I don't know how often they arrive. TSA security line was very long and slow moving although you can sign up to an express security scheme there for an annual fee so this may be worthwhile for people who frequently go through DEN. After arriving you need to take the train to baggage claim which can be a tedious journey to go to the other side of the airport just to collect your bags. Sign posting for this is not immediately apparent to someone new to the airport. Ground transportation to downtown is plentiful but taxis are expensive ($65). Best to get the $20 airport shuttle bus which your hotel can arrange and which you can pay in cash. ATMs everywhere but they appear not to take Maestro cards so be warned. Distance from downtown is quite far and a car or taxi takes just under 40 minutes early in the morning and possibly longer later in day with traffic.

Note: Bags can arrive on a belt adjacent to the one they mentioned on the board. Also the new conveyor belts are a little narrow meaning your suitcases have a hard time staying on them. Look around a bit if you cannot find your bags. If you are arriving from Europe or North America you may be asked to jump the queue and exit the terminal ahead of those arriving from the Middle East who are subject to rigorous customs checking.

It's very over rated and as a seasoned traveler I was very disappointed with the lack of 24 hour service I have had in Asian airports. The lounge already feels very worn and tattered and they only served tea and coffee and soggy sandwiches. If they are trying to compete with Dubai they have no chance in winning. Even compared to old European lounges it didn't strike me as anything too exciting. We even took the shuttle bus to the main airport and the lounge there was tiny and packed so we came back to the Qatar business lounge.,NA,NA,NA,4,0,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2013-10-30,As I had only 1 hour 20 minutes between landing from Manchester and catching the next flight to Bangkok I'd booked the Al Maha fast track service which I can really recommend I was rushed through the usual crowds and chaos of Doha and escorted direct to the departure gate so I can't really comment about delays etc although the terminal seemed to be a crowded as usual. On my return flight I'd used Q-miles to upgrade to business from Doha to Manchester as I was in transit for 8 hours the premier terminal is the place to be if you have 8 hours with nothing to be expect sit and wait for the next flight a fine choice of foods and top class staff there seem to be more of them since my last visit I just hope the HAMAD finally opens they'll have done something about the crowds and queues.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Federico Muscogiuri,Spain,2013-10-15,To the previous reviewer: are you sure you are talking about Doha airport? The airport of 2-3 wide-body jets arriving at the same time at 1 am and turning the security area into mayhem. Small and cramped departure areas where people are herded one hour before the boarding and are forced to sit on the floor due to lack of seating? Dingy and smelly toilets. Long bus rides around the runway where often the driver is himself unsure at which aircraft he has to stop. Surly and brusque customer service? Bad ventilation and simply not enough space to contain QR expansion. My last experience was all of the above and worse. Much as I like flying QR I hate this airport and will avoid it until the new terminal opens.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,James Laskowski,Thailand,2013-09-25,"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have been in. Mainly due to the archaic use of busses that take over 20 minutes to get to and from the aircraft to the terminal. And then when checking in with the extremely polite staff everyone must hurdle into a 2nd waiting room to wait for the bus. The lack of services at the airport are very poor. 2 or 3 restrooms tops that have a line out the door for men are packed and in locations not convenient to all passenger waiting areas. Since the current airport is so small the food and shopping options are extremely limited and the shopping is limited to duty free items (and over-priced electronics). The 1 great thing about this airport is the ""Quiet Area"" where it is dark reclining seats and very quiet if you have a long layover. Made for nice place to nap.",NA,NA,NA,4,1,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

By the time we disembarked from our first flight our next flight was already boarding but the flight attendants assured us it would be fine. The longest part was the bus ride as we flew J class to Doha and then were flying Economy to Amman so the bus first dropped the continuing J class passengers at the Premium Terminal before going to Arrivals and finally to the Transfer terminal.

Airport is of ok quality quite compact lots of seating but generally had over crowded feel which let down the experience. Lack of food outlets and ones available seemed full / lots of rubbish about. Main ground floor is mostly filled by large duty free shop. Problem with airport is buses from planes to/from terminal does give it the feel and look of a fancy bus station. Going to far side of runway from / to terminal takes ages (15 mins) on the bus and can stand on the bus waiting another 15 mins waiting for buses in front to let people board the plane before allowed off.

doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Andrew Maile,Indonesia,2012-09-06,Travelled through this airport twice last month and overall impression was that it is below average. The biggest problem is that there are no airbridges onto the plane so in order to board the aircraft you go down an escalator into a very cramped 'holding area' with hardly any seats before boarding a bus for the very long journey out to the plane. Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge. The only positive was that there seemed to be a lot of Qatar Airways staff all around the terminal assisting passengers.

Compared to many other airports it is standard during peak hours you hardly can move freely in the airport. The duty free is small with limited items available. For such a transit terminal it is not entertaining/accommodating enough. The toilets need improvement but still adequate. No trolleys available so you need to carry all of your cabin luggage when shopping in the duty free and the queue of the payment point could be a nightmare.

Coming in from Bangkok around noon was a complete different story all security lanes open AND through in 30 seconds so we had 1 hour and 25 minutes to wait for the next plane. Outbound we had a long layover and I strongly recommend the Oryx lounge although it is a bit pricey for $40.

Ground floor always seems to be crowded duty free shop poorly set out I've never been able to purchase anything here due to the long queues much better to use the smaller duty free shop on the upper floor. Plenty of seating available upstairs and as the seats have armrests it stops the backpackers lying full length still not somewhere you'd want to spend a long time.

Flew in to Terminal 1 where all the other airlines land at. Now this is a review for Terminal 1. This greatly varies to Terminal 3, where all the Emirates flight flies into (which is the posher terminal). Absolutely amazed at how bad the condition of the terminal is, considering this is a main hub for tourists and that this is Dubai. My flight from Muscat to Dubai was only 45-50 minutes long however the queue at the immigration? 1 hour 10 minutes - longer than my flight. The immigration was jam packed. Regardless the day or the time! I flew in on a Thursday afternoon (4pm): Packed. I flew in on a Monday morning (11am): Packed. I flew back in on Wednesday (12am): Packed. Oh and not to mention, it was boiling! I don't know if the staff noticed just how packed it was, but they certainly did not notice just how the amount of people equals to more body heat. Considering that is is Dubai, they can honestly do better.

Whilst the queuing was not too bad staff were certainly not friendly at immigration either in or out. The facilities in terminal 1 were limited and there was hardly any seating for once we had checked in our return flight. However the main problem was that everything was filthy.

Even the few seats available in the terminal were dirty I perched on the edge they were so bad. I would have sat in Costa or Starbucks but they were small hemmed in and packed with other disconsolate souls looking for a seat.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2012-08-05,I had a decent transit experience at T3 the first time through here 7 weeks ago. My flight from HYD had the misfortune of being parked at a remote stand which meant wasting 20 minutes on a bus back to the terminal. Once in the transit area no signage regarding what to do if transferring to an airline other than Emirates. Security check was fast. Then came the bizarre process of going down a set of escalators walking 50 feet then up another escalators to the floor we were just on this time a little further down the hall. Then came the hike from the far end of Concourse 2 to the transfer desk for BA at the other end of Concourse 1. What's maddening is that the transfer desks are outside security by just a few feet (amazingly to reach them you are told to go the wrong way through the metal detectors) so after getting my boarding pass I had to go through security again even though I'd just been in a secured area! Finally boarding pass in hand I could head for my gate - only to find yet another useless security check! The whole thing took exactly one hour while speed walking through the terminal enduring 3 security checks during that time 2 of which were unnecessary. At least with the exception of one officer at the third and final security check the personnel I encountered were helpful and efficient. The bottom line after two transits through Dubai - if your arriving flight parks at an aerobridge the process isn't bad taking perhaps 30 minutes though you may have to walk a bit. But all bets are off if you get stuck at a remote stand. That risk alone will put me off from choosing to transit through Dubai again.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

My flight from LHR landed just before 11 pm I thought this would be an awful time. It took 30 minutes from parking (thankfully at an aerobridge) until I got to my onward gate. Almost all that time was spent walking the vast distances of both concourses from one end to another as my arriving flight was at the far end of concourse 1 and the onwards was at the opposite far end of concourse 2. The transfer itself was a breeze; not a single person in line ahead of me at security check which took all of 45 seconds to get through. There was also plenty of seating space available throughout concourse 2 and no real issues with lack of available toilets or overcrowding in the shopping areas.

There were large queues at security and there was no allowance for the large group of passengers who were rushing for the connecting flight. There were very long queues at security. The duty free areas were OK but the stalls in the middle of the corridor/walkway meant that with passengers going in different directions along the narrower walkways it became congested at times.

Although my most local airport I used it for the first time only this week to fly out to LUX via AMS (with KLM) then back from BRU via LHR (with BMI). I was on the road barely 10 minutes after landing on my return (hand baggage only) but had some trouble checking in at Brussels where the staff still referred to the airport as Teesside then again passing through passport control at Heathrow when I gave Teesside as my destination and was told somewhat sharply (and lacking any humour in tone or body language) by the man on the desk that there was no such place! Seriously road signs must be a real pain for strangers to the area - why on earth can't quick stick-on amendments have been made by now?

Dushanbe only has 2 flights a week from Istanbul (most flights are from Moscow) - if they had more the system would collapse. On arrival it took 3 hours to clear immigration - once I got my visa I had to wake up the border official to stamp my passport! Usual FSU customer service standards - it took 20 minutes from getting to the desk to receiving a boarding card with the check in agent calling her friends and wandering off during check in hand writing passenger details carry your own bag through the scanner etc. They relieved me of $40 exit charge for which I got no receipt so I am not sure if this was simply a bit of Tajik private enterprise or a tax on foreigners. Airside there is absolutely no space - the airport was designed before security measures and you simply have to wait until 5 minutes before the flight before you go through. Duty free closed (with only 2 flights of westerners a week you would think it was worth their while to open it) and nothing at all airside aside from a few plastic chairs. Land side there is a coffee shop selling bizzarely coloured cakes and a variety of beverages but as the Turkish Airlines flight is horribly early in the morning I did not feel up to consuming anything so cannot comment!,NA,NA,NA,2,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Escalators were roped off with everyone being redirected to the stairs and lifts.

Can't really complain about the airside facilities or indeed much else. On the return leg the baggage was at the carousel by the time we had got there. The only problem was being held up by the bus service for twenty minutes because they couldn't get it to restart and a whole bus load of pax and their luggage had to change to another vehicle (but this is a Lothians Buses problem).

edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2008-05-18,I have not used this airport as frequently as some commentators but I was recently there and disagree with some of the previous comments. True it is busy and needs additional facilities also the shops and restaurants are usual BAA fare but there was plenty of seating and information was good - my outward flight was delayed but not really due to the airport (the local weather was poor when it appeared very good everywhere else in Britain). My real disagreement is with transport links there is a bus to the city centre every 10-15 minutes which costs £3 and when I used it took less than 20 minutes which seems as good as any other airport I know of in Britain. Obviously it will take longer when the traffic is busy however there is much publicity about a tram to link the airport and city to be opened in a couple of years so it is not really fair to say the problem is not being addressed (albeit rather late).,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There are good amenities available once you're past security if you want to get something to read or something to eat. And the Air Canada lounge at Edmonton is very nice indeed -- definitely the place to be if you have to spend a few hours between flights. The airport is a way out of Edmonton proper and getting there involves a slow drive through downtown if you're from the north side. Also in my most recent trip there it took about forty minutes to get through the security checks.

At the x-ray scanner an operator gazed in the general direction of the monitor screen. The main hall had no AC not even a fan and had a very oppressive atmosphere. Baggage handlers man-handled checked bags out through a back door. After checking in most passengers seemed to go back outside where it was much cooler.

Why passport control between and within Terminals? Evidently the concept of an internally secured passageway eludes management. Signage also seems to be a foreign concept.

We did however find the notorious Tunnel possibly a filled in drainage ditch with just as much charm. My wife is slightly mobility challenged. This makes endless stairs/corridors difficult and puts a premium on functioning lifts. I dare say even fully fit individuals would not enjoy the experience.

Checking in with Lufthansa is all automated so it can be confusing and time consuming for the first time user. Don't bother asking any airline staff member to help you - they were rude and didn't help. Getting on to a flight is ridiculous - wait in a crowded departure lounge then finally scan your Boarding Pass only to be stopped just beyond the boarding gate to wait (again getting crowded) rather than let you board the plane. Arriving into Terminal 1 is even more illogical. Follow the signs to Immigration and Baggage Reclaim. Immigration is straight forward but next is Customs before reclaiming your bags. To get to the Baggage Reclaim you have to continue walking beyond Customs where you'll find yourself in the Check In area of the airport. Finally the Reclaim is down into an unsecured area and once you have your bags walk back out into the Check In area. The whole path is convoluted and illogical.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

You can get to France through the Swiss side terminal - just collect your luggage in the main bagage hall go out into the Swiss side and then walk upstairs (to the left I think) through a small door and you are in France! There is a place for someone to check your passport but I have never seen anyone there. The French side is much less crowded and has a full set of (albeit fewer) check in desks so you can check in and leave your luggage here without a long wait but be warned - you need a boarding card to go from France to Switzerland in the terminal so you can't go back to the Swiss side once you have left - make sure you have all your children with you! I have no idea if there is any public transport or taxis on the French side - probably not - but there is a full set of car hire booths (if you hire on the French side you must bring it back to the French side otherwise Herz or whoever will charge you lots of money to move the car about 100m). There are lots of shops selling pricy watches and chocolate and a reasonably good duty free - before security - but the cafes in the departure satellites (after the security has removed your drinks) are horrendously expensive - €3 for a small bottle of water anyone - but aside from that the only problem is the lack of seating downstairs however if you go upstairs near the frequent fliers lounges (follow sign for chapel) the lounges are usually empty.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

glasgow-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-airport,Glasgow Airport customer review,E Barr,NA,2008-02-12,"I regularly commute through Glasgow Airport and remain astounded at how consistently poor it can be despite some great staff. Yes the security incident last year was dreadful and people have coped admirably but this should not allow BAA / Ferrovial to gloss over the underlying issues with an airport that is ""overtrading"" until the extension is completed. Until this happens some simple things could be done to make our lives easier and some real bugbears exist. On International arrivals why is the moving walkway always closed for maintenance / switched-off as it was on January 25th? They do not however switch off the message ""you are approaching a moving walkway"" - actually it is not working - first impressions count and this is not good. Why does baggage always take around at least 30 mins to arrive as it did on February 2nd (as usual)? Most airports around the world are much faster than this and BAA have to take a hard look at itself on this one - are the baggage handlers understaffed? It certainly looks like it and if they are they have my sympathy what with the growth of the airport. I recently used the new SkyLounge and overall it was a pleasant experience with nice staff. On a recent ski holiday flight I was subject to the usual crowd of happy skiers all off on their break and Glasgow Airport was struggling to cope. There appeared to be a ""manager"" running around with a walkie-talkie telling check-in staff not to overload the baggage belts - whilst we were all standing there. I am not sure what good this did as in my case it just seemed to annoy the check-in staff all the more on what was clearly a day that they all dread (with some justification it seems). There are some highlights. The ""mature"" gentleman in the whisky area of the duty free shop is very knowledgeable and friendly and the Caffe Nero is very small but has great staff and coffee. All in all this place is saved by the generally good natured attitude of the staff despite some inconsistent management practices and general failure to recognise that people are not likely to accept this mess without having a voice. It's all very well expanding the retail side of an airport but the priority should be a ""back to basics"" campaign from the top down in terms of customer experience in simple things like check-in baggage and moving walkways.

Arriving on Jetstar from Sydney we had to negotiate the stairs (no airbridges) then literally battle our way between two 30m lines of passengers, with hand baggage, waiting to board flights. The gap between the lines was about half a metre and my small wheeled back-pack was hitting the bags of the waiting passengers. What a totally ludicrous situation! Surely the designers of the upgrade could foresee such a situation and keep arriving passengers separated from those queued to board. Departure 5 days later at 0700 was much more comfortable experience through gate 3 at the other end of the airport.

You are put through a series of tents to get through passport control and the baggage reclaim is slow and a bit of a mess. However departures is a drastically different story. The new terminal is very nice bearing in mind i came through Grenoble an the end of the February half term ski season so it was very busy. But the terminal dealt with it very well. Check in was fairly quick plenty of desks. Security was surprisingly fast. (More info on flight boards would be nice though). Departures was fine you can generally find a place to sit.

No wonder less-frequent flyers get confused when faced with check-in for other airlines and airports closing 30 minutes before departrue (eg Jetstar) and here we have an airport not allowing any check-in at all until 45 minutes before departure. Makes for an interesting rush of people. Pleasant terminal spoilt by a television blaring away in one corner making it difficult to get some work done.

This needs to be sorted or doing away with as if you come off a plane and will board another one why would you need to go through a fine security check once again. This really needs to be made more efficient as the security staff are arrogant, unhelpful and rude in the cases I observed as I waited to transfer through. They say there is a fast track but its not sign-posted and passengers were just overwhelming the security area anyway. Signing in this area is pretty poor. The gates C-20-29 are downstairs and its like a sauna down there with inadequate A/C overcrowding of passengers and huge queues just to use the one toilet area there which can not cope with the humanity that flows through there even with attendants trying their best. Badly designed sadly and you still have to use buses would you believe to get to your aircraft from these gates. So you build a huge airport and yet you still have to uses buses and crowded parts of this airport to board a plane. Truly not thought out for passengers sadly in these areas.

Arrival was straightforward with bags on the belt in reasonable time. The direct S-Bahn connection to the city centre is frequent and the fare a very modest EUR2.95. Departure was also fine apart from a few minor niggles spoiling the experience. The up escalator to Terminal 1 departures was out of action leaving a choice between carrying heavy cases upstairs or cramming into a lift. Didn't it occur to anybody to reverse the direction of the down escalator which was still working? Secondly the security staff put my passport and boarding pass into the tray to go through screening (why?) but in such a position that they fell out as the tray left the machine. Luckily I noticed this and they were retrieved with no harm done but such carelessness with essential documents isn't good enough. More seriously both male and female toilets at Gate C06 were out of action (and seemed to have been for some time) with only a tiny notice in German to warn you. Since you have to go through Passport Control to reach the gate there is no access to alternative toilets unless you can persuade the Passport staff to let you back out.

The new terminal is clean and bright and a huge improvement over the old provided you are flying airlines that use it. Security seems totally confused and amateur compared to other airports and after checking in you simply deposit your checked luggage in a heap manned by security staff who seem distracted and uninterested in what you are doing. Worst of all is upon return it takes far too long to get your baggage. On a recent calm winter night we'd all deplaned a Delta flight and it took about 20 minutes before any luggage began to appear at the carousels. About 15 bags came out and then there was another 10 minute wait for 15 bags and then on and on. You can generally plan on waiting at least 30 minutes to get your bag at this ""small"" airport.

havana-airport,/airport-reviews/havana-airport,Havana Airport customer review,Glenn Biffen,United Kingdom,2014-09-22,Arrived to a plain airport with a predominant colour of red everywhere and a warm friendly welcome from staff. The luggage belt (the biggest we had ever seen) was a bit chaotic but my partner and I were expecting this so shrugged it off. Customs were fine arrivals hall was pure chaos but again we laughed it off as being part of the experience. Given the social and political status of this country we were not expecting too much but were surprised at what we did find. However there was more choice landside than airside but then again was not expecting a shopping mall! To avoid chaos at tax payment (to leave Cuba) and the immigration exit (staff on all sectors were very pleasant by the way) we would recommend arriving as early as you can. The departure lounge was air conditioned and although small in some respects seemed quite spacious in a way. No long walks to the departure gates either although some confusion here really; boarding pass dictated B9 the plane was sitting at B9 but the main screen stated B11 as did the screen above B11. The staff had it all under control though and we boarded in very quickly indeed. Please note: Just to be aware that on both land and air sides keep loose change (in peso/cents) for the people on entrance to the toilets - well the men's anyway (otherwise no paper to dry your hands).,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Having finally cleared that lot we found that some of our luggage had still not found its way to the conveyor belt.

havana-airport,/airport-reviews/havana-airport,Havana Airport customer review,Peter Yunes,NA,2005-12-19,Havana Airport (Jose Marti) has 3 terminals. Terminal 2 is mainly used for charter flights from Miami. This terminal was built few years ago and was mainly for international flights however seemed quite small and impractical. Since tourism kept increasing every year a new international terminal was needed. Terminal 3 started on 1998. Since it is not a big airport I think is running fairly well. I had been in Havana 5 times arriving from different countries. As a rule Immigration is fairly quick although I found it particularly slow one night when 3 flights from Europe arrived almost at the same time (1 hour waiting) . Luggage collection is OK. Public transport from Terminal 3 is non existing but they are plenty of taxis and the ride to the center takes no more than 30 minutes. No hotels around so I recommend connecting passengers catch a taxi and go around the city if you stay for half a day. Facilities are few although they are ok.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
heho-airport,/airport-reviews/heho-airport,Heho Airport customer review,W Ford,United Kingdom,2014-03-31,Travelled in and out of this Burmese provincial airport early last year arriving from Mandalay and leaving to Rangoon. Pretty basic but it was OK and really belonged to another age of flying. This because you could wander out onto the runway between planes arriving (there weren't many) and if you wished you could go to your hold luggage which was stacked on a trolley awaiting the plane's arrival and put things in or take things out of it. Many of the Burmese passengers availed themselves of this facility as our plane was an hour late arriving. When it's light appeared in the sky on it's approach an airport official suggested we all go back into the terminal so we did.

helsinki-vantaa-airport,/airport-reviews/helsinki-vantaa-airport,Helsinki Vantaa Airport customer review,S Barker,United States,2012-06-17,I had overall great experiences at Vantaa at least for my purposes which were leisure travel from the US on Finnair from New York. I purposely booked flights to Italy that included layovers in Helsinki both coming and going. On arrival to Vantaa on a Sunday morning I was able to easily get information on how to get into the city (two convenient bus options) and a very well-stocked tourist kiosk had great maps and walking tour suggestions in multiple languages. Pretty much everyone I dealt with spoke excellent English with no apparent problem with dealing with a non-Finnish speaker (not always the case on the Finnair flights). My layovers were long enough that I spent two nights in the airport and I was pleasantly surprised at how relatively comfortable this was. The airport had free wifi that had a strong signal (or whatever you call it) and was extremely easy to log onto. Also lots of electric outlets available to recharge devices. There were both brightly lit and diimmly lit areas for trying to settle in for the night to rest a bit and the ones close to the Terminal 2 entrances that I stayed by felt very safe and secure. At the far end of Terminal 2 (across from the new Starbuck's which was overpriced by US standards) is a more or less full service 24 hour grocery store. This was great for getting food and bottled water at something like one-third of the price that the regular airport kiosks charged and also great for loading up on food souvenirs like chocolate and licorice before flying out. Another thing I appreciated was that credit cards were welcome for even the smallest purchases. I was out of Euros on my way back to the states but my credit card was happily accepted for transactions as small as a postcard and postage stamp. Lines for security and passport control were 1-2 minutes in each case for me so that was fine too. Overall had a good impression of Finland and Vantaa and hope to return in the future for a more extended vacation.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Serious problem this as passengers could see all the other machines and were not pleased that they could not be bothered to open more points. In fairness that is a worldwide issue not just Helsinki though. Once through security we were amazed to find that shops and bars were closing down as quickly as they could for the night. One cafe bar was left open for the entire terminal! The last flights do not leave until midnight so some pressure on facilities was evident.

Thank goodness we did not have hold luggage (we live out there) and that we checked in online as the queues were horrible! But despite some other reviews on here the toilets look new and clean. On arrival from Bristol we herded off the plane onto some awful cramped bus and driven at twice the speed of sound to the terminal which wasn't very comfortable as we had to stand up. On return to Heraklion (to fly to Bristol) it was worse. Our easyJet flight was called early but we did not know about this I just happened to go and look at the departure screen where it said in very small letters gate 6 (or something like that) but it didn't say boarding. We queued up at the back with another lady who same as us had paid for speedy boarding. One lady seemed to shout in Greek that speedy boarder's should come and stand by her at the front. She then tore up my boarding pass (no efficient cutter or anything) and then we were told to go and stand outside on the steps. 10 minutes later a bus came for the Gatwick passengers (whose flight was leaving 30 mins after ours!) and then finally 25 minutes later a bus came for us. Awful service at Heraklion! When we got onto the brand new easyJet plane to take us home (very pleased) we sat right at the front so very good legroom.

heraklion-airport,/airport-reviews/heraklion-airport,Heraklion Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2007-10-29,"We must have passed through Heraklion airport at much the same time as your previous correspondent but our experience was much easier - perhaps things were quieter because of our late evening flights. We last used Heraklion 6 years ago and remembered little apart from the crowding - until we read the reference about the entertainment value of the bottom step from the duty free as we'd been entertained too! Obviously Heraklion has been redeveloped since then because there's much more space and no longer an irregular bottom step from the duty free. On arrival we too did have a long wait for our bags and I would agree that it was not easy to find which carousel was to be used. While I waited for the suitcase my wife went through to process our car rental pick-up and had it all sorted long before our bag came through. Leaving from Heraklion was far easier than departures we've had from other Greek airports. BA check-in opened early so that only took us about 10 minutes there was no queue at all for the separate baggage drop and there was plenty of seating in the pre-security departure area. We didn't even have to queue to go through security either time (more of that later!) though we're not sure how searching security actually was as the visible screen didn't seem to recive much attention. Lots of space in the departure lounge and much cleaning going on. We didn't try to buy anything as we tend to avoid airport food anyway so I can't comment on price or quality. The only problem that arose was when our flight was called - we were in the wrong depature lounge! We had to go back through security right through the check-in area through more security to find Gate 1 at the other end of the terminal building. We don't think we missed any signs or information but most other passengers for the flight seemed to be in the right place so we assume that it is something to do with ""Schengen"" which is a mystery to us who are more used to shorter journeys with low-cost airlines. By the time we reached the gate the buses to the plane were being loaded but we weren't the last by any means so perhaps we weren't the only ones in the wrong place. Otherwise the ""new"" Heraklion came as quite a pleasant surprise.... though we did miss the entertainment of that bottom step! Score: 4",NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The food concession stands also cater to Japanese tastes only so you are out of luck if you only like western food. There are also no magazines or books in any language other than Japanese.

Plus points: 1) I stayed at the Regal Airport Hotel connected to landside of the arrivals section. Very good hotel with good service and facilities and reasonably priced. 2) Transport links are sound with bus and taxi options. 3) The terminal itself had all the essential facilities and conveniences. Minus points: 1) All passenger conveyors - escalators and travelators - have bollards that prevent passengers from bring baggage. From a safety perspective this is understandable with escalators - there are always lifts nearby too - but less so with travelators. 2) I did not find HKIA to be the easiest to navigate to my gate - wayfinding itself was fine but there were a lot of directional changes walking and the need to go from Terminal 1 to T2 by train in order to get my flight from T1. 3) The satellite building where my flight was leaving from was not well set-up for food and retail - the main building was but suffered from very heavy queuing which I could not afford to wait in. General thoughts: My experience of arriving at HKIA is generally positive across the board save for the initial feeling of confusion at the sight of high-rising escalators crossing each other in an imposing arrivals area. My experience from check-in to boarding the aircraft isn't one I look back on favourably - at the risk of sounding lazy I felt that a lot of time was wasted on the walking required and the queuing in the main retail and food complex added to my frustrations.

Food-wise there are a couple of places (a Chinese place and a McDonalds) which while cheap for an airport are more than the same chains charge outside the airport in Hong Kong. The security queue's are almost always very fast (I have never queued for more than 5 mins even over CNY) but the immigration (arrival) queue can be a little frustrating and the bags don't always turn up very quickly (which I suppose is a comfort if you have to queue for immigration first it's not time wasted if your luggage still isn't ready). One tip travellers might be interested in knowing is that the shuttle train is not necessary - if you have time to kill and enjoy a stroll you can just walk past all the other gates to get to the other end of the train which travels underneath the main walkway. The main terminal is a 'Y' shape the train goes under the '|' part of the 'Y'. My gripes about this airport (my local airport) are that there aren't any relaxing places to have reasonably priced coffee it's a long way from Hong Kong proper and there is an annex which requires a bus to get to which is a frustration and not all that pleasant if you are unlucky enough to get relegated to one of those gates.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

However I find the shops very repetitive as it's all duty free from all European/American branded names. While the airport is run efficiently and you will not find it boring but it lacks that extra personal touch that Singapore Changi offers i.e koi pond swimming pools massage area (in Hong Kong you have to pay to get into the lounge for massage) quiet spaces. Overall it's a great airport to transit and the food is reasonably priced. And of course the duty shopping is quite good.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,C Brown,United Kingdom,2014-04-11,Being one of only three 5 star Skytrax rated airports in the world it doesn't take long to see why. The airport is incredibly clean well sized and has plenty of on site amenities. On arrival I was through immigration in next to no time but the walk and then train ride from the gate was maddeningly long. The Airport Express train is one of the most expensive options to get to the city but by many standards is still an absolute bargain. My one big gripe with Hong Kong airport is actually about how functional it all is. Style makes way for function in everything. It is an incredibly boring affair with no flair or flourishes to make up for the monotony of it all. Personally I found the signage to be okay not brilliant and not nearly as good bright yellow signage commonly found in European airports. Some of the amenities are also really expensive ($200HKD for a shower seemed rather steep to me!) and the facilities for eating and drinking landside are a little lacking (Terminal 2 is better but most airlines use Terminal 1). One more moan - The time from gate to takeoff. The captain on my flight warned us that the taxi would take at least 20 minutes at minimum and that this is a regular affair at Hong Kong Airport. I have also learnt from several sources that Cathay Pacific leave transfer times between connecting flights that they have booked perilously short. Passengers have to be rushed through the airport by staff who meet them at the gate. They manage to get onto their connecting flights but sadly their luggage doesn't join them! Putting my moaning to one side this is a good airport with an excellent reputation and I can see why.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I have been here before over a year ago. It is clean efficient with a variety of options for food plus many options to get into the city. I found the signage easy to read and understand everyone was very helpful and maybe I am easy to please but no long line ups anywhere it was pretty easy to get through each time no long waiting lines. This time we arrived about 9pm on a Thursday night and 7am on a Tuesday morning. Departed midnight and 10.20am respectively the following days after arrival (just being one night stopovers) so there were a variety of times and none caused us any issues or problems.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-01-10,I live in Hong Kong so pass through this airport a lot! It gets top scores but other than in comparison to other Asian airports I don't really understand why. It's not convenient to get to the Airport Express is only really suited for business men rather than locals and is also expensive (100$!). The busses are slow the airport is a long way from anywhere on an island. This is gripe number one because I often go to collect visitors so I make the trip far too often. My other gripes are that immigration is painful. I am resident but still need to queue up (albeit in the residents queue) which is better than most visitors - but still far too long especially on departure. The food/shop choices are poor. There is always an enormous queue for the food outlets none of which are any good (a basic sandwich shop would be nice) maybe McDonald's is the most popular (and cheapest). There is no cheap coffee either (except at McDonald's) and the shops are almost without exception fashion clothes watches etc. (all super expensive) which are useless for most people. Security is on the whole (surprisingly) sensible (that is not too strict on the >100ml liquids) and fast. It's clean and has a viewing deck (which costs money another sad point). Overall it's a shame this is my local airport given how far away it is from anyone and how pricey all the shops are. It's only saving grace is that the time to the airport is basically unchanging from most places so you can minimise your time there by leaving as late as possible!,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Passport control can sometimes be slow but this is the only negative comment I can imagine for this airport. Airport is very clean and well organized. When arriving in Hong Kong after passport control your luggage is usually already waiting for you on the luggage belt or will be coming much faster then in many other airports I have been to. Transportation to any part go HK is fast and cheap. Departure from HKG is made very easy and to avoid queues just use the downtown check in service. HK duty free is impressive with many brands present. Being a very large airport you can use the fast train service to take you from one side of the airport to the other.

I very much enjoy the layovers in this airport as it is very spacious great facilities food shops relaxation and entertainment areas. However I have to agree with the last few reviews regarding the very long queues in security queues are getting worse and are becoming a real annoyance especially when you have a short transfer time. Immigration which I pass through only 20% of my stops in Hong Kong airport is by far the worse I seen in Asian airports.

Once you deplane you have to walk a long way to the Delta baggage claim and signage is not very good. The airport is old but everything works. I found it quite interesting to leave the gate area and walk outdoors to the main terminal where baggage claim and the arrival hall is. Baggage was delivered within a few minutes after the first pax made the long hike. Once outside I found the official airport shuttle to Waikiki and was on my way. Departure was just as swift with your bags being scanned by the agriculture department before heading to check-in. The departure lobby is really very old and baggages are stacked behind the check-in counter before being transported to the plane. Security was quite quick and if you are leaving on an international flight you have a nice choice of duty free goods but if you leave on a domestic flight like I did there really is not much. I had some Japanese food before heading to the gate area and I was glad that the plane left almost on time as it's pretty boring being stuck in that airport for long.

Out of a possible 30 or so desks there were about six open for international passengers at that time of night. The immigration officer we saw was polite and processed us smoothly. We did not have to line up for very long before being processed but I did note that more people had joined a line once we had cleared immigration. It would I think take some considerable time to clear immigration here if there had been another international flight arriving. I saw the Global Entry kiosks before arriving at Immigration but I did not see anyone use these at the time I passed them. (As a UK citizen I am ineligible to use such a service). Baggage for our flight came off quite quickly. One thing I have now noticed is that when the customs form is handed in you now have to show your passport to them also. The taxi rank was not well sign-posted outside and the dispatcher had isolated himself in a glass box!. Once we had managed to communicate with this individual the taxi arrived soon afterwards.

It turns into a completely wasted day. Management seems to not care about passenger flow. They torture you with long lines with 4 or 5 stations out of 80 (yes 80) open. The appearance of security is there so while they delay you anyone can walk off with your luggage because there is nothing to monitor it at the back end. No nexus pass to speed things up. No priority for connections or smooth connection process. Do not buy duty free perfume or liquor etc. You are a transit passenger but it will be confiscated or taxed because you pass through customs.

I believe the very different appreciations of this airport are in part due to the fact that all terminals are not equal. Arriving from Paris on the AF flight. Quite a long walk until you get to immigrations (no longer at its original place). There some queue and waiting time but it was organized with employees guiding the passengers and it took no more than 20 minutes to go through the control. Luggage already on the conveyor ! All in all not a bad performance. On the return I am not so satisfied.The safety controls are undersized for the number of passengers (and this day a number of flights were cancelled because of weather !) in what looks to be a (for-ever ?) temporary location and it took ages to go through the process while messages kept informing you that commenting on safety procedures was an offence. The so called ""magic"" X ray system does not seem to be an improvement it is long an about 50 % of the passengers need to be hand-checked anyway. Then the terminal itself must be the barest international terminal I ever saw : 1 small duty-free shop (do your shopping in town prices are better and there is no choice) a very limited (US only) newspaper stand no bookshop no electronics shop only 1 bar / snack no plugs for computer it's big and empty.

There is an above ground people mover (the ""Terminal Link"") which works quite well; however it has not been extended yet all the way to Terminal A from the other terminals although this section is currently under construction.

Arrival was chaos to say the least with long queues to pay for a visa and even longer unmanaged queues to get it stamped. The price you pay seemed to be somewhat variable depending on where you paid for it $20 at the official desk (for the visa stamped $15) or cheaper from some of the tour guides. Our baggage had arrived by the time we got to the baggage hall (45 mins from arrival) but had been dumped off the belt onto the floor in the general area of a belt – finding it was difficult. The security queue on our return was long and fast track was on offer for €10 but this really would have been a waste of time because the queue moved fast. Check-in was very fast with short queues for my flight (not sure why it was so good) and the subsequent queue through emigration and then security again was fast. The bazaar designed to relieve you of money beyond security was doing a good trade but the duty free alcohol prices were more than those payable on our plane only cigarettes being cheaper.

hurghada-airport,/airport-reviews/hurghada-airport,Hurghada Airport customer review,Paul Harvey,NA,2009-02-16,"The airport is close to the town and is currently undergoing a continuous rebuild. Initially you pass through a general screening x-ray security gate (bags passports etc). There were very long queues because they were also using the baggage screeners (at a peak time of the day) to screen cases of duty free being taken through to the shops and also crates of milk. Check-in was fast but the check-in staff tried to convince many passengers that their baggage (which was within weight limits of the way out) was now over weight and surcharges would have to be paid. Perhaps the fact that some of the scales read 3 kg when unloaded and others read 12 kg might have had something to do with it! Immigration and further security was efficient. Once airside it resembles a bazaar with numerous shops adopting the hardsell approach to things you did not know you wanted. The toilets have clear signs saying ""No Tips"" but the view of the attendants is that the notice only applies to staff. Food and drink is available (very expensive water is £3 per 500ml) and duty free prices are in dollars and are also very very expensive. The gate areas are large with bussing to the planes. Smoking seems to be allowed everywhere.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The one thing you'll notice upon getting in or out of the terminal is the crowd control - you don't have to fight through the thousands of gawkers that normally congest the entry gates. The check-in area is spacious and unlike other airports in India you don't have to get your bags pre-screened before going to the check-in counter. Security check is a breeze and there is a better selection of shops and restaurants than the old airport (albeit badly overpriced). The terminal building itself is clean airy and bright with adequate seating at the gate areas and has clean modern bathroom facilities. The negatives - the distance from the city the exorbitant parking fees (300 rupees just for your driver to wait for you) high prices for food and drinks in the terminal and the bags take a good while to get to the carousels.

Plenty of seating in the departure areas and all together a pleasant airport to sit and wait for departure. The bad most arrivals are bussed to the terminal last year and previous it was a 75 yard straight to passport control now they have put in walkways and it is now about 600 yards to walk up and down for old people us not good especially when easy to adjust the straps and cut down the walking distance when little arrival traffic. Getting out similar this year now 3 funnels for customs which feed into each other creating one big bottle neck with those who are leaving it to the last minute trying to push through to the front have made what worked into a disaster.

The duty free is also pretty good with a wide range. The standards of English for concession staff was pretty good and the information screens are clear. I accidentally left my baggage in baggage claim and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful in getting it for me when I passed through security without remembering to collect it. There is a bus that will take you to pretty much any Seoul downtown hotel and it is cheap and bus stops are well sign posted for which hotel you need but it can take quite a while to get to downtown.

I was dreading the return experience. However this time I noticed another transit and security facility only about 100m away that was hardly being used!

Compared to some others I was quite lucky to arrive at a time where the queues at passport control were limited. Going from International to Domestic is a bit long but if you carefully follow the signs you manage. Had a long wait in domestic airport and the only solution is to take a drink at one of the bars / coffee shops. At least it is quite cheap and they don't push you out but you need Turkish Liras and it's not very comfortable. The safety control is not too well organized it's better to have time ahead. Then the boarding room is small with not enough seats (as in most airports). Boarding by Bus. It was worth on the way back. For some reason Turkish Airlines site would not allow me to print my second (international) boarding card and time was short. There is a ""quick way"" from domestic to international but you need the boarding card! Luckily could find an automate that worked. Safety control was not too bad. But on the international side boarding rooms are much smaller than on domestic with a pitiful number of seats. Plane was delayed with very little information. The queue was ""Turkish'"" the transfer was by bus with the usual mess associated to this solution. When at least they opened the door of the bus it was ""free for all"" with people boarding from both ends of the plane and trying to reach their seats at the other end.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,M Michael,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,Flew here from Brussels and back again. There are very long and tedious lines at passport control on arrival made even more long and tedious if you also choose to buy a visa on landing rather than buy one online in advance. My advice is buy a visa online before you land. Unless you hold a Turkish passport you will have a long wait at passport control. The metro transport from the airport to Sultan Ahmet is cheap and only involves one change/connection. Cafes are ok and reasonable choice in duty free. The signage was a little unclear at times. On the outward flight ridiculous procedures mean you are screened through security gates at the terminal entrance pass through passport control then pass through the main security again just minutes later. There are very long and tedious lines at each stage of this process three step process with some pushing and shoving common at the passport control with little organisation as to where people should line up.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,T Foran,Canada,2014-09-10,We have flown in and out of IST-Ataturk many times over the past decade. The airport has improved in some ways and declined in others. Business Class check in lines were chaotic with economy pax frequently queue jumping and little attention from staff. Now Bus Class check in is really smooth with the convenience of entering the lounge directly after Passport Control. Unfortunately. though we had been through security we were obliged to do it again in the sweltering heat of the gate two times. Landing at IST has got progressively more stressful as the airport gets more traffic. It took over an hour and half to get through Passport Control and get our luggage. Turkish airlines flights have been almost always tardy and our flight from Toronto departed 2.5 hours late so we were three hours late arriving. Our friends waited to pick us up. The food and drink in the Business Class lounge is great but it is frequently overcrowded. Both arriving and leaving have become longer more annoying processes.

When we flew (to FRA on THY June 2014) one had to go through full security before entering the terminal. There wasn't obviously anyone to help if a passenger were too frail to lift ones (not yet checked) bags onto a table above waist level for the x-ray. So we then assumed that IST just does security in a different order having cleared security we bought water for the flight (at reasonable prices) before passport control. Only after passport control can you see that there's a second identical security check and you have to discard that water. Still thirsty or hungry? The final set of shops and restaurants have the most outrageous prices you have ever encountered in any airport anywhere. So we had about $10 worth of Turkish lira left but could buy almost nothing with it. Why not exchange it for € or $ at the currency exchange? No they say the amount we had didn't meet their minimum! The roads to IST from Sultanahmet were fast and uncrowded at least at 6am. The ticketing check-in agents were unusually friendly and efficient; the passport control line was really long but moved quickly. Fairly crowded waiting at the gate (but there was decent seating) and then we were jam-packed standing onto a bus to get to the plane.

On departure: lengthy security checks the agent at check-in didn't know a word of English - a superior had to step-in. Seating is scarce around the terminal.

Walking times to gates very long gates number changing at last minute. As the previous commentator objected you must have a Turkish SIM card in order to access the wireless internet - in an airport that tries to position itself as a global transit hub - mind boggling to say the least.

The main problem is queuing on arrival one queues for visa (if necessary) and then to have it checked for immigration (an hour in my case). On departure you queue for security before you enter the building (a few minutes) for check-in (about 15 mins in my case but by the time I got to the desk the queue was about 4-5 times longer than when I joined it) and then for emigration and a second security check. Fortunately a friend had advised me to arrive at least 2 hours before departure I endorse that. I recommend the metro and tram to get to the city centre the price is a tenth or less of a taxi or the shuttle bus and the time is about the same given Istanbul's traffic. Be aware it does require a change if you have a lot of luggage and also there is not a metro/tram stop near all hotels but if there is one it is a reliable and cheap alternative.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Next step was to go to the passport control line and this was another disaster with really long queues.

I then made my way directly to the departure gate only to be faced with another series of horrendous queues to get through the x-ray machines it was organised chaos. I heard my name being called with other passengers for our flight. I pleaded with an official to let me through to get to the plane but he refused point blank saying that I had time.

One reason they are slow at this point is that the available cubicles are never fully manned. Onto luggage claim - at the opposite end of the airport to the aircraft. You need a 1 Lira coin for a trolley. If you do not know this or do not have one you are stuck. I learnt the hard way during a previous trip.

I then replied by telling them a high percentage of long-haul flights leave late at night. Another thing which was very annoying and this happened both times I recently arrived was that baggage trolleys ran out meaning I had to carry my big heavy suitcase.

Elsewhere this is done with a stamp that requires perhaps a quarter of a page. Then you line up for another 30+ minutes for the actual immigration procedure where the previous action of acquiring your passport details is duplicated.

However issuing a full-page visa sticker for a stay of a few days is ridiculous and simply wastes an entire passport page upon every entry. In Japan the sticker is about the size of a postage stamp. On departure unnecessary waiting time is created by the surprise raid on departing passengers' wallets of Rp 150000 in cash. Most foreigners are out of local currency at that point in time.

They accept £ and $ currency at the duty free and return the change in Saudi currency (though the rate isn't great - but not bad for the convenience). The waiting area near the cafe was very clean  with massive windows overlooking the airport.

There were many stressed passengers like us worrying about whether they would get their connections. The mindbogglingly slow queues at passport control did not help matters. We managed to get our flight in the end mainly because when we exited the lift to the domestic terminal there were two supposedly helpful staff waiting to assist us.

The International terminal has really improved both before and after check-in. The new International wing is quite something modern spacious and very airy. But somewhat left the heaters on ( on a very hot day) so that was not exactly welcoming. One gripe I had about my experience in the International departures lounge area was that there is no ATM to be found. And I happen to be the unlucky one without SA Rand cash. I tried to buy a phone card from Telkom they do not take credit cards (machine broken) Vodacom does not sell phone cards but their vending machine does which takes cash. So I ended up spending a small fortune phoning from my mobile phone. So beware: If you need Rand cash after check-in and immigration draw money from the ATM first before going through. I found the craft shops to be expensive. I wondered to myself if they ever get their wares sold? Airport itself: ACSA is doing a fine job bringing OR Tambo International up to standard.

Baggage was a bit slow to come out but at least nothing was missing. Customs was a joke with one officer randomly waving people through or directing them to an x-ray machine.

Domestic departures was a breeze - no queues at check-in or security adequate seating space and clean toilets. Domestic arrivals was similarly hassle-free though it's a rather long walk from the gates to the baggage claim area. International departures was a real pain due to a check-in queue stretching the length of the terminal building - though I attribute this more to SAA's incompetence than the airport as no other airlines seemed to be having issues.

Whilst hand baggage trolleys are freely available they cannot (for no obvious reason) be taken through passport control and used as you get towards the gates.

This setup is in-place because it is not possible to walk from the non-Schengen gates to baggage claim without passing through the secure area of the main terminal. Therefore passengers cannot bring duty-free liquids purchased airside in North America into Iceland (though the arrivals duty-free store is quite well stocked). On the way back to North America despite signage to the contrary in gate areas there are no supplemental security procedures after the initial checkpoint so any liquids purchased once airside (or in the case of passengers connecting from elsewhere in Europe at the point of embarkation) can be brought onto the plane without restrictions such as the need to place them in tamper-proof bags.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The shops are okay (standard big-Asia-airport shops) but still have a sort of tacky make-shift feel about them unlike Singapore or Hong Kong and more like some Manila terminals or SVO (Moscow). My biggest complaint about this airport which I didn't spend a very long time in is the immigration queues. I didn't have any luggage but the queue for immigration was very slow moving. This is partly due to the number of Chinese nationals trying to enter (on my flight from Hong Kong) - and it certainly slows things down a bit when immigration staff insist on checking return flight bookings for certain passports (and in some cases rejecting them - something I have never seen before - telling passengers to contact their airline for assistance after being denied entry initially!). As a British passport holder getting past the lady at immigration was very smooth but there simply weren't enough staff for it to be acceptable by today's standards for big airports - particularly if they insist on checking Chinese peoples itineraries. My other gripe is the lack of reasonable coffee in departures - the best you can find is a McCafe without paying silly money: there is no other major coffee chain inside the airport (that I could easily find and at 6am I was looking pretty hard!).,NA,NA,NA,5,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Rishad Patell,India,2014-10-13,Used KLIA to transit on my flight BOM-KUL-REP and back. Had a 4.5 hour wait on the way there and 3 hours on the way back. Landed at 7am and the airport was strangely empty. Very easy to use airport but seems to have little to do if transiting for a few hours. Shops were okay - the basics available and the eating options seemed all right. Would rather use BKK or SIN to transit as there is more to do there but all in all KUL is a pleasant enough airport.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Ahmed Nash,Jordan,2014-09-14,I first went to this airport in 2010 and I thought it was a superb airport. However my recent visit proved the opposite. The quality and surrounding of the airport is getting worse. There are not as many seats for waiting passengers not to mention their bad condition (broken torn cushion). The desks where airport staff check tickets are also very old with scratches here and there. The information screens are sometimes confusing which codeshare airlines names are put together. A lot of stalls around the terminal are also irritating to the eyes.,NA,NA,NA,4,4,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1
klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-09-06,I'm a frequent flier on both full service and budget airlines though I try to avoid the latter. A major disadvantage of going with a budget airline apart from the lack of onboard amenities and punctuality is the low- cost terminals or airports from which they fly. I therefore expected a bare and plastic terminal with next to no amenities when I was on my way to KLIA2 which is used exclusively by budget airlines. How wrong I was. In all my years of flying I have never been so pleasantly surprised with an airport. The duty free shops and various cafes and restaurants on offer was excellent and better than most full-service airports from which I have flown. Also the terminal was so clean. In fact based on this experience the only airports I would say are better than KLIA2 are Singapore Hong Kong and Amsterdam Schiphol though in fairness they are mainly for full-service airlines. How KLIA2 heaps shame on many full-service hubs like Beijing Manila Jakarta Paris Charles de Gaulle Shanghai Pudong and Heathrow. Also public transport links are excellent for both efficiency and value for money. My only criticisms of this airport are the lack of travellators in such a large terminal building which could pose problems if someone was in a rush and the fact I had to go through security twice once right after immigration and then again before I went to pier P to catch my flight to Jakarta. Nevertheless I will not think twice about using KLIA2 again and I assume that KLIA's main and satellite buildings must be impeccable as they cater to full-service airlines.,NA,NA,NA,8,3,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

While KLIA is all stainless steel and glass KLIA2 is more white paint and glass. It's set up for much better comfort than the old LCCT terminal but unfortunately it's just not ready yet - there are very few useful facilities for transit passengers at the moment food options in the transit area are limited to MacDonalds and Gloria Jeans no bar no massage almost no ATMs limited duty free there are a couple of lounges but one shuts long before the last flight and the other is very remote and has no showers. Long walks to and from the gates with few travelators. Wrongly the toilets are already smelly and I encountered a broken-in-half toilet seat.

Easy check in at the Malaysian desks. Baggage arrived around 10 mins and easy sign posting for the KL express train into the City. Departing is another story. Most airports now seem to prefer high end duty free shops to passenger comfort.

Even with extra security and immigration checks due to MH370 all queues moved quickly and the staff were very friendly.

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,N Werner,Switzerland,2010-10-29,Staff are generally friendly and everything seems to be efficient and clean. A very good feature is the KLIA Ekspress where you can check-in at KL Sentral. Security is quite efficient and immigration officers are not bad. If you fly MAS on a domestic flight there are not many eating and shopping options though. Also if you fly to a SE Asian destination you usually use the gates which are above the domestic ones - and there you also have limited duty free. The satellite terminal has a good choice of shops and restaurants although of course the food is airport food. One annoying thing about KLIA are the frequent announcements in Bahasa Malaysia English and Chinese for everything. Also I do not understand why they are constantly changing gates for flights. Usually it's never the same gate as stated on your boarding pass so you better check the monitors. Especially for domestic flights it is very common.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Also seating facilities are very poor with mainly banks of seats provided. Fine if you like sitting bolt upright all the time but very uncomfortable if you want to lean back and relax a bit because the glass wall of the transit lounge is the only means of support available. There are a few chairs which allow you to stretch your legs a bit but only if you're less than 1.65 metres.

Facilities in the satelite terminal are great and there is a lot of shopping to be done. MAS Golden Lounge is good as well. Shopping is a bit cheaper than downtown KL since it's tax free. Sometimes there is some congestion at the gate area as security checks are done at each gate. Staff is usually friendly but you sometimes come across one or two souls who are having a bad day. Immigration officers are probably worldwide a special bunch of people and you never know what to expect. Usually in KL they are ok but give you the silent treatment. Customs is ok and once outside the KLIA Ekspress is the fastest way to KL. Train rides are comfortable quiet cheap and efficient. Once you arrive KL Sentral you can catch the subway to KLCC or other places. You can also check in at KL Sentral when you go back but currently they only offer it for MH CX and RB. Heard they are expanding it though. If you fly domestically things are not as brilliant as in the satelite terminal but still good.

Off loading of the aircraft is very quick and luggage appears rapidly. The only bottleneck is if you arrive internationally behind another international flight then immigration can take 45 minutes. There are many transport options once you have exited the terminal. Leaving the airport the check-in area is clean and large and quite quick. You then have a 200m walk to the gate and security area but this is down a main street that is filled with shops and eating places. I suggest you spend time here as there is very little at the gates. Once in the gate area there are free drinks and snacks smoking area toilets and the such like. Boarding is easy and efficient as the small trolley buses used to take you to the aircraft split the loading in to small groups.

To be fair the main terminal was far better than the low cost terminal as it was quieter and more spacious. The big lacking of this terminal was that the air conditioning did not seem to function properly causing the whole airport to be humid hot and uncomfortable. The departure hall was almost empty with very limited choices of shops and restaurants. My feeling was that this airport was simply under used and should definitely need more to- and-fro flights.

Airport workers here (check-in counters security immigration etc.) are generally fine but can be improved especially on the level of professionalism in their communication with passengers. The airport may look very new but there is a need to improve some facilities such as seating areas especially the terminal Air Asia uses at one end of the single terminal and the automated passport gates at the arrival hall. Cleanliness can be improved as well particularly on the toilets. Overall Kuching Airport is a good and hassle-free airport to use.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

kuwait-airport,/airport-reviews/kuwait-airport,Kuwait Airport customer review,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,2015-06-17,"I honestly have been to this airport far too many times considering that I have once lived here in Kuwait before (but this will be my first review on the airport). 1) Upon arrival, for some passengers, it is required of us to obtain a visa on arrival before heading to the immigration counter. I have noticed huge improvements with this service as they now photocopy your passport getting your passport stamped at the visa place (which did ease up the whole transaction). I did notice however that there was no information with regards to the price for the visa. Last time I came, I paid 5kd but my boyfriend (on an American passport) didn't pay for any. I actually had to Google up the actual cost and turns out its only 3kd. Anyway the whole visa process was easy thankfully. 2) It was not notified to us that those who already have their passport stamped at the visa application area can just walk through the immigration without going through the queue as you already have your passport stamped. 3) Coming back to this airport and heading out to Abu Dhabi almost gave me a heart attack. This airport has a weird way of organising their check in counters as they would group some airlines in one gate/area (e.g. Omanair, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways would be in the same check in area). Passengers are required to stand out the airport and look at the direction to figure out which gate/area they need to go to check in. Anyway, as I entered the airport, I noticed there was a long line at the luggage check going out to area I needed to get my boarding pass. I have already checked in online and all I needed to do was get my boarding pass. I didn't even have any luggage to scan as I flew in the same day as I am heading back out. My flight was due to leave in 1.5 hours and I noticed that all those that queued up were ones that were flying with Emirates. Thankfully, the security guy at the luggage check allowed me to jump the queue (scan just my handbag) and proceed to the counter. 4) There are hardly any shops in here. Both before and after immigration. I'm happy to see the new coffee shops area at the end of the terminal which is usually less crowded and more peaceful. Overall, it is an OK airport to be at for a short transit.

la-guardia-airport,/airport-reviews/la-guardia-airport,La Guardia Airport customer review,A Johnson,United States,2015-04-30,Just about the only thing LaGuardia has going for it is its proximity to Manhattan versus other NYC-area airports and even then you are at the mercy of traffic since there is no direct rail connection. I flew into and out of the Central Terminal Building (Terminal B) which I found to be cramped and dated. With construction going on a number of vehicles live-parking at curbside and no traffic control officers to speak of it took forever for my bus to make the loop of the airport to drop me off at Terminal B. Once inside there was not enough room for passengers to queue up at ticket counters in the landside area and the queues for the security checkpoints were spilling into the main terminal. Once past security your only food and beverage options were a coffee shop and two newsstands. Then once the flight boarded and pushed back we had to wait over an hour for our turn to take off - there were 20-25 planes ahead of us on a Friday late afternoon with otherwise good weather.

With its relatively small size and its frequent bus service I was in my Manhattan accommodation within 50 minutes of my plane touching down and that is after catching a bus and the subway. (The bus stop is literally just outside the door of baggage claim.) I did not find baggage claim to be any more chaotic than my last trip to McCarran-Las Vegas and I did not encounter any real facility uncleanliness either.

Absolutely limited space with insufficient seating let alone totally miserable number and variety of shops with limited things to buy yet with high prices. Even walking to the baggage claim without bumping into other people is a challenge. No free wifi and only a few power ports can't even be a major concern in this airport as so many other things are just miserable. Total chaos continues landside where signage is insufficient and no one seems welcoming. Public transportation limited and reliable systems like rail links non-existent. Bus services seem to be there but with no information posted anywhere. Departure also a total pain. Passed check-in as web check-in was already done but security check took 15 minutes even at 6am. Then on to the same concourse with appalling state of amenities for passengers. Apparently sleeping is the best thing to do in this airport but good luck finding a spot to do so.

I had to fly last minute and Delta my carrier of choice didn't have any JFK flights available so LGA was the only choice as EWR would be way too far. I arrived at Terminal D at 5AM and the lines on the check-in area were insane! I had already printed my boarding pass at home and had no check-in luggage so I wasn't worried. There were numerous self check-in kiosks and the queue to security was rather short. The agents were friendly and it took less than 5 mins. The gate area was rather cozy far better than DL's JFK Terminals. There were decent amount of shops and restaurants. I returned the same day with US at 8PM the US Terminal was far better. The departure gates looked more cozier and it was cleaner.

In place of Chili's another very popular and safe choice is some other very high end restaurant that again is overpriced. Forget dining for fun on the run and grabbing a reasonably priced burger chicken or salad. Now you have salmon and steak as your choices. That is the most screwed up decision I have ever seen in airport retail. Starbucks before security - gone. Starbucks after security - gone. In place is some other new coffee that will not attract all the same traffic other than the fact that it is the only coffee joint there. And finally there are so many bags of chips and grab and go items everywhere that it literally looks like a supermarket.

I have always been able to check in and clear security very quickly though there are often long queues on the tarmac for takeoff given the fact that the two runways cross meaning that departing aircraft need to wait for arriving planes to land. Airside there isn't much in the way of facilities to keep you busy while waiting for your flight. There are four separate unconnected terminals (many of which are further divided into piers) all of which have their own security controls. If you happen to connect through LGA (which is uncommon since it's primarily an arrival/departure airport) you will likely need to clear security and in some cases (e.g. mainline Delta to Delta Shuttle) have to take a bus to the entire other side of the airport.

My only issue was the delay in recovering my baggage due to confusion about which carousel it was on and even this was cleared up after a few minutes.

Not impressed by the new lounge not relaxing and not value for money. Escaping the airport onto a brand new Monarch aircraft was a relief! Returning to Leeds 5 days later was a complete farce! We departed a very busy Barcelona some 20 minutes ahead of both Jet2 and Ryanair landed at Leeds and parked on a remote stand. Instead of taking us to the terminal by bus they made us use the dual use walkway. We then got held before the terminal in the freezing cold (not weatherproof tunnel) for 15 minutes as a Jet2 Boeing 757 was boarded on stand 9. In this time we watched 3 further flights land and park at the terminal and begin to disembark ahead of us. Including the Jet2 and Ryanair we left waiting in Barcelona!

Reason: a flight was boarding and because of airport construction the two sets of passengers were not allowed to intermix. This is an international airport isn't it and do not passengers embark and arrive at roughly the same time? So eventually get into the terminal and up several sets of stairs which I noted were giving at least one elderly lady some discomfort.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,A Walker,United Kingdom,2012-05-16,This used to be a pleasant little airport. However in recent years it has been taken over by a company determined to squeeze every last penny out of customers. The drop-off area costs £2 simply to enter so many people simply take a chance and drop passengers off on the mini-roundabouts. There is no taxi rank so taxis bringing passengers to the airport cannot get a fare back to the city. The airport taxis are provided by Arrow cabs which are more expensive than local firms (for example £20 to my home instead of the local firm's fare of £10). If you live locally and are flying home take the number of a local cab firm with you and call them when you leave the plane. The taxi will be waiting for you when you exit the airport. Public transport is poor; there is no train service and the many flights arrive or leave outside the hours of the bus services. The terminal is cramped so it can be difficult for example to get through to the lavatories if you are carrying hand luggage. There are shops but the selection is not good and the cafes are crowded so you will not be served quickly. The only advantage of LBA is convenience if you live locally.

There's enough shops to keep you entertained for 10 minutes there's a cafe and you can watch the planes from the outdoor balcony - and there's not much else.

It seems that we arrived while officers were out to lunch. The wait took longer than we expected and we missed our flight. The following day we returned to the airport for our second attempt at departure. This time the non-EU citizen queue was empty with again one counter open. Once we walked up to the officer he informed us that he was not in service and proceeded to raise his voice in disgust when we told him that waiting hall signs were still directing non-EU citizens to his counter. After our stand-up scolding we followed his directions to the EU citizen line just in time to be chided by the new officer for coming to the wrong line.

This is by far the worst airport that we encountered during the last 20 years or regular flying. Long distances have to be traveled by foot between arrival and departure gates.

We experienced that 2 times out of 2. Another thing is that after arrival from USA (so still in the safe zone) a security check still has to be made where (in our case) a simple and small fishing rod of one of our kids which we were allowed to take as cabin luggage from USA to Lisbon was considered to be dangerous! Checking it in as cargo for Euro 55 - was the only option.

The only down side was walking down to Gate 4. I found this to a bit on the scruffy side with carpets that were in need of a good clean and bringing up to the standards of the rest of the airport.

liverpool-airport,/airport-reviews/liverpool-airport,Liverpool Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2012-11-01,"As a regular user of LPL I haven't suffered any of the extreme experiences reported by some contributors. For me an airport's principal purpose is to facilitate my departure / arrival as painlessly as possible and LPL has largely done so each time I have used it this year. I have no problems with walking from the car park (instead of having to wait for a transfer bus as at some airports) and travelling hand luggage only have rarely spent more than half an hour getting from car park through to departure lounge. Passage through security has always been swift - but my wife and I are usually flying out first thing in the morning - and we have never encountered any lack of politeness perhaps because a smile and a ""Good morning"" from us creates a favourable ambience. Even when we had an item confiscated last week (a jar of jam - don't ask!) it was done in a perfectly pleasant way and demonstrated that the security staff were vigilant. I would agree that the carpeting throughout the terminal looks dowdy but I think that is due to an unfortunate choice of pattern / colour rather than actual dirtiness. Returning through LPL isn't the most exciting experience in the world especially if two flights arrive almost simultaneously but I have queued far longer at passport control in Spanish airports and had longer walks from plane to exit. As long as LPL continues to meet my requirements as a relatively efficient departure or arrival point I shall be content to use it.",NA,NA,NA,8,5,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I was checked in and had dropped my bag within 5 minutes of walking into the airport and that included the time it took me transfer some items from my checked baggage which was overweight to my hand baggage suggested by the check in agent (EZY). Security took me maybe 10 minutes and the people were pleasant. I also noticed them helping a man who was partly crippled with great kindness and courtesy. I had a very good breakfast at £12.50 but worth the extra for freshly prepared food proper waitress service and much better than awful self service ones where you get bacon that was cooked hours before and eggs swimming in grease.

Having read all of the reviews I can pretty much agree with all of the negative comments. The security staff are generally quite rude and always seem to be standing about not doing much. Even when the airport is quiet there still seems to be queues for security and if my bag goes down the separate channel for inspection it usually takes over 5 minutes before somebody comes over and takes the bag for a check. The departures lounge looks tired and even with the new restaurant and shops it is still not that great. One of the biggest benefits was the season ticket parking which was available. It was a good price and in my opinion value for money. No surprise then that this has now been stopped and I have to go through the tedious booking of car parking every week when I use the airport. From January I will be using Manchester Airport.

Security is on the first floor and departure gates on the ground floor so it's up to security from the departures hall and down again to the gates. Could be better. On time boarding. Returning the same evening at around 9 pm we used a bus for the transfer from a/c to terminal which means upon entering the terminal building you need to climb a flight of stairs then walk a substantial distance before having to walk down a flight of stairs to the ground floor again (i.e. the same level you had originally entered the building - not very smart).

On each occasion passage through Security has been swift and painless with staff efficient and polite even when one of us has been selected for extra scrutiny. Retail and food outlets do not interest us so we sit at the easyJet end of the building until our flight is called. I would agree however with some of the comments posted about the hold-ups to pass through passport control on returning to the UK - the immigration area is small and quickly becomes congested when 2 flights arrive in quick succession. It is particularly bad when one queue coming down the stairs has to merge with another queue entering at ground level. On our most recent transit earlier this week the situation was not helped by the fact that only 5 of the 9 desks were manned.

However they still encourage customers to cough up a few quid in order to skip a few places in the line. While security does need to be taken seriously I found it a a bit much to be given an extended and thorough pat down when the gate didn't even ping. Following the return landing though within 'spitting' distance of immigration passengers were loaded onto buses taken about 50 yards to a (wrong) door then presumably as a result of driver error transported around the block to another entrance marked 'international arrivals'. Here we all got soaked as passengers shuffled up the stairs along the long corridors and then got stuck in an enormous queue for passport control. And guess what they must love forcing people to balance their bodies and luggage on staircases because it's back down steps once more to immigration.

I can only agree with most of them. When I passed through the airport was not so busy (31st December) and still security was slow and inefficient. The most unimpressive factor were the pay machines in several places for ""Fast Track"" security. There were machines before you go through security as you go in to the hall and just before the lines in case when you arrive you are horrified by the queues and can then pay the extra UK Stg 3 for the fast line. I think that extra optional charge for security is shocking. In my opinion that just encourages inefficiency in the main queue so they can make more money.

Following recent surgery my wife temporarily needed wheelchair assistance and we could not fault the service provided. It was even thanks to LPL's e-mail passenger service system that I finally discovered how to contact easyJet to add a request for special assistance. We were directed to the PRM (Passengers of Reduced Mobility) desk when we arrived checked in there and were issued with a wheelchair and then allowed to make our own way through security to the gate. Security was very quiet but in any case we were directed straight to the nearest desk where everyone was very attentive and helpful. There were even apologies for the need to ""frisk"" my wife. We had to have a convoy system for boarding as there were 7 wheelchair passengers for the flight the other 6 of whom required the ""ambulift"" while my wife was able to climb the aircraft steps alone and at her own speed. The whole procedure went so smoothly that the flight actually was able to leave early. Our return was equally well handled: since an ambulift appeared at the side of the plane and there were only 2 PRM passengers this time it seemed churlish to turn it down so we were transported directly to passport control and bypassed the queues in the chicane.

However that is where the good part ends! In most airports including the South Terminal there is a separate queue for flyers who have speedy boarding priority boarding or the like but not at the gate(50) for this flight. The gate staff just made everyone queue in one line regardless if you had paid extra for speedy boarding or not. I thought I was at a different airport than the one I had dropped my bags off at it felt like the gate staff just could not grasp the concept of speedy boarding.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

LGW-PSA 10/4/14 PSA-LGW 13/4/14 LGW-UVF 25/5/14 UVF-LGW 02/06/14. My experiences at London Gatwick are positive. Departing: I was last there in 2011 and it has improved. All times on departing we arrived 3hours 30mins before The queues at South Terminal have been extremely short (All times we used south) including Bag drop (UVF only time we did have hold luggage) which took 5mins security which took 10mins at the most. The shopping is great with a large walk through world duty free then an open departure lounge (Stansted is terrible with a small alleyway with all the shops in it (20 or so)). Boarding is allocated between 90mins and 45mins but clearly tell you when (Stansted you have to figure out what time and if it's delayed i.e. Boarding in 129mins). The gates are 15min walk at the most so it was fine there was a lot of seating and boarding was boarding not get in queue. (Stansted you have to queue up for 30mins before walking on to tarmac). Arriving: The immigration queues are quick which is good as after sometimes a 10hour overnight with no sleep you want to get home. There are several e-passport checks as well. It took 10mins to queue both times arriving and the baggage was out quickly. Overall: My favourite London airport with sort queues open spaces and good boarding process and of course a good image for foreigners making their first trip arriving in London.,NA,NA,NA,9,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Both of terminals are in good condition and under the new ownership is being improved very fast and effectively. Check In and Security is fast most of the time. There seems to be more shops and better restaurants in the North Terminal which is bigger but the South is becoming just as good. One thing is that gates do take a good amount of time to come on screen but they are never far away. Boarding is always doing using a Jetway. On arrival deboarding is speedy and takes you straight to immigration. The wait generally is no longer than 10 mins and with the new e booths it is getting quicker. Baggage reclaim can take some time but where doesn't really? Not to mention the cleanliness it is very impressive!

Puts one in mind of the Grand Old Duke of York. I guess it's a marketing ploy that leads you THROUGH the duty-free shop on reaching airside - doesn't work with me.

Check-in was straightforward and the North terminal wasn't crowded at all. There was ample space and it was very clean! Its also well sign-posted - I had to use the shuttle to get from the South to the North terminal and I haven't used Gatwick in a long time so was a little anxious about where everything was but turns out everything was dead simple to find! Security was security and staff weren't that friendly but I wasn't there for more than 5 minutes so no worries there. Departure lounge is a little disappointing as it didn't have as many shops and restaurants as I had anticipated but as an airport that offers mainly European routes you can't really expect it to be like Heathrow. Though saying that I think they are planning on adding more shops and restaurants. Departure gate took forever to appear on screen but once it was there it was a fairly short walk to it from the departure lounge and then after 10 mins at gate we were told to board the plane which was brilliant as I wanted to just sit back and relax. On the way back to Gatwick - passport queues were horrendous but they were moving steadily rather than being a complete stand still so was through in about half an hour.

Similarly on the way back no long delays at passport control at 23.30 if you have a chipped passport. Still a few things that could be done to improve things. Firstly a few more toilets after you get off the plane before getting to passport control. Secondly I like the fact they now give an estimate of when the earliest bags will arrive and last bag arrival based on average past experience. Just over 50% of time bags first appear 20 mins after the plane arrives on stand but you are still waiting in a crowded area with no chairs. Thirdly late at night most of the shops are closed and I needed a bite to eat and a drink. But the major problem is with the short term car parks they look identical and although the ticket says write the floor number and row it does not say which car part (5 or 6?).

The signs as you approach the two doors to enter the hall are very confusing the left door has an arrow above for passport control whilst the right door has an arrow above for connecting flights. However both simply lead in to the same hall where the queuing system is very poorly managed with EU and non-EU passport holders getting mixed up. There appeared to be just 2 staff valiantly trying to help control the flow of many hundreds of passengers but with little success.

In the departure lounge is a sign saying all gates are no more than 10 minutes away - well this is absolute nonsense I am a fast walker and my gate took a good 20 minutes to reach! You have to go up a massive escalator along a lengthy walkway and then down again. If you were delayed en route to the airport you could easily miss a flight due to this.

As others have commented there has been a vast improvement and there are still some changes to be fully implemented. Parked in the short term car park which is still relatively expensive. BAA use to offer a reduced price at weekends from Friday to Sunday and I would like to see that re-introduced. The signs when entering the airport area particularly the filter to the right leading to the car park could be improved as well as signs to the number of entrances to the car park building itself. Easy walk to the terminal buildings which makes a good first impression from the outside. A short walk inside still looks a bit scruffy and then one needs to re-orientate oneself for check-ins or security etc. Security excellent both in time and friendliness and professionalism of the staff except they may need someone or a machine to stack the trays after they have gone through the x-ray machine as passengers are not doing it. The waiting area is still a bit crowded good choice of shops and places to eat on two levels not all of them high end but more high street just needs a Tesco Express or Sainsbury's. Television monitors well placed for information about flights. Long and strange walk to use the toilets. I am not sure if that is temporary while other building work is being carried out or going to be a permanent placement. Longish walk to the aircraft but not untypical of large airports nice views out over the airport and some electric walkways good lighting and flooring. On the way back minimal wait for passport control and staff at the border also friendly and professional. A vast improvement on what was there before I hope they maintain these standards and that when work is finished on the terminal it will be even more impressive.

The road layout on the exit to do this is poor and potentially dangerous. Baggage drop was a complete disgrace. The word 'drop' doesn't match a 35 minute wait and the queue was as long as the regular check-in. A member of staff with an inadequate unclear non-standard accent called for flight destinations and passengers arriving late were then bumped ahead of those who had been there before the 2 hours recommended. Passengers checked with each other which destinations had been called.

Getting around is a confusing mishmash of walkways corridors escalators and busses. Signage is clear but the airport is nevertheless extremely difficult to navigate efficiently. I have never seen so many people racing through a terminal apparently trying to navigate the complicated layout numerous times to find where they should be. I am fortunate to usually travel business class so I can avoid the cavernous dirty hot noisy and smelly main waiting areas in favor of a private airline lounge. The terminals seem to be organized to generate sales at the stores and restaurants and not for passenger comfort or convenience. Immigration lines are very long and extremely slow which seems to be a problem at airports everywhere. For anyone changing to a domestic flight I would recommend at least 3 hours transit time. Several times baggage claim has been a single carousel serving many flights crowded with hundreds of people. The ensuing chaos makes for understandably frayed nerves and short tempers.

Despite being able to check-in at any desk one is left to queue at each desk individually; if a problem arises with a passenger in front then you are stuck waiting for that check-in agent whilst other passengers on surrounding desks move to the front. Despite some reviews I have always found the security process through to the departures lounge to be very quick and professional. On my latest trip I waited around 30 seconds. You can tell that the airport authority has invested a lot of money on the screening equipment used. I don't know whether some passengers aren't used to stringent security but I feel reassured and have never encountered a rude member of security staff. In fact I've found them to be both approachable and friendly. Terminal 5 is a giant shopping mall it has to be said - and an expensive one at that. But the fantastic panoramic views and beautiful sunlight coming through the expansive windows is enough to compensate for the commercialism. There's a good choice of bars and eateries. Unlike some other terminals at Heathrow you don't have to walk nearly as far to get to your gate but be warned - If you are travelling from gates marked 'B' or 'C' then you have to get an underground shuttle train to a satellite terminal and this can take 15 minutes. On arrival back to the UK I was through immigration in a couple of minutes and had my luggage a few minutes after that. Back in the arrivals hall and then onto the Heathrow Express - an (incredibly) expensive but convenient way to get from airport to city in less than half an hour.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,J Marshall,United Kingdom,2014-03-28,I was very annoyed with the immigration controls this morning when arriving from Sydney via Singapore on a BA flight that arrived at 4.45 am. When we arrived at passport control there was not one single person to speak to. Many passengers were getting connecting flights and looked so confused. They were just left to read the electronic boards. Surely someone should have been on duty to help these passengers. Then as we approached the Passport control area several big flights had obviously come in at the same time but as we had electronic passports we thought we would be okay and would get through quickly. Wrong! UK and EU citizens were all herded into one area and it was not clear that the EPassport area was not available but we did finally see a small A4 sheet of paper which said that the epassport scanners were not operational until 5.30 am. It was 5.20 am so decided to stay in the long queue although some people started queuing for the epassport section. There were two female attendants to the right of this area and when I approached them to ask if I could go through with my epassport I was told quite sternly that I should join the large queue to my left. Then another official came on the scene and looked confused at the large queues and then proceeded to check the scanners and eventually invited people to use the escanners. However these did not appear to work properly because they were not giving any messages out. When one guy removed his passport because it didn't seem to be working the gates opened. This happened to a couple of people. Another member of staff joined the one guy on duty but they did not seem capable of helping people. I stood for ages with my passport in the scanner and eventually tried another one which eventually worked. My husband said that maybe the scanners need to warm up but surely the staff should know this and be on hand to help and advise. What an awful welcome for overseas visitors I was embarrassed because Terminal 5 is a super terminal but the staff need to be more helpful and welcoming to visitors. I flew through Sydney New Zealand Honk Kong and Singapore Airports and Heathrow was not up to the standard of these other airports which quite frankly is a disgrace and someone should be doing something about it.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

There is a physical sign that states gates 77-80 I asked where gate 76 was and rudely told - around the corner by three people. When I said there is no sign for anything lower than gate 77 I received a who cares stare. I don't utilize terminal 1 99% of the time it is terminal 3.

As on previous occasions at T1 I found the security staff to be officious slow and apparently unconcerned about people missing their flights.

Many bags were being lined up for a hand inspection with only one person checking them. Most bags had nothing in them to be removed. I was in a crowd of people waiting for my bag for 25 mins! While one lady slowly checked one thing at a time. Laughing and talking to her colleagues. There was no urgency despite the fact that I said my flight was boarding in 10 mins. I was bomb checked twice because they had nothing better to do. My bag was in a line of about 12-15 bags just sitting there while I waited. 7 people had to have suitcases offloaded from our flight too which delayed us.

The person on the security scanner was taking an age to check the bags as he was asking a colleague about almost every bag. The system seems to have a weak spot as two bag check lines feed into one body scanner so if a person sets off the alarm which happened frequently everyone of the same gender has to wait until that person is frisked.

Rather than do the sensible thing (as is done at other airports) and ask me if I had any liquids they decide to remove my bag after screening and have me standing around waiting for more than 30 minutes. All that was needed was to have me identify the bottle of water remove and re-screen which would have taken 2 minutes. Instead they want to empty every item from the bag.

This terminal is awful. The food is all terribly expensive. The shops are so expensive that no one actually purchases anything from them. The two stores that passengers were buying anything at all are Boots and WH Smith because they have the least expensive items in all of the airport. Security is completely out of hand. Security is overwhelmed due to the number of passengers that travel through this airport. It is my thought that Security has a policy of confiscating items for twofold reasons you're tired and don't want to even bother questioning and that they want you to go purchase the item from one of the stores in the airport.

Perhaps being here early on a Saturday morning helped but I was pleasantly surprised after expecting the worst. I went from the gate at T5 to my seat in the lounge at T3 in just over 30 minutes; not bad at all for an airport this size. My one complaint is the lack of information on how to transfer to a non-BA airline. All you see are signs that indicate connections within T5 and for connections through ""all other terminals"". If you don't happen to know which terminal your airline flies out of this can be confusing. On the plus side staff were quite helpful in checking to make sure you were headed to the right line.",NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

We arrived at the gate with only 10 or 15 minutes to spare - no time to visit the BA lounge - there isn't one in the ""C"" section anyway.

A really quick passage through, only stymied by waiting for our baggage for more than 20 mins. Some you win, some you lose. On my return, I was taking my first 'domestic' flight to Edinburgh. Once upon a time, domestic flights had a different part of the airport, and no security, but those days are gone. I was processed quickly and efficiently by security although the area was very busy. Having a lot of time before my flight I decided to investigate the shops, but wasn't tempted. There is a considerable choice of dining options and with a long wait ahead I enjoyed my meal at Giraffe. Once my gate was called, I had a new experience but not one that I'd care to repeat often. My flight was called to Gate 84, via a tunnel with streams of passengers walking in both directions with no separation of inbound and outbound passengers. Once in the gate area, there were no separations of the four flights due to depart - two to Edinburgh, one to Glasgow and one to Belfast. It was quite disconcerting to see people openly drinking from beer bottles and as there were no separation markers, it was very hard to find out where to queue (especially the difference between 'speedy' boarding and 'other' boarding in the case of my Easyjet flight). Passengers inbound from these aircraft simply walked up to the area where we were waiting and had to push their way through the throng of waiting passengers to get into the tunnel and back to the terminal.

The exit to the Ryanair 'wing' has been moved and the passageway along the windows has been narrowed and access to the toilets removed. This makes for considerable congestion - including a few brave souls returning to the terminal against the flow, and the narrowing seems to be also in force in the 'underground' corridor between the departures lounge and the steps/escalator to the Ryanair 'wing', which made some of the older people around me panic that they might miss their flight. The airport was extremely busy and the only new, but major, criticism I have was the queue at the Ryanair desk at the start of the Ryanair 'wing' which stretched back into the corridor and the escalator/steps area due to handling passengers whose flight had been cancelled. This made it very congested for passengers arriving at the 'wing' for their gates. It might be helpful if the queue for passengers needing attention from the desk be separated by ropes so that the flow of passengers into the terminal could be better controlled as there is a potential danger of 'overcrowding' in such a small, enclosed area.",Arrival and Departure,06-07-2015,Solo Leisure,7,3,3,3,NA,3,3,NA,NA,0

This airport is in a clear sorry state I generally enjoy flying and don't mind Airports for the most part but the experience here was utterly joyless. Firstly the Terminal as you walk in it is dark dingy and cramped with poor signage - not very clear where particular check-in desks are located. Then there is the zoo that is security I've been to third-world countries where security has been managed better - it was chaotic with enormous snaking queues which barely any staff controlling the masses of people going through security or to give any assistance. If you were running late you would have been stuck and most likely miss your flight. Once through security airside is no better again dark dingy and cramped with barely any natural light entering the building. Surprisingly there were some nice food outlets like a Leon but the environment is so poor and devoid of any joy you wouldn't want to linger here for long. At the Gate it is even worse decrepit waiting area with gates cramped next to each other and only a common seating area to wait for multiple gates which was obviously not enough room for the 3 flights taking off at the same time. This Airport clearly needs some serious investment - it hasn't got any hope of competing with the likes of Gatwick and Heathrow and is already at a disadvantage because of its location I would have thought some effort would have been made to actually encourage more passengers. I'm sorry to say but this is the first time an Airport has actually put me off from flying - it is unacceptable in this country to have third-world like airport especially when it is supposed to be serving what is the capital of the world.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,M Horsfield,United Kingdom,2015-03-24,Once again had the misfortune of the Stansted experience last week. I do not use this airport anymore but my schedule required I had to do so but nothing has improved. It really is the pits. As you enter the airport you have to weave through passengers now making their way to the new location of the security area. To be fair this was reasonably quick once we had walked about 50 metres back and forward through the ever wonderful queuing pens. You are then forced to wander through a shopping mall and into an unmade bottleneck to emerge into a building site. There are not enough seats and Stansted's owners then believe that by not telling you of your gate number you will utilise the retail opportunities. Really? Once you get your gate number and catch the silly little train you find a quiet gate lounge with plenty of seats and an air of calm compared to the dump at the main terminal. Returning into the border control is farcical. The automated gates take longer than the ordinary gates so don't bother to use them. And guess what? Despite the queues 5 of the automated gates were locked out of use. If you managed to get through with a single swipe of the passport you were lucky and many people were not. There was one helpless officer on the other side dashing back and forth telling people to simply try again. It really is pitiful. There is plenty of room to extend this area and add more machines (in return for the APD paid) but they have not done so as it would mean moving a large area reserved for unused luggage trolleys. Most flights are low cost meaning that people do not need luggage trolleys - they just want to get through the airport quickly and stress free.

On arrival we had to remain on the aircraft for quite some time due apparently to a complete power failure. On the return journey the airport resembled a refugee camp!Walking was almost impossible and sitting down let alone trying to find a place to eat impossible. Once on the Ryanair flight to Limoges we were told that there was a choice of hot and cold snacks but that we had better put in our orders quickly as they did not have much food aboard. What kind of ridiculous statement was that considering we were all belted into our seats and in our case half way up the cabin? Cabin crew were still serving what food they had when the pilot announced for all cabin crew to take their seats for landing! Hopefully I shall never have to use either Ryanair or Stansted again and I for one shall certainly try to avoid this total displeasure!,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,A Pease,France,2014-11-20,Having seen the construction of the 'new' single terminal Stansted Airport and having used it extensively over the last 25 years my latest experience (inbound 7 November outbound 11 November) showed positive changes in the speed of flow through Border Control and outgoing security (which although I could have been 'lucky' in my arrival and departure times cannot be anything but a good thing) but I was horrified by the World DutyFree shopping area which dominates the start of the airside facilities. No daylight lowered ceilings and nowhere to go but to wind my way through hell and heavy sales pitches all too similar to what I hate about Manchester airport. The redevelopment airside is all to do with commercial opportunity and this coupled with the lack of seating and natural daylight really drags this airport down. It's almost a pleasure to reach the relatively spartan wing of the terminal given over to Ryanair's flights and even then today I found myself for the first time going down what used to be the domestic arm of the terminal building which was even less appealing on the eye but far more suited to air travel rather than high-end shopping. It is disappointing to see so few if any domestic flights and the whole airport seems to be losing its function putting commercial activities ahead of a short walk from the street to the gate which was one of the USPs of the initial design. I would recommend the airport for its proximity to London the wide range of destinations it serves and for good ground transport links but regret that I no longer feel that I could recommend it as an airport because it seems to be principally an upmarket shopping experience with a flight thrown in.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

She gave us another one and she just put it in the tray without sealing it. Departure lounge. It was OK. Walk through parade of duty free shops is not good as people go back and forward causes congestion. There are shops and the departure boards are OK a countdown system till the say go to gate.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,M Horsfield,United Kingdom,2014-07-06,"I refuse to use Stansted Airport since MAG has taken it over and are systematically ruining it. Lord Foster who designed it designed it be a straight through airport so you walk in one direction through the terminal. Now as you enter the airport you are confronted by a wave of passengers traversing the terminal to the security areas at the southern end of the airport. This area is like something out of Communist era with about as much charm and efficiency to match. And for what? So that more retail outlets can be built that nobody wants. When will Uk airports learn that what passengers want and need is to get through them easily and efficiently. We do not go to airports to shop we go to them to travel and I take great offence at being forced through retail areas directly after security. I also take huge offence at being asked to present my boarding card if I wish to buy a newspaper or a packet of mints. Is it any wonder that there are queues and delays with this unnecessary nonsense. I always refuse. Arriving into Stansted is a lottery with its pathetic Border Control area. In the half hour or so you stand and queue you can amuse yourself by watching the Border Control officers looking down on the queues and the unmanned gates and think ""why don't you do something useful and come and open an additional gate rather than looking at your clipboard?""

On the return flights the main problem is at passport control where there can be a lot of people particularly if several flights arrive at about the same time.

Then a train takes you to one of the remote terminals. We did this process twice since we missed our first flight. The strange thing is once you take the train out to the terminal there is no way back. We had to call our airline and have a representative come out and escort us back to the main terminal. I'm sure that the design is good for security and crowd control but someone hasn't thought through all possible scenarios. The second time we went through the process the remote terminal was freezing cold and dingy.

Yesterday evening it took 1hr.25 mins. to get from leaving the plane to leaving the car park. I now am convinced that the staff are part of the anti-expansion campaign and really want to prove that there is no capacity to enlarge this airport. Passengers arriving from Madeira yesterday were unable to board the first shuttle which was full.

Book in advance online and the roundtrip from the terminal to Victoria Station or Baker Street only costs about £10. The journey takes an hour and if you're delayed/early the team at the desk will transfer your ticket onto the first available bus. Miles cheaper than the Stansted Express and a much better drop-off.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,R Hopkins,NA,2008-08-01,What can be said that hasn’t already been said? There’s always a worrying wait for the car park bus then a long journey. If you’ve not done it yet allow 40 minutes in case you’ve just missed a bus. Exit signs out of the car-park are inadequate even when it’s an airport you know. Outbound journey was delayed on 29.07 so there was a gate change and inevitable rush to join the new queue not popular with ‘first come first board’ airline passengers. The return journey was also delayed resulting in a half hour wait on the tarmac. If the passengers knew what time the rescheduled landing was it’s a bit worrying that Stansted didn’t and so did not have ground staff available. What if there had been an emergency? It can be no surprise to the airport authorities to find a plane has landed. Just hope it’s not two at once that are late which given that the delays were attributed to air traffic control seems pretty likely. Passport control is an utter insult with a scrum to join the queues while non EU citizens get through with little delay. There are no toilets in the area which is also a disgrace after delays. Avoid the toilets in the baggage area! The ladies’ toilet stank of urine and the cubicles are tiny even for a fairly small adult. Once through passport control without luggage it’s a matter of luck how long it takes to get to your car. Last night (31.7.08) it was a fairly typical one and quarter hours from landing to car longer than it took to drive the 60 miles home. Stansted expand?

Once in Terminal 5 it took another round of searching for an info desk (with our flight departure time getting ever closer) to eventually find one tucked away in a corner. The patronising attendant told us that we needed the Tom Bradley Terminal which was two terminals along and waved in the vague direction of a corridor which led who knows where. The corridor eventually led outside where we would have hoped to find a map or some form of signage to the terminal. Nothing of the kind could be seen. We ended up asking a shuttle bus attendant for directions after which we walked for 10 minutes to eventually find the right place.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,N Raven,Canada,2013-10-22,An atrocious place to transfer between international flights. Also dingy understaffed and too small for the volume of passengers moving through. City and/or state and/or national authorities should be embarrassed by this place which is the first glimpse of many visitors. I understand that American airports have no concept of passengers in transit but LAX makes transferring especially tedious. On my last trip my 747 from Australia dumped its load into a Border Security hall that had only 6 agents working and which looked like the basement of a community centre. It took me 45 minutes to get through. Half the people in the line were panicking due to tight connections. After getting through the border (after which I was just going to be getting on a flight to another country anyway) I had to retrieve my bag go through another passport and bag check and then recheck the bag with United personnel who were behaving as if this was the first time they had done this. Next I had to find out where my next flight departed from. This was very difficult because the departure board in each terminal only shows the flights that depart from that terminal. So I had to ask an off-duty employee to point me in the general direction - which turned out to be the terminal farthest from my current location of course. Next I had to find my way with bags in tow from Terminal 7 to Terminal 2 (even though both airlines were Star Alliance partners). To make this journey one has three options: take a shuttle bus that circulates between the terminals walk the long long way around the horseshoe-shaped road or cut across the horseshoe on foot. Mindful of my short connection time I chose the latter. But the airport does not make it easy. Traffic is heavy there are no guiding signs and crosswalks are few. But I made it. Then I went through security all over again. Having started out with a 3-hour layover I made it to the gate 30 minutes before boarding. Well done LAX.

The baggage claim area is a confusing dated loud disaster of a space with poor signs. Traffic on the arrivals level is wilting and at least Avis Rental car busses took a great deal of time to arrive and also get through the madness. Rental car facilities are all off sight and Avis treated it's customers to a two hour wait in line to rent already confirmed cars.

Maybe DFW offers a more comfortable mode of making your connection with its Skylink tram system. However I made a similar connection at LAX by taking a 5 minute walk outside between Terminal 4 and the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Sure I had to re-enter the secure area but 9 out of 10 times you have time built into your itinerary to spend elsewhere (area hotel restaurant etc) when connecting domestic with international and vice versa at LAX. As for TSA lines Los Angeles' moved faster and had more lane options. The clincher in this day and age of flying with the latest and greatest of technology I prefer the quiet comfort of the Airbus A380 over the older Boeing 747. The Airbus flies into LAX but not into DFW until they fork out the money for a serious terminal upgrade. Until then I won't even consider Dallas unless my back is to the wall and I have no other option.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Landing at LA for refueling required all transit passengers to have an ESTA and to pass through immigration even though we were not willingly in the US and were leaving in two hours time. What a chaotic and unnecessary procedure! Upon disembarking “continuing the same flight” transit passengers were separated from other passengers and given an “Orange card” some were herded directly into a large secure lounge with an adjacent smaller lounge with refreshments (coke coffee crisps) others at random were directed to the only staffed immigration desk (one of two) for processing in the usual way (fingerprints photographs and strange questions). Then an announcement was made that all those who had not been processed had to go down to the main immigration processing centre – although we are not American Citizens we were made American Citizens for the afternoon because their line was shorter and then we were processed and stamped. At the desk we were asked “what was the purpose of our visit today” even though we had handed in an “orange I am in transit” card and a transit boarding card. Appropriately stamped and approved to be in transit we were then sent to a secure lift (a member of staff who knew code numbers was required to operate it) and escorted back to the lounge where we started out from (and where our names were crossed off a list of transit passengers who had been approved to be in transit) and we mixed again with those who had or who had not yet been processed.

It's one of the worst airports in the world! Having arrived in afternoon peak-hour our flight was sent to one of the many remote gates at LAX requiring us to be bussed to the arrivals hall. Waiting for immigration clearance at LAX is a frustrating experience with several lines of about 100 people each being serviced by one or two immigration officials. After a 100-minute wait (seriously!) the lad who processed my arrival didn't know how to use the software properly and had to ask for assistance from a colleague which delayed the process even further. Once the passenger has actually had their passport stamped they enter the Soviet-era baggage-claim and commence their epic voyage to their connecting flight.

There was a line for the baggage drop but it moved quickly. Security was fast and efficient. Officers on duty where not rude as you expect them to be at LAX which was a nice surprise. Facilities at T5 are not very exciting with a McDonald California Pizza Kitchen take away and one or two small shops. Since it was breakfast time I opted for McDonald as you don't get anything on Delta domestic. The terminal had some natural light and did not feel dark or dingy. Arrived back at T5 at night and the terminal did not have many flights arriving. However it took around 40 minutes to get the bags which was extremely annoying. Also there was no ground staff available when a big suit case blocked the other bags to come out. Luckily a passenger took care of this which earned him a round of applause. The signage once you are outside is pretty clear where you have to wait for which shuttle. Next day left through TBIT to Heathrow and found the facilities have improved since my last visit to TBIT. They have done a face lift and are still working on it. Security took a while though and there is nothing actually after security. So eat and do your duty free shopping before security.

Since AA only has two international flights a day from LAX (to NRT and LHR) the facilities were pretty straightforward and easy to use. However when we arrived there were only three people at immigration (2 for foreigners and 1 for US citizens) so I was glad that I ran from the plane to immigration as people who came out last had to queue quite a while to get through. I waited for approx 15 minutes but the immigration officer was pretty friendly and efficient. After immigration my luggage was waiting and I could go through customs where again only two officers were handling almost 300 pax. All in all I was at my car rental in 45minutes after touch-down which was not bad. When I departed the check-in hall was quite busy and AA has implemented the self service check-in everywhere so you could see many pax who were confused and needed help by the grumpy ground staff. TSA was quite quick and so was security. There is no immigration if you leave from T4 on an international flight and you just hand your departure card to the ground staff at the gate. Facilities are so so at T4 and consists of a few shops selling magazines etc and two mexican restaurants. Since it was before Christmas the terminal was quite full and it seemed every flight that day was overbooked. Restrooms were ok but I have seen better and cleaner ones at other airports.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,J House,United Kingdom,2013-12-16,Another horrendous visit to Luton Airport. Despite vowing I would never go there again I did. Having arrived 1 hr and 15 mins prior to my flight (and at 0600hrs) the queue through security was evidently going to take too long forcing me to pay for a priority pass. Whilst going through I was then told the plastic bag which my liquids were in was too big. When I asked why every other airport I have travelled through (10-15) accepts them I was given no explanation. It was re stated that I need to spend money buying their bags. When through in departures it is even more evident that the capacity is simply not enough the number of passengers. Despite being very early every shop cafe and seating area was overwhelmed. More queues for any of the places to eat and numerous people sitting in corridors due to the lack of seating. Luton Airport management need to look at other small airports Southampton Edinburgh etc who can get the service right. I will not use this airport again.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,B Jones,United Kingdom,2013-11-27,I have the dubious 'pleasure' of having to fly from this airport twice a week just getting dropped off is an issue! The airport appear to have fences along the roadsides on a two mile radius around the airport forcing you into a minimum Â£2 drop off area. If you want to park longer take out a mortgage and don't expect a car park - imagine pouring tarmac onto a ploughed field and you get a feel for where you will leave your car. The staff in security are unbelievably rude which is a shame as you will spend so long in there by the time you get out they will feel like family to you the queues are huge and generally only two lanes are open of which one I believe is mainly for gruff and grumpy staff to use. OK arriving if you are lucky enough to be at the gate near arrivals I envy you the rest of us have to wait 10 minutes for a bus as our arrival always appears to take the ground crew by surprise I mean its a big orange aircraft what's not to miss?

However what worries me is that this situation has been going on for at least 5 years without any signs of improvement. Passengers should simply vote with their feet as in my opinion this is the only way the management in this so-called airport will do something about it.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,C Clark,United Kingdom,2012-09-12,I have to travel through Luton airport twice a week and have done for 8 years. There is never seating room in the check in area. There is a rip-off fee for 'Priority' security a distance of some 10 metres and a possible time saving of 15 minutes another rip-off scam based on the exact size and the type of fastening of clear plastic bags required for liquids. In the past year there has been a distinct improvement in the politeness and care of the security search staff but you can still be bawled at or humiliated in front of other passengers. The amount of seating in the airport 'lounge' has been reduced (area taken over by Pret a Manger and other cafés). After boarding clearance has begun the holding areas are cramped and are often simply stark staircases. On return I have found the automatic passport gates (installed at enormous cost to the tax-payer) open just 7 times out of the hundreds (see above) of times I have travelled whilst staff actually manually checking passports are always too few while colleagues stand idly by.

Staff are aggressive and moody gum chewing security personnel seem to be in abundance but its still painfully slow also usually chaotic and overcrowded. Now the new overflow security channels are open which issue forth to the old terminal area - so if you want to use the facilities in the main terminal its a 10 minute walk and don't even think about buying the fast track ticket for security (which went up 25% from £3 to £4 last week) as you will be turned away if they are sending you to the overflow security channels.

However at a quiet time it worked which is all the evidence needed that the airport has over-expanded and should not be allowed to expand further.

It took 20 minutes from parking our car in the long stay car park to walking into the terminal queues at non-fast track security were very short and we were through in a few minutes. Actually getting onto the plane was the usual scramble and it was disappointing to see the ground staff at the gate responsible for shepherding us onto the plane deliberately and obviously ignore the requests of a mother whose arms were full of children buggies and bags for help in getting onto the plane.

Excellent check-in facilities and short walks to gates. No lines to speak of when checking in or at security. The only annoying aspect is the 30 minute limit on free parking close to the terminal - everyone uses it to pick up arriving pax so why not make it 45 minutes or a very basic charge of say EUR 5 for one hour. 30 minutes is too short and there are no display signs in the car park or on the ground floor to tell you the flight is delayed.

So you could walk out of the airport to a tram and pay about 2 dollars for a ride into the city. You can still get to the tram but it's an awkward walk. You have to walk about 15 minutes to reach it. Also the kantor/currency exchange was outside of security so after we had gone through passport control I couldn't exchange money. So hopefully they'll fix that. There was free internet near a cafe but couldn't easily find power. So most people had to run off of battery.

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Federico Muscogiuri,Spain,2014-10-28,Madrid Barajas is a complicated airport. For a start it would be more adequate to describe it as a tale of two airports. Terminals 1-2-3 are within walking distance to one another. Terminal 1 is mostly used by low cost airlines and has the ambience and charm of a bus station. It is also used by non-Schengen flights except those operated by Iberia and other Oneworld airlines. The non-Schengen section of the Terminal 1 is a bit quieter and modern. There is only one overpriced eaterie queues for check in and security are long but overall it does its job. Terminal 2 is pretty similar but is used by Lufthansa Swiss and Star Alliance airlines. Occasionally however I have caught the odd Easyjet/Ryanair flight from there. Terminal 3 is more modern and airy definitely the best of the bunch with Skyteam airlines mostly using it. Terminal 4 is located about 4 kms from the main three terminals and it is connected by a frequent and free shuttle bus (I don't understand some passengers' complaints about connection from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4). It is used by Iberia and Oneworld airlines as well as those airlines that have a code-share agreement with Iberia. It is architecturally impressive and compared to the other terminals feels relatively uncrowded however there are three things that really bother me about it 1) long walks from one gate to another 2) the fact that now you find it impossible to transit from one area to another without having to pass through some Duty Free and 3) any eating place is almost twice as expensive than in the city. Despite its shortcomings one thing that sets Barajas apart from other airports in Europe and the US is the public transport which is excellent from all Terminals. I live in Madrid and moan about Barajas but when I travel via CDG or FRA (not to mention US airports) then I realise that it's not bad after all.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

This airport is a joke for such a city. I know that T4 is much better but this part of the terminal is outdated dark crowded and cramped. Restrooms are dirty. Check-in area is small and dark. Furthermore taxiing at this airport may take ages since runways are sometimes very far away.

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,C Porter,United States,2010-12-28,Its easy to transit between the terminals but terminal 4 and its satellite are functionally lackluster in my opinion. The lines and walks are long everywhere you go. Transiting from the primary terminal to the satellite is a pain. After several elevator rides and several ramps you traverse a crowded security checkpoint with the most impersonal agents I have experienced. Its then another train ride and one long walk through a long straight terminal to your gate unless you are lucky and have one of the near gates. Signage is inadequate in the satellite terminal as are seats. If its a busy time of the day many will be forced to sit on the floor or along a wall. They are also poor when it comes to announcements. I once had 2 completely unannounced gate changes in the matter of 30 minutes. The other terminals are dated looking but more functional. Its not all bad as its a decent looking airport and a good selection of restaurants and other services when you are waiting for a flight. To sum it up its a small airport design stretched out for one of the worlds largest and it simply does not work.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Security check (at 0630) very efficient and quick and journey from taxi drop off to gate S51 (halfway down the building) in T4S was about 20 minutes. An eternal problem at Barajas is retail opening hours but a couple of shops and Mcdonalds are open early in T4. Only the one cafe open at that hour in T4S though. Arriving back at T4 was something of a revelation. Early on 40-minute waits for bags was the norm (and this got into the Madrid newspapers) so they did at least bring in estimated arrival times for baggage on the monitors. Now they actually manage to get bags there ahead of the estimate - they turned up within 5 minutes of arriving from T4S (so about 20 minutes from stepping off the plane). Someone's reprogrammed the baggage belts and it's not too bad at all. So about 30 minutes from leaving the aircraft to getting in a taxi (at a now very well managed pick up point).,NA,NA,NA,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

But having just flown into and out of Madrid this past weekend the signs regarding the supplemental fare are all over the place. They're on the trains (in English and Spanish) on platforms vending machine screens on station walls even on large stickers on the floors. That supplemental fare of one euro is peanuts on top of the normal fare which is also one euro. I'm not aware of that many capital cities in Europe where you can get from the airport to the centre for two euro.

Some of the boarding areas (B26-29 for example) have had the seating moved back to create more queuing space for lo-cost flights. In T1 as ever nothing whatsoever is open at 7am your only source of refreshment is vending machines. Quite a lot of the ongoing refurbishment now appears largely complete although I didn't see any of the promised 40 new shops and restaurants. Return was fine too with luggage arriving within 10 minutes - the absolute opposite of the terrible experiences of T4.

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Vincent Fissore,NA,2009-05-20,This is my third review of Barajas airport and each time it is getting worse and worse!!! Used the airport on the Labour Day weekend. To start with getting a ticket was the closes thing to hell because there were only 4 ticketing officers for roughly 750 people! Security shouted at us and shoved us to pass the control (and when the odd passenger complained ultimate humiliation seemed to be the only retaliation method for the controllers). Shops were full and vendors shouted at passengers to speed up and grab anything they wanted. Finally gate for the IB8755 flight for Nice changed 4 times with no announcements!

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,NA,2009-05-17,The airport is pleasant enough with plenty of seating areas and an airy open feel. There also seem to be plenty of shops to pass the time in. Passport control was a breeze and only took a few minutes to clear as they had lots of counters open. The metro stop right at the terminal entrance is also a plus enabling you to save 30+ Euros compared to a cab ride. Security lines were a bit long though and good luck finding someone who speaks English if your Spanish isn't very good. The airport's big downfall though is its immense size - the walking times between terminals/gate areas can be immense especially if you have to go from the T4S satellite terminal back to T4 or vice versa (and good luck if you have to go to T1/T2/T3). I sure wouldn't want to have a connection here unless I had 3-4 hours between flights. Baggage wait times are also atrocious - it took better than an hour to collect them and bags were making it onto the belt 2-3 at a time at intervals of a couple of minutes.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,N Barnsley,NA,2009-04-15,Previous comments I've posted about long delays at T4's baggage reclaim unfortunately still hold true; in fact if my most recent experience is anything to go by they've actually got worse. Many of the catering outlets keep odd hours and some don't accept credit/debit cards. But the bottlenecks that were common at passport control seem to have smoothed out and the signing has been improved. Procedures at security and customs continue to be highly professional and efficient and the staff courteous. Although the terminal and its satellite are huge lots of escalators mechanical walkways and the connecting underground train reduce distances and walking time. Furthermore all the terminals at Barajas are amongst the cleanest and best maintained that I've encountered anywhere in the world.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

You arrive into the beautiful gleaming new terminal 3 with easy transition through passport control and out to the very efficient train station. Getting back home is a different story. You check into the brand new gleaming terminal 3 but if you are directed into lounges B or C don't go through until you absolutely have to! This is the depressing old 1960/70s part and looks it. Most UK flights go back from these lounges and they are drab with 1 tiny duty free shop a poor self service snack bar and the air conditioning is woeful. Even the staff were suffering with the heat.

malaga-airport,/airport-reviews/malaga-airport,Malaga Airport customer review,Ian Fraser,United Kingdom,2013-11-13,Have made a number of visit to Malaga this year as usual. Because of the completion of T3 has not been the best airport to visit but was hoping this year would be better in fact now worse. Fortunately Jet2 our carrier now has T3 booking desks from T1 and T2 previously however those with t1 or T2 desks have a long walk to the only customs in T3. On arrival last year we arrived T2 and went straight to the luggage belts in T2 this year arrived T2 and like 2011 had to walk through T3 and back to T2 luggage belts why I ask not good for us oldies. On departure things getting worse in October all the tables behind the x-ray machines have been removed which forces people to empty their trays of wallets etc whilst it is on the machines rollers still. This slow the passage of the bags etc to nearly a standstill we were moved to an x-ray machine with only 4 people in front of us with plastic trays but a full belt and a whole family of 4 trying to recover their items of the belt. 30 minutes later we got to put our trays through the machine. As I had to take my shoes and belt off I am trying to balance on one leg to get my shoes on whilst my partner stops our trays falling off. Once again they stop the belt and we delay for at least 5 minutes whilst we put shoes belts watches on as no where to put our trays. Having checked on line knew zone B but still a long walk to get there to find since May they have stripped out most of the seats near the boarding gates and now about 20 seats at each gate we arrived an hour before boarding all seats full just after our arrival. Seems airport operators want you to stay the retail area and not sit around the boarding gates not a good option in my mind.,NA,NA,NA,7,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

No hitches at all on arrival and this time we even found the official route up to departures level to meet our courtesy bus to the off-site car hire office. On our return trip queues at security were not too bad and we were through quite quickly. For some reason however no details were being released about gates for flights not even which zone until actual boarding began. In the end boarding for our flight to Liverpool was announced by loudspeaker before it even appeared on the screens and even though we were then quick to go through passport control for zone C  the flight was already boarding from the gate immediately adjacent.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It's big impressive and airy but there are still irritating niggles. On arrival we needed to go up to departures level to access our bus but couldn't find any way to do so apart from squeezing through barriers. We then unknowingly walked past the bus point because the signage was not displayed for passengers emerging from the terminal. We were glad that our car hire collection point was off-site as the area outside the airport was very congested. On our return we found Security somewhat disorganised. There was something of a melee to secure trays and at our security gate one harassed female agent seemed to be trying to do everything: call passengers through check the detector and frisk selected individuals whilst at the same time trying to call to a colleague to come and help. We found it very difficult to hear announcements made at the gates. This time we were departing from Area C and our flight to Liverpool was announced early: all we heard was something about Liverpool so we followed others who started moving to join a queue. Perhaps our next passage through the airport in Sep will be smoother as we will have a better idea of what to expect.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Only one set of toilets in arrivals and these are hidden in a corner under the stairs. Had to walk through a multi- storey car park then over a bridge to get to the 'airport train station'. Check-in on return journey was ok although some of the ground handling staff who man the check-in desks on behalf of other airlines don't seem to know the rules of the airlines they work for. (bmi baby check-in desk staffed by FlightCare Spain were unaware that bmi baby give 5kg extra luggage for passengers travelling with babies and tried to charge me an excess!) Security checkpoint an absolute nightmare. Around 100 check-in desks in the main hall but only 6 security lanes. It took us 45 minutes to get through security.

Unlike at PMI which we know well arriving passengers seem to be kept entirely separate from those departing. We're not sure how easily we would have found it driving out of the airport though if we hadn't had excellent instructions from the lady who rented us both her country house and a hire car as you emerge right into the thick of the traffic of ""greater"" Malaga. Departing from Malaga was reasonably straightforward too. It took a while to find a parking space but then the signs towards and inside the terminal building were clear and we discovered that there was a separate security area for those who do not need to check in at the airport desks and that area was very quiet indeed. From what we could see the main security area was very busy but flowing fairly smoothly. We didn't visit any of the shops so can't comment on those but in the waiting area between security and the moving walkways up to the shops it was difficult to hear the flight announcements.

Internet cafe must be in the running for worlds most expensive at US$15 per hour. Its slightly more reasonable once through security (but see above - you will not have much time to use it). For reasons unknown the entire area beyond security control smelled of vomit. A taxi for the fast 7 mile/12km journey to town costs an extortionate US$30+.

No real queues for bag drop passport control or security. Airport not as clean as Schipol which was very noticeable. Real need for road improvements from the M6 to the airport as some stretches still single carriageway and get very congested. (I concede that this is not in the airport's direct control but they should be lobbying for change). Staff attitude was great. Only real concern was that we had to wait for what seemed like a long while for baggage to appear on the belt. We also watched on the plane as bags were loaded and it seemed that the handlers felt they were not doing their jobs unless each bag was either thrown or dropped onto the belt of left to fall some distance onto the tarmac.

Our destination Corfu meant we had to fly from Manchester. Our transit in both directions was smoother than that of last July because we were travelling out of high season and at quieter times of day. We passed through security quite swiftly and were treated very amicably. The only downside on the outward journey was a longish wait in a hot and stuffy ground floor gate area until we were actually allowed onto the plane. On our return we were among the last off the plane but almost first to passport control because everyone else had taken a wrong turning en route to Arrivals as there seemed to be no signage at a crucial point along the way.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,F Odds,United Kingdom,2014-04-29,What a dreadful airport! At terminal 3 today around 50% of the x-rayed bags in security were passed for hand screening and swabbing causing huge build-ups of frustrated passengers. Many airports recognize that people who've paid money to fly are not criminals per se but Manchester (terminal 3) likes to make everyone passing through get the feeling they are an unreasonable nuisance to mankind. At security the tray containing my jacket and laptop and the tray containing my cabin bag were both sent for manual screening. Incredibly the security chap solemnly looked me in the eye for the second time when it came to tray number two and asked exactly the same questions: did you pack this yourself? Could anyone have interfered? etc. Is it really impossible to add intelligence to security? Airside at Manchester terminal 3 every WHSmith and Boots outlet insists on production of a boarding card for all purchases. Many British airports ask if you object to showing your boarding pass and don't mind if you say 'yes' but Manchester won't sell you even a newspaper without your producing a boarding pass. This farce has gone on long enough. The food outlets don't ask you to show your boarding pass to make a purchase: why should Smiths and Boots?

This was the first and I have to say it was an eye opener. My dislike of MAN is based on several trips where staff and facilities have been woefully short of the minimum you would expect. This last trip was a welcome exception. The fast track was operating well and the staff at screening were courteous and efficient (a first for me at MAN) and we were through in a few minutes. On my last return through MAN we were held on a corridor for over an hour with no explanation and then faced with surly immigration staff and long long waits for luggage to get onto the belt. To my immense relief the organisation was far better on this trip. The queues for immigration were relatively short and by using the automated booths were through in less than ten minutes. They do need more of these booths though and to keep them in working order. Baggage was on the belt within ten minutes of us reaching it and we were off the plane and out of the airport in a little under 30 minutes all told. A much better experience.

We used to fly via Manchester quite often but in recent years we have invariably used Liverpool. However I had found it cost slightly less to fly from Manchester so we went for the cheaper option. Everything went fairly smoothly both on the outward and inward journey and we encountered no unpleasantness from anyone: in fact the security lady who attended to us was positively pleasant and helpful. She even suggested that my wife and I share a tray for the items which had to be sent through separately. Would we choose Manchester in future over Liverpool? Only if it was much cheaper. Everything took much longer at Manchester because of the crowds. Security area seemed more claustrophobic and there was hardly any room on the other side of the channels to re- pack one's bags. On our return it took approximately an hour from leaving the plane until we exited the car park. There weren't any major queues at any stage but long walks passage through passport control waiting for the bus to Jet Park 3 roadworks between the airport and the car park all took time even without hold luggage to collect In contrast our daughter who had flown later via Liverpool said that on return it took her just 5 minutes from plane to car park. She agreed that everything had been in her favour but in the past we have managed it in 15 minutes when immigration is not busy. Also why is a boarding pass required even to buy a newspaper at Manchester when there is no such requirement at Liverpool?

Overall I think it's the best of Manchester's 3 terminals due to it's proximity and easy access to the airport station and it's more thoughtful and user friendly design: there seems to be sufficient check in security and baggage reclaim facilities for the number of aircraft and passengers it can handle at peak times consequently queuing is kept to a minimum. Staff are friendly and efficient and there's plenty of seating and a reasonable range of places to have a drink or something to eat in the departure lounge. Drawbacks: the forced torturous route to the departure lounge through the duty free shopping area and the weird way in which the piers are configured leading to arriving passengers having to go down a long flight of stairs - not an escalator - then immediately back up a similarly long flight to the same level.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Manchester portrays itself as a modern airport but two American Airways flights landing closely together meant long tedious queues for passengers at immigration and no access to automated kiosks.

After check- in I found myself in what appeared to be a bright massive department store-come-shopping centre. Anything that might suggest the presence of aircraft and boarding gates were missing or lost amongst the neon glare of perfume counters and tobacco signs. I saw a young family who were obviously about to miss their flight frantically ask another passenger in the airport for directions to the gates because the entire terminal was designed to encourage as much transit shopping as possible and no thought was given to the fact that people actually had flights to catch. Confirmation of flight boarding gates are not announced until the flight is about ready to board so unlike almost every other airport I've ever used there is no option to just relax at the gate as you wait for your flight.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,S Fletcher,United Kingdom,2015-03-17,Manila Terminal 3 despite being the newest terminal at NAIA is currently undergoing refurbishment with an extension to the 3rd level pre security shopping and dining area. This means that there is an excellent selection of dining and shopping facilities. The major downside of using terminal 3 is that whilst these renovations are being undertaken there is no air-conditioning so is extremely hot especially at busy times. All airports in the Philippines have a security check as you enter the airport where you are required to show the guard a copy of your ticket in order to gain entry into the airport. This can be a problem if the airline sends you the e-ticket in the form of a corrupted pdf which cannot be opened! Had to call the airline and get them to send a representative to confirm I had a ticket in order to obtain entry into the airport. There are currently roadworks on the roads around the airport (Skyway extension) which can significantly add to the already congested roads and journey times. Personally I prefer flying into Terminal 3 which is a vast improvement on the old International terminal 1 I just hope they sort out the air-conditioning!,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Once again arrived at this awful airport on the morning of the 11th to find it still in full blown renovation which is Lila maze to negotiate for the passengers as nothing was clearly sign posted but as I have been a regular it was not so bad for a first time arrival it would be a nightmare. Immigration was busy and the number of counters had halved! Made it twice as long to get through. Customs was a breeze as there were none on duty when I entered the baggage hall so straight to arrivals and out of the hot stuffy place as there was no air-conditioning working sufficiently to keep the area cool.

Had to wait 15 minutes in line for customs (they just opened a new line) and had to wait about 20 minutes for my baggage. When I left had to wait about 40 minutes in queue for check-in. But it was a bit hectic since I did know what line I should have waited in. Cleanliness is ok. I did not like that they put the air-conditioning below freezing point in the transfer room.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-08-07,I flew into terminal 1 on a Royal Brunei flight and was amazed at how quick immigration was. Transit bus to terminal 2 was ok if a bit infrequent. Domestic departures for terminal 2 is clean and modern if rather sparse. What disappointed me most was the fact one can't buy a beer once through security. However my worst ordeal was when I flew back to Indonesia from the Philippines. You need to pass through 2 checkpoints just to reach the check-in desks of terminal 1. When I got to Royal Brunei's check-in desks it was understaffed with unhelpful staff and it took 40 minutes for me to get served. I then had to pay for a departures tax which was absolutely ludicrous given this is a pathetic excuse for an airport. When I got through immigration half the facilities were out of service due to renovation and there wasn't even a money changer. This in particular annoyed me as you'd expect this in one of Asia's largest international airports. Furthermore I arrived just over 2 hours before departure which seems like plenty of time but by the time I got through there wasn't that long before boarding and had I arrived half an hour later I would have struggled to make my flight. Therefore you must arrive here at least 3 hours before departure to be safe. Overall this airport is in a sorry state and terminal 1 likely employs the same number of staff as it employed when it opened back in 1981 which makes it chaotic. Unless the Philippine Airport authorities get their act together they will deter both tourists and investors which will only adversely affect its economy. Other major hubs in Asia even much-criticised ones like Jakarta Soekarno- Hatta and Shanghai Pudong provide a much better experience and airports like Singapore Changi Hong Kong and Bangkok Suvarnabhumi really heap shame on Manila.

By far the worst of the terminals at NAIA (I have been there 6 times in the past 5 months) it's almost impossible to find anything positive to say about this terminal. At most times of the day it is overcrowded to the extent that it is hard to find anywhere to sit in the departure lounge even on the floor. The air conditioning is inadequate the facilities are minimal the queues often depressingly long and getting a taxi from the airport is extremely difficult. There are plenty of taxis around but those depositing departing passengers are not allowed to pick up passengers arriving.

Half of the immigration counters are open (approximately 10 are open and more younger personnel are visible). Snack bar and some shops are closed for renovation so there are fewer seats.

The big issue was that the pick up area was totally clogged up. I fly through this airport a lot and it's far from the best of airports but it usually functions. In this case drivers have bribed the traffic co-ordinators to park in the pick-up/drop off areas indefinitely whilst they waited for the people they were picking up. We had a pick up organised and it took over an hour for the driver to move the 200 meters to get into the pick up area.

They take your money and passport and then walk over to an office near the baggage claim where the visas are processed.

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,M Ferguson,United Kingdom,2015-06-18,"Marseille itself is a wonderful, buzzing, cosmopolitan place, but this airport, or possibly just the Easyjet/Ryanair sector of it, lets it down. You enter into a general hall that includes a very nice café area, where you can wait for your flight check in to show. The use of computers and digital displays in this airport is almost non existent. When we noticed our Easyjet check in was open, it was via a wooden or stiff cardboard board above the Easyjet area. We had speedy bag drop which that weekend, might just not have existed (see my Gatwick review). There were two queues. We were second in the speedy queue but you'd not have known it. At least 5 people went though on the other queue before we were called forward. There were two check in desks but our attendant seemed to have a lot of admin before she could start the process. We eventually were called, showed our documents, the tags were put on our luggage. Then we were told to take our luggage through and to the right. This was via a crush barrier, not the sort that you see in the bigger airports but solid fixed steel like a cattle crush! We traversed this maze of a barrier, to arrive at another point where once again our credentials were checked/scanned and our luggage put on a conveyor. We then went into a general holding area, that had a news shop and coffee area, and quite nice seats. But the loos were upstairs. This next floor was obviously an overflow area as there were lots of seats and no one in them. Ladies, these loos were the worst I've been in even on campsites. There were three that I would not even go in. Clearly there is no regular check/cleaning. Gents were apparently good. Down in the general waiting area, we could see a doorway that appeared to lead to passport control and the gates, but signage was minimal. There was no digital departure board. There was a board that showed all current flights, but it didn't seem to be updated as an announcement for the first flight didn't result in any change on the board. Our flight was meant to be 11.20. At 10.40 we decided we'd best move closer to the gates/passport control. We found passport control, through another of the fixed barrier mazes. There were 4 booths, three of them manned.The two guys in the ones immediately facing , simply ignored us. I moved forward, the woman in the other booth told me to wait. There was a digital board facing them and clearly they were able to see flight information which we couldn't.As it was there was chaos at Gatwick, so our flight was delayed, but no-one told us. Eventually at 10.55 we were called forward, and I noticed one of the attendants from the check in desk carrying the Gatwick sign from the desk. She was setting it up at the gate as we approached. Speedy boarding, she said, to the left by the window. Given that one wall is a window, difficult to know where to stand. There was a door in the middle, and one at the far end. Eventually there was an announcement in French and English telling us to move down. It got to 11.15. The luggage was on the tarmac, as was the fuel, and two sets of steps. No plane. Said plane eventually arrived at 11.20 (for said 11.20 flight) There are no loos after passport control. (There is a warning notice) and no seating in the gate area. We were eventually boarded at about 11.55. Unfortunately the first step on front set to the plane was a little high for my arthritic knee, and no attendant there to help.

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Anna Kleinzahler,United Kingdom,2012-08-28,Flew into Marseille from Gatwick and used on arrival Terminal 2. It is appalling. It is brutal architecture and long hard corridors that go up and down with no electric walkways or many lifts. If you are not physically fit or so handicapped that you need a wheelchair getting to and from the aircraft can be a struggle even more so with those with children's buggies. I found the staff particularly the border police indifferent to passengers and talked amongst themselves. The check-in and security going out was smooth and fast but the facilities leave a lot to be desired. Blocked toilets poor shopping options particularly on the land side few seats. If you fly with easyjet even as a low cost passenger you get modern well equipped clean and comfortable jet. I don't see why this airport authority expects passengers to be happy with a terminal that is not as good as the other terminal at the airport and which is the case at both the north and south terminals at Gatwick. or Nice.

Having felt like him that MP2 was beginning to get its act in order I had a poor experience a couple of weeks ago. At a 'busy' time for the terminal (ie 2 flights departing closely together!) management of two different queues was non-existent - and unnecessary given that in fact my Ryanair flight (to STN) was about 40 minutes late into Marseille and so passengers should not have been called to the gate at all. Result - on going forward to the border police passport control STN passengers were asked to stand to one side to let the others through (I think they were going to Eindhoven). Those of you who know the area at MP2 that I am talking about will realise the unpleasant scrum that resulted (after which we STN passengers were still required to queue at the 'gate' (ie behind a locked door) for almost 45 minutes before boarding. Once we reach summer schedules I'm going to try Leeds/Bradford-Avignon with Jet2 although recent posts on LBR (which I have not used for a couple of years) hardly fill me with much hope!,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2009-09-02,My third report on MP2 will be my final one as I will never use this appalling shambles of a terminal again - the worst yet. As before my departure was on a Saturday afternoon in August but just four flights were scheduled to leave in the three hours after I arrived. MP2 could not cope. We arrived just over two hours before scheduled departure and had the flight left on time would have spent 1 hour 50 minutes queuing. Among the highlights were 24 minutes waiting to give passport details (after 36 minutes in the check-in desk queue) and being accused of not submitting them online - like everyone else in the queue I had not been asked to. Another half hour waiting for the border police officer to open his booth. The final insult was an extra 20 minutes at the departure gate as they could not let passengers off the incoming aircraft - the terminal door would not open. So we finally boarded the aircraft 2.5 hours after entering the terminal all but ten minutes standing in queues. This place is an utter mess: inefficient chaotic cheap nasty and with uncaring staff I speak and understand enough French to know that it was not just a language barrier; I will accept the security staff who were doing their best. It should be avoided at all costs there are alternatives and I intend to use them.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Andrew Bennett,NA,2008-11-09,I think MP2 is nearly getting it right! I have used it several times more since my previous comment and I agree with others that staff are (now) generally helpful and friendly and - although limited in extent and choice - the food and drink available in the departure area (I hesitate to call it a 'lounge'!) is of reasonable quality and is reasonably priced compared with many other airports. However passengers are still called to gates far too early - often before the incoming flight has even landed - so that the length of time queuing in the rather grim ground-floor area is too long.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2008-08-26,Last August I wrote a rather damning review of MP2; this year I used the same terminal at more or less the same time of day and time of year. It has improved a little but there is still room for improvement. The queues are still there but they move more quickly; I timed everything very carefully. Check-in 10 minutes; luggage drop-off 4; security 21; passport control 10; boarding- pass check 9; boarding 8. However you look at it this is still an hour of continual queuing and as we were a little later than planned arriving at the airport it was literally moving from one queue to the next. The environment has not improved though I did feel the staff were more helpful and friendly than last time and generally it was not quite as awful. However the final episode illustrated some of the problems of MP2. With everyone on board on time the pilot announced that he could not start engines because there was so much rubbish blowing about on the apron. I was by a window and could see burst rubbish bags from aircraft just left lying around. We waited 15 minutes while some of it was cleared up but it was far from completely clear when we left. The whole place feels very uncared-for and it is obvious that costs have been cut wherever possible; as I said last time I understand the economics of low-cost flying but this seems to be a step too far - to the point where it is counterproductive in terms of efficiency and customer satisfaction.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I was fortunate to go through at a quiet time on my own and with hand baggage only but I can imagine that it can be a frustrating experience at busy times and/or with a family and all its luggage.

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2007-08-27,I have used Marseille in the past and found it perfectly acceptable. However last week I endured the new terminal 2 (warehouse would be a better description) for low-cost airlines; it is a truly horrible experience. I know that when travelling low-cost it is just that and you get what you pay for but this takes the concept to a whole new (lower) level. They obviously did not waste any money on decorating as it is mainly bare walls pipes concrete floors etc. On the few places they actually put some paint it is the most disgusting mixture of lime green purple and orange you can imagine. You get plenty of time to admire the 'design' of this box as you queue to put your luggage onto a conveyor belt (about 20 minutes and quite what cost it saves is beyond me) and to go through security (about 45 minutes). If this is the future of mass air transport it will surely kill itself it is a totally joyless and annoying experience.

My usual route is MME-AMS-MRS and return (KLM - rather wobbly Fokkers on both legs but generally personable crews and reasonable timekeeping) which means I get to use Hall 4 at MRS undeniably pleasanter than Hall 1 or the new low-cost terminal MP2 (although one of my daughters used this in December and thought it perfectly adequate). Check-in staff at MRS are always pleasant the waiting area by the gates is light and airy and (since changing from Europcar to Avis) I have found the collection and return of hire cars to be quick and hassle-free.

The facilities simply can't cope with too many flights at once. When quieter its fine and comfortable enough.

Get through that and find carousel 5 and head for customs. We declared food and some mats. On seeing my wife and daughters had Philippine passports an officer sent us to line 5. Here an officer basically accused us of carrying all sorts of illegal foods and when I said no he sneered ""we will find it"". After that they let the sniffer dog loose.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,2011-12-13,We arrived at 06.30 on a fairly full Qantas 380 from Singapore. Expecting the worse we were pleasantly surprised perhaps because of luck perhaps because of planning. We were quickly off the 380 because we got seats near the front of economy hence when we arrived at Immigration the queues were short. Staff were moving non nationals into the nationals line as soon as a booth became free and we had none of the long queues reported elsewhere. We looked back and the line looked reasonably short. Whilst our bags took a long time to come this was because they were some of the last to come off the plane - the carousel was full of bags by the time we got there. The pain came when we had to check-in for our domestic connection - we had to take our bags landside and check-in again rather than being able to use a fast bag drop airside. The new Qantas bag automatic bag checkers accepted one of our bags but not the other and so human intervention was required (others were also having trouble). Never-the-less we have experienced worse. I suspect the terminal would be under strain if a number of big jets arrived at the same time we had chosen a flight when this would not be the case.

Fortunately I used Smart Gate and was able to bypass the queue. I was expecting queues at baggage but there were throngs of people around each carousel at least 6-7 deep all intermingled with the queue for the exit all made painfully slow by overzealous quarantine checks.

For example I have arrived between 5-7 am three times in the past month from overseas only to experience an hour long wait each time - waiting for my bag then standing in a long line waiting to exit.

If you are checking in from 89 onwards these are just before the Virgin domestic terminal - the illogical layout makes this a baffling ordeal for travellers. Security and immigration have recently been upgraded and it shows but then there is the hike through retail shops to get to departure gates which are old and outmoded. A collection of four or five gates serviced by toilets and a few overpriced drink and snack machines. Returning was an endurance test. On arrival one is greeted by a low-ceilinged shabby corridor and queues at immigration. My baggage was on carousel 5 which is the newer one but to get to it you have to cut through waiting throngs of passengers lining up afor the exit and waiting for baggage at carousels 3 and 4. The queue to exit begins between two baggage carousels a winding path to customs officers and then another trek with queues to quarantine to have your luggage scanned. Total time elapsed from aircraft arrival at gate to exiting this overcrowded mess: 1hr 55 minutes. Once out transport options are limited to the red bus going to the city (express running a very elastic 10 minutes) at the bargain price of AUD15 or taxis. That's it.

On departing queues at security were fairly short and very slack. A woman in front of me was asked is she had any liquids or gels.

That's more than was available at some Australian regional airports but much less than your average capital city terminal. Access to planes is via the tarmac.

There is little to do at Avalon except wait for boarding which is in groups of around 40 by sequence number a new system for a mainline Australian airline. An alternative is to take a V/Line train to Lara and pre-book a taxi. At certain times this may save hanging around Avalon for 90 minutes but taxis must be prebooked - call Geelong Radio Cabs or Bay City Cabs. Coming from Warrnambool or Lorne in SW Victoria the late afternoon West Coast Rail train stops at Lara makes an excellent connection with the final Jetstar flight to Brisbane.

Once again he was rude and unhelpful and said we should wait in the same line or find one that was shorter as there wasn't a separate line! After waiting another half an hour we found a helpful lady who directed us towards a transit booth.

The airport is very linear which means there is considerable walking from one place to another and luggage trolleys are few and far between. The aisles to get to the security scanners are about 75m long and snake backwards and forwards 6 times before your get to them – you are not allowed to walk up the side even if there is no queue. Once airside you then start an even longer trek going up and down stairs and escalators to get to the gates. If you are travelling out of the Schengen Area you then walk even further to get to a shed with no facilities other than a few smelly toilets and an inaudible / incomprehensible tannoy system. We were bussed to our aircraft and this process took 30 minutes from getting onto the bus to getting to the aircraft because the coach just sat there waiting. The plus side of the airport is that there are plenty of cafes shops car hire companies coaches etc. The minus side is everything related to its organisation and the quality of the environment.,NA,NA,NA,1,5,1,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

The trip to Georgetown Bahamas on American Airlines was satisfactory and uneventful. Changing planes at the American Airlines terminal in Miami while not bad had one curiosity that I do not understand. It turns out that the terminal has a small train service that can whisk you from one side to the other in less than 5 minutes. There was no signage in the terminal indicating that this convenience even existed. When I finally asked for help I found out about the train and where to catch it. Terminal 3 at Heathrow has much better signage for its labyrinths. On the return it took us an hour to get through Customs get our luggage and check-in to TSA security. While waiting for our aircraft to arrive 3 hours late we noticed that the airport restaurants coffee shops etc. started to close down at 9 pm! By 10 pm there was nothing available.

Like on the way out at Stansted no security questions were asked. Once through immigration and the security check all their is is a small duty free shop and a coffee shop. The amount of seating was reasonable but not sufficient for the Ryanair flights scheduled to leave within 45 mins of each of each other. The airport also seems to suffer from a lack of airside buses to transfer passengers to aircraft  but thankfully no delay to departure occured.

If you don't know you have to walk the approx 1/2 mile from one end of the concourse to the other. Only when we asked for directions did we find out about the elevators hidden away that took us to the train. It is a great service that whisks you from one end to the other in less than 5 minutes. On our trip back going through Passport Control Customs and TSA it took an hour to run the gauntlet even with 40 separate gates to service the thousand other incoming passengers (literally!).

It is a fairly basic airport and the architecture is pretty unimpressive. However it is one of the most efficient airports I know. Luggage is normally delivered within 15 minutes from arrival and one can be in the centre of Milan in 15/20 minutes provided there is no traffic. I also like the fact that the parking area is next to the terminal and one can be in the check-in counter minutes after parking. Its downside is the lack of amenities the cramped spaces and the fact that on international flights you are whisked to the plane in a bus which is too small and always packed.

Recently went to Terminal 2 for the first time: arrival not bad though getting on a bus when the terminal building was about 20 metres from the front of the aircraft is a bit frustrating. Departing was considerably worse: security was quick though that was where the efficiency ended. Not enough seats and limited food facilities. Worse followed though: we knew the flight was delayed by '45 minutes' (not the airport's fault it was foggy). We were then called to the gate about 30 minutes before 'departure' by a message on the screens ; after about 20 minutes we were told that we were at the wrong gate (and treated as if it was our fault) so we all went to the right gate where we stood for another 30 minutes before the aircraft arrived. We were then cleared to stand for a further 20 minutes before being allowed to board the aircraft it eventually left the stand 90 minutes after the scheduled time. I am not complaining about the delay bad weather in January is a hazard of flying but the airport must have known it was going to be much more than 45 minutes late a couple of hours in advance why did they not inform us? Also why did they have 100 people just standing around for well over an hour again they must have known - we could have shared the sparse seating.

The Schengen terminal upon arrival was uncrowded so that everything went smoothly. But it is a long walk through endless corridors to reach the baggage claim area. Transfer into Milan city centre is operated by two competing bus companies with rather the same prices. Allow at least 55min between Malpensa and the city easily more in rush-hour periods. Upon departure there are very few and small flight information screens making it difficult to locate the right check-in desks. It is even more difficult to find the gates as security checks take place at an intermediate floor between Arrivals and Departures floors! Security employees were efficient and friendly.

A potentially quite pleasant airport spoiled by this (oh and by the lack of clarity in signing food facilities: I ate not very well before setting off for a distant gate area and then discovered much better facilities there!).,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
milwaukee-airport,/airport-reviews/milwaukee-airport,Milwaukee Airport customer review,M Keenan,NA,2010-02-19,I’ve flown through a few times and found it works very well. Baggage has always arrived very quickly and rental cars are close to the terminal. On one occasion I was able to get off the plane get my baggage rent a car and get checked in at an airport hotel all within thirty minutes. Outbound Milwaukee is similarly straightforward - I experienced minimal line-ups to check in and only a few minutes wait for security. The departure areas are nothing special but there's plenty of comfortable seating while you wait and reasonable concessions to purchase food drinks or reading material. MKE gains some points in my book by also including a small museum that deals with the history of the airport and aviation in Milwaukee a nice touch that other airports should consider. MKE is further proof that it's far less stressful and time consuming to fly in and out of medium sized airports than mega airports.,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I must agree that some of the concourses (C especially) seem quite long but it never hurt anyone to walk a little bit (there are moving sidewalks for a good part of the C concourse anyway if walking isn't your thing). The signage within the airport is quite good and it is a very clean airport. Can't say much about the retail options as I've never understood shopping at airports. I feel the food options are rather good. Others have pointed out the fact that it can be a bit pricey to fly out of MSP but I have found there to be much fewer delays at MSP than at O'Hare.

mombasa-airport,/airport-reviews/mombasa-airport,Mombasa Airport customer review,W Pechler,Netherlands,2012-09-03,Arrived from Nairobi and flew to Amsterdam on September 2nd 2012. Baggage arrived quickly from our domestic flight couldn't immediately find international departures but were helped friendly at the outside service desk. Security went fast but that could be attributed to the fact that it was a very quiet day (only 2 international flights departing after 3 pm) and we were early. Enough available power sockets for charging. Check-in opened a little over 3 hours before departure once again we were helped by a couple of very friendly guys. Staff on the lower floor overall was kind and helpful but we asked 3 different people if there was either a Burger King McDonalds or KFC at the airport and none of them gave us a straight 'no' answer they all directed us to the small sandwich counter on the second floor. On the second floor staff spoke poor English. Passport control went fast but was arbitrary they asked for my entire right hand (4 fingers + thumb) to be scanned while my sister and father didn't need to have their thumbs scanned. Free wireless internet of fairly good speed but very limited reach. A dozen or so of duty free shops. Half the ceiling fans were broken but since the second floor is not entirely walled up the fresh wind from outside cooled the waiting area down enough. No power sockets at gate 3/4 no toilets either if you need to go you can just walk right back. After asking very politely and kindly if there was a way I could charge my laptop for the long flight (13 hours) they agreed I could charge it behind a desk at the security check where I left it out of sight for over half an hour and I'm happy to say my faith in humanity remains the same it was right there where I left it when we boarded right on time.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

The new international concourse is very impressive. However I do think it could be utilized a little bit more but it is a busy airport during the rush hours of 10am to 5pm. Some problems is that the AC does not work that well in Immigrations or Customs but that will soon be changed as they are building a whole new section to replace the current immigration and customs area. There are so many shops and a new shopping concourse is suppose to open really soon. I think there should be a first class lounge for all the airlines that don’t have their own and I feel the check in lobby in the departure concourse needs to be extended. During the busy periods its way to crowded and it seems like it takes forever for you to check in. Also I think they need to raise the roof in the western concourse it’s a little bit to low and it feels claustrophobic. If you’re an aviation fan this is a nice airport to for some spotting from the East concourse because it’s very airy and allot of glass windows. Overall I give the airport 4 out of 5. It will be nice to see the airport again once it has completed its expansion project. Maybe then Ill give it a 5 out of 5. There might be a lot of walkign also depending on what concourse your flight departs from.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
montego-bay-airport,/airport-reviews/montego-bay-airport,Montego Bay Airport customer review,Iain Maciver,NA,2005-06-07,MBJ or Sangster AIrport has grown from an old army airfield in WWII to a reasonable airport for a developing country. I started flying there when it was one runway and a quonset hut for a terminal. The airport operation is contracted out to a Canadian Airport Authority (Vancouver?). Current construction of a new building at the east end will alleviate most complaints (due 2006). Problem generally is the impatient intolerant pax - this airport is equivilant to a regional airport in size and traffic volume. To expect service levels to equal Heathrow or other non-american airports is unrealistic. If one is realistic & winds down to island time/speed it is a pleasant experience - people watching is VERY interesting here- I have seen more people make fools of themselves that at any other airport.. I have always found parking spots in the parking lot & it is an easy walk from their to the check-in counters. The current waiting lounge is indeed small but is more friendly that the vast majority of N American facilities. My favourite feature - you dont have to take a bus down the tarmac to even get to the plane or even walk miles to it. The main cause for consternation is from americans who have to go through extensive/excessive? security screening as imposed by their own govt. I have seen lines from AA etc out the door due to this. By now anyone bound for a american airport should have gotten accustomed to this and altered their check in times accordingly. Now that Air Jamaica is no longer Air Sandals indeed there have been changes but it is still a 'friendly' airline and they still represent the majority of check-in counters. And for arriving pax the flight path in (generally from the west) provided some dramatic views of this island nation.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Obviously had to recheck in on to the domestic flight but that was quick and simple and easy to find. Security was quick but the departure hall for domestic flights was very crowded so it's probably best to wait in the public area until nearer the flight. It only took me 30 minutes from leaving the Easyjet flight to go through immigration check-in and clear security. On the return trip it was just as efficient with no lines anywhere.

Queue for immigration was a bunfight with only 4 cubicles open for about 3 flights that arrived about the same time. This is where we experienced the lack of any queue organisation. Finally they opened up 3 more and the crowd subsided. This at least would lead to no wait at the carousel for the luggage. They put 3 flights load of luggage on same carousel which led to massive overloading. Found one but after another 20 mins (1 hour since landing) started to get concerned. Eventually found the remaining 2 pieces off the carousel. Someone must have taken them off and left them unattended. Not impressed one bit. Left the airport 90 mins after landing - never had such treatment before. Customs was a cursory wave through. The departure experience was better. Got the AeroExpress train and it finished 100m from entrance. The terminal surroundings are a builders yard so beware. Got through first security X-ray just inside the entrance then went to BA check in. Club tickets so eligible for Fast Track through immigration and security.

The airport seemed relatively modern but still lags far behind other hubs I've flown through like Frankfurt and Heathrow (which isn't saying much). Transit times seem to vary depending on time of day and which terminal you land in. Terminals D, E, and F all form an interconnected transit area. On our first stop over in Moscow we arrived at Terminal F and found ourselves funneled through a tiny transfer area that had one attendant serving multiple arriving flights. While we we arrived near the front of the line, I could see some people easily waiting 40+ minutes to pass through transit passport control and security. On the way back, we landed in Terminal D and things seemed to be better staffed and far less busy. My main complaint with the airport is the absolute lack of space. All three terminals are packed with very expensive duty free stores, squeezing out room for seating, food options, and bathrooms. The toilets at the airport were probably the dirtiest I have seen in any airport, and are stained with cigarette ash marks. In terminal D the duty free shops leave so little room in the corridors that it is a struggle to pass between crowds of people queuing for their flight. Terminal D also gets very hot during the daytime. The airport staff didn't seem very friendly or interested in customer service. They mostly bark commands at passengers.

Seating: there is virtually none on the first floor. Architects did not allow for the numerous (and terribly overpriced) duty-free shops that have been added since. That left a very narrow passage almost completely devoid of any facilities except for a couple of bathrooms and some broken currency exchange machines. You can go to the second floor - there aren't any seats there either but at least there aren't any duty free shops so you can camp out on the floor. For that reason the second-floor gallery looks like a refugee camp. Transfer times: you are forced to have your passport and boarding pass checked before being allowed to proceed to your gate. No line there as such just a crowd of desperate passengers and a lone staff member who tends to take long breaks. If you're desperate and your flight is leaving soon push your way to the counter. Boarding areas are actually enclosed and guarded and you are not allowed into that area - which is unfortunate because they have seats there - until shortly before the flight. They do not announce flights so make sure to make regular runs between departures/arrivals board and the gate to makes sure you're still departing from that gate - ask the staff.

The major problem of Sheremetyevo is transportation. From 5 passenger terminals and 1 cargo the road to Moscow is going though a 1-line overpass which is linking to a 3 line bridge of the one of the most busiest highways to St Petersburg so in most cases people are spending a long time just to leave the airport.

I've been to what I believe are all of their major terminals (B D F E) with the exception of C. On a flight JFK-Paris via Moscow the transfer was seamless. We ended up arriving about an hour later than expected with just over an hour left for the transfer. There were no line-ups anywhere and as we'd already received the boarding pass at the Aeroflot desk at JFK we were directed straight to our gate with a quick passport check). The staff were polite and gave us clear directions. D and E are the recently constructed terminals - clean modern and open with clear signage and info screens. That might seem obvious but many airports that I've been to lack these basic necessities. B and F are the old soviet-era terminals that have recently been refurbished. They are pretty good and a clear logical layout. The number of stores is a little limited. There are some good Russian fast food stand there though (like Kroshka- Kartoshka which sells baked potatoes). Unfortunately most of the eateries in all terminals are quite expensive but if you take a minute to look around terminals have budget cafes (like the Kroshka Kartoshka). Customer service has improved by a lot and staff polite and for the most part will try to help you. Aeroexpress takes you to Moscow city centre and easy to locate from terminals F C and D (a walkway connects the train station with the terminals). There is also a shuttle from the other terminals that takes you to the aeroexpress train station. I'd highly recommend the train over taxi or other options.

In March it was just a large section of a pier cordoned off but still miles ahead anything that passes for a lounge in any US facility.

Immigration was quick with a very friendly officer and our bags were out too quickly - it took us some time to admire the new terminal building with pieces of Indian art that is so different from Delhi IGI or Chennai Anna International. Departure was a similar story: some queues were there but moved relatively quickly friendly check-in (TK) very friendly officers that even joked with us at security with the usual stamps here and there and finally a quick cup of coffee close to the gate before boarding. True: there are mosquitoes in T2 and not all shops are operational yet but all we needed for departure was relatively prompt & pleasant and we enjoyed the huge improvement that has taken place in Mumbai. When they shift all domestic flights to T2 towards the end of 2014 we won't hesitate to use BOM again for our travels to India.

Road to the terminal is well maintained and elevated with 4 entrances for the security checks to get into the terminal. They have a separate Business and First class check in zone for all airlines which was nice and not crowded. Very high ceilings make for a feeling of a large facility. Security was a breeze with officers saying please and thank you (Clearly some training took place). Facility spotlessly clean with excellent lighting. Tons of shops though not completely open due to recent facility opening. Food outstanding and very well priced and boarding gates large with two entrances for each plane making for a quick boarding-deboarding process. I liked the Indian mural art work which was superb.

There was an insanely long queue just to get inside the terminal. I guess what people don't know is that you can use any of the doors. Most people queued at the entrance next to their airline apparently for hours just to get by security who checks every passport and boarding pass at snail's pace.

The place is clean modern and unusually hasn't been turned into a giant shopping mall - natural lighting throughout by way of lots of windows.

muscat-seeb-airport,/airport-reviews/muscat-seeb-airport,Muscat Seeb Airport customer review,Nur Afiqah Rahmat,United Arab Emirates,2015-06-17,"I am at this airport almost every other weekend and this will be my first review with them. 1) Check in is a breeze. Especially if you're flying with Omanair, they have a specific area just for that airline with many counters open for it. The only thing is, I just absolutely am disgusted with some of the staff where they would constantly question whether I need a visa to UAE with my passport and then question me back on ""are you sure?"" and ""really?"". 2 weeks ago, the guy at the check in counter said ""how do you know you don't need visa? When was the last time you were at UAE?"" (if he had properly check my passport that he was holding, he would have noticed that I have at least 10 UAE stamps in my passport, one which was dated 2 weeks before that). 2) Not many shops to be honest. Not the sort of airport you want to be at for more than 3 hours. 3) Did not like the other gate for low costs airlines such as Rotana or flydubai. That place is packed and crowded and super unorganised. I have honestly paid more to fly with Omanair just to avoid boarding through that gate. 4) Arrival at the airport is ok at times. Sometimes its super crowded, sometimes it's excellent. The immigration counter could do with some more counters during the busy time cause I remember when it took over an hour just for the queue. 5) Taxi from the airport to your destination is absolutely expensive. Where I am staying at, is only 10 minutes drive, yet it costs OMR8 (and same price to where another place that is 30 minutes is). 6) When the airport is full, it really is full. The cars are unorganised and everyone looked lost. I know they are building a new airport to support the high amount of tourists coming into the country, so I really am looking forward to that.",Arrival and Departure,14-06-2015,Solo Leisure,6,2,2,2,NA,3,1,3,NA,0

Not sure what to expect after some of the negative reviews posted but actually quite a pleasant experience. Flight WY 0102 landed on time and as we had booked a premium Meet & Greet were met straight off of the plane where the rep. showed us to the lounge while he sorted the visas. Whisked to immigration where there was no queue for quick formalities. It must also be said there were plenty of Visa machines where you could pay and get the required receipt for immigration. Luggage off of the carousel within 25 minutes so in the car and on the highway to hotel within 1/2 an hour. On return no queue at Oman Air so through security etc pretty quickly. No problem for my wife to nip back out for a cigarette. Airside reasonably airy with a decent amount of seats. A few shops and coffee places - we did not try so can't comment on prices. Cigarette prices incredibly cheap in Duty Free - alcohol not so.

muscat-seeb-airport,/airport-reviews/muscat-seeb-airport,Muscat Seeb Airport customer review,J Gerwin,United States,2015-01-28,While we found Muscat to be a great city we found that the entry process at MCT really poor. First one waits in the Travelex line to buy a Tourist Visa. A long line but it moved quickly. Then you get in one of two lines each feeding to a single passport agent. If these agents moved any slower they would be going backwards. Three to five minutes to process each passenger. They spend more time chatting to their partner than processing people. We were 15th in line and it took one hour to reach the agent. After baggage claim the main arrival hall is total chaos. The new airport will open in the next 1-2 years and one can hope it will be better run.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
muscat-seeb-airport,/airport-reviews/muscat-seeb-airport,Muscat Seeb Airport customer review,M Jones,Austria,2013-11-21,I fly for business practically every week this has to be one of the worst airports I have visited. Plane to terminal is always by bus you have to purchase a visa from the travel exchange desk where there was a long line of people waiting. As most of the flights to Muscat land late or very early morning you really don't want to be standing around for too long fighting fatigue waiting for a visa. Passport control was very slow. I timed the average processing time per passenger between 2-3 minutes. So just 5 people in front of me resulted in a minimum 10 minute wait at the airport. Because it took so long to get from the plane to arrivals the bags had already been offloaded from the belt there was no reference anymore on the screens as to which belt I would find my bags so I had to check every conveyor belt. Departure from Muscat: arriving at the airport you must first go through a checkpoint and security check before you even get into the check-in hall. If you have bad luck and there are a lot of people there as there was when I was departing you could be waiting for a while just to get into the arrivals hall. There is a separate line for business passengers and frequent travellers. Once in the arrivals hall there are no amenities limited places to sit you cant even buy a bottle of water so be sure to enter this hall through the first security not earlier than 2.5 hours before the flight otherwise you are in for a long and uncomfortable wait. Check in was without problem you then go through passport control which was much faster than on arrival and then another more thorough security check. The security here is bad I had fluids with me in my hand luggage including half a bottle of water this was let through without question. Once through security you are in the departure hall. I am a star alliance gold member so I can use the PLAZA lounge. The lounge offers a bar smoking room free wifi and a good selection of hot and cold foods. There is a large duty free hall upstairs and a very small one downstairs so if you are looking to buy things be sure to use the large duty free shop. All in all I was really very disappointed with this airport the new airport is currently being built and should be finished by the end of 2014.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

muscat-seeb-airport,/airport-reviews/muscat-seeb-airport,Muscat Seeb Airport customer review,Peter Bedson,Oman,2010-10-30,"A nice efficient little airport - much smaller than others in the region until the new building is completed. A very important piece of information is that the check in counters close an hour before take-off and I mean really close - the systems all shut down and there is no way onto the flight. This stops the check in staff getting bullied by late comers but means you need to be there in good time. The immigration queue looks long but generally moves reasonably quickly - you need to buy your visa at the Travelex bureau before you join the queue if you don't have one already. It is now 20 OMR each but kids seem to be only 10 (though I wouldn't bet on it) and if you have a visa for some but not all of the GCC states it is free. You can get a multiple entry visa but that seems to be at the whim of the Colonel on duty. There is a reasonable small duty free on arrival just after immigration and before what is generally the worlds fastest ever baggage reclaim (unless you are unlucky or travelling on BA for some weird reason when there can be a wait). The only ground transportation option is taxis - if you go to the hut directly outside arrivals you are guaranteed a reasonable price - about 7 OMR into town - touts (of which there are plenty hanging about but as with everything here they are not insistent) may cost you less or more (taxis don't have meters) and there is clearly a multi-tier pricing system in operation with westerners paying the most! The car parks are directly across from the terminal and are cheap with the exception of the ""executive"" car park which has permanent shade and a huge price to boot - the long stay is cheaper and only about 50m further away. Departures is pretty painless and border control and security are both generally very quick although it can get busy late at night; there is rather limited shopping airside but some nice coffee shops. The airline lounges are OK but nothing to write home about. Be aware that all the gates are bus gates and they close the flights very early - up to 40 minutes before departure - to herd you onto the busses. So don't linger too long in the coffee shop!",NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The main concourse was very very busy and in the heat was an experience. Departure can be a bit hectic with the majority of flights being operated late at night. The front of the terminal was a bit of a scrum. Be wary of the porters on the initial security check. Check in was not too bad. Security again was no different than anywhere else as was immigration. Shopping was a little limited but adequate with a duty free shop and several book stores and coffee shops. Departure lounge was decent. Again transfer to the aircraft was by bus.

nadi-airport,/airport-reviews/nadi-airport,Nadi Airport customer review,B Williams,Australia,2013-03-12,Arrived in Nadi at about 4pm on a Boeing 737-800 operated by Virgin Australia. The airport had not changed much since the last time I had been there (5 years ago) - still old. Disembarkation was a little slower than average. Immigration and Customs were surprisingly quick albeit laissez-faire and the bags were ready almost immediately. A fresh supply of taxis were also awaiting at the terminal. Arrived for check-in at 12pm about 2.5 hours prior to departure. My return flight was on a 80-90% full Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800. For such a small capacity plane the line seemed huge. Nadi seems to separate its check in desks by airline and flight. So Virgin Australia had about 9 desks - 3 each for the Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane flights. As the Melbourne and Brisbane flights had not started check in this meant that only 3 desks for VA were open while the check in staff at the other desks had a nice chat. The line barely seemed to move at all - the same people stayed at some one of the desks for over an hour! I ended up getting through check in 90 minutes prior to departure: that's an hour wait for a small plane. Virgin Australia generally closes check in 90 minutes prior to departure but when I turned around the line was still very large. This is totally unacceptable. Getting through customs is fairly straight forward. Then you arrive in a large room with boarding gates off to the sides. There seem to be a lot of people in a small space.

Never mind we went through the security check customs check and the 2 staff check before we boarded and no one actually checked the names on boarding passes = names in the passport.

It really needs a layout change - so you can be scanned just once on entering the secure passenger only area. Duty free shops well they sell the same as elsewhere in the world just without hi power arc lighting and glossy shelves.

It took 90 minutes to dispose of my bag having already checked in on-line and queuing for the business class counter. Next to this line was one headed 'Fast Bag Drop' which was pretty ironic since that queue was barely moving at all. Just as I handed my passport at the immigration desk all the lights went out and this supposedly the leading airport in East Africa was plunged into complete darkness. Once the lights partially came on again I tried to proceed to the BA lounge only to find the stairs leading to it in such darkness that it was impossible to see anything at all. So went to the gate to sit on the floor like so many given the limited seating. On returning to NBO on 14 November I was interested to see that - as others have said - the immigration queue for those without visas proceeded faster than for those holding visas. But it didn't matter given the wait for luggage that was going - slowly - through a single xray machine with a resultant long delay even for baggage labelled 'priority'.

nassau-airport,/airport-reviews/nassau-airport,Nassau Airport customer review,R Phillips,NA,2009-06-26,First off Nassau Airport is not on the same level as airports in the US or Europe. That should be news enough for people expecting a 5-Star Airport. The recent growth on New Providence and at Paradise Island (i.e. Atlantis Cable Beach etc.) is almost a world away from Lynden Pindling International Airport. My experience last week seems to be better than some of the good folks who have come before me but by no means is NAS a 5-Star Airport and the unexpected should be expected Inbound pax deplane and enter the Bahamian Customs facility. I arrived at about 2:30 and most of the lanes were open. Next comes the bag claim. Word of caution- try not to check any luggage. This will only slow you down and bag handling at NAS is disastrous. A Customs officer will ask you about the contents of your bags and most of the time will let you through without any checks. Taxis and Car Hire is outside of the bag area. Departures: I flew out on USAirways at around noon. If you are flying to the USA from NAS arrive at least 3 hrs early. Flights within the Bahamas Caribbean and to Canada & the UK leave from another terminal and usually need 2-3 hours lead time. USAirways opened their check-in desks at 9 so my group was checked in first. 3 hours may seem excessive for a Caribbean airport but it really helps here. After check-in you walk around and behind the check-in desks to the first security checkpoint. This has a metal detector and the whole works so be prepared to do everything you would at TSA/CATSA. Next comes US Customs & Border Protection Preclearance where a US (not Bahamian) officer checks your documents. Make sure to fill out the proper forms before you arrive at the airport. Not filling out the forms until the last second will only delay you further. After CBP you proceed up an escalator to a SECOND security facility. This also has a metal detector and more stringent security checks. My laptop was checked for explosives and had to be taken out of its TSA-approved case (not recognized in the Bahamas). The reasoning behind 2 checkpoints is hard to fathom but is probably to create a few more jobs for Bahamians. After all 3 of these checks you finally enter the departure lounge. Thanks to new ownership by Vancouver Airport Group (who is responsible for YVR Gatwick and the new Montego Bay Airport terminal) there are new shops such as Dunkin' Donuts Hard Rock Cafe (Souvenirs Only no food!) and Harley-Davidson. Prices are extremely high ($2.50 for a candy bar) so buy only if you need to. Also sit near your airline's boarding door. The jetways are still several hundred feet away but each airline has one set of double-doors where they conduct boarding. The PA is impossible to hear thanks to the massive echo in the building but you should be fine if you pay attention and sit near your gate. Finally at the jetway security personnel conduct random hand checks of luggage. They seem to pick the first person who walks towards the door so mix yourself in the pack to lessen the chance of being stopped. All in all NAS is changing. Vancouver Airport Group will steer the airport in the right direction down the road but it can't be fixed overnight. Just remember: get the earliest flight possible to your destination to avoid the 11am-2pm security rush for 1pm-4pm departures and get there 3 hours early (or more if desired). It takes 30-45 minutes to reach the airport from Atlantis/Downtown Nassau so plan for that too. This should help to make your departure from Nassau a bit less stressful. As many others have said NAS is below expectations for the capital and toruism hub of the Bahamas.

For example travelling to Toronto Montreal or London: simply check-in with the agent walk down 40 feet to the right to the security area and walk through the detector. After this quick security screening you have reached the ""international lounge area"" where you just sit and wait to board. It takes about 20 minutes in total if there isn't a big line up at check in. Just be there an hour early to make sure your bags get on the plane but they should since NAS is a small airport. The BIG problem is travel to the US. If this is your case you should be at the airport at least 2.5 hours in advance due to all the TSA regulations. The Bahamians are just following protocol but they sometimes exagerrate when they confiscate possessions (eg golfballs were taken from me) and they are rude and brush you off when you ask why. Expect at least 3 security checkpoints a carry-on search (1 on 2 chance of having that done) and for the unlucky a random spot check (1 on 6 chance of having that done). These are all measures the TSA has enforced in the Bahamas and have to be followed by Bahamian security personnel. The US Customs line can be really long and slow especially during lunch hour when the bulk of the flights are leaving. You would think they could have more agents out at that hour and save the lunch for 2 PM when things calm down. During Christmas break and spring break the Bahamian Customs area for arriving passengers can be packed and lines can take over an hour if 4-5 flights arrive at once. Otherwise it is extremely smooth. The biggest problem with the airport is the fact that it is just SO old and in dire need of renovation. The restaurant in the US departures lounge is way overpriced and the food is horrible. Ultimately the image the airport conveys is that of a tiny island airport you'd see at a Bahamian island like Long Island-- this is not an airport suited for the capital Nassau. Also the baggage area has no security and lost bags are thrown everywhere. It is a mess to see for tourists. But the baggage people who can be paid to place your bags on a chariot and wheeled out are helpful and informative. They are worth the $5 tip since they'll also get you a taxi/limo. Overall this airport is a 5/10 but people should not base coming to the Bahamas because of the airport. It is a great country with much to offer simply a little slow as the expressions go.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Customs and immigration very pleasant and quite fast - but then we were the only flight arriving at this time (4 pm on a Sunday). In spite of so few incoming passengers it took nearly 45 minutes for our luggage to arrive. Hate to think what it would be like if things were really busy.

However food offerings post-security are somewhat limited particularly since there is no airside access between concourses. The security areas are not large enough to process peak-time crowds leading to potentially lengthy waits.

That meant the duty free sealed glass items we purchased in the secure Milan terminal would not be allowed by TSA - they take it or you are escorted out right away.

Firstly the wait at the BA check in was about an hour with only 3 desks open higher classes of travel had their own check in desks and the staff there were largely unemployed. Heathrow took five minutes. The wait to go through security was about 40 minutes there was only one desk with one officer and three belts Heathrow has approximately twenty belts and a myriad of security officers and again took five minutes. Another officer did come to help the one on her own but all too late and it looked very inefficient indeed it was also unsafe and I saw a large bottle of water go through on someone's hand baggage that went unchallenged. Signage was also inaccurate telling you to remove your shoes and belt but nothing about wallets pockets etc therefore time was wasted in operatives repeatedly having to get customers to rectify their mistakes they were also rude and overbearing in their manner. This airport is a throwback to the 1970's with staff who have a real attitude problem. Once through security we were charged over 20 dollars for two small lagers.

I (and I'm sure many of the other reviewers) have entered more than one other country as a foreigner (as well as the US through other airports) and so will have a fair idea of what to expect from immigration control officials. I witnessed an incident of an officer being unduly rude to a fellow traveller in a similar way to an incident in a previous review so this must not be all that isolated or unusual. Waiting times for baggage and to go through other security areas could also be improved. I was not there at a particularly busy period and yet waiting times were significantly longer than one would expect from an airport of this size. Further signage and direction finding must be improved. There were several information points around the airport that would have probably been helpful if there had been anyone at them.

TSA people on departure were slow and officious to the nth degree.

newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,G Burns,NA,2009-07-21,Have used Newark two or three times a year most recently DUB-EWR-DTW on Continental. The airport has some positives - the monorail (Air Tran) fairly fast and easy. (There’s also a inter-terminal bus through the ugly underbelly of the airport – fast but hot little seating difficult for people with even minor mobility problems.) But echoing some of the other posts arriving internationally then connecting domestically is a zoo. Passengers have to do the work of baggage handlers in taking their bags after clearing customs into a snake line to a transfer point for rechecking onto domestic connections. There are not enough airport workers nor enough space nor enough explanatory signs for this transfer; passengers are confused and herded like cattle. There’s no indication that it’s occurred to the airport authorities that international arrivals involves some people who don’t speak English. Even well intentioned airport workers – clearly not trained to deal with international passengers - end up barking orders that even English speakers have trouble hearing and understanding. One is expected (again without any clear explanatory signs) to deposit one’s bags in one of the jumbled piles of luggage. It’s such a picture of chaos that no reasonable person would think that those bags will end up checked onto the appropriate destination. Thus the crowding gets worse as passengers are understandably hesitant to separate from their bags. TSA in Newark can be unbelievably slow. First why can’t the whole transfer from an international flight to a domestic connection be in a secure area so that passengers don’t have to clear security again? In any case my TSA line literally cleared no more than about one passenger a minute; some people surely missed their flights.

You have to guess on your own whether the one to the left or one to the right will depart. And on top of that for no apparent reason you had to change the tram at terminal A to go to terminal B. Nothing tell you do so. You just have to guess seeing most of the people getting off the train. It was very confusing. The gate number for my flight was not listed even though flight was about to depart in less than an hour. Security had to be the slowest of any airport I have seen. Its not that there were lot people ahead of me - the TSA folks just looked lazy and clumsy thats all. They didn't have any incentive to expedite people faster.

I use this Airport about 3 times a year and my recent visit I found the new layout to be a negative customer experience. As you leave security you are straight into duty free shop which now gets clogged up with people dazzled by the shiny beads.

newcastle-airport,/airport-reviews/newcastle-airport,Newcastle Airport customer review,M Kennedy,NA,2009-11-12,Travel out of Newcastle at least once or twice a month on KLM to the Netherlands. Departure wise the airport is fine checking in and security never takes longer than 10-15 minutes and staff are mostly friendly and helpful. Facilities are passable but wouldn't like to be stuck there for more than a few hours. However if you're arriving it's a different story - have been stuck on the plane numerous times as we waited for a walkway or stairs. You'd think they didn't know we were coming. Also there always seem to be long queues at immigration - I know we live in days of heightened security but I never have a problem at Schiphol which always seems to have the same number of officials on duty as NCL. Baggage reclaim is just as bad always seems to be a long wait and don't even think about the words 'priority baggage'.

The gate areas are probably next for a face lift and the wooden stairs and dirty carpets really need to be scrapped!

newquay-airport,/airport-reviews/newquay-airport,Newquay Airport customer review,A Johnson,United Kingdom,2013-01-14,Just to reiterate the frustrations of other users at Newquay. I collected and dropped off 2 separate visitors last month in the 5min drop off area which was totally empty apart from my car as the airport was not at all busy and have now received no less than 3 separate fines for £92 each. On one occasion I overstayed the 5 mins by 2 min 10 seconds another by 1min 30 seconds and the last by a mere 1 min and 2 seconds. This is a switched on outfit that have all the technology and correct signage to be just about covered by the law so unfortunately I can't see any way of fighting these charges we are totally at the mercy of these people and the way they unscrupulously make their money. My real gripe however is not at the parking company but with Newquay Airport Authorities and the fact that they have adopted and sanctioned this approach ostensibly to further tax the users of this struggling enterprise. I think this is incredibly short sighted and negligent management. How can whoever is in charge truly believe that this is the correct approach when the airport so desperately needs to attract more loyal users and advocates unless there is a serious gain which we are unaware of? Regarding the £5 tax that all travellers have to pay to fly from Newquay I can't think of any other commercial enterprise in the world that charges it's users a tax for the pleasure of being an already paying customer. In addition to all of this the airport has a generally disorganised and unfriendly feel which is a shocking first impression or lasting final memory of our beautiful county. I will definitely vote with my feet when I fly in and out of the county from now on which is at least 8 times a year and also tell visiting friends to fly into Exeter from now on. The additional 40 mins drive each way to is a small price to pay. Newquay is seriously in need of a management shakeup to bring in a team who have a focus on its long term viability and who want to treat the customers with the dignity and respect they deserve and provide an experience worthy of the county. If you treat customers in the right way they become your best advocates which with cumulative effect will be far more valuable than the fees they are generating via these enforced taxes.,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

I fly out of here once about once a year. My only current complaint relates to a pre-check-in security inspection on a recent international departure. We had purchased a small (12 cm across) very fragile ceramic plate on our trip. We carefully packed this plate in our carry-on luggage. During a hand inspection at security the inspector demanded that this plate be placed in our checked luggage since it could be used as a weapon (she motioned how you could hit someone over the head with it). Believe me it seemed an incredible concept that you could injure someone with this small thin incredibly fragile plate. Yet the inspector persisted and we anxiously placed the plate in our checked luggage. The amazing thing was that in the duty free store in international departures (long last the final inspection) the place is selling huge strong appearing ceramics which one really could use to cause damage.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

During my last visit (26 Oct 2012) I was subject to a new rip off they have devised. They advertise parking deals which have to be purchased in advance so I asked to buy the 6 month deal for the advertised tariff of 340 euros. The guy took my money wrote out my receipt and prepared a little plastic 'credit card' for me to use for entry and exit. When I asked why my expiry date was shown as '31st March 2013' he explained that all parking contracts have to start on the first day of the month so despite the date of purchase being 26th Oct my pass had to start on 1st October. Furthermore there was an additional 20 euro fee to issue the card! My other memory of Nimes is the airport restaurant. Service there was so sloppy and slow that despite having nearly two hours available it was never possible to eat all of your rather poor quality overpriced 3 course meal without missing your flight. Other gripes - The little newspaper / book shop closed in 2010 and has only recently reopened I would say in summary that I only use Nimes Airport if I have to.

The introduction of new airport transit buses has modernised things but the older truck and trailer is still around for added character. A resurfacing and lengthening of the runway is in progress so gradually all things will improve. Immigration is ok if you follow the rules and accept that it will take time. Luggage appears fairly quickly but the traveller must expect to have all incoming baggage checked and even X-rayed. The key to travel is correct paperwork relax don't expect slick service learn some local language and don't get stroppy when everything appears to stop. Remember the staff have the control and can may your life a misery if you give them cause. Also don't be overwhelmed with the onslaught from the rabid taxi touts as soon as you exit into the public area. Please remember that easy travel into and out of Ukraine is a recent thing and attitudes take time to change.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,S Healey,United Kingdom,2014-01-06,I would have to agree with B Munro's review regarding this airport particularly with regards to lines at immigration (good practice for waiting in line at the theme parks). I spoke to one woman who had already been standing in line for an hour. It was a weekend arrival but again only 6 desks were open out of the 30 or so in total they have there. Our flight was the second of the three to arrive that day from the UK and by the time this flight had started to line up a couple more desks had opened. The blame for that lies with the CBP so this is out of the hands of the airport management. Baggage was again placed on the floor of the carousels for people to find once immigration formalities were completed. Passengers still have the option of either taking their cases onto the train or to put these on the transfer carousel to be collected at the main terminal.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,A Johnson,NA,2009-06-09,On the whole Orlando International Airport is a very enjoyable airport to transit through. The only two problems seem to be security queues and rental-car check-in queues. The security issue has significantly been improved over the 12 years I have been transiting through the airport albeit queues could be around 15-25 minutes at peak times over at Concourse B when the Virgin Atlantic British Airways & Lufthansa International flights depart. The problem with rental car check in has been improved in the last few years. The worst does seem to be Alamo however Dollar seems to be the best contender especially during peak times around 14:00-17:00 with queue to car (Side B) in less than 15 minutes. Overall Orlando is a great and relaxing airport to transit through and I would recommend it to anyone traveling to Florida especially internationally. With the expected terminal renovations it should make the experience even better.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Its much smaller than Orlando International (MC0) and therefore much quicker to pass through. On our last visit on 17th August 2014 there was a 15 minute wait for immigration friendly staff and once through our luggage was already on the carousel. Straight into the car hire office and out in 5 minutes driving down Lake Mary Boulevard within 30 minutes of landing. fantastic. Compare this to MCO where you would still be queuing in immigration.

Now for the down fall the return journey checked in at Sanford just fine but then asked where we could get something to eat before going through to departures only to be told there was nothing until your in the departure hall. Once in the departure hall all we found there was this tiny food court selling sandwiches burgers hot dogs and chicken curry. We settled for burger fries and a soft drink each and were expecting to pay between $10 and $15 for the food but when the cashier asked for almost $33 we were a little dumb struck. As for the rest of the departure hall if your not in to buying duty-free or over priced newspapers there is not a lot else to do. So as a word of warning to any future traveler If you have to travel through Sanford-Orlando Airport then take your own food and drink in with you but if you can use Orlando International Airport and avoid Sanford-Orlando all together you will have a better experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Waiting time was average. A good point rental cars booth are very easy to find at short walking distance and same for the car park. The railway station is also within the terminal building easy to find and an excellent idea in winter. At departure safety queue is quite long the terminal certainly boasts the highest ratio of bars and snacks (with lots of customers even in the afternoon) compared to its size. Bad thing is that the number of available seats at the gates is ridiculously small and as our flight was delayed with very little information had to wait standing at the gate.

When the airport gets too crowded it seems the personnel loose their overview on things and everything quickly falls apart with insane lines. Staff usually helpful. Lighting and colors are odd as everything feels grey and dimmed. Why? No decent view of the runways and aircraft coming in leaving. No place for spotters inside the terminal. Go over to the old terminal building for spotting if needed. Shops are overpriced and should be avoided at all times. Pizza Hut overpriced but yummy. First time I went to OSL in 2001 everything was a mess and their baggage system was wrecked. Thankfully much has been improved since then but the colors design and shops leaves much to be desired.

I travel in and out of this airport about twice a month on business. The SAS self check-in terminals have become overloaded by the increase in summer traffic. They're often out of service resulting in a serious bottleneck as travellers line up with big bags. These kiosks are made for business and frequent travellers and seem to confuse many elderly and foreign travellers increasing the delays. I flew two weeks ago and it felt like in was in Heathrow. For travellers in summer 2011 beware that the Airport train (expensive but usually v efficient) won't run past Lillestrom. You have to get out and use a shuttle bus that will drop you somewhere downtown. The Flybus service is cheaper and more reliable.

I have been in Star Alliance airline lounges in many cities in Europe USA Asia and Australasia and while the lounge had pleasant amenities what is wrong with providing some decent food?

During this time another flight arrived (from outside the UK) and miraculously they all had their luggage within 20 minutes. On our return we were checking in with a member of staff who was clearly incompetent. We were waiting for over an hour to do this and we were halfway down the queue who knows how long the people at the back took. At one point this member of staff threatened to walk off picking up her handbag and gesturing. Why this happened no one could understand. Upon getting onto the plane (straight from check-in due to the massive delays) there was no air- conditioning for half an hour. It became very hot and everyone had sweat dripping down their foreheads we complained to the cabin crew who promptly informed us this was due to Palma airport's engineering department since the ground power unit (or something like that) was out of action.

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,L Cadwallader,NA,2010-10-10,"It's ironic that my last posting on PMI should have referred to wheelchair passengers because on this latest transit my wife had temporarily joined their ranks. The PMI pages on the AENA website were a useful guide to what type of assistance we could expect but when we actually landed at Palma my wife needed to stretch her legs after 2 hours of sitting and so we walked slowly from the gate instead of waiting for one of the 7 wheelchairs which would have been needed for our particular flight. For our return journey we did use the PRM facilities which didn't work quite as smoothly as those at LPL. None of the special call points around the airport seemed to be operative so we had to report to the information desk in the centre of the check-in area for assistance to be summoned. We then had a wait of perhaps 15 minutes before assistance arrived a form was filled in (with copy attached to the wheelchair) and we were then taken to the special security area for PRM passengers. There appeared to be a relay system after security but we were allowed to make our own way to the gate rather than wait for the next available ""pusher"". And yes we did have the gate number long before it appeared on the screens for everyone else. A delay to our flight resulted in a Belfast flight being allocated to our gate and more wheelchair handlers arrived ready to assist PRM passengers onto that flight so we quickly had to explain that we weren't going to Belfast! One of the handlers was good enough to ring through to ask for the new gate for the LPL flight and even to wheel my wife to it. When eventually our flight was called PRM passengers were the first to board with more handlers to wheel them along the airbridge to the door of the plane. Unfortunately my wife's ""pusher"" talked loudly on his mobile phone most of the time leaving only one hand free to steer the chair and failing to avoid the bumps! The only time when he came off his mobile phone was when he saw an associate some 20 yards away down the airbridge and had a shouted conversation with him. My wife was glad to board the plane! So though PMI has a clearly defined system for PRM passengers its operation was not as smooth or efficient as we had hoped though no one was actually unhelpful. We didn't see any of the motorised buggies which used to transport PRM passengers so efficiently in the past but perhaps they are reserved for passengers being taken to the more distant gates as on this occasion we flew into and out of area A. As for PMI itself it was less busy than we've seen it on some occasions and there were few queues....but then we bypassed the main security area.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It was pretty quiet when we arrived on a Saturday morning after a long taxi round to area D though there was a queue at passport control as 2 flights ex-UK arrived almost simultaneously. Departing on a Tuesday morning though was positively eerie: the place was almost deserted and at security there were just 4 staff and 2 of us! I've never seen an airport so quiet. Yet even with only 3 flights departing during our 2 hours there we still had to wait a while before our gate number appeared on the screens. I can't understand the reluctance of airports to announce the designated gate well in advance because the staff who take wheelchair passengers to their departure points always seem to know which gate long before the number is displayed on the screens. Despite checking in online I even had to go to an easyJet desk (also deserted apart from the staff) simply to find out which area (D again) to head for after security.

Both inward and outward flights involved bus transfers from/to remotish stands and through area A which was fairly crowded. We were told on our return flight that one runway was closed so perhaps all flights were concentrated to just part of the airport. The result was shorter walks but busier concourses. Perfunctory passport control on arrival long queues at security on departure though the queues did move reasonably quickly.

No delays at passports in either direction and quite swiftly through security on the return journey. We didn't have to take our watches off this time but there were notices advising that certain types of footwear would have to be removed e.g. ladies full length boots.

Everything seems to work well but there could be more lifts because access from car parking/car hire collection or return to check-in usually involves going up or down one floor with a laden trolley. Transfer of less mobile passengers is usually efficient but on our return journey from Palma to Liverpool yesterday the two elderly and less mobile members of our party were deposited at the wrong location and I had to start searching for them! Luckily I found them fairly quickly but it could have been a real problem. Security is thorough and slow moving: even wrist watches have to be removed.

On departure we found a very busy ground side concourse but check in on our Iberia flight to Miami was quite orderly and efficient. Don't forget to pay the $20 departure tax but there are airport staff cruising around making sure you've paid! Airside is where we found the big surprise - a shopping concourse to rival Heathrow's! You could buy just about anything there and at very competitive prices. A view of one of the runways completes the picture. One thing was bizarre though - aircraft taking off in opposite directions on the same runway depending on which end was closer!,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
papeete-airport,/airport-reviews/papeete-airport,Papeete Airport customer review,Harun Rathore,NA,2005-03-31,Arrived at and departed from PPT on a two-week Easter holiday. Some of the older comments are indeed true. Some need explanation. It is true that the immigration for non-FP and non-EU-nationals takes a while but it is nothing compared to the ordeals you sometimes have to go through when arriving in the USA. (I know what I am talking about. I had to cahnge in LAX before going to PPT.) The staff at PPT is overall very friendly – even at night – there is a little band to welcome you with traditional Tahitian music. The airport employees do not usually grunt the problem simply is the following: If you arrive at Tahiti and you do not understand French you are as lost as a person coming to the UK or the USA with little or no knowledge of English would be. However when you leave PPT to return back home  you have to pass ONE security control (screening of all your luggage and your body) before you can check in your luggage then you have to leave the security area for some reason no one was able to explain. You pass through a door and are once again in the airport’s main hall. You then have to go through passport control and have to go through ANOTHER security control where they screen your carry-on luggage and your body again. After that you arrive in the departure lounge. The latter can be crowded if two planes depart at the same time but there is one more public waiting room on the second floor and that was surprisingly empty. Very few passengers seemed to go there because the signs only read Airport Lounge. When it comes to boarding before you leave the terminal to walk out to your plane there is a THIRD security check. Security staff pick out some passengers to check them and their carry-on luggage by hand.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Landed at 4pm. I went to flight connections along with a number of passengers from same flight. Terminal was in lockdown due to security alert. Other passengers who were transferring to other terminals were allowed to go. I was left alone with airport staff security and soldiers waiting for alert to end. They were all very polite but there was a lot of confusion. Once security alert was over I was allowed to proceed. Had to go through security scanning where an unopened bottle of water I had got on my flight from Tokyo was confiscated. This seemed ridiculous as I had clearly come through flight connections and got the water on my flight. There was a good selection of restaurants but very expensive. I went to the food court. The service was poor staff were awol and unfriendly. Restaurant wasn't very clean either. Toilets were also not very clean. Was in noticeable contrast to Tokyo.

RER B from central Paris got off at stop and wondered where the heck we were. Finally got out of the train stop - had to use our tickets to get back out - and onto another train to Terminal 1. By the way Terminal 3 is between Terminals 1 and 2. Go figure. Got to Icelandair ticket counter in Hall 2 3.5 hours before our flight to find 100+ people already waiting to check in but no agents in sight. After waiting in line (with empty stomachs) for at least 2 hours we got checked in and luggage sent off. We weren't given any instruction on where to go next but when asked the agent said it was just around the wall. That entryway was closed so we walked to the next and went up the very weird escalator tube. Getting through security was no problem but much to our dismay there was hardly any food available on the other side. We had to settle for some horrible over- priced sandwiches. Nowhere to sit except on the floor since there aren't enough seats. Take out the stupid Playstation 3 machines and put in more seats!

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,Marc Guillemard,France,2014-03-31,"This review is regarding terminal 2G. This is important as performance varies a lot in this huge and very heterogeneous airport (although never outstanding). 2G is dedicated to ""Schengen"" flights (to and from countries under the Schengen agreement no passport control) for the AF group. For commuting passengers it is important to know that the usual commuting nightmare at CDG is a the worst if one of your flights is from this terminal as it is far away from the other ones and the only access is a bus shuttle. When you fly from this terminal the positive point is that queues both at luggage drop off and at safety control are usually very short. Also positive is the fact that you walk to the (small max is 100 seaters) planes to board like in a small provincial airport. Now the negative points: I don't know who selected the food ""services"" in CDG. Except for 2 decent places in the whole 9 terminals it is always bad but the only one in 2G is just terrible and much too expensive for what it is eat a sandwich at the small stand before safety control if you can. The terminal itself is bland and as everywhere in CDG the seating is insufficient. They call the doors in theory 20 minutes before boarding but manage to be a little late making boarding more mess that it should be. The AF lounge is ridiculously small not very comfortable and with minimum amenities. This is supposed to be a place where you don't stay long but you need to always take a good safety margin when you drive to the Paris area so waiting here is not a very pleasant experience.

All personnel I have met through these years have been polite friendly and English-spoken as opposed to what many reviews here claim. But the airport itself has been big confusing and for a long time now a building-site. So to be fair to the airport and its constructors: This time (Oct 26 and Nov 11) all went smooth. Outbound: Easy shuttle from 2G to 2F. And: 2F is fine. Lots of light modern lots of space. Homebound: I had a 1h and 15min connection and was quite nervous from 2E to 2G in such a short time? Believe it or not: it took 25 minutes! Arrived at 08.25 am on a full AF B747. I was politely guided by an English speaking agent who followed me to a special arrival-security-check for passengers heading for 2G which had no line. Then to a shuttle-bus taking me to 2G in 4 minutes where I passed through passport control in 5 seconds and I was at the waiting area of terminal 2G with time for coffee and croissant.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Depending what your terminal is your experience can go from very poor to good or acceptable. Generally I have never had any problems with airport personnel they are usually always polite and willing to help. Maybe the people working for French customs in the train station could be less invasive and more discreet. Terminal 2f is old and once past passport and security check it gets even worse at baggage deposit. Terminal 2g is more spacious and more user friendly but difference between new and older 2g terminal wing is very obvious. Generally this airport has been poorly designed but once past baggage deposit passport and security you walk through an airport with poorly designed duty free shops and nearly no food outlets. Generally speaking this airport needs to rethink why it exists and how to service its customers faster and better. I am still travelling through this airport surely because I like this place but more because of schedules of airlines I fly with using this hub so lets hope for some drastic improvement in the future.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,A Snelling,United States,2013-08-04,I travel frequently in Europe and I absolutely avoid changing planes at CDG due to the messes described by the other reviewers here. Those comments are absolutely true. This time I was vacationing in France so I figured that just arriving and departing from CDG could not be that bad right? Wrong. Arriving at Terminal 1 proved to be an absolute disaster. The facilities are operating at a multiple of their capacities with too few restrooms for example. The baggage area was clearly too small for even one or two arriving planes; people crowding around while waiting for their luggage created a jam where no one could get in or out or around. There was just not enough square footage for everyone and it is probably a dangerous situation. Even getting through the final customs check to embrace your loved ones was a crowded bottleneck involving a pushing/shoving battle just to somehow get through the maddening crowd. The parking and layout of the rest of the airport is confusing and illogical but we figured it out. Departing from Terminal 1 is even worse. Check in is okay but once you go through the first boarding pass check (ticketed passengers only) you take the escalator upstairs to see the real problem. You will stand in line for a minimum of one hour to get through the passport control. There were only two windows open for all departing passengers and those two officials took their time! I was up there two hours before my departure time and I nearly missed the plane. I have never just walked on a plane and had them shut the door but this is what happened. Everyone was in the same boat. The boarding announcements started while we were still in this non-moving line and everyone got very nervous. To run to the gate while they make the final boarding announcement and then realize you still need to go through security. It is all very unsettling. I would advise anyone who is using Terminal 1 to be upstairs three hours before your departure time. Perhaps this way you will be able to have a coffee before your flight but that is doubtful based on how things run upstairs.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,Marc Guillemard,France,2013-04-21,"I have already written a number of reviews about CDG but never about terminal G and in CDG every terminal has its own peculiarities. It is dedicated to the ""Schengen"" flights in other words flights between European countries that have signed an agreement suppressing customs between them. If you are on foot or rental car you must take the internal railway in one of the other terminals. This looks very much like a small city airport where (if you are lucky) you walk to the plane (otherwise it's a bus sometimes for ridiculously small distances). The good thing is that the baggage check and safety control are most of the time very quick then you arrive in the single hall. Although there is a lot of seating and the rotation is quick (bigger planes here are A320s) it may be difficult to find a seat at certain times. Flights gates are normally given 20 minutes before boarding but quite often less so it can be a rush. Main concerns are the food : only one ""snack"" with insufficient seating where you can have some kind of fancy sandwiches and salads and I've never have one that was good even the very limited choice of cakes is bad. It's to the point that putting a McDonalds would be a huge improvement!

Hall 1 is mainly used for medium-sized destinations (with turboprop and Fokker aircraft) and is my preferred one - security checks are usually quick boarding area is bright with sufficient seating areas. Hall 2 is dedicated to LaNavette shuttle flights to Bordeaux Toulouse Marseille and Nice - at peak hours waiting time at security can be very long and the boarding area is cramped. Furthermore as LaNavette flights run every hour or even every 30 minutes it can become confusing and difficult to locate the right boarding gate! Hall 3 uses only departure gate 30 for domestic flights - no need to rush through security as tha gate has only toilets and no other facilities. Hall 4 is used rather for tourist destinations with larger aircraft (A320/A321 to Biarritz Toulon and Corsica) - the boarding area gets crowded rather rapidly and the small bar has rip-off prices. ORY is much closer to downtown Paris than CDG but is unfortunately missing a fast and reliable train connection. Avoid the Air France coaches and the OrlyVal train which charge rip-off prices - around €10 one-way. The OrlyBus shuttle is cheaper but is always overcrowded. My preferred alternative is to use the RER C suburb train: first catch a shuttle bus from the airport to the train station ""Pont de Rungis - Aeroport Orly""; from there a RER train run every 15-30 minutes to downtown Paris.

This time we landed at CDG coming from Hamburg. Everything seemed to work well and we went to a gateway (CDG is famous for having a high percentage of planes that load and unload by bus especially short and medium haul).

This is pretty old fashion airport so do not expect jetways fontains or wifi hotspots but fairly enough for easy transport means and connections. Swift immigration no checked baggage so headed for the Orlyval train in 10 mins after landing. The only point is one (!) counter for train tickets - fairly too few to manage todays traffic at the peak times (there are another two ticket machines accepting banknotes or credit cards as well). Departing on Thursday mid-evening easy navigation to the check-in though you have to slalom between some queues sometimes. Two counters for an 737 flight just okay staff friendly and working fast. Reaching the departure hall is a matter of walking steps up and down (due to the reconstruction) first you can reach understaffed passport control (3 out of 8 counters open) security just before the respective hall (was forced to remove my belt on the other side nobody cared the liquids in my x-rayed bag). This may be a stuck point so beware you slower movers and take some 30 mins to reach the G hall. Tried to buy some drink before security to take with but shops did not offer the security pack (I wonder if they would when purchasing a bottle of wine or scotch?). Airside there was just one small snack bar and one delights shop there. A lack of seating for a full plane pax load waiting at the gate. A bit chaotic gate staff changed by PA the gate number their english was from terrible (rather a nose sounds than words) to non-existent (only French announcement for passengers to another international destinations).

This is not the worst one but the architecture is all show and nothing practical therefore efficiency is difficult to obtain. The new thing when you fly Air France in economy is that you do everything yourself : print your boarding card but also your luggage label that you have to fix yourself to your suitcase (do not forget to take off and keep the receipt). When you have queued to leave your suitcase you go through passport and luggage control which is not the worst but not the best either. Try to get a sandwich and you find that the famous architect has completely underestimated the necessary seating space in the 2 small underground snack bars as well as the restrooms which could be cleaner. Then go to boarding gate and go through the most incredible experience CDG has created so far : we went down the stairs to a bus that drove 5 to 10 minutes in the airport to leave us not at the plane but at another gate!

paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,R Lubbers,United States,2012-06-04,Easily the worst airport we had to navigate on an around-the-world itinerary. Arrival on Air France wasn't too bad with only a modest delay in baggage arrival. Departing on British Airways was unpleasant. The airport bus could not drop us at 2A due to construction so dropped us on the other side of the airport requiring us to heist our luggage. The path was extremely poorly marked. Terminal 2A is dark looks as though it is 40 or even 50 years old lengthy lines at some airline check-in spots. Had a pleasant quick check-in at BA had a short line for security (business class) but the check-in area was extremely warm and the security area even warmer. Personnel were reasonably pleasant and courteous however. Some of the gate areas were pleasant and cool - why couldn't the rest of the airport be equally well air-conditioned? We had no real options as we wanted to include Paris in our itinerary but I would go out of my way to avoid CDG in the future.

You can wait up to 30 mins for a transfer bus to arrive then take up to 20 mins to change terminals. I regularly take a bus transfer from 2E to 2B and takes 50 mins for this. Staff at the Air France 2E transfer desks are extremely slow I timed them one day and the average was 10 mins to deal with each person. Frustrating when all I needed was to get a boarding pass because the automatic check-in ones were not working.

Terminal 1 is a consequence of the French politicians' love for ""contemporary"" - obsolete architecture and completely atrocious for passengers. Terminal 2 ABCD are too small badly designed no air- con and in all Paris airports the common point is the huge queue at passport control where you are lucky if 2 cops are there to control 3 or 4 long-haul flights ! which is a disgrace compared even to some Middle-East countries. Other common points are dirtiness and lack of toilets lack of moving sidewalks. This time flew from 2F which is slightly better more modern more space more available seats. Nevertheless was shocked to discover there is no lift to take you to departure level so manage with your suitcase in escalators - and no air- conditioning in the waiting rooms which is an issue because although in this one the ceilings are very high the architect has put windows everywhere.. A last word of advice for foreign travellers if your ticket read 2G be aware that this is a (bad) joke this is a totally different terminal and you need a 15 mn bus shuttle to go there after having left your rental car at 2 E/F.

Check-in is usually pretty quick and there is a McDonald's and some ATM's etc before you go through security. Security (and immigration for international departures) are pretty quick and efficient. Once you are in the departure area there are a few sad shops and one snack bar. The terminal offers a nice view of the tarmac. Don't bother to arrive too early for your flight.

There is only one runway and one small terminal to cater to international and domestic flights. Once the aircraft is docked at the terminal the passengers used the aerobridge (all flights regardless of international and domestic) to enter the terminal. The terminal is split into two sections which are the international and domestic sections. The state of the restrooms are very appalling. There are some small cafeteria and duty-free shops when one moves along the terminal but most of the items sold there are not too appealing. If you wish to purchase some items found in Penang only the airport is a good place to buy as they are stocked up with many authentic Malaysian goodies. The third level is where the airline lounges are. As I flew SIA and MAS in first and business class before I got the chance to use the lounges. The MAS lounge is beautiful and one should try it. It is situated looking towards the runway so you can see the different aircrafts when landing or take- off. The SIA lounge is a little dark and quiet but is still a good place to rest. On my return flight check-in was average. The staff were not grumpy but also not outstanding. There is only a small area to check-in.

In order to get to Concourse F you have to use a downward escalator - there were too many people going to that area at the time I was there so there was a very long line (Disney-style!) to go down the escalator waiting for buses. Once the line started moving the person who was supposed to control the flow of humanity completely failed because too many people were queuing up at the base of the escalator and people were stopping at the bottom! There would have been a pileup if I hadn't said loudly ""Move move move move move!!"" and people at the bottom moved. But she completely failed.

Queues for TSA grow quite long at peak times and since there isn't much room for people to wait near the checkpoints the queues snake back down the corridors toward the ticket counters.

Our flight landed in a 10mins early (Easyjet from LGW) and had to wait on the taxiway for 5 mins as a plane was leaving from our allocated stand a little bit late. We had to disembark by air stairs and walk a long distance to the terminal building. Immigration took 10 mins and as we were only there for a long weekend we had no baggage. There was a large taxi rank which was a delight from our 30min wait at Edinburgh for a taxi last year. Flying out we got at the airport 3 hours before our 10.10 departure (easyjet to LGW). We were expecting long queues at security and customs. However there wasn't and we were left in the departures lounge with around 10 duty free shops and cafes. Annoyingly they said go through customs (for UK and intercontinental flights separate departure area upstairs) 90 mins before departure and around 50 of us did. However a hazard was the escalator was kept running and we had to cram in to a small area for 25 mins before they opened up customs. We boarded 35 mins before (inbound was 40mins early) but there was a long walk down ramps (quite odd) our plane was at a stand the other side. It took a while to get down to the planes and a Ryanair was disembarking and pax had to walk across the ramp which caused a 10min hold up. (We where last to board before hold up) We push backed 10mins late and departed in just 2 mins. We arrived 5 mins early.

portland-airport,/airport-reviews/portland-airport,Portland Airport customer review,M Atkinson,United States,2014-09-28,"There's a lot of bad and good to say about Portland International Airport. First the good: PDX has a lot of restaurants and shops to visit. Prices aren't too outrageous and it feels organized and easy to navigate. I've read a lot of complaints about the TSA in Portland but I've experienced very few problems especially compared to other airports. The lines usually move fast and they don't make me remove all my liquids from my luggage which some airports do. Now the bad: the pick up for PDX is a mess. It doesn't need to be but it really is. First of all is the smoking problem. Everywhere along the pick up line are signs that say ""No Smoking."" There is a designated smoking area at the very start of the line where cars come in. However whenever I'm at PDX there are smokers standing all over the place in any location along pick up. I have yet to see PDX enforce them. The second issue with pick up is that there are signs posted everywhere asking people to not wait. That's why there is a very useful easy to find cellphone waiting area nearby. However often the pick up lane will be entirely blocked with parked cars who are still waiting for people to get out of baggage claim or off their flights. I've watched multiple cars sit in the same spot for over fifteen minutes while the drivers played on their cell phones. On many occasions I've picked up and been picked up at this airport and if anything I've always seen cars blocking the entire pick up line with no one in sight to pick up. There was no one to enforce the many signs stating this was illegal. It's been a problem several times which is why I'm finally writing about it. Weekends are the worst and I usually try to avoid that but sometimes that's impossible. Let's use common sense PDX! I can understand giving people a few minutes so the person being picked up can run to the car from wherever they were waiting outside and drop their luggage in the trunk but anything over five minutes to fifteen plus minutes is ridiculous.",NA,NA,NA,5,3,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

providence-airport,/airport-reviews/providence-airport,Providence Airport customer review,Michael Wiggins,United States,2012-06-26,"(June 27 2012) As a frequent user of the Providence T.F. Green airport (PVD) I will say that the airport is a true four star facility. While it still is a small airport by most standards it has a surprising number of plusses that as has been said by others to be a reasonable alternative to Boston Logan (BOS) but only if you are flying within the US (no international arrivals or departures except to Toronto). Upon entry into the departures area the ticket stands are almost all within the same distance from the entry doors to the terminal. You don't have to hike a mile to get to Southwest and 10 feet to American like many other airports do. TSA security is also right there so one doesn't have to hike for that either. The TSA crew does their job well but they get backed up during the 6-8 AM rush. After TSA the main passageway is quite wide and is always clean. It is set up so when you leave TSA you are located dead centre in the passageway (equidistant to either end of the terminal) so there's not as much walking to do. There are plenty of concessions. Signage is good. The seats at the gates are what I would rate as not bad not terrific. Upon arrival the walk to the baggage claim is good with a ""detour"" that keeps the arriving passengers to not have to deal with departing passengers. Waiting for your luggage is longish sometimes but good overall. There's even a Starbucks in the baggage claim area! There is now a connecting passageway that takes you to a train station that is served by the MBTA (important: weekdays only! With any luck this will change in the future.) (AMTRAK for some reason won't stop there.) where you can get to downtown Providence Boston and most points in between. Next to the train station is a new parking garage. We're supposed to get a lengthened main runway in the near future but with today's economy that may get put on the back burner.

pune-airport,/airport-reviews/pune-airport,Pune Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,NA,2007-12-24,The one thing that strikes me about this airport is that it's becoming woefully undersized for the amount of traffic coming to the city these days. Getting in the terminal isn't bad but once inside the security line snakes almost all the way back to the door (though in fairness it only took about 15 minutes to clear). Sitting space in the terminal area is also inadequate. My flight was at midday which you would think is a slow time of day traffic wise yet the waiting area was overflowing with people many sitting on the floor in any free space they could find. On the plus side the trip to the plane from the building is very short as is the taxi time. One thing to note - unlike at HYD MAA or the DEL domestic terminal the security guard at the terminal door checks your photo ID before allowing you inside the building. Not knowing this I had to fumble through my bag to get mine and my wife's which got me a rather unpleasant stare and what I presume were some choice words in Hindi.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The arrivals hall had all the facilities one would expect of a modern airport but was let down by very long immigration queues. We had to queue for just over an hour. There were two queues one for nationals of Ecuador (plus nationals of a few other South American countries) and the second for Foreigners. There simply weren't enough desks open for Foreigners but there were plenty open for Ecuadorians so they never had to wait more than maybe 10 or 15 minutes. This really needs to be rectified and also there needs to be clear signage as to which queue to join. In front of us was a couple from Peru who could have used the short queue had it been clearly marked. On the day of our arrival (3 Sept 2014) the new road from the airport to Quito had just been opened that very same day so the journey to the centre took us just 45 minutes even though it was a busy time of the day.

Bit of a shock on arrival but should be fabulous when finished. Befitting a gorgeous island such as Rarotonga. Previously RAR didn't separate Arrivals and departures - bit of a problem for the once weekly flight to/from LA. No airbridges in the new terminal planned from the renderings I could see. So still a bit of a problem to/ from aircraft when a tropical downpour arrives as it want to do. Reason being this is such a tiny aerodrome with short runway of approx 2300m ( just enough for a 777). Accordingly turnaround and parking area for aircraft precludes a fixed airbridge. New departure area will still have the outside garden area so you can have one last look over the airfield to the beautiful mountain peaks before boarding. On another note duty free no longer the stupendous bargain it once was. Still pretty good compared to many big airports around the world.

I also found out that I could not get my NOVA points in the terminal and I was able to get them at the office when I picked up my boarding cards which should of been given to me at check in. The food in Lido was the worse I had eaten in Latvia and the family members to had given us a lift to the aiport remarked that it was not the normal standard of Lido meals maybe we should of stopped at the main Lido in Riga rather than head for the airport to eat. Lido is a well known name in Latvia and I before have always had a very good meal at the airport but not this time. The tax free shop was staffed by two staff who were more interested in reading or talking to each other or to colleagues for prices were dearer than in down town Riga and in fact somelines had a mark up of nearly 50% compared to Rimini Maxima or Rigas Balsam shop also the shop did not carry any tobacco items.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

In the departure hall they have approximately ten check-in counters which seemed quite enough for a Sunday afternoon. The ""Schengen"" departure lounge after passing the security check however is hardly adequate. There were only two departures at that time an ATR 72 (70 seats) to Munich and a Boeing 737-500 (120 seats) to Luxemburg. These two were already two many for the few seats they have in the departure lounge. Moreover there is almost nothing you can do. There is an overpriced restaurant a an equally pricey souvenir shop.

Once you leave the customs area do not go to the first taxi booths but rather to the booths to the left in the main hall: they offer fixed cheap rates to the city centre.

The ugly and dirty terminals don't bother me so much but what amazes me is the sheer level of incompetence in the management of the passenger flow. Boarding a flight in Rome and immigration queues are controlled by the crowds there is no guidance and no one from the airlines helping it is a kind of first come first served or who pushes more gets in first. I was yesterday in the immigration queues with about 100 people and even though there were supposed to be EU and non EU queues people were moving in and out in between them jumping shoving pushing trying to get information there was no staff present no appropriate signage and to add insult to injury the passport control only spoke Italian. Boarding the flight was similar no delay announcement staff could not be bothered to answer questions or help no family priority no upgrades possible as staff would not talk. I love Rome and I would like to get back there but I think this airport needs some actual professional management. Unbelievable as it may sounds it is probably the worst airport I have been in Europe and I have travelled rather deep into Eastern Europe. In fact the only positive thing I can say about Fiumicino is that it makes CDG look good.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
rome-fiumicino-airport,/airport-reviews/rome-fiumicino-airport,Rome Fiumicino Airport customer review,R Marshall,United Kingdom,2014-06-13,A terrible and costly experience. We checked in with Alitalia 1.5 hours before our flight to London which was scheduled for 21.15. We thought this was reasonable timing not having been warned by our travel advisor or Alitalia about the 'normal' horrendous queuing problems at FCO. We got to Immigration control 45 minutes before our flight departure time. There were hundreds (no exaggeration) of people there trying to get through the non- EEC gates (my wife is American so we thought we had to go that way). Only two lines were open. The crowd was getting restless and eventually two more gates were opened where the Immigration officials merely looked at the cover of our passports and waved us through. By this time we had missed our flight by no more than a few minutes. We eventually made our way back to Alitalia ticketing (no easy task going the 'wrong' way through the airport). We had to pay 420 euros for a flight to a different London airport (London City) the following morning. To add the final insult there were no hotel vacancies so we had to spend the night on the departure lounge floor. No fun as we are both 70 years old! The airport experience is a good reason why we are never going back to Rome.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

We were for Terminal 3. After we got our bags checked in and boarding passes we hightailed it through to immigration/security prepared for horrid conditions but there were no issues whatsoever. Security was fast and efficient immigration was a little lax actually the officer took one look at the outside (only) of my Australian passport and I went through no problems. The airport was clean the toilets were clean. We walked around the shops for a while and bought a couple of things to fill in time more than anything. in fact there were loungers in front of some of the windows with great views onto the tarmac. I did have an attitude experience in one store when I tried to buy water the girl eventually paid us attention and rattled off something in Italian so we left the drinks on the counter and walked off to somewhere else to buy water.

It really pains me to see how low things have sunk and it is certainly true that in the third world it is possible to find much better airports. There are however two positive things: the transport links to Rome both by train and bus are decent also the four terminals are all interconnected so it is a fairly easy airport to connect compared with say Heathrow or CDG. The positives end here. This is basically a monster that has grown out of proportion architecturally ugly dirty dingy. The security lines as others have pointed out are totally unacceptable and I have witnessed borderline ugly scenes between stressed passengers and stressed security officers. The VIP lounges are pathetic the toilets dirty and smelly and the general atmosphere one of confusion and mayhem luggage delivery takes ages and the staff are tense and defensive.

The Mormon shuttle will take anyone of any religion to downtown and collect them later in the day and take them back to the airport free of charge. The only catch is you have to do a tour of the Temple Square complex which takes about 40 minutes and involves being guided by two young female missionaries. This tour is excellent but will involve your own religious beliefs being inquired about which I didn't mind but others may want to consider this.

I found this a bit ridiculous but I guess that's normal nowadays if you enter the US. Luggage took quite a while as it was a full 747 but afterwards I got through customs within seconds where a very friendly customs officer took my form. From there the BART station was a short stroll away and it is very cheap and quick to get in to town (USD 8.10). Departed on Southwest at T1 and found the experience not bad. Took the BART to the airport and then the SkyTrain to Terminal 1. Check-in was very quick and security was also quite efficient and fast. Facilities are so-so with a few places to eat and one or two newspaper shops. Terminal was quite crowded as some planes where delayed due to the weather. However the Southwest staff was friendly and kept us informed. It is a mixed bag but overall SFO is ok.,NA,NA,NA,3,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
san-francisco-airport,/airport-reviews/san-francisco-airport,San Francisco Airport customer review,J Drolet,NA,2009-04-22,On the domestic side flying in from Vancouver I was amazed how quickly I got my luggage & outside very fast. The international terminal is spacious though the departure hall seems somewhat foreboding. Security was very smooth and efficient. There is no free wi-fi here which is unfortunate. Otherwise I was impressed with the spaciousness of the Int'l Terminal which lends a great view of the tarmac and hills surrounding the city. In the domestic terminal checking in on United to fly back to Canada was a cattle call - crowded inefficient check-in area way too small and narrow.

Terminal A (the larger and newer of the 2 terminals) has been remodeled to add more windows and light and the dark filthy carpeting has been replaced. They still haven't bothered to install moving walkways despite the very long distances between the terminal entrance/exit and the farthest gates however and the narrow corridors and lack of floor space cause major crowding problems during peak times. Food and beverage options are very basic with overpriced and bad food. Terminal B is set for a major renovation. They will finally add jetways and build a new facility that brings it into the 21st Century. The renovation of the parking areas and airport access roads is nearly complete and the airport is now much easier to get in and out of by car.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The food options are overpriced and of poor quality. The airport is difficult to get to and requires navigation through downtown San Jose's horrible freeway system. The rental car kiosk is offsite and requires a long shuttle ride to get to/from the terminals. The only positive about this airport is that it's only 2 miles from downtown San Jose.

Does its best but is clearly well above its design capacity in terms of passenger volumes. Check-in is hampered by too little space between counters and the exit which results in chaotic snaking queues and no free space. This is particularly trying during cruise ship changeovers when passenger volumes are highest. Security screening is passable with fairly efficient staff. Airside services are ok for the Caribbean but there is little available space for seating in the waiting lounges. Clearing US customs here is easy as it is mostly small planes feeding in passengers.

santiago-de-chile-airport,/airport-reviews/santiago-de-chile-airport,Santiago De Chile Airport customer review,A Mackenzie,Canada,2011-12-09,I have been through this airport many times in the last few years. Overall I would it fair to good. Arriving international is usually ok as other travellers noted: if you hold a Canadian American Australian or Mexican passport you will have to pay the entry fee in a different line before proceeding to immigration. Lines are generally fast in the morning but can be slow in the afternoon. Immigration and customs officials are usually relaxed with the exception of plant/animal goods. If you are unfamiliar with Santiago I would recommend getting a taxi just before you exit the baggage claim area. Departing can be a little different. Depending on when you depart you can expect to wait. Check-in will be long in the early weekday morning and sometimes in the afternoon. If you are departing internationally you will again have to go through immigration. Again they are quick but it can take 20 min. If you are departing domestic security is lax but can be very long on weekday mornings due to high volume. International gate side has a decent selection of restaurants and shopping although expensive. Domestic side has a few stores and not as many places to eat. Overall the airport is clean and bright. Signage is good and easily visible. You can usually find quiet areas to relax if you have a long layover.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Duty free is very expensive. On a positive note the arrivals area was excellent very fast immigration and the hotel information desk was very helpful - down to advising me to pay for ground transportation - bus or mini van in US Dollars and to change my money downtown - as the change facilities at the airport charge high commission.

Upon arrival you are greeted by a wide arrival concourse with moving walkways rest rooms at regular intervals clear signage in both Portuguese and English high ceilings clean fresh look. Immigration took 4 minutes and most of that was talking to the immigration officer about the remarkable transformation. After that you are greeted by an unbelievably spacious luggage claim area. Bags still took a long time to arrive but this is normal for me. You also have a reduced immigration card to fill in. Certainly makes a difference after the long haul from Australia. Guarulhos Terminal 3 could be any modern airport in the world as compared to the run down shambles that used to greet you upon arrival. Absolutely no complaints at all.

I think the comments here are by and large fair. GRU is not somewhere you would choose to spend time but its not a bad place just struggling to cope with more people than it was built for and showing its age.

The airport also has many areas for relaxing too with many sleeping chairs and complimentary showers along with saunas. Aviation enthusiasts can spot departing and arriving planes from both runways located at either end of the terminal.

On my first leg I seemed to be the only person doing an international transfer so it was quick and easy. There was no one at the transfer desk so I made my way straight to security. The maze you walk through following the international transfer arrows was easy enough. On the return transferring was a nightmare. My flight landed at 4.30am along with at least 3 other flights and when we arrived in the transfer hall there was again no one at the transfer desk. I didn't see a single staff member anywhere for a good hour. I bypassed the desk it and waited in security line which at that point was also unmanned. Everyone waiting was confused about where to go and what to do. We didn't see a single staff member until nearly 6am when they told us we needed to go to the transfer desk first and kicked us all out of line. At that point several other flights had landed and we found ourselves at the back of the line. Took 1.5 hours before I finally got to the desk where they looked at my ticket and passport than waved me through. With probably more than 6 planes worth of people waiting they only had one lane open in security? That added another 45 minutes of wait time. So that was over 3 hours just to transfer flights.

Transiting to Japan with a 7-hour stopover we were ushered to the transit desk which is not airline-specific. Due to the very common delays on Chinese flights the most pressing flights were dealt with first. Passengers were dealt with as if they were causing problems for the staff rather than trying to do something which is carried out with ease at most international airports. I was asked why I didn't have a boarding pass for the final leg of my journey which could not be issued in London because the airline could not issue it there. All very annoying. A 7-hour stopover was reduced to 5 hours just by standing in the queue at the transit desk. Staff can be seen chatting happily which is very unprofessional and adds to the stress when things are going so slowly anyway. Do not expect anyone to smile.

This airport is one of the best I've travelled through. Arrivals are straightforward and there was no line at immigration (and unlike other airports they had lots of staff at the immigration desks). Customs was also pretty straightforward and in no time at all we were through and on our way into Singapore CBD. Departures were again very very efficient with fast check in and immigration. Terminal 3 was very clean and modern with lots of duty free shops and we also visited Terminal 2 (looking a bit dated) to see the M&Ms Concept Store. Although we made a bee line for the lounge once we'd made our duty free purchases I could see there was a lot for people to do in the airport with cinemas gardens shops and eateries.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Going from one terminal to another is not a hassle although it does seem the shopping is simply repeated from one to the other except for the Butterfly Garden and other such attractions there is not much point in visiting the other terminals as every terminal is pretty much self-sufficient.

On the way into Singapore the immigration queue was quite slow and a few people were pulled aside at the immigration counter. There are individual queues to the various counters and maybe they should adopt the one queue system that feeds into the various counters when you get to the front as in other airports. Bags were in the luggage reclaim area very promptly and out we went into Singapore. Hats off to Changi on our return journey! We were on a transit in Changi from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland and due to some snag with our booking the airline could not check our bags through to Auckland. In Changi we were made to go through immigration get our bags go through customs then check in again on the landside go through immigration again!

Security is handled at the gate much like Bangkok or Frankfurt so queues again aren't an issue. Plenty of shopping and restaurants are also available and the MRT station underneath the main terminal is a big plus. On the downside ATMs are awfully hard to come by - I could only find one working ATM in the arrivals area near the entrance to the MRT station and there are no signs indicating where it is. Also while security provided at the gate helps eliminate security lines it also means the seating areas don't open until an hour before departure and seating space is inadequate if you get there early and don't have lounge access.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

southampton-airport,/airport-reviews/southampton-airport,Southampton Airport customer review,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,2011-09-22,Flew to Edinburgh from Southampton Airport in September. It's very local to us so convenient but the growth in flights hasn't been matched by a growth in facilities. The airport will argue that it is investing and has enlarged the area of retail and catering space airside (which is true) but the queues into departures are now almost always longer than those I experience at Heathrow. This airport needs to speed up its investment if it wants to continue to grow and especially the airside space. Landside - the retail outlets are limited to one WH Smith which is really quite bad for an up-coming airport like Southampton. The other huge problem with this airport is its reliance on Flybe. Flybe operate an extensive network of routes to France and within the UK but has very few decent 'city break' destinations on offer so if you need to fly to places like Barcelona Rome Madrid Prague and Vienna you have to go to London. The airport can handle large aircraft (757s and 737s) so am not sure why it has failed to attract a competitor to Flybe which in my opinion is gradually whittling away all the competition it faces.

My only complaint is that from the screens changing to 'Boarding' to our names being read out over the PA for 'immediate boarding' was about 2 minutes not even time to walk downstairs from the coffee bar. On return a walk from the aircraft to a short queue for immigration and straight out to the car park; less than 10 minutes from leaving the aircraft to exiting the car park.

The airport has wi-fi but no computer stations so if you don't have a laptop you can't get on the internet. The telephones also seemed rather confusing for making international calls. The airport was undergoing considerable refurbishment and building work when I was there (March 2011) so there was lots of dust and scaffolding in the terminal.

They have lately opened up more security controls before check in which speeds things up although long queues to check in and passport control remain a problem. After the passport control several new restaurants have opened up like TGIF big tax free shop and a new smoking room (to avoid smoking at the toilets).

st-petersburg-airport,/airport-reviews/st-petersburg-airport,St Petersburg Airport customer review,B Vincent,NA,2009-02-23,First thing to note is that there is no direct public transport from the city and if you are thinking of doing that allow plenty of time - you have to first get to Moskovskaya metro station (which probably means two trains) and then find the right exit near Macdonald's where you need to catch a #39 bus or mini-bus. Thankfully a kind person guided me because I would not have found it myself. On the mini-bus you will have to pay an extra fare if you have a bag. From the outside Pulkovo 1 looks quite imposing - there are only a couple of doors and I saw no signage to identify where was arrivals and departures but by fluke I picked the right door. Inside is quite dimly lit. There are just a few check-in counters and all the destinations are in Russian so if you need to catch a flight here make sure you can read your destination (or at least your flight number) in Cyrillic. My flight had only one counter open but it was very efficient and although the queue was long I had my boarding pass in just 10 minutes or so. Next security was very diligent and I was glad of this - everyone takes their shoes off no exceptions.

The unfamiliarity is intimidating but in fact it is well organised once you get used to the system. The system is back to front: the key lesson is that you cannot do anything until your flight is called. You pass through passport screening and security checks before being allowed into the departures hall and then go direct to the check-in desks where you will be processed immediately. There are only 6/8 desks which means a queue - but you don't have to walk far and the queues are always moving. Russian border controls have a bad reputation so the feeling of disorientation adds to a feeling of nervousness. Add to that the characteristically brusque and sullen staff and it all feels quite intimidating. But don't panic.

As a father of 4 and a Stockholm resident Arlanda succeeds at most things (cleanliness security shopping play areas) but fails dismally at food and beverage pricing. On the plus side for children there are two play areas. Now where Arlanda fails is that it's almost impossible to get children's food either for eating or take-on- board at a decent price. My benchmark for this has always been Boots in the UK where there have £3.99 meal deal (air side) giving you a 500ml drink a double/triple sandwich and a sweet snack. In Arlanda it would be impossible to do this for less than £12 or SEK120. With 4 children and the no liquids rule at security the cost of feeding my children is about 10% of the cost of a budget flight for each of us. Things have been improved recently with the addition of a local fast food joint ""Max"" in T5. Come on Arlanda.

Check-in is uniformly speedy and the staff are polite and efficient. Queues at security are manageable and the move from landside to airside is always smooth. The facility itself is compact and easy to navigate. The Red Baron Cafe landside is the best option for dining as it offers the best choice airside slightly limited but adequate for an airport of its size.

I asked a staff member where we were supposed to be and in spite of wearing a radio he just said ""I don't know"" and walked away. Signage is unclear to an Aussie let alone a visitor so when you see a tourist join the wrong queue you could be a little understanding unless you work at the SYD airport in which case you roll your eyes and in your best condescending tone say ""madam. (sigh) what makes you think you should be in the Australian queue when you have a foreign passport? get yourself into the correct line which is over there"" (shown with a wave of the arm as you turn your back and walk away).",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2014-06-25,If you arrive early in the morning expect very long immigration and customs queue as more than 20 international flights arrive very early. This is not a friendly airport. The good thing is that if you hold a British or Singaporean passport you can use the electronic gates which might speed up things a bit. I had a very rude immigration officer recently. It was my third trip into Australia at Sydney and the third time I was subjected to extra checks and questioning by both immigration and customs officials for no apparent reason. When you are departing from here you won't find a First or business signs which is what you would expect from airports around the world. You will see a small sign in black that says Service. Apparently they do not like big signs here. I had no idea what this meant so had to go up and down the check in hall searching for a business class desk before a nice Qantas employee pointed me in the right direction. Australians like to do things differently but this is just idiotic.,NA,NA,NA,7,2,3,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0
sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,P Jenkins,Australia,2013-05-12,I used SYD last month for flights to and from the U.S. As a departure airport Sydney International is an airport of contrasts. For example the nice leather lounges with the recharging stations and the high ceiling in the central space feels just great. However as you near your gate the ceiling becomes really low and you will find many people just standing around because the seating is far from adequate given the number of passengers. The free wifi has a fairly strong signal throughout the terminal. As an arrival airport the new SmartGate system definitely speeds up the immigration part of the process. After that it all becomes a bit more interesting. The problem seems to be that there is not enough floor space between the end of the baggage claim carousels and the customs area. When a couple of jumbos are on the ground there are long lines wrapped all along the backside of the baggage claim area. To combat the confusion I looked for the least busy carousel and then picked a customs line close to it. That strategy paid off though it took some creative weaving around other passengers and walking the long way around nearly all of the carousels to make it happen. It was all worth it in the end. I was on my Route 400 bus outside an hour and fifteen minutes after my plane's arrival. The bottom line: Sydney is one busy airport that services a large percentage of Australia's 20 million people. Be prepared to wait and go with the flow. What the airport may lack in affordable parking it more than makes up for in its CityRail train station downstairs and even handier bus stops upstairs.,NA,NA,NA,6,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Unfortunately on leaving things were less well organised. The security system was awful. Only two machines operating so the fastrack was merged with the other line which caused resentment quite rightly from other passengers who had queued longer.

Seems that the real peak hour is somewhat later than 0630 more likely around 0800 when the queues are much longer and the staff surlier.

Inbound went well (no passport control between Norway and Poland) luggage came fast and no delays getting out of the airport. On departure things were not that smooth baggage system failed but much worse was the queue through security. Our departure was at the same time as a Ryanair flight to Dublin and it took the best part of 1.5 hours to pass. Staff was not rude but in dire need of learning how to smile and treat people nicely. Pity since the facilities are quite nice once you get through security. When boarding the plane there was no one leading the way from the terminal so we had to find the plane more or less on our own. Hardly satisfactory from a security point of view. All in all it wasn't that bad. Szczecin Solidarity is one of the smaller regional airports and as such rather new to international traffic.

There is the usual selection of rubbish repetitive shops with nothing exciting that I could find. The departure lounge is pretty dull there is very little to do and the food and shops won't excite anyone who regularly flies. Perhaps this airport has gone out of its way to make everything as standardised as possible compared to other big regional airports. The other gripe is that this airport is poorly connected to Taipei proper - road is still the only option although buses are frequent and take under an hour.

While capable of handling major airlines and large jets it somehow feels very relaxed by comparison to say HK Bangkok and Singapore. However the terminals are smart clean and I don't have too many complaints. Some suggestions. Some of the eateries in the food court could also have a presence airside. Like Singapore and its wonderful but more expensive sister airport Songshan (in Taipei itself) it makes use of interesting themes in some of the terminals alcoves about aviation in Taiwan nature of Taiwan relax zones etc which are a nice touch. Ironically it's Songshan that is connected by metro and not as yet Taoyuan - it seems to be taking an eternity to finish the metro link and the high speed rail is miles away and costs a fortune!

tbilisi-airport,/airport-reviews/tbilisi-airport,Tbilisi Airport customer review,A Jansen,NA,2006-05-23,"I found this one of the most revolting airports I have ever been. The facilities have changed little since soviet times and are just too small. In arrivals there was only one luggage-belt. Some thugs monopolized the trollies and demanded money from foreigners who wanted to use them. Unruly taxi drivers even pushed their way into the arrivals hall looking for prey (foreigners). Departure was even worse. The departure hall is much bigger and supposedly better organized but still we had a very unpleasant time there. First of all most flights seem to leave very early in the morning (around 5 AM) which is already inconvenient. Secondly the check-in of several flights at the same time causes a lot of confusion. Staff works extremely slow and broad shouldered types simply push their way up the lines while people behind you gladly try to push you aside. The guards in the hall are uninterested in this and do not take any action at all. After receiving our boarding pass we had to go upstairs. In spite of the sign ""passengers only"" the stairs were blocked by people saying goodbye to their loved ones. There were only 2 desks for foreign passports. Even here some unpleasant types tried to push themselves in front. People from western countries were treated politely but my wife who has a Moldovan passport and a valid residence permit for the Netherlands experienced real trouble. An extremely unfriendly female official grabbed her passport and without any explanation went into some office rudely ordering my wife to follow her. I went after her and found some officer holding my wife's passport. I demanded an explanation as well as their names and registration numbers. One good thing about Georgia's rose revolution is the fact that officials are in fact required to identify themselves when asked and that it is also possible to make a complaint against them. Luckily this helped without even looking into the passport he gave it back saying that there was "" no problem"" . I am sure that without this intervention they might have detained my wife for hours. I am deeply disappointed that officials at this airport show a smiling face to westerners while at the same time they apparently take pleasure in harrassing people from poor countries. After this intermezzo we had to go to the metal detector. There was only one working so again a huge queue had formed. This detector did not work at all - it went off for almost everybody but not for me even though I was carrying a pocket knife with me! Finally we had reached the "" departure lounge""  an extremely small area with a bar and one sad "" tax free shop"". I am a smoker myself but the fumes exhausted by visitors of the bar were even too much for me. There seemed to be no toilet at all however when looking really well (a small corridor behind the bar) you could find it. Even though Georgia produces wonderful souvenirs there was nothing except cigarettes and some alcoholic drinks in the taxfree sold by some unfriendly women spending their time chatting to each other and taking cigarette-breaks. There were 2 "" exit gates"" (not indicated by numbers). Departures were announced in unclear english (no monitors). Travellers had to walk down to ground level were busses were waiting to take them to the planes. Since these busses stand next to each other and several take-offs take place almost simultaneously this leads to confusion when people get into the wrong bus. We were really glad to have the ordeal behind us. A terrible place unworthy of this beautiful country!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The airport is fairly new and looks good. Departing is a whole different ball game and the time is spent mainly with the security checks so make sure you have plenty of time and I mean plenty of time. We arrived 3 hours prior to departure but it took us over 2 hours overall just to check in! Firstly queue to go through the ""interview"" i.e. why were you in Israel where are you going who were you with who packed your bag have you been given anything to carry on behalf of someone else etc etc. Wait time for us was approx 50 mins. Secondly queue for your bags go through a scan. Wait time for us was approx. 15 mins. Thirdly queue for your bag to be hand-searched. Wait time for us was approx 30 mins plus search time. Fourthly queue to check your bags in. Wait time for us was approx 30 mins. As much as security is of high importance the level of efficiency to move passengers was really poor e.g. ""interview"" staff would suddenly disappear leaving a long queue of people waiting around. Also don't think you can skip a security line either as you need all of the proper security bar codes before you can Check In. And the distance for all of the waiting around in - a mere 50m! Fifth queue for Immigration. This is where they really need some form of ""crowd control"" and manage their staff change overs. People were queuing in front of each individual Passport counter but when 2 of the staff left the remaining (long) queues became disorganised as they struggled to find another line to queue in for yet a different Immigration Officer. It would have been better if there had been a single queue and passengers directed to the next available counter. As for the rest of the airport well we really didn't experience much of it. Since Check In took so long we had to head straight to the Departure Gate. The only good thing - free wifi albeit for 30mins.

Arrived at security 4 hours before departure was turned away and told to return in 30minutes because we were too early; 3 hours prior is just about right FYI. Went through the first two of three security checks before checking in with Lufthansa. I was told I had to check all liquids cannot carry them on. At the third check in after my carry on bags went through X-Ray I was asked to step aside for a hand inspection of my two carryon bags. The instant oatmeal packs Glucose Tabs (I'm a diabetic) and my meds in their prescription bottles (6 bottles actually) caused the inspector to call her supervisor who told me that I had too many meds and could not bring them onboard with me. I could not believe he was actually suggesting that I put prescription meds in my checked luggage that already had been checked. I had two choices leave my meds behind or go back to the first security area and ask for a cardboard box place my meds inside and check the box as luggage. The supervisor was nice enough to allow the security agent to accompany me to help me bypass the very long lines. I was allowed to take with me two days worth of meds. From start to finish it took 2.5 hrs for me to get from the front of the airport to the business class lounge this included the added delay of checking my meds.

Firstly, its a long way out of the city. We used a fixed price taxi, which cost 15 Euro, but it will easily be 25 to 30 Euros from the city centre. On arrival we were met with a Departure Board, that only showed a handful of flights. We had to dodge lines to eventually find where we needed to check in. I am just thankful we arrived early. We stood for 30 minutes on what was a short line of people (clerk was simply slow), to find that we could only weigh the luggage and get the tags and that we had to drop off the suitcases at another part of the airport. No signs anywhere to show you where drop off was. The Terminal is small, and lines so long, we had to fight to through lines of people to find the bag drop. Once there, we had another 40 minute wait and a line that snaked around half the airport, just to drop off the bag. Crazy! Next another 30 minute queue to go through security. Rude staff and poor organisation sum up this experience. As we were flying to a non Schengen country, we had to use a small lounge on the other side of passport control, which was so full we had to stand. The toilets were disgusting and the only shop was a coffee bar, whose young employee was on a go slow. To reach the aircraft you have to use stairs and buses.

There is a major expansion of another terminal building next door so maybe proper facilities may exist later. As it is the check in area is separated totally from the rest of the airport requiring everyone to show ID to walk through a door to go through a customs area before actually checking in for the back end of the row of counter. Then you retrace your steps to access the immigration area before the typically cramped security screening which only had two of the four points on duty leading to a long wait in line. Once through the main terminal area is obviously a temporary scenario by the way the duty free shop acts to block access to the other gates.

As a result the taxi time itself already was over 20 minutes. Except for that the facilities are mostly quite well maintained. Spotlessly clean. Plenty of places to dine and shop. Convenience facilities like shower rooms also available. Carts free wherever you go. Free wifi also available. A spacious observation deck. Not many people speak decent English. Another rather big disappointment involves the never-ending queues at immigration and transfer desks. My impulsive decision to hit the landside was made when I arrived at the transfer desks with so many people that they were not even able to stand in lines. Immigration was not much better but at least in a seemingly interminable line for foreigners. Despite the efforts of the officers to divert some people off to the counters for Japanese nationals it took over 30 minutes just to pass immigration. Another minus 2 point for this.

Furthermore a small warning: you should have your passport ready in the train going to the airport because ridiculously you can't even exit the subway without it even though you'll need to produce it another 3 times before you fasten your seatbelt. Another point the airport suffers from a constant reek of tobacco. I always had had this impression of Japan being high-tech enough that they could at least build a sealed low pressure room for smokers if banning smoking really isn't on the agenda there yet. But alas one continues to hope. Last note actually the entire design (proportions use of space aesthetics lighting air quality and architecture) of both terminals belongs to a bygone era.

One was all the good things about airport terminal design and the second was all the bad things. Unfortunately they mixed up the two lists when they drew up the designs. I cannot fathom how such a new terminal built at such great expense can be so inefficient. The worst part is trying to pass through customs after collecting your baggage.

I read lots of comments about people complaining about the signage and directions in this airport but the signage could not be clearer (large bold and colour-coded). The customs clearance section is still a bit of an adventure with a mix of meandering queues for automated passport readers Nexus terminals and queues for customs officers. This could be improved.

In the last month I've flown through Pearson from LHR MUC and IST and without fail I'm amazed at our archaic customs process and the ridiculously long wait for baggage. I'm a Canadian citizen. I'm pleased they have a separate queue for Canadian Residents now however Canada is the only country I've been to (out of 47) that is the most onerous and frustrating to enter. The Canadian Residents line is always the longest the three flights I took also required us to use the automated machines that promote ""faster entry home"" - the kiosks were slow couldn't read my passport and the organisation was a mess. You then still have to join another queue and give your printout (a waste of more paper and tax dollars as it's a scanned copy of the form you just filled out) to an officer who may or may not ask you questions. You then join another queue to show more officers your printout - and then once you get your luggage (which even for Priority can take ages - I waited 50 minutes for my bag from IST - easily wait an average of 40 minutes) you have to queue yet again to give your printed form to another customs agent. If the airport isn't busy it's not so much of an issue but these times are rare particularly when you arrive from European flight - most arrive in the early evening and you then have thousands of people trying to get through. It's terrible and makes no sense - can't we at least get rid of one of those checkpoints? And Pearson/GTAA whomever please fix the ridiculously long wait times for luggage.

This time we connected there as part of our Comox to San Francisco trip. I was not so impressed this time. We had no problem heading out. Even went through US Customs on the way and the waits were all reasonable. We made our connecting flight with time to spare. Our return trip was not so easy. In San Francisco we were given a brief explanation about getting our luggage near Canada Customs and having to transfer it ourselves. Once through Customs (the line was very short so there was no problem - but getting there from the plane was a long walk) on the way to picking up our luggage we asked one of the information people (right beside carousel 25) about getting our luggage to our connecting flight. She was totally useless!!! She told us we had to exit the terminal and go back in to the check-in area. That made no sense to us. My daughter had noticed the sign for connecting flights in Canada and that made more sense to me. Of course the helper overheard us and then asked for our boarding cards and then changed her mind and agreed with us! Not much good when the helper is being told what to do by the ones who asked her the question.

vancouver-airport,/airport-reviews/vancouver-airport,Vancouver Airport customer review,Serge Grynkewich,Philippines,2012-09-10,My review focuses on two matters: Transit passenger handling at immigration and Staff knowledge of the airport and its facilities. I arrived in Vancouver at around 9pm to transit for a transpacific flight at around 2.45am the following morning. On the Air Canada flight I advised the steward that I was transiting and he advised me that I did not need to complete a customs and immigration form. On arrival the transit lane was closed and I was advised to proceed through the normal channel and to advise the immigration officer that I was transiting. I did so. The immigration officer (courteously) advised that I did need to complete the paperwork which I did. When I was called back to immigration it was by another officer who when I told her I was in transit gave me a pink card and told me the paperwork was not necessary. Someone in immigration is confused as am I. After all was done at immigration I proceeded to the lady who had directed me to immigration in the first place. She advised me to proceed up to the next level. When I asked her for the location of the Cathay Pacific business class lounge she advised me that it was upstairs but that I should proceed to gate 64. To make a long story short no one was at gate 64 as the flight was still 5 hours away. I asked several people including a janitor a Customs and Border Officer and a shop attendant where the lounge was. Only the shop attendant could direct me correctly. Amazingly the Customs and Border Officer - though very courteous - laughed as he told me that he was responsible for security but had never been there. Vancouver has a beautiful airport - as do most Canadian cities. However Canadian authorities should see to the education of those working in their airports. It's disconcerting when security officials admit that they don't know the place they're assigned to secure!,NA,NA,NA,5,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

There were gaps in the barrier which enabled queue jumping and nobody around to replace or sort out the mess. On 15/3/15 with a growing queue two staff wandered off one on 'Speedy boarding' took a phone call and there is an air of bemusement that passengers are disgruntled. Perhaps they really don't care. The upstairs café is quite pleasant but not somewhere to visit in a hurry. Easyjet must hate this place as all the 'services' they need are done so badly. All the passengers were ready and waiting to board but everything is done at snail's pace. The security checks re-organised last year are worse than ever even at a quiet mid-March time. Boarding took far too long because only the front door was available so on a quick turn- round it was impossible to get to our seats quickly.

Baggage drop was slow security utterly inefficient with staff making things worse by trying (unsuccessfully) to manage queues. The new security gates have caused chaos. We were in plenty of time there weren't many people passing through security but it took 20 mins. The upstairs cafe operates at snails pace with odd queue arrangements and poor display of pricing. Not surprisingly with such poor service customers choose not to clear their trays as requested. Our EasyJet flight was delayed because the baggage handlers couldn't get the luggage on in time to meet the departure slot. Why? The passengers were all at the gate in good time there was no sign of anyone arriving at the last minute and not much luggage actually going to the hold.

The restaurant is busy hot and noisy but good value with freshly cooked pizza and pasta available. Security was somewhat slow (20 mins.) and ignored an obvious queue jumper who appeared from nowhere dived under the queue barrier then presented himself ahead of others who had been waiting. This really should have been noticed as a security concern not just the queue jumping. The security screening seemed over-sensitive which slowed things down. There are few facilities once through security so it’s a bit of a gamble to leave it as late as possible. Leave going down to the gate until the flight is in. The gate area is inadequate particularly given that passengers were allowed through when a delay was expected. It would be impossible to imagine more than one of the four adjoining gates being used at a time as the waiting area was full with one. The seating is totally inadequate.

Most of the things stated in previous comments are true. But at least one has changed radically after the latest terror threats. In contrast to YVR there is only one security control for all flights (domestic flights to Canada and international flights to Seattle and Salt Lake City). The first oddity was that a security officer awaited me in front of the controls just to find out whether I wanted to go to the USA or to remain in Canada. As I was merely going to return to YVR I was told that I could keep my shoes on whereas all passengers travelling to Seattle had to take them off to have them x-rayed. (What if I smuggled in something for someone I was to meet in the departure lounge who was heading for the USA?) The second oddity was that the security officers checked my hand luggage by hand after screening and found two sealed one-portion packages of marmalade which I had taken from my hotel's breakfast room earlier that morning. The officer took them out and threw them away. If they had really been so dangerous I wonder why the staff in Vancouver had not already thrown them away on my way out.

The airport is extremely well sign posted and the instant you clear customs and get into arrivals a sign points you to where you need to go. The coolest way to get to downtown is to take the high speed train which can make the journey in 15 minutes two trains per hour.

vienna-airport,/airport-reviews/vienna-airport,Vienna Airport customer review,Y Kahanovych,Ukraine,2011-10-16,I used it for transit couple weeks ago. First strange detail is having Schengen and non-Schengen wings they have non-Schengen gates at Schengen wing. It causes major trouble to those who are in transit from non-EU to other non- EU country. Physically they have to cross Austran border twice: on leaving arrival gate and on approach to departure gate. Big deal if you don't have visa for that. Double immigration control for those going let say from Russia to USA. Duty free selection is poor and prices are unreasonable. Food selection is very good though. Lack of fresh air. Ventilation is not sufficient. Layout of the airside area is strange but du to small size of the building is bearable. Departure was via bus gate from claustrophobic area downstairs.

I have to say that the airport has greatly improved over the last few years. Unlike some of Europe's bigger hubs, immigration, customs, and baggage claim goes fairly quickly. The airport has a new rail link to the city center, and public transit options from the airport are well marked. The departure hall has been expanded considerably. The additional check in and security facilities seem to have reduced overcrowding. We got from the train station to airside in less than 15 minutes. There are a wider selection of shops and a new small food court. The airport even had a kids play area and a rest lounge for transit passengers.

Be warned that unlicensed cab drivers will approach you in arrivals. Ignore them at all costs even if they are pushy. The best way into Warsaw is to take the Modlin Bus a purple coach that costs 33 zloty (just €8) an air conditioned warm coach will take to central Warsaw in a journey lasting about 1 hour.

Then queued for a further 2 hours 15 mins at immigration (non-US citizen) - rows upon rows of unmanned desks no assistance or announcements. The queue got even longer behind me so some people will have waited for over 3 hours. After an 8 hour flight expecting families with young children to stand for so long is completely unacceptable. Then a hunt for bags deposited in a random location in the baggage hall and yet another queue for customs.

Flew into IAD Monday 29 Sept with BA to land just behind a Saudi Airlines plane. Immigration took about 1 hour after the little shuttle bus the up and down various endless corridors and escalators. Collected baggage and checked in with United Express for transfer to Savannah / Hilton Head International. We allowed a 4 hour layover so all relatively painless except the last minute Gate Change from C terminal to A terminal - just to keep the passengers on their toes and awake presumably. Returning from Savannah 13th October we then had the usual interminable walks through various buildings and up and down miles of escalators before collecting the baggage (which did arrived relatively quickly). The only problem was the signage to where we then had to go to check in with BA for our flight home - a very grumpy man at the Information desk eventually grudgingly told us the right direction to head. Check in at BA desk a breeze security queues minimal and Terminal B actually a very quiet and pleasant place to be for a glass of wine before flying home. Perhaps because it was Columbus Day. Would I recommend Dulles? I suppose as much as I would recommend any US Port of Entry or Departure - some are bad and some downright dreadful (Newark Chicago LAX Miami etc etc). Do allow plenty of time if you are transferring flights - we allowed 4 hours and got total peace of mind. And none of them are particularly good but Dulles was as painless as anywhere.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,G Meyer,United States,2012-02-06,One of my least favourite airports. This airport has expanded haphazardly over the course of several decades and is poorly designed and laid out. Amazingly the new Aerotrain which shuttles you from the main terminal building to the satellite terminals is no faster than the painfully slow so-called mobile lounges that used to be the sole means of transport between terminals. I always have to allow 45 minutes or more to travel from the drop-off/check-in area to the gate. Several times when arriving on a late night flight I've had to wait 20 minutes or more for the next Aerotrain. Security lines are the longest I've seen primarily because half the security lanes are normally closed similar situation with customs - never enough personnel to man the available counters and as a result lines are commonly 45 minute or more. While Dulles suffers from some irreparable design flaws it would be much better if airport management would simply ensure that they make better use of the facilities they do have - by having more customs and security personnel on hand and by running the Aerotrain at reasonable intervals at all hours to speed transit through the airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

United had about a dozen Europe-bound flights leaving within minutes of each other from adjoining gates. The place was absolute pandemonium no where to sit stand or walk. Food and shopping options are severely limited and impossible to get to with all the crowds. Perhaps other areas of the airport at different times are more pleasant.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,G Jardin,United Kingdom,2010-01-23,Such a contrast between arriving at Dulles and departing from it. Arrival was as horrid an experience as I have encountered in the US. After my plane landed about 2 hours late I found myself at the end of a long snaking queue for immigration. As a non-US citizen it took me almost an hour to reach an agentâ€™s desk. Ahead of me was an elderly man about 80 far too polite to ask to go to the front of the queue who was clearly in some distress. After I got through immigration I waited for half an hour for my bag to reach the designated carousel. On a trip to the restroom I found my bag with others piled up on the floor. The carousel screen was wrong and all the bags from my flight had been delivered. To my surprise my return trip from Dulles went just fine. Security was quick and then I was able to take the moving walkways to the brand new B concourse as good an airside space as Iâ€™ve seen anywhere. Very spacious (10-15 minutes walk from end to end) and plenty of shops and eating places.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

As with all US airports I have used I feel they must scour the country for the most charmless people they can find and employ them all here. It always makes for a depressing if not downright stressful and unpleasant experience. My case arrived off the carousel broken and searched with various unwrapped presents.

Although there is no direct access to the Washington Metro the coach to West Falls Church station was quick and comfortable. Coming back security was a doddle. So I found the basics just fine at IAD. The airport could do with internal modernisation and redecoration as it seems stuck in the 70s. Also if you go through security and expect to see a departure lounge you're going to be disappointed. You need to take the moon buggy to your departure pier where there is a proper range of shops.

Staff at immigration are efficient and friendly and no need to ""bribe"" like you have to in Vietnam and Cambodia.

Make sure you are checked in online and/or are a gold card or above member of the airlines you choose to fly often they have a special line open for that and staffs check and make sure you are qualified to queue up in there may save a lot of time.

There a lots of porters who wear flourescent jerseys to assist travellers with transferring baggage to taxis etc which they do for a couple of dollars - quite reasonable. Don't be put off by it some also speak english. IF you want to make a call these porters have mobiles so you can make local calls for a dollar a minute. The information desk don't let you use their phone. The return trip was very good as well. You will be asked to open your bags if they contain jewellery. You have to show your customs slip from when you arrived or your government registered shop reciept which says you have paid the taxes. Immigration is easy you then have to pass through the gate.

On the way in those passengers in the know bunched up at the door of the aircraft and ran for the entrance hall. Those (like me) who hadn't a clue about what was coming walked normally and were confronted with chaos. I know the Russians are paranoid about security but this was ridiculous took over 3 hours to clear a 737 load; fortunately we were the only aircraft on the ground at the time. The fire truck took about 5 minutes just to start lucky (there were no fires). The baggage hall was interesting all baggage arrived on a tip-truck which backed up to a slide (and you guessed it) up-ended the tray and baggage into the room (no carousel). Customs Hall is something else one over eager passenger put his head around the door before he was called; flashing lights and sirens erupted. You didn't need to speak Russian to get the gist of what he was told. Fortunately I had a Company courier waiting for me outside with a name board. On the way out similar system. this time however the flight was delayed due to heavy snow. No information given by staff no flight info boards all passengers JUST WAITED. In my case it was about 8 hours; this must be a fairly common occurrence in January as the same courier was with me and refused to leave until the aircaft was actually on the ground (most impressed).

The intercontinental gates are a train ride away and again you can be stuck in a queue for security at busy times.

zurich-airport,/airport-reviews/zurich-airport,Zurich Airport customer review,David Griffiths,United Kingdom,2009-09-09,It's a big place and be aware that the signs indicating 20 minutes to the E gates mean what they say. The E gates are a long way from check in requiring various up and down escalators and a train trip (complete with piped birdsong and cow noises!) but the signs are clear and easy to follow. Security was quick and courteous. Only small criticism is that our flight was slightly delayed and an announcement by the gate staff of the reason and the expected duration of the delay would have been appreciated. The previous flight on the route (ZRH-LCY) had been cancelled and some of the passengers from the cancelled flight were understandably starting to get irritated.

The check in areas are OK staff friendly and professional after immigration there are a number of eating outlets but mostly local food - not international considering this is Jakarta's main international airport its disapointing. Recently I noticed two internet terminals which were free - neither have worked since the many times I have tried to use them. The arrival areas are another story dingy dim and many officials standing around doing nothing. Immigration is Ok but at peak times the lines are long which also goes for the visa on arrival counters.

Even though Changi might be one of the best airports in the world (not T1 which is outdated dark dirty etc. but fortunately gets a makeover and extension now) the better airport in this region is HKG. Changi T2 and T3 are nice efficient clean but its a bit uncomfortable to have the 3 terminals and even though the travel between the Terminals is nice the appearance of the airport is rather cold. With the friendliness of the staff at the check-in its really a hit and miss customs as well but the security at the gate is most of the time friendly and joking. I dont like the military patrols in the airport.

They start jumping on the hood holding on to your doors or fenders or anything they can get hold of. Some of them want to be paid to carry your bags. Others want the opportunity to find anything no locked glued sealed with duck tape bolted down or secured by an armed guard. The entrance is just as much chaos. You walk to the terminal and there are people standing outside the terminal who want to help you through immigration or carry your bags. Do not give your passport to someone who promises to help.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,J Quarles,Netherlands,2013-08-26,Last month I went on a family trip with 2 adolescents and 2 parents to London. Since we were traveling with hand luggage only the departure hall seemed an easy hurdle for our return trip. After a pleasant stay in London we arrived in Luton departure hall an hour and a half before take off. There were long queues at the luggage counters especially the Easyjet counters. Confident because we could bypass this queue we took a short break before we went to passport control and security check. No written or verbal signs whatsoever about the massive queues that were ahead of us. Then after showing our passports and boarding cards we entered a huge space on this review site better described as an immigration hall fully packed with people duly following a labyrinth of ropes. The end of this story is also described by many visitors of this site. Queuing time for ordinary hand luggage turned out to take at least 1 hour. Customs officers working to rule having all passengers take of their shoes inspecting items while our gate was about to close. Running on our socks we reached on the off-chance the right place where 23 people were standing before an already closed gate. Going through the reviews more then 20 people missing a plane because of queuing times at Luton seems business as usual. I wish that I had read these reviews before! When you really take the chance of traveling via Luton airport be prepared to miss your flight. Easyjet will sell new tickets for 60 pounds each and in case it is late you can book a hotel for circa 45 pounds per room. We will at least think twice before making a new booking. The same counts for Easyjet who well aware of logistic problems at Luton doesn't take trouble in warning its clients in advance redirecting any complaint to Luton airport not in the least troubled by earning extra at the expense of its derogated clients.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Even with an 1 hr 20 mins between flights and running we could not make it to our connecting plane on time We had to go through TSA twice - once after clearing customs and again after having to exit the secured area to get to the other terminal! There was so much wrong it's hard to know where to start. Starting with having to climb down some steep stairs with our carry-on luggage after deplaning wander along a long hallway only to have to take an escalator back up. Miles later customs. Drag luggage to re-check it in for the remainder of the flight home. Through TSA because we had touched our checked baggage to drag it from customs. Then running with luggage from one end of the airport to another - including having to exit the secured area and cross a ticket lobby to get to the gate we needed to depart on. Had to then wait in a huge line to go through TSA again. Then running to make our gate at the end of another terminal. Showed up with barely a minute to spare only to find out they had changed our departure gate and did not announce it in the areas we were. The gate agent said they would call to tell the people at the new gate we were on the way and to wait. Once again running to the end of yet another terminal only to find the plane had left. Gate agent not only didn't care but was extremely rude. Others missed the flight as well - for the same reason. We were stranded in the airport overnight. US Air refused to provide accommodations or even food until we could get another flight the next day. With the exception of one TSA agent every employee we encountered was unhelpful and rude.

If you're connecting leave plenty of time (don't take a 30-45min layover because it won't be enough if things start going wrong). When arriving/ departing from Atlanta (ie. not connecting through) I have never had a problem. Sometimes it takes bags a while to display in the terminal but other than that the ground is usually as efficient as possible. However for connecting flights the major issue seems to be weather. On a good-weather day I never have problems. But once bad weather hits everything starts to break down. Delta has always been good to me if I needed to rebook but again all we can do as passengers is to give ourselves a decent layover time to account for the possible delay. Overall the facilities are pretty good compared to other US airports. Especially Terminal E. There's plenty of food options as well as decent shopping. The airport staff is usually extremely nice and always helpful - just be polite.

Back in the mid-2000s (when Spain was a booming economy) Barajas was obviously growing at a staggering rate yet it's three well laid-out terminals were very convenient the staff was friendly it was clean security was a breeze and the airport in general had this unmistakable Spanish charm somehow present throughout it. Then one fateful day T4 opened and for me this marked the beginning of the downfall of Barajas. Since the opening of the nonetheless good-looking terminal Madrid's airport has become nothing more than your typical big airport with astonishingly rude staff members (except those at the check-in desks) dirty facilities (T2 is the only terminal that is somehow clean) laughable shopping experience strict security lines increasingly confusing signalling. But one thing in particular makes Barajas actually a desperate case: the fact that it is increasingly resembling London-Heathrow in every single way possible. Maybe its because Iberia is now BA's pet but everything from the shopping experience to the staff members to even the general atmosphere has become a carbon copy of Heathrow. Such a shame.

The airport is small and basic but to be honest we checked in late to save boredom and everything was ok. The WHSmith could do with being a little bit bigger as it can get a little crowded the Wetherspoons restaurant is probably the best feature. Basic bathroom facilities but all fit for purpose. Would be nice to see the airport expand a little but I guess that comes with more flights. Overall it was a pleasant enough experience coupled with the fact it only took us 20 mins to get home after baggage collection on return. If you can fly out of Doncaster id say support it as much as possible. Another plus about Doncaster was parking right outside the terminal major plus after any flight.

pisa-airport,/airport-reviews/pisa-airport,Pisa Airport customer review,S Chantry,NA,2007-10-03,Pisa Airport on arrival the luggage collection area was a total sham. Crowded with no information it became an adventure game to try and find which carousel the luggage arrives. The toilets are to small and the queue was long so if you need to use the toilet you are in for a treat. The car rental area has now moved and is about 250 yards from the main terminal building and is accessed via a free shuttle bus service expect long queues here also. Forget the shuttle bus if you drop the car off early it's an obstacle course of a walk in the dark. Will they ever finish the road works? On departure also expect a long queue as the customs and baggage search fiasco starts where rules are made up depending on their mood. A total farce in my opinion.

Depending on what time of day you arrive you'll generally be faced with exceptionally long slow moving queues at immigration. Luggage usually appears on the conveyors quite quickly and from this point on clearing the airport is reasonably easy - and you want to clear the airport! The shops available are reasonably far and few between food establishments are slowly getting better and are no longer the mum and pop owned places they were a few years back but are quite overpriced and poor value for money (even for an airport) probably due to the lack of competition. Transport from the airport is ok with buses and taxis easy to locate. The local state governor is the director of the only taxi company that has a taxi stand at GRU which probably explains why they have the monopoly there. Airport buses are available near terminal 1 and are easy to find and pay for even if you don't speak the lingo.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Terminal F inbound terminal C outbound. SVO is hit and miss place. Terminal F is an outdated and strangely laid out facility. However it didn;t took more than 15 minutes to pass immigration and then to collect bags that had already been on the belt. Then arrivals hall with usual taxi scam. Then easy to find train station with nice food facilities and free wifi coverage. The only minus is unclear sugnage. Walks are reasonably long. Outbound arrived to the airport by train coming to /terminal E. Transfer to terminal C was done by intercity type coach running every 30 minutes around the whole airport including its most remote places. Absence of tunnels under runways located between terminals E/D/F on one side and B/C on another side makes this ride 25 minutes long so should you need to arrive by train and to leave from terminals B or C allow some 60 extra minutes for this transfer. At terminal C security search was a breeze check in was done online immigration lines long but managed to catch my plane as the terminal is really small. Again free wifi but airside facilities are very poor with nothing to do uninspiring duty free and overpriced food options of very average quality. Staff unsmiling but not rude nothing really unpleasant. This airport is ok when you know what to do and where to go.

I have been through this airport dozens of times over two decades and nothing has changed! Plan to be processed for at least three hours. The problem here has consistently been complete and utter lack or organization and not enough staff and officials to process people. On top of that they just don't care. The airport authority doesn't care and that filters down to all the staff and immigration guards. I am not an airport official but I am an efficiency expert in my field of work. I would love to have a week in this airport and overhaul all of their processes! New cash grab! Smokers do not bring more than one carton of your homeland cigarettes through this airport! They will fine you 500% of the value of one carton for the excess. They consider it ""foreign merchandise"" and it will be taxed. I watched dozens of people utterly flabbergasted by this new tax grab. Be prepared to have all of your bags and luggage rescanned and searched. The trouble with these officials is they don't get the difference between what is coming into the country and what is being taken out. The exit process from Mexico is far easier and less time consuming! Like everything else in this country the Mexicans try to do things like the rest of the world but they don't quite hit the mark!

As noted having a light rail station adjacent to the station is a definite plus (about 45 min to the area of downtown where we were staying) though we had so many bags we did not use it. Although I had read that taxis to downtown cost about $30 we were told at the airport they would cost about $45 and so used one of the shuttle vans costing about $14 per person (usable for downtown only).

If Ryanair and Transavia flights depart at the same time you are jampacked in a kind of shed. If there aren’t any delays or cancellations and no coinciding flights it's bearable but otherwise? To go to Venice is relatively easy there are direct buses and the railway station of Treviso is only 10 min by bus (nr 6 in front of the entrance). Take care however that the ride in the reverse direction takes much longer (30 min) as the bus makes a circular tour.

There was no indication where the line started and when we walked forward we were shouted at very rudely by a woman which was in all quite embarassing in front of other staff and customers.

Southwest has significantly cut back service to/from ABQ and eliminated non stop service to a number of cities like Seattle and Portland.

Why the airport management at ABQ is not more aggressive in attracting carriers to the Sunport is a mystery.

The queue at security was so long that I wasn't going to make it to the gate before it shut. This isn't an improvement it is a backward step. I would like to think that the shambles isn't a way of forcing people to pay £5 for the fast track security enabling Edinburgh Airport to make yet more money from travellers. Heaven help you if your bag does get taken to one side for further investigation you can stand and wait 45 minutes before someone looks at the bag and that assumes that you can actually find where it has come out. So your passport credit cards laptop phone etc are all sitting somewhere for anyone to just lift on the way through. The old system was infinitely better. Once I got through on the fast track I was speaking to a member of staff on the other side who said it has been dreadful and a large number of people had missed their flights due to the 'new improved' system. My advice if you have the misfortune to fly from Edinburgh is to add on at least one extra hour to when you think you should arrive that way you stand a chance of making your flight.

What a shame it cannot treat its passengers properly. Every time I make a trip most things go well that is until I arrive back at Edinburgh and I know my blood pressure is going to soar. It seems that they find it impossible to co-ordinate getting baggage off the plane and into the reclaim area without it taking an eternity. Yesterday it took only 40 minutes from me actually arriving in the reclaim hall for my luggage to appear - this was one of their better performances! I have waited on one occasion for over 1 hour! Contrast this to my visit last week to Naples in less than 10 minutes of exiting the plane I had my luggage and was on my way.

I fly fairly often from Midway in Chicago and there is no comparison. Chicago Midway transports wheelchair customers directly to their terminal. Transporting wheelchair people to a cart then waiting on a cement seat for sometimes half an hour is very uncomfortable. I was given a seat on the cart placed on very end without any handle and was trying to hold on to the side of cart as it sped along. To make this trip worse I was driven and left about a block from my terminal and had to walk the rest of the way. Wheelchair staff were rude.

After we returned our rental car (Avis in the airport) we rode the escalator upstairs to ticketing to check our bags only to discover we didn't know which way to go; apparently finding the airline on your own is the game of the day. Went one way turned around went the other way asked directions were told to go to the other side and take a right didn't find asked directions again told to keep going straight take a right and we'd find USAir. Finally did find it but at no time anywhere was there a sign - for any airline! Is this an airport with airline ticketing? And we must have walked a mile; good thing we had about 2 hours!

On a recent trip, as on a previous one in the fall of 2014, this restroom had dirty toilet stalls and nonfunctional ""automated"" sink handles. The airport is, in general, user-unfriendly. Yesterday I had intended to wait for a friend on an arriving flight in the cell-phone lot, which I'd not been to before. The signage to the lot was so confusing that instead I ended up in the central parking garage. Signage from the garage to the US Air arrivals area in the terminal was similarly unedifying; I had to ask an employee for directions. Same thing to navigate the return to the garage. The signage for the terminals and parking is not only confusing but also dangerous: any attempt to change lanes runs the risk of involving oneself in a crash with one of the numerous fast-approaching vehicles on one's tail.

I usually arrive without a visa and buy one when I get there. I've found that I get through the line a lot quicker than when I had arranged a visa in advance. While friends have had bags delayed I never have and that is a problem with the airline not the airport. If you have a long layover during the day you could try to arrange a driver in advance to take you to the Nairobi Game park. Traffic mid-day is not bad. Morning and evening are horrendous. Flying out is a challenge no doubt. you have to go through one security go get into the terminal and you cant get in without a ticket or at least an itinerary. That's a pain. There will be 3 or 4 747 leaving at the same time so there are huge crowds trying to check in. You could go early to beat the rush but then you are stuck in the worlds most boring airport with few places to sit (as noted) and limited options for food (thank god for Java House!).

Then I queued for 30 minutes on a Fast Track! What a rip off. There wasn't that many passengers just that the staff were incredibly slow and were too busy chatting to each other and what a rude bunch they were.

My recent trip: Plane lands and taxis for 20 minutes to some remote outfield. Can't find any steps to get off the plane. Eventually they find 1 set so front passengers can get off. A bus arrives but it isn't big enough for all passengers. 40 minutes after landing you embark on the drive to the terminal itself and after 10 minutes in the bus you enter the labyrinth of tunnels under the terminal building only to come to a complete halt in a traffic jams. Stagger off the bus with only 8 minutes of your 1 hour connecting time left. Left to negotiate a series of steps and corridors back to the gate you just passed in the bus. Tunnel of Missed Connections runs for about 1km between A and B gates. To get to it you can wait for the inadequate lifts or carry your bags down about 8 flights of stairs before running.

On arrival we used the long term car park and was on a bus to the terminal within 10 mins so no problems. Check in desks with Easyjet were busy but took no longer than 15 minutes to get through. Security queues not long at all and all through easily and pleasantly? No problems at all so far (at it was 10am on a busy Sat morning). Had a pleasant enough breakfast in the cafe before leaving flight on time etc. Only issue I had was after being called to the gate Easyjet decided to allow folks who wanted to put their hand luggage in the hold do so at the gate free of charge and as a thank you allow them on as speedy boarders? Stood in a stairwell for around 10 mins after getting our tickets checked? So all in all it was not bad. Return journey as well was fine slight delay in getting through security but 4 planes seemed to have landed at once causing larger queues but this was only about 10 mins hold up.

The planners should have visited a couple other airports before ever daring to think they could make any improvements. Boarding areas are way too small. Would have been fine in the 50s when the average plane was the size of a Douglas DC-3 but the aircraft today are a tad bigger. First class lounge is a joke. One never knows from one week to the next where the taxi stand is going to be. Taking public transit would be fine but one needs to be in the know so as not to be duped into taking the way overpriced CAT. (City Airport Train) Taking the CAT would almost be acceptable except that when you arrive at Wien/Mitte (train station) you then still have to buy a ticket on the subway to get anywhere else. (or take a cab) With the S-Bahn you can simply buy a ticket for EUR320 that will then take you to anywhere within the zone 100.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,Laurens Verkade,Canada,2012-04-24,One of the most poorly managed major airports in the world: poor signage inadequate directions masses of people lined up and waiting for security passport control or immigration - we even had to line up and wait for access to the Business Lounge. Not enough sky-bridges to handle all incoming flights so many arriving planes must park on the tarmac; passengers disembark using mobile stairs and are then bussed to the terminal (about a 10 mins ride). Passports are checked at disembarkation then again upon entry to the terminal then again at a security checkpoint. There is a checkpoint to check boarding passes in the corridor between the security checkpoint and the lounge between gates B42 and B44.

moscow-domodedovo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-domodedovo-airport,Moscow Domodedovo Airport customer review,Nick Fortuna,NA,2007-07-18,I used Domodedovo on a couple of occasions in June. The airport train from Paveletsky Station was badly signposted. There are four halls to choose from - by trial and error (welcome to Russia). It is located in Hall 3. The ticket counter to the Airport was closed because the power went out (welcome to Russia). The 'Help' Desk wasn't able to help. Power came back on ticket was sold. The train is the old rattly variety departing every 40 min. No airconditioning. Then again I can only compare with Vienna and HK. If you use the city check-in you're on the train for free. Airport itself was busy being holiday and charter season. Austrian's check-in went smoothly. Since we were Senator members we got to use the VIP passport control and security. A new whole-body scanner was in use though it broke down and we had to wait ca. 10 minutes for it to reboot. So much for VIP service. Airport facilities are excellent - lots of shops and a whole food court upstairs. Sheremetyevo take note! Arrival too was a breeze. Toilets were clean stocked and functional a welcome worthy of the name. Immigration was the usual Russian mess with no clear line(s) but push your way to the front and feign ignorance. Baggage arrived quickly enough and after the customs gauntlet you run the taxi mafia gauntlet (though not as bad as Sheremetyevo.

The first thing most people will need to do after walking off the tarmac and into the small arrivals area in the terminal is line up for a visa. It takes a few minutes to do the paperwork so if you're late coming off the plane expect to wait about 10-15 minutes. Make sure to have a passport-sized photo and some cash preferably $US ready. After paying the appropriate fee depending on your nationality and picking up your passport with visa you'll get your passport stamped at the next booth. As I mentioned the arrivals area is very small so you immediately reach the baggage claim area after immigration. My bags were already off the belt and waiting on the floor. Passing through customs you can find your way to the exit where either your ride is waiting for you or you can head to the taxi counter and pay a flat fare of 5000 kip (or $US5) for a ride whether for 1 person or 4 people to your accomodation in Luang Prabang.

Not sure if this issue of being hassled is still an issue anymore? People were friendly (as I found throughout Ghana). There are lots and lots and lots of checks - I think 8 in total including immigration - just accept it and allow time. Air conditioned throughout. The restaurants are on the Ghana side of immigration - it does all the Ghanaian dishes food was OK a bit expensive but fine. Also there is a place that does burgers fries sandwiches etc. Food on the other side is limited so if you are hungry and want more than a sandwich eat the Ghana side of immigration. All European planes leave about 9pm hence there are a lot of people going through about 7pm. KLM say they close their check-in desk 2 hours before flight leaves - don't know if this is true as I didn't test it! I took the advice of the airline and checked in before 7pm and then waited in the middle waiting area - after immigration but before final set of security checks - which has small restaurant duty free shops (with very expensive local goods and booze etc) before proceeding to the boarding area which is cramped and smelly. Note when you have gone through immigration but before you get to your boarding gate if you are flying to Europe you have to go through another security scannerso ensure any water you buy after immigration is sealed in a bag. You also have to go through another 3 passport checks so be prepared!,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

There was no skybridge and no bus - they actually made us walk for a hundred yards in the dark to reach the 'terminal'. I don't have to mention that everyone from the ground staff to the guys unloading the luggage were rudely asking us for money all the way through. The arrival hall was a disaster. We were herded through like cattle past passport control and customs - the fact that they took their time shaking down each and every of the foreign passengers for money didn't make the queue go any faster. There was no AC in the hall and no ventilation either. Speaking of queues - the Indian passengers didn't seem to know what that was and crowded the counters in spite of protests from the foreigners in line. Baggage pickup was in a dinghy hall where our stuff was just dumped in the middle in a huge heap leaving us to pull it out by ourselves. There was no security and no order at all. From the outside the airport tried its best to exude a modern facade with a sweeping roof apparently built at great expense by an American company and it did succeed even though the roof was badly maintained and falling apart in places.

Domestic arrivals and departures use Terminal B only Terminal F is used for international arrivals and departures. Terminal B is around 300 metres from Terminal F is served by small 20 sealer free buses or you can take a 10 minutes walk if you are flying on elsewhere in Ukraine. It is true that staff are uninterested but that is the Eastern European way so far as service is concerned. It is also true facilities are lacking and catering wildly over-priced. Nevertheless I found it efficient enough. Give yourself plenty of time. My flight from Brussels was well handled and my bag on the carousel within minutes. You no longer have to fill in customs forms unless you are in possession of large amount of currency (ies) or bullion and the customs men were fine agreeable and English speaking. I had to take it to Terminal B and check in once more for my onward flight to Odessa. Terminal B has only one cafe where it cost 184 Hrivinas (about $18) for a toasted cheese sandwich and a pint of Stella Artois. They didn't even blush when asking this shameful amount! Coming back (you take the transfer bus waiting at the plane steps to Terminal F) although my bag was ticketed through to the UK I actually had to pick it up where the truck drops all the plane's luggage and check it in again just inside the building.

I agree that this brand-new terminal is spacious and well-designed. The only too often long distance involved in getting to your departure gate is pleasantly shortened though efficient moving walkways. The airport is conveniently located near the city and cabs are plentiful. The bus option is equally convenient and certainly cheaper although it should be noted that buses are not entirely reliable when it comes to getting to/from the airport either early in the morning or late in the evening. Negative aspects include: The blunt inadequacy of the existing catering facilities in the departures area. These are basically limited to two (twin) self-service outlets with a more than limited and certainly overpriced range of products. Tables are scarce and dirty. one often has to remove what others have left before. The only existing restaurant is poorly located at one end of the terminal and consequently often passes unnoticed by the traveller. The standards of cleanliness can be much improved. The otherwise pleasant relaxing open-air area is often found in appalling conditions with rubbish and bird droppings scattered all over the place. The retail facilities are small and unattractive. The perfume bar is normally crowded and rather inconveniently located at one end of the duty-free supermarket selling groceries and other stuff which is rather off-putting during the perfume-shopping experience. Non-smoking regulations are bluntly ignored by both travellers and staff alike. The only two existing passport and security control areas often mean that the traveller faces a rather long queue. The arrivals halls are cold and depressing. The low concrete ceiling creates an oppressive atmosphere. As in many other airports in Spain smokers automatically light their cigarettes the moment they get here when smoking is theoretically not allowed in this area.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The ""Plane Train"" is large fast and very frequent and the new LED/LCD display inside the train cars looks great. I've had better results using ""Plane Train"" when changing terminals than trying to walk/run. I usually try to avoid having to go through security during peak hours on Monday mornings (even priority lanes get very long). Other times aren't bad but priority lanes sure do help a lot. ""TSA pre"" is also available in South Terminal which I heard is more faster and convenient than priority lanes ( haven't personally used that yet but colleagues of mine did). Baggage is also handled quite well. Never had a lost/delayed baggage when checked in at ATL.

I read the criticisms of both and find that while I agree with some of the things that are said about them both when it comes to choice I would always prefer Liverpool over Manchester because Liverpool is smaller and less crowded. I agree that it is looking tatty around the edges and that the management seems to be doing all it can to encourage spending even removing most of the seats near gates 12 and 3 where we used to wait happily away from all the commercial outlets for our flight to be called. However it has a big airy security area where we have never encountered any long queues whereas we have found security at Manchester both congested and claustrophobic. It has rarely taken us more than 30 minutes from one of the on site car parks to the departure lounge on our outward journey while on our most recent return journey we landed at 23.30 and exited from the car park at 23.50. At Manchester one is lucky to complete the same process in an hour unless you pay over the odds for the closest car parks.

Passengers are left to their own devices to exit find baggage claim or - anything. No clearly marked instructions when deplaning at all. Security staff act like prison guards and treat bewildered passengers like criminals. The exit is crammed with drivers hawking car services. The exits are blocked by the crowding. There isn't an official seeming person in sight. I'm a fairly hard boiled New Yorker but coming back into the country via JFK Airport just now (7/16/14) has really rattled me.

First I've arrived on another airline and been unable to get help in the transit lounge from Air I'voire even though they are my next flight. You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them. Second if you go through the passport desk they have plain clothed policemen without badges who demand your passport in the luggage area without identifying themselves.

My comments relate to the older national terminal.

This sets the tone for what is usually a pleasant visit to the city of Holguin. Incoming passengers walk to the terminal where an excellently designed baggage conveyor promptly brings the luggage to be reclaimed.

karachi-airport,/airport-reviews/karachi-airport,Karachi Airport customer review,Moyene Najmi,NA,2006-01-27,"Karachi airport is pretty run-down from the last few years that I have been visiting the place both for international and domestic travel. While the terminal building was originally inaugrated around 1993 and constructed by a french company its a basic airport. There is a duty free a shopping arcade for Pakistani handicrafts and a McDonalds Kiosk for those who just have to have a Big Mac. However while the airport may be maintained to some extent its not neccesary that everythng will be spank. Lightning can be an ""occasional"" issue and the local authorities have put in these hideous looking black glass enclosures everywhere which are not coherent with the original airport design. A welcome addition is the Citigroup ATM kiosk right there at International Arrivals which adds a colourful touch to a rather mundane airport. The best part is that the terminal has lots of space for developing passenger facilities including new restaurants bookshops and coffee shops etc. Heck on the street level Pakistan has every conceivable food franchise including McDonalds Pizza Hut KFC Costa Coffee and Papa Johns. The airport has none other than a McDonalds kiosk which is not open 24 hours. The duty free also needs a brush up as the current operator is not allowed to sell alcohol. All in all the airport is modern and the size of the terminal manageable unlike other asian and western airports which overwhelm passengers with their long walks and distant parking lots. Also the huge underground parking which has not ever been opened since the airport came into existence in 1993 needs to be opened up.... whats the use of having it in the first place!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Yesterday on a flight from Shanghai Pudong to HKG the flight left almost 6 hours late-even though the weather in Shanghai was clear. The only explanation ever given is that there are ATC delays.

Often she disappeared around a corner and I had to hurry to see which way to proceed. The people movers did not work and I was exhausted and finally ended up in a wheelchair myself. The design of this new terminal is grossly flawed in that the distance from gate to baggage and customs is at least a mile and there is no good way to get there!

oakland-airport,/airport-reviews/oakland-airport,Oakland Airport customer review,S Glavan,NA,2008-07-16,I recently moved to the Bay Area from the Pacific Northwest and was accustomed to Portland's ultra- efficient ultra-clean moderate sized airport. So imagine my chagrin when I first tried to utilize Oakland's terminals. I understand that the airport is in the process of remodeling and restructuring but there seems to be little regard for the traveler in this process. Curbside drop off and pick up are disorganized and confusing. The people charged with directing traffic appear unable to bring any order. Long term parking is also confusing and shuttles are inconsistent. Using public transit as an alternative is a poor option. Unlike San Francisco airport’s direct BART access the nearest BART stop is several miles away from Oakland’s airport and passengers have to transfer to a shuttle bus that charges an additional fare to get from the BART station to the airport often stuffing passengers to the limits of standing room only. One can only assume that this is done in order to maximize the fares for each trip. Once at the airport ticket check-in and TSA lines are often overwhelming and leave passengers feeling like cattle in a pen. Lines often stretch out the doors onto the sidewalks leaving passengers little time to reach their gates once they have navigated this maze. Restaurants and shopping options are limited and crowded. Arriving passengers must deal with a baggage claim system which includes electronic signs at the carousels that often do not reflect accurate flight information and waits of a half hour or more for luggage to arrive on the carousels is not unusual. San Francisco offers far better amenities and services for the traveler but can be difficult to reach for those who live in the east bay. Fares to and from Oakland tend to be lower than those to and from San Francisco but almost identical to San Jose if one is willing to drive a little further south to avoid all of the hassles. All in all with the choice of three major airports serving the Bay Area there seems to be little attraction for choosing Oakland’s facility.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Landside facilities have greatly improved in recent months with many new eating establishments and so on and you can now walk from the main terminal into T2 without having to go outside again. There is limited option for shopping before going through security to the departure area but they have a few bureuax de change and various food outlets and bars. Security waiting time was about 10mins and seemed to be very efficient since it looked busy. There is a large duty free shopping zone which you have to pass through to get to the gates. Once you are airside there are various shopping eating and drinking facilities although on the international area these are limited and the shops look empty. The international area also became very warm and uncomfortable considering it wasn't a warm day. Boarding gates are well sign posted and there are quite a few information boards telling you where to go. On arrival we waited a while at passport control as a few flights had arrived at the same time but not any longer than any other airport. Baggage was delivered fairly quickly with no problems.

The shopping is good and if you can get into a lounge they are very good too.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,Kathie Schoenleben,United States,2014-01-06,I am a LH frequent traveler and use the Frankfurt airport for domestic German travel very often. I also use other German airports such as Munich Dusseldorf Hamburg Cologne Berlin on a regular basis so I have a good basis for comparison. I never cease to be amazed at the back-level stage of this hub of Europe. Twice I almost missed flights because of long lines - even long lines at the baggage drop when you already have a boarding pass. Why does this mega-airport have no self service bag check? If anything goes wrong with weather anywhere not just Frankfurt this airport seems to collapse - and there is total confusion and lines with no one managing them. This airport made me finally break down and stop checking bags. Even worse though is the security lines - the area has been redone and modernized with the result that there is more space but the security people work in slow motion! After observing them go through their routine several times I think they are trained to go through a drill which has more steps than at other airports - at an incredibly slow pace. This airport has trained me to get to the airport well in advance so I can stand twice as long in the fast lane as at any airport in Germany. This has been going on for months and has not improved.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,K Painter,Czech Republic,2012-08-12,So once again my annual trip to visit my family. I arrived from Prague at about 23.30 and we were bussed to the arrivals area. I was quite amazed as the machines were working and I was able to clear customs in a few minutes. My sister picked me up – she still had to pay a pound for driving into the pick up / drop off area where I jumped into the car and we were away in two minutes. Return trip was not as enjoyable. I had bought some small items for my car and let the check in guy know that I wanted to go to the separate scanner just in case there were any problems. He misunderstood my English and proceeded to put a red “firearms” tag on my suitcase. I explained to the officer and once again he had real difficulty understanding me. So now the rush to the loading gate a complete nightmare I am not “disabled” but have great difficulty walking any more than 100 metres without being able to sit down and have a rest for a minute. The sign telling me that I had only 300+ metres to go didn't help at all and by the time I reached the top of those steep stairs down to the loading gate I was in agony. Until they do something about this I will down mark this airport.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

We paid the visa tax on prior trip so we proceeded straight to the immigration officer. Immigration a bit of a mess but Baggage claim went without problem.

There was also no clear information displayed how to get to the other terminals (we had to pick up my parents) On the way back the departure lounge was even worse ancient looking dirty carpets rude people and security staff and duty free shopping was a joke.

nimes-airport,/airport-reviews/nimes-airport,Nimes Airport customer review,John Barefoot,NA,2007-08-20,A very small quiet airport and with only a few flights a day check-in is very quick and hassle- free. Probably one of the easiest airports I have ever used as long as transport to and from the airport is planned in advance or is directly connected to your flight. Between flights a great silence descends on the place. In the main hall there are several car hire desks one cafe stand (offering good quality hot sandwiches) and a small restaurant upstairs for those needing a traditional large French lunch. There are no shopping opportunities either in the main hall or in the departure lounge (a small cafe stand there). The main point is that because there are so few flights passengers are easily organised and you are unlikely to spend much time at the airport and what could be better! When arriving you need to rent a car OR pick up the ONE shuttle bus service linked to the flight that will take you into Nimes city OR have a friend collect you. There is a taxi rank if you need to leave at a time not linked to a flight but taxis seem very infrequent we once needed to leave the airport at a time not connected with a flight and waited half an hour for a chance taxi to arrive as there is so little activity apart from the few flights a day. The rent-a-car car park is directly across the road from the airport main exit just a few steps. Most customers seem to use Hertz because it is advertised with Ryanair but there are several other car desks and it would pay to plan ahead and find the best deal regarding rates and maybe avoid the problematic and hefty supplementary insurance fee that Hertz offer unsuspecting customers on arrival. Going back to the airport after a stay in Nimes there is just one shuttle bus per flight. Don't miss it. There are four points in Nimes city centre where the shuttle can be picked up and the main hotels have the timetable. The hours on the hotel timetable were slightly different from the times displayed on the bus stop but the hotel timetable seemed to be the correct one. The time allowed between shuttle arrival at the airport and last check-in time seemed too close for comfort but in fact it was fine just right and things work smoothly because there are so few flights. Going back with a hire car the airport is very close to exit 2 on the A54 autoroute very easy access. Hertz (and perhaps the other companies) also have a base in Nimes at the railway station where a car can be collected or left as an alternative to the airport.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Well it is actually an airport and therefore it is quite possible that some passengers may not understand English especially English spoken with an accent. I don't use this airport often but when I do it never fails to disappoint. Come on Liverpool - get your act together. When it's taking longer than 5 to 10 minutes to get an individual through security - open another lane - take a lead from the supermarkets! Train your staff on how to be efficient and courteous.

The terminal is perfect to perform a terminal's main goal - getting people quickly and efficiently off and on an airplane onto or off a cab/bus/. It took less than 10 minutes to leave the plane pick up my luggage pass immigration (being a non-US citizen) and into a cab. When leaving check-in desks are plenty and gates are only (on average) a 2 minutes walk from security gates (which are next to the check-in desks). Be aware that T5 has no eateries and only very basic duty free. Almost nothing in fact.

Baggage check is not unfriendly with efficient officers taking less than 5 minutes for my carry-on and large suitcase. An oddity - the check-in (which was efficient taking into consideration the line of about 70) was placed after the baggage check. The areas are spotlessly furnished with marble floors and a mural about the developing aviation industry. Transit facilities were just about adequate with no airport hotel but about 5-10 shops and well-maintained waiting areas. Immigration/passport check was swift and well-carried-out. Arrival facilities were also top-notch - duty-free efficient staff but no restaurant disappointment to food-lovers like me. Chatted with arrivals officer who complained good-naturedly about my mandarin writing - what do you get when you are on a shaking plane? another oddity - there is a long tunnel straddling all gates for staff.

Yet the automated pay machines do not accept 50Euro notes or Laser debit cards. Staff are very friendly and the small size of the building is makes a pleasant change from most other airports. At present catering is limited to drinks and snacks. Beware of one outrageous thing: each passenger is required to pay a fee of 5Euro at check-in to fund the future development of the airport. Nowhere during the booking process is this mentioned. Furthermore when other busineses plan expansions there is no requirement for current customers to pay upfront.

minneapolis-st-paul-airport,/airport-reviews/minneapolis-st-paul-airport,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,S De Penning,NA,2007-10-16,Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport seems optimum in the sense that it is large enough to offer passengers multiple shopping and dining venues and yet it still maintains a very clean and modern environment despite its size - something I have to appreciate after having been to more rustic monstrosities such as Chicago O'Hare. It is true that Northwest Airlines dominates the airport and its passengers may have to walk long distances to and from its many dispersed concourses but this actually seems to translate into an advantage for passengers flying other airlines because most of them seem to have their operations concentrated on one concourse that is quite close to check-in baggage claim and the Northstar Crossing dining/shopping. So if you are traveling say American Continental Delta etc. you may not even realize the immense size of the airport because you are not likely to contend with it. My one complaint about MSP is that there are very few shops and restaurants open during the early hours of the morning which is an inconvenience for persons such as myself who normally arrive at the terminal quite early for flights departing at 6 or 7 a.m. with international connections and would like to eat or shop before boarding.

The problem is compounded by poor signage often courtesy of Lufthansa (could someone please instruct them that white lettering on a yellow background is not a readable choice). At one point I didn't even notice I had exited one security zone to enter another until I was almost past it (no sign saying ""Leaving secure zone"" only a ""no entry"" sign facing the other way!). When I asked the security officer who saw me there trying to see what the other side of the sign said he forced me to go through the security line all over again if I wanted to turn back! Of course this wouldn't be nearly as big of a problem if each section of each terminal had adequate food and shopping options but all but one of them most emphatically do not. International travelers going through a major hub expect more choices (without a trip through security) than just one sit-down restaurant one coffee shop one news stand and a duty-free! I won't even get started on the small infrequent and hard-to-find restrooms. That said if your destination/departure is Frankfurt the range of ground transport options hotels and car hire makes it quite convenient. For everone else I'd much rather connect through a modern efficient hub like Amsterdam or Zurich!",NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
phnom-penh-airport,/airport-reviews/phnom-penh-airport,Phnom Penh Airport customer review,L Cronje,Cambodia,2011-10-12,PNH Airport has yet again been renovated lately in 2011 for the better. Everything is improving even airport taxes are now being included in most ticket prices for flights departing which is great especially if you forget to take extra cash with you or for visitors that wasn't informed.

ho-chi-minh-city-airport,/airport-reviews/ho-chi-minh-city-airport,Ho Chi Minh City Airport customer review,B Ford,NA,2009-12-08,Very shiny and big and new - really much too big considering the number of passengers and the new terminal seems a bit of a white elephant given that they're planning a brand new airport for HCMC in the medium term. I can't say anything about arrivals but processing was pretty speedy for departures - I even got a smile and some friendly conversation from the guy at the immigration desk which are rare in the typically glum and/or stern world of Vietnamese officialdom. As other travellers have commented the duty-free and food in the airside section are pretty expensive - 3 USD for tiny little cakes at one of the cafes for instance and I paid 4 USD for a pretty but not incredibly remarkable fridge magnet. What it is really lacking is a newsagency - there's precious little to do if you have to wait there for a couple of hours (if you don't fancy paying through the nose to dine at one of the restaurants upstairs) and grabbing a decent magazine or book would be a good way to cope. At the moment all that seems to be available are the propagandist Vietnamese English-language papers - not exactly a substitute for The Economist. Overall it's hardly going to compete with KLIA Changi or Bangkok as a SE Asian hub but it's clean and efficient enough not to be the complete nightmare you might expect in a communist country.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Miami Intl makes transiting in Frankfurt a marvellous experience.

Staff at Miami appear to be trained to be rude and unhelpful to passengers. We asked a female staff if we could go in front of the massive queue as we were just about to miss our flight and she said if we miss our flight we just miss it. After immigration one has to endure the other queue to get through customs which is another awful experience. There were more than 1000 arriving passengers and only two members of staff dealing with the queue. We waited an eternity for our bags at carrousel 8 where it was announced they will be delivered. However they were delivered at 6 and we were not told of the changes. Staff just do not care about passengers.

The only drawback being the often very long (and slow) queue to security and sometimes to the check in. The latter are the bottlenecks. Security is often understaffed and this is a long standing and notorious problem at this airport. My experience is that all staff are generally very polite and helpful and often friendly too. Walking distances are notably long though walkways are provided. The best feature is the baggage reclaim - it is extremely fast and it is not uncommon for your luggage to be at the reclaim before you arrive there. Free WiFi is provided.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,A Leinenkugel,United States,2015-02-24,I have traveled all over the world and this was by far the most tiring experience. This was my first experience at Schiphol and I do not recommend it I will be utilizing other international hubs in Europe even if it costs me more money to do so. I was transferring to another plane in Schiphol and while a 2 hour transfer window at any other airport would have warranted time to eat and have a drink it was barely enough time to get on the plane. As such while the facilities looked decent I cannot comment on the food and drinks. I am not sure how this airport is rated so highly but as many others have stated Schiphol is horrible because of the following: Passport Check lines chaotic and slow for non-EU passports (40 minutes). Security personnel are rude (would not be as big of a deal if you didn't have to deal with them so often). Check-in at the gate is 1.5 hours before flight because of the ridiculous decentralized security process. Once again this is a transfer not the initial security check at your first airport. Security interview at gate - seriously this is a first for me and everyone must go through it and is absolutely a waste of time (1 hour with a short line in front of me). Removal of everything in my carry-on - as a traveling consultant I have 2 laptops a tablet a phone and all the necessary chargers headphones and adapters which means everything comes out into clear plastic bags. Yep I needed 3 of them. Luckily I avoided having to wait in the purgatory room after security and prior to boarding as I was one of the last people on the plane. My hard shell checked luggage was cracked open the entire length of the bag. This may have not been the airport's fault but I'll chalk that up to KLM.

Nowhere comfortable to sit (apart from the floor) coffee rip off (see above) shops were poor with bored looking staff. The terminal stank of cigarette smoke from the indoors smoking area that wafted throughout the terminal. My tip if you have to transit through - take your own cup and tea bag/instant coffee and help yourself to the hot water. If all else fails organise a flight for the next day and stay over at a hotel.

My recent experience involved arriving back from Gran Canaria touching down at approximately 3:15 am on 3rd January having already been delayed by around 4 hours in departure. Having made our way to the baggage collection area with my family and disabled 6 year old son in an airport wheelchair we waited over 2 hours for our baggage to come around including my sons own wheelchair. If this wasn't unacceptable enough no logical or legible information was given to us as to the reason for the delay other than the weather was too cold for the baggage handlers to work (even though it wasn't cold enough to stop planes from landing and taking off). The ensuing response from the baggage staff was unacceptable. Even though they were under pressure from many tired and angry passengers the Thomas Cook representative along with the Global Baggage attendants were rude and avoided giving any indication of when baggage would be available. There was no management of the situation evident and those that proclaimed to be in charge were wholly inexperienced in handling a situation such as this so much so that at one point they called the airport police to assist in quelling the growing anger being demonstrated by the crowd. All in all one more highly unacceptable experience within Manchester Airport. Given the amount of footfall through arrivals in terminal one it should be expected that there would be back up plans should there be problems of this nature. To keep already delayed passengers waiting and uninformed many with children and small babies is at best an amateur effort at situation management but in my opinion it is an affront to customers who have paid considerable amounts of cash to travel and expect a minimum level of customer service way better than that demonstrated.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

They then suddenly were very quick. The toilets aren't provided with coat or handbag hangers which I find not practical.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I flew there on 7 August only because I was taking advantage of the promotional fare on Air France's A380. I was apprehensive and right to be so. Although more light reaches the upper level the terminal lower level is gloomy. The walking distances are unbelievable; we took a shuttle train within 2E and still had considerable walks in the same terminal and subsequently from baggage claim to RER station. Baggage arrived at a carousel other than that advertised on the plane's information screen. I did not see any master screen to direct one to the correct carousel. Ticket machines on the cluttered station concourse were difficult to spot but do take 'foreign' credit cards which they used not to (a long time ago).

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-02-18,There are good points: the building is quite airy and there was adequate seating when we were there (though it could not have coped with many more passengers) there was a good choice of eating places mostly not the usual boring international fast food outlets. Getting to and from the centre took about 20 minutes by taxi at a reasonable price (we had pre-booked on arrival which I recommend if you can). However there is one huge downside which has coloured my experience - the absurd process of immigration and emigration. You fill in an immigration card on the flight and then queue to have it and your passport checked and stamped. In our case it took about 30 minutes just about acceptable. On leaving though you fill in another (identical) and form take it to your airline desk to be stamped if you only have hand luggage (as we did) you thus queue (15 minutes in our case) for a process that takes about 30 seconds. You then go to the embarkation area and queue again (5 minutes) to check that you have been to the airline desk. This allows you into the hallowed ground of the emigration area where you queue (about 40 minutes) to have the paperwork checked and a stamp in your passport. All over? Oh no there was another officer standing about 1 metre behind the desk you have just passed who randomly stopped people to check again (admittedly we were not stopped). So over an hour queuing to get a stamp to leave the country. Marrakech clearly needs and attracts many tourists and has much to offer if it wishes to continue increasing the number of visitors it has to find a more efficient way of processing them into and out of the country.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

I appreciate there is a need for security but when they are just standing around talking & appear to be in no rush I guess it makes TSA look good. British Airways need to be aware that the poor customer service is a reflection on them so they do need to ensure there is a level of customer service set in line with their excellent customer service BA provide. The other area which is annoying is the amount of walking to go from Fast Track which is next to the BA Lounge to then walk halfway down the terminal only to double back on yourself. We all know it is a ploy to get passengers to walk through the numerous shopping outlets which the majority of business passengers ignore so come on BA & BAA allow the business passenger direct access to the BA Lounges next to Fast Track as most of us have no interest in buying anything from the shops in T5.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

The only drawback may be the baggage handling which is slower than for example in Zurich. But this is largely compensated by the short distance to town.

Airside zone A is very modern. zone B seems to be reserved to easyjet and charter flight so it is often crowded and lacks shopping facilities.

Half of the congestion is caused by the tour operators collecting customers for a number of flights on the same coach meaning many are arriving at the airport well in advance of their required check in time! I travel to Corfu at least twice a year and have done so for the past 10 yrs. The tour operators are causing most of the problems by bringing flights in on basically two transfer days.

The first issue was immediately being shouted at by a charming young lady handing out clear plastic bags before security. She just seemed to scream at everyone (and anyone) for no apparent reason. Next up was the carnage which was security a wait of 45 mins underneath the hottest roof spotlights in queues which went nowhere fast. The number of passengers waiting was actually quite low it just took an excessive amount of time. Finally once it was our turn to be screened we were met by incredibly rude staff. Now sometimes people say that staff are rude whilst they are simply just being efficient and doing the job with no fuss this wasn't the case. These security staff were frankly disgraceful rude remarks to simple questions and then providing zero information when the whole screening machine/process temporarily broke down. So got through security and looked forward to grabbing a coffee. Exited the security section to be met by a red barrier across the corridor it turns out that a toddler designed this section of terminal 3. If a plane is disembarking from some gates you cannot walk from one section to another speechless! To make this albeit slight inconvenience worse we had to listen to the two female ground staff who were guarding this red barrier and supervising the disembarkation of the British Airways Airbus (at 16.25ish on Tues 3rd Feb 2015). They seemed to relish being able to control a large group of passengers who were now running rather late thanks to security delays and who were now stuck between this red barrier and security. Some passengers were really late and asked if they could be let through to the gates it turns out that at least this is possible. But only once you had been spoken to like a child and told ""your too late"" and ""should have got to security earlier"" (really). They then spent the remainder of this lovely encounter laughing and joking about the plight of those late passengers in front of about 50 passengers. Brilliant. Finally boarded a nice peaceful aircraft after one of the rudest most uncomfortable airport experiences I have ever encountered. I will never fly from this terminal again at Manchester.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,Jane Burns,United Kingdom,2014-06-25,I had a lovely 50th Barcelona Trip booked for me by my daughter on the 7th June. Unfortunately we missed the flight due to what I can only describe as the security cattle market in Terminal 3. The flights were all booked online check in online and boarding passes printed on line a week before we left. On arrival at the airport we joined a queue that was fractious and so long I have never seen anything like it. Staff were asking people to move to the front of the queue depending on their time of flight giving passenger only 20 minutes to go through security. Then to find out that bags were being checked by 1 member of staff who obviously could not cope with it and was not fit for purpose due to her false nails which hindered her ability to open cases and plastic resealable bags. It was appalling to say the least. Airport staff were screaming at each other when asked to fast track families through the queue. Obviously understaffed and unable to cope with the pressure. Hence we amongst other people missed our flight. When we finally arrived at out gate 213 Jet 2 staff said they knew we have gone through security as they could see it on their screen. It was the 1 baggage checker that was causing the back log.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Terminal 3 now caters for a vast array of airlines instead of being a mainly BA terminal for domestic flights. As such it is a lot busier and on a Ryanair flight the queue stretched from the gate around the cafe and past the duty free shops - poor organisation there. I was also reprimanded at the entrance to security for having a plastic bag of the wrong type! A food bag with a knot in the top that is very obviously able to be resealed. Apparently this is not allowed - even though I fly regularly and have never been told this before in any airport. When I questioned the security officer he said well alright then but you'll have a better chance if you put it in your partners plastic bag even though its too big (again nothing ever mentioned before about the size of the plastic bag he takes on).

You can wait at the medium term car park for free for the first half hour. Absolute rip off and un-necessary worry when trying to pick up somebody.

In the domestic terminal there are very few places to eat expensive food and are not good but very busy.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,N Cutts,United Kingdom,2010-01-21,Had the misfortune to transit through Dubai T3 on a couple of occasions in both instances flying Emirates on all legs. Both transits involved a long bus trip from aircraft to the terminal security checking (whilst necessary) was incredibly slow - far worse than other hubs such as AMS & SIN. Signage is very poor - although the terminal layout is relatively simple Main problems however are overcrowding and poor provision of facilities. As mentioned by other reviewers - the T1 problems were meant to be solved by T3 - maybe now T1 is OK but T3 is chaos. It appears that there are only around 4 sets of WCs for the main transit level with queues for the gents as well as ladies - possibly better to wait until you get through into the gate holding area before using the WC if possible although I'm not sure if there is WC provision in all of these. Very few seats available for the number of people wanting to use them and in general staff were unhelpful. Lots of bling shops if that's your bag but no focus on providing a quality service for passengers just wanting to transit. Had hoped T3 would make the 'Emirates' experience rival SIA etc but no way. Goodness knows what it will be like when load levels get back to full capacity and over the longer term when flight volumes increase. Somewhat amazingly it would appear that the architects have a long track record of airport terminal design - so maybe this was a 'Friday afternoon' terminal.

Transferring between terminals needs to be improved having to leave airside to go to your connecting terminal and then go back through TSA security. I had to line up for over 1hr to go through security so with the hour long wait for immigration & the hour wait to line up and go through security you need at least 3hrs if you are transferring to a domestic flight.

Although the airport is about 30miles from Glasgow the access is trouble free and reliable in the form of a train service and motorway both leading to Glasgow. It may be a bit of extra hassle getting to airport but while other airports may be suffering ice and snow it is a good bet that the runway at Prestwick will be open due to it's mild micro climate. The airport is mainly used by Ryanair and charter aircraft. The airport is under private ownership and not BAA like most other UK airports. The interior of the airport is old but it is efficient no crowds and every process from checking in to boarding is hassle free. There are bars and restaurants and even an observation balcony.

edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,James Crichton,NA,2009-04-07,Edinburgh airport is a small regional airport and is one of the best I've been in. Check in was quick and efficient as usual. Land side there was a number of shops and a newly opened/refurbished food hall which was clean and well maintained. We were able to pass through security within 3 minutes without any problems. The first thing I noticed airside was that all the windows had been boarded up making the gates look dull with poor lighting. I initially expected this had been done for security but I found out that they are currently increasing the size of the lounges and they will be opened in phases between 2009 and 2010. Virtually the same facilities are available airside as landside so I wouldnt bother spending anytime landside and go straight through.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

No air conditioning thus very hot and stuffy everywhere. Enormous queue outside the airport just to get in it was chaos and took us about a half an hour just to get into the airport. Why is there a security gate just to get in the airport? The Visa charge is a little bit of a rip-off but I can cope with that. I can't cope with spending £8 just for two milkshakes at McDonalds.

The Lufthansa web site for their commuter line (Cityhopper) said that only one carry-on was allowed (including a purse). But the agent let us take a rolling bag with a purse.

Being in Thailand for 10 years I have to say that the Airport seems to be finally listening and certain changes are visible to make life easier in this large airport. The excruciatingly long walks from gates to passport control still remains and something no one can do anything about. Certain airlines simply park way too far at the end of the concourse. Passport control officers are much faster even if they still lack common courtesy. They are more ""efficient"" nonetheless. The security (X-ray) staff are the ones needing an extensive training in politeness and customer care as they do treat passengers as cattle. I 100% ignore duty free in Bangkok airport since it cannot be called such when prices are higher than in the city.. food too overpriced as well with internet offered but not functional. If having the option to transit then I would strongly suggest KUL HKG and SIN if you have the choice. For the rest of us who simply have to fly from and to Bangkok it is not as bad as it used to be granted that I ""ignore"" most of this port's services simply check in and rush to gate and fly.

The extra security check at the gate for the AMS to MSP flight was expected what was not expected was being physically hit by the Dutch equivalent of TSA. The trays for laptops passing through the metal detector are sized to handle pocket change. I was worried that my laptop would fall from the tray. I walked through the whole body scanner all the while pre-occupied with what was happening with my laptop. After exiting the body scanner I walked over to the metal detector to retrieve my laptop. Next thing I know this TSA guy is hitting me on the back and yelling 'I'm not finished with you'. I was completely surprised and taken aback. There were no signs or people waiting just after exiting the body scanner saying I should stay put. I told the TSA guy that I didn't know I had done anything wrong and he yelled again that he wasn't finished. For those Americans who constantly complain about USA TSA try flying through AMS.

A poor member of staff helping to organise the queue said that this sort of thing happens all the time. Initially only half of the booths were manned but as the queue started to move faster and we entered the hall it was obvious nearly all the booths were manned.

In my most recent trip the luggage belt tripped 10 times. The luggage belts are very small probably good for the number of passengers coming out of a plane smaller than 737. But still for 747s and 777s they are using the same small luggage belts. Air conditioning is at its worst. For departing passengers the long lines start outside the building. You will spend around 3 to 4 hours in different lines before you are able to arrive at the boarding area again to find that there is no space to sit until boarding announcement is made.

The staff arrived shortly after 8.20 and took their time setting up. The counters for this particular flight did not have the usual roped off queuing so there was 4 individual lines. Myself and other people in the line could not believe it when the business class counter offered people behind us service before us. Usually this would not matter but we waited in line after serving commenced for 45 minutes. This was by far the worst experience I have received at an airport and can be attributed to bad attitude staff and staff with no common sense.

The queues for passport control which have always been terrible are now almost unbearable (this was around midnight as well) people queuing up the steps to the outside doors with a nightmarish post office queuing system. We were very lucky as my wife was carrying our sleeping 4 year old and a very nice female officer let us jump the complete queue from the bottom of the stairs to the front of the queue wonderful lady must have saved us at least 30 minutes. Returning I was surprised to find that half the seats had gone from the departure lounge and when we were called to our flight we had to walk for what seemed like miles through a seemingly endless maze of corridors and stairs a problem if you have a walking disability.

Firstly the idea of not having a pavement and trying to restrict pedestrian access to and from the airport is ridiculous. It is then absurd to erect notices saying Pedestrian Access not permitted ""For your safety""! When they have purposely made it unsafe for pedestrians by erecting barriers and not providing a pavement. The abandonment of the free 10 min drop off/pick and the impositon of the £2.50 charge with the accompanying barriered access road and permanent manning of a barrier is prison-like and I would have thought hardly financially beneficial considering the extra manning it must involve. At outbound security passengers are treated like idiots there is no table for passengers to sort their belongings into trays prior to the loaders as at other airports. Being a frequent traveller as many are we know the rules and are quite capable of loading out own trays at a table without the indignity of having to open bags and remove items on the floor in the waiting queue. Finally the new arrivals hall must have been laid out by either a prison warder or a gymnast. It is ironic to see 3 security officers patiently waiting whilst a new arrival of passengers negotiate the long distance chicane hardly wide enough to negiotiate with a trolley/case. Surely the girl at the head of the queue would be better employed opening the barriers so that the first arrivals can go straight to the desks and then opening other parts of a smaller chicane as nessesary. Certainly at other airports (eg Gatwick where passenger numbers are significantly greater) they see no need for a girl to show passengers to an appropriate desk or to have such lengthy chicanes a sign saying ""Wait here until called forward"" suffices.

Got off the plane at 9pm on a rainy Monday night: 2-minute walk to reach the shuttle train station 1-minute wait to get on the train 2-minute ride to reach the main terminal 2-minute walk to arrive at immigration 15 seconds to pass immigration (eligible to use the kiosk being a Korean citizen) 5-minute wait to claim all checked bags 10 seconds to pass customs and I was walking for the Airport Express station. Altogether only about 13 minutes despite arriving at the midfield concourse passing through immigration claiming 2 bags and passing through customs. Even the worst luck with gate assignment would have taken only 3 additional minutes for me and even for foreigners who cannot use the automated immigration kiosks would have completed all the steps within 30 minutes.

You just shove and elbow and get to the front of the crowd any way you can. Even for no reason... the mob getting in the front door resembled a rugby scrum but once inside there were no big crowds and thus no reason to push and shove rather than just wait in line - it's just the way they've always done it.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,I Maciver,NA,2009-11-17,Toronto has matured significantly with the demolition of two older terminals and the Term 1 more or less fully on line. Though the old names remain Term 1 and 3. Reasonable shuttle between Terms. But indeed depending on arrival gate you can have a long walk (some moving sidewalks) - benefit being most times your bags are on the carousel when you get there. Food is good. Go to Tim Hortons if only a coffee donut soup or sandwich will suffice. Prices are close to outside the airport. Lots of hotels adjacent to airport. Bus service taxi and Limo to get downtime. This is the weak link- no train subway nor LRT- (express service) - solution keeps being a govt promises. There is now a cell phone lot. Customs hall is large - and signage (ie 'EXIT') could improve significantly. Drug/Contraband dogs are used - particularly for flights from Jamaica . Departing is easy other than during peak times (use e-ticket and carry-on to speed up). Security is very good - 'greeter' gives preliminary warning and plastic bags so you can be through in minutes.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

There are also lots of places to eat and their prices are also high (I paid $2.00 for a can of soda pop). The terminal itself is very clean and bright the waiting areas are large with big flat-screen TVs (usually with Korean programming) and the seating is comfortable.

In the media it sounds very nice and looks at a first glance like an advantage for the travellers. But what they did not announce is that at the weekends where many travellers are doing city trips the fees have been increased by nearly 50%! So instead of 39EUR for a weekend (Friday evening to Monday morning) parking it now cost you 54EUR. The cost per day is now 18EUR instead of 13EUR before! I am pretty sure that this new pricing structure is not an advantage for the travellers as announced in the media but rather an advantage for the owner of the parking lots. I would appreciate if such public installations like airports would show more dignity and call their ""changes in price structure"" what they really are namely ""price increasing"".

lahore-airport,/airport-reviews/lahore-airport,Lahore Airport customer review,Shayaan Nadeem,NA,2003-12-28,The New Lahore Airport definitely contrasts positively from its dilapidated predecessor. The old airport lacked everything one could now find in other major world-class airports. Despite the cleanliness and refurbished appearance of the Allama Iqbal Terminal our CAA has let us down. There is an obvious lack of amenities and a shortage of space. During the busiest hours of departure the terminal is packed with people and the check-in hall can give a person a feeling of claustrophobia. In the international departures the immigration hall is deplorably small. Clearly there is inadequate space at the airport to accommodate for the increasing number of both International and Domestic air travellers. The airport lacks in space for passengers AND parking gates for aircraft. Of course the current air-traffic of our city does not require a massive airport but the expected increase in air travel will definately have to see an expansion of the parking facilities. Already there is often the need to park aircraft in their remote parking areas rather than near the terminal (with the boarding 'ramps'). There are three boarding ramps dedicated to International flights and three to Domestic flights. One ramp may be used for either. Another closely-related flaw is that there are very few baggage claims in both the International and Domestic terminals. Sure i haven't had a problem with my luggage at the airport YET but this inconvenience MAY soon become apparent if traffic increases. Lahore is after all a city quickly developing to attract tourists. As Mr. O. Khan said there are no discernable CIP lounges and there is a shortage of amenities (airside). No duty-free shops no entertainment. A literal torture chamber for transit passengers! Apart from this blunt criticism of the airport I must admit that it has changed air-travel at least a bit for Lahorites. We can now come home to a presentable well-lit and airy airport rather than the dingy and tastelessly-built old airport. An overall improvement and a clear full-hearted effort (the CAA did the best they could given the resources at their disposal) the Allama Iqbal International Airport of Lahore Pakistan is a destination to look forward to in itself which incorporates the city's vast culture and Mughal heritage. Hats off to the architect and the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority).,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

What we found was no food or drink facilities and nowhere to sit as there was not enough seats. We lay on the cold floor for 4 hours with many others who had nowhere to sit. This is completely unacceptable. When departures opened there was a massive queue for check in and no staff to check us in until 5am. By this time the queue was outside the main doors. Still no refreshments available to buy not even a single vending machine. By the time we checked in there was another huge queue for security mingling in with the queue for check in.

After reading many negative reviews of this airport we were not looking forward to it. However we were very pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. Check-in was a breeze allowing people who have checked in online to proceed straight to a bag drop counter. This worked very well unlike Sydney where it doesn't seem to be of any advantage to check-in online. All staff we encountered were smiling and pleasant and spoke English if required. Passport control and security were thorough polite and no slower than any other airport I have encountered. The shopping area has everything required and is reasonably calm and pleasant again unlike Sydney which is like a noisy Westfield shopping centre. We found the departure gates calming well organised with spotlessly clean toilets.

The security process which does take too long in most US cities was up to the excessive time scale I have become accustomed to. However luggage handling collection was much improved. My negative experiences on my last two trips has been the very low standard of the counter staff at the airlines check in desk. On this occasion she insisted on me having a China visa in my passport to visit Hong Kong which is not required. I showed her my HK resident card but she insisted on a visa was dismissive and ignorant of the visa requirements for entry and refused to check them. Eventually she checked myself and my partner - but at other ends of the plane even though we checked in very early. This was corrected elsewhere.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,M Allan,United Kingdom,2011-09-11,"Standards definitely seem to be on a downhill slide at this airport - noticeable over the past 5 years. Generally use T2 - check-in queues are usually just about acceptable (we usually fly early morning) but delays in getting through security are becoming a real deterrent to using this airport. Over an hour's wait on our most recent departure just to clear the secure area. Completely understand the importance of security measures but the airport needs to employ more staff. We were in T2 in August and it seemed quieter than usual - however the food court still had debris all over most of the tables at 6am. Dread to think what it must be like later in the day. Knowing that we normally board approx 40 mins before departure time we presumed that we were on for a delay when nothing appeared on the departure boards - thankfully we strolled down to our gate to double check - only to find that boarding had commenced. No wonder you hear so many last minute calls for missing passengers. My main gripe however is the experience on return. It is not unusual to wait over 30 mins for an airbridge. This is bad enough but then you have to tackle the immigration process - woe betide if a large aircraft has landed from outside the EU - could be an hour's queuing. Once that hurdle has been overcome there is the joy of baggage retrieval which seems to take longer at Manchester than anywhere else. These issues need sorting as they are worsening every year and Manchester ""International"" Airport is starting to resemble the gateway to a third world country.",NA,NA,NA,3,1,1,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

On the return to Mexico we arrived in AMS in the Morning around 11 and the Airport was packed. Lines were long at immigration but we could again use the EU Passport line which reduced waiting to 15 minutes. Security check done at the gate which saved time. Staff friendly and efficient.

I'm Italian and I'm the first to admit that in Italy cleanliness of public places leaves a lot to be desired. The toilets are often very dirty and so are the bar areas often with uncollected cups and plates on the tables. My other gripe is that checking in (at least with Easyjet) involves a shapeless queue and check in staff (who I believe are airport employees not Easyjet staff) often look as if they are really doing you a favour by opening their desk. However: Linate is very close to the centre of town a 15 minutes cab ride from my sister's house! I have never had any problems with luggage either (touch wood).

rome-fiumicino-airport,/airport-reviews/rome-fiumicino-airport,Rome Fiumicino Airport customer review,B McDonald,Australia,2012-09-03,I have flown in and out of Rome Fiumicino in the past few weeks both internationally and domestically using several different carriers and on all occasions the experience has been extremely poor. On arrival there are few air bridges meaning you have to be transported by bus to the terminal in crammed buses. Once in the terminal the baggage area is chaotic and disorganized. There are several privatized baggage handling companies meaning up to six flights' baggage end up on the same conveyor. Baggage took over an hour to reach the conveyor belt all the while sitting in summer heat with no air conditioning. The airport is dirty the toilets a disgrace. Signage is very poor to transfer and for the airport train. Baggage trolleys cost 2 euro there is no free wi-fi and security lines long. Airport staff seem to have no sense or care of urgency. If transferring allow at least 3-5 hours to allow for disembarkation transfer to the terminal baggage delays getting through security and immigration. All in all it's hard to believe that one of the world's most amazing tourist cities in western Europe has an airport that is so hopeless. Needs a complete overhaul or a new airport to be built.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
budapest-ferihegy-airport,/airport-reviews/budapest-ferihegy-airport,Budapest Ferihegy Airport customer review,D Vogt,Netherlands,2015-05-13,Ferighegy Airport is a quite efficient clearly signed airport. On our arrival from Amsterdam we were directed to an escalator about 25 meters away from our arrival gate and within 20 minutes we were out of the airport and on our way to our Hotel. Seamless experience there. Leaving Budapest towards Bucharest with TAROM was a smooth experience as well the SkyPriority counters were completely free and we were checked in in a matter of minutes. As they were very strict with the FastTrack we chose for the standard lane as my wife has no Priority status and we did not want to separate there but the queue on this busy 8am was short and efficient and within a small 8-10 minutes we were security cleared. Another few steps in the terminal to the non-schengen departures which were deserted at the time of our departure. The boarding process via the bus (it was a small commuter plane) was less orderly there was a priority section in the bus but which was not enforced so the run to the plane was opened as soon as the bus opened it's doors. Further up for the smoker the cigarette prices are highly competitive and you can take two cartons when travelling within the EU per person.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,T Adams,United States,2013-08-01,There is no airport quite like LAX. There are 3 entrances to the International terminal all of which are packed and crowded. Like a funnel. 1000's of people entering each hour at only 3 entrances. After checking in the queue through security is horrendous typically 30 to 45 minutes. The TSA agents are rude (as they are at all American airports). The international dining area does not have enough seating. When returning to LAX from flights overseas you are again waiting in long queues. Immigration wait time is ok. However after picking up baggage everyone is funnelled into one queue to exit the baggage claim (sometimes there are 2 queues). For domestic flights routinely the wait to go through security is horrendous with too many TSA agents. Very rude very slow very inefficient. Routinely at terminal 1 and 2 the queues extend out into the street while waiting to get through security. As an American I am ashamed that we are a first world country with a third world airport. Parking is atrocious. Not enough parking in the international terminal parking structures. also expect to wait 20 minutes to 1 hour in the parking exit queue. Even you only park for 1 hour you may need to pay for 2 hours because of waiting in the queue. When exiting the parking everyone is funnelled into 1 lane of traffic this year because of construction.

newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,S Joshi,United States,2012-10-05,"Every aspect of the flying process involved with Terminal A on Oct 4th 2012 was beyond being a ""mess"". TSA lines were so long that passengers arriving 2.5 hours before their flight time had no chance of reaching the gate in time. After moving 40% through the line a group of concerned passengers asked for help. We were ""load-balanced"" to the other A Terminal and told to use an airline shuttle to get to our correct gate. We missed the flight which left on-time. Standby passengers from early morning cancellations were ecstatic to find seats while the gate agents ignored the information of passengers stuck in the security lines. I was put on standby for a later flight. While waiting 25 mins before boarding the gate's destination board suddenly replaced cities. Checked online and discovered a gate change. When approaching the gate agent they were unaware of any change. To add to the misery the gate change was for use in the other Terminal A section. So back on the transfer bus - which also became quickly overwhelmed with an entire flight's worth of people rushing to the new gate. Once there - we find out that the flight is now delayed. We learn that yet another gate change has been enforced - fortunately within the same A Terminal section this time. After not making standby a handful of the original passengers were told they were confirmed for the next flight 4 hours later. To make things fun this flight is in the other Terminal A section. As we wait this flight also enjoys a delay announcement. We ultimately arrive at our destination (1.5 hours flight time away) after being at this airport for 11 hours. This airports layout and the airline's processes have an unfathomable amount of room for improvement. The customer service agents are rude the gate agents are clueless and the stupid logistics around the bus and two terminal A's and two TSA choke points is beyond comprehension.

The worst aspect are the unacceptable queues and waiting times at passport control by far the worst I have witnessed at any airport so far. This coupled with the average unpleasant attitude of the border agency officials the last one experienced only yesterday have made me decide on using other airports as a first choice. Stansted is the nearest in terms of distance and travel time to my home but the time saved with this is now overridden by the waiting transfer and wasted time on other aspects the main one being passport control.

Overcrowded and limited duty free space limited choice of books/newspapers restrooms not acceptable standards and very low airconditioning. Oryx lounge 40 USD for entrance is not gift but at least you have a well airconditioned space with comfortable chairs space and high speed internet. Food availability was limited - around 11am they offer lunch service yet limited. If you have more than a couple of hrs transit time using the lounge could be a good solution. Departure procedures were standard although pre boarding was very unprofessional. Pax were squeezed in a small preboarding hall for 30 minutes then moved by bus to A320.

faro-airport,/airport-reviews/faro-airport,Faro Airport customer review,J Foster,United Kingdom,2012-08-19,Just arrived back from Faro airport this afternoon and I have to agree with the last review that this is the worst airport I have travelled through with a young family. We arrived 2.5 hours before our flight time and spent the next 2 hours queuing to get through to the departure gate. Checking our bags onto the flight was relatively quick and straightforward however once through this stage we had to join the queue to pass through security. We had to go back through the bag check in desk and join the end of the queue which by now stretched to the far end of the airport. Did not appear to be any rational process or system in place to try and move travellers efficiently through this aspect of your journey. This was causing distress to many who feared they would miss their flight. We eventually made it through this stage to the duty free area only to discover that any chance of visiting the shops was not an option as the you had to join another lengthy queue stretching the full span of the terminal to get through passport control and onto your departure gate. Not acceptable and quite frankly shambolic. Our holiday in Portugal was very good however this was a frustrating exasperating and disappointing end to the holiday and not a pleasant experience for anyone unfortunate enough to be passing through Faro today. Not sure if this is the norm and I would be shocked if this is how the authorities at Faro airport and the people in charge of tourism in Portugal wish to portray their airport.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

The international terminal with its west coast themed design is a nice change from the steel and of many modern airport terminals nowadays. Good connections to the city center via the Canada Line as well. My biggest gripe is the security check upon departure. The set-up now seems to include one security person at a station scanning boarding passes for two adjacent lines. Seems a bit daft and it made a slow process even slower. Why not have something similar to T5 at LHR where each passenger scans their own boarding pass before they put their bags on the scanner? Or do the scan at the entrance to the security area?

Queue was c.20 minutes and although the questions were very thorough there wasn't anything asked that was out of the ordinary or unexpected. Plus obviously the usual photo and fingerprinting (all 10 fingers).

Booked a flight from the UK transferring in CDG only to find that the connecting flight was cancelled then it appeared to be delayed then it became a technical issue. Air France clearly could not make up their mind what was the problem but it was clear that they just pushed all passengers on the next flight so the delay (in the end they settled for a delay even the airport information signs changed from cancelled to delayed as otherwise they would had to come up with compensation payment of course) and accidentally the delay was rectified at the exact same time the next flight was meant to leave. Clearly there weren't 2 aircraft's waiting they just bumped us on the next one. We were stuck at the airport for six hours with a child oh dear what a disaster. Don't know what they were thinking when they designed the place but it's just such an awful place to waste your time. The design of the place is bland industrial soulless and boring and there is absolutely nothing to do but feel sorry for yourself having to spend time there. They have a handful of shops but many of these sell overpriced French design stuff which an average passenger can never afford. Staff in the shops make you feel awkward. Having these shops just sums up what this airport is about presumptuous style of substance. To make things worse the airport staff do not exactly understand the meaning of what good customer support is about. Some staff are rude and one just made us wait just to finish a chat with their colleagues with a queue waiting to speak to them. Again avoid the place.

Start with the condescending attitude of some of the staff 'helping' you navigate the automated passport machines. Then a reasonably quick trip through customs and immigration and baggage gives you hope. Then with a few hundred passengers trying to get their bags checked in for another flight YVR allows a very long queue to form. Next comes the security bottleneck with two checkpoints for all those people it took us close to an hour to clear our flight through that security point - I cannot imagine what happens when more than one comes in. With the exception of a very professional young woman steering you into one of the two lines the security staff were silent slow and unfriendly. Some people needed assistance but that was scarce and those with tight connections were not given any leeway. After a 15 hour flight from Sydney with everyone tired I can only say the passengers subjected to this treatment were more helpful and courteous in getting each other through than the staff at YVR.

Having experience explosive growth in the region with a new airport on the way it's amazing that this little military airport holds up under the pressure. There's a special charm about this airport - and while taxed by the increasing number of passengers coming through this tiny facility I think that the airport administration has done a pretty good job. Arriving from Paris at 1 AM I was through customs picked up luggage (after having to wake up the porters who were sleeping on the belt!) and into my car in 30 minutes. On the way out on a mid-afternoon flight from BLR to BOM I was checked in and through security in 10 minutes. While there was no lounge service just sitting in the main waiting area is quite an experience.

That aside the other services and facilities remain of a high standard and the modern departures concourse makes a pleasant start to your trip.

No ground staff were taking off bags that were left unclaimed for hours and again there was no information given (2) Ottawa Customs officers are bored. There's one truly international flight a day from London that I take at least once every two months. This is the highlight of the shift for these guys. I've never seen so many passengers pulled aside for the most trivial offences. There's a food-sniffing dog employed by the Food inspection people. A very cute dog but your heart sinks when he sits next to your bag. I did not appreciate being hauled into the inspection zone for a bag of potato chips from London that I'd forgotten to eat on the flight!

The downside is that there is absolutely nothing to do here if you have a spare hour. There are 2 or 3 small souvenir shops and about as many places to eat. The decor is non-existent and looks a bit old not the fanciest place you'll ever see. But they are efficient and things happened quickly because we had an early flight and it wasn't too busy.

I have never found security staff anything other than pleasant and professional. Returning - again no issues through passport control there was a queue all desks were staffed and the queue kept moving. It compares more than favourably with other regional airports across Europe. I'd like to make an observation on other largely negative comments about walking time to gates and irritating charges for trolleys and car pick up. Probably 80% of the airports landing fees revenue is from low cost carriers who are not prepared to pay for frills including moving walkways and air bridges. Even at airports with these facilities the likes of Easyjet and Ryanair end up in a basic terminal and/or one far away from the main entrance and when you get to the gate you can still be bussed to the plane.

Advice - Buy a visa and demand the airline put you up in a real hotel. If your flight cancels don't leave the airport until you have replacement tickets in hand. If they refuse get angry and cause a scene. It's crazy but it's the only thing that works. Also don't wait in lines. Ground staff is happy to point at any line that is far away in order to escape helping you. Also don't assume that anyone knows what they are talking about - they likely don't. Nothing is settled until you have a paper ticket in hand. It took me twelve hours to book a flight out and even that flight required that I be stranded for three days.

For example in connection HEL-WAW-POZ operated by LOT Polish Airlines all the passengers are screened in HEL but also in WAW which is idiotic. Also on the return way (POZ-WAW-HEL) everybody is checked in WAW again. So doesn't matter from where and to where you go in WAW you have another screening anyway. And the rules are these same for example no liquids even thought they were bought in HEL or in POZ in secure area. So no shopping before WAW transit.

The airport itself is small but there is a good bus service which will take you into the city centre pretty quickly. On arrival on the 13.00 HRS AF 7638 flight from CDG this flight seemed to coincide with a number of other flights from the UK which made the baggage arrivals area chaotic. In addition the toilet facilities landside need some upgrading and definitely could do with the cleaners visiting there on a more frequent basis especially mid-afternoon which seems to be the peak time for the airport. The rubbish bin in the gents toilet was overflowing when I was there which left a poor initial impression! The airport does have an excellent tourism booth with very helpful staff however. In addition from the airport one can get onto the nearby motorway very quickly and the care hire agencies also had very helpful staff at the airport (especially Europcar). On departing Biarritz back to Paris however I discovered that the departures area has only one very small cafe so passengers may not want to enter this area too quickly as the wait could be long and somewhat boring.

My pen gave up on me so I was unable to fill that yellow form when I asked the clerk if I may borrow the pen in his pocket for just two minutes he point blankly refused and rudely told me to go to another clerk. The other clerk was none the better as he very sarcastically asked me all the personal questions about where I study etc. Due to this I was delayed and got my bags late and almost missed my ride back home.

chicago-ohare-airport,/airport-reviews/chicago-ohare-airport,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,T William,NA,2009-02-02,I would say that the experience varies greatly depending on the terminal you face but at least in general security wait times have dramatically improved over the past few years. United and American each have their own terminals more or less that can look somewhat grim but have a fair amount of services available. The United terminal has a tunnel that you must walk through to get to most gates (C Concourse) but at least they more or less synched together the audio warnings about reaching the end of the moving walkway. Walk to gates for American can reach 10-15 minutes if your luck is bad. Terminal 3 feels Soviet in design aesthetic but at least is being updated. Access to/from city center can be truly problematic - most hours of the day the drive (20 minutes no traffic) is at least an hour and without a car you are consigned to either an extremely overpriced (US$50) cab or an uncomfortable train ride. Delays are probably the worst aspect - part of a political game to make the traveller suffer so that Daley can get the airport expansion approved.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

portland-airport,/airport-reviews/portland-airport,Portland Airport customer review,Jerry Wallace,United States,2014-04-07,I fly frequently through PDX sometimes several times per month depending upon where my current workplace is located. Pick-up and drop-off has never been a problem as long as one does so efficiently and if not then expect the traffic patrol to move you along. TSA is another matter. I am under medical orders to not use the scanner screens so must have pat-downs each flight. When I inform TSA that I cannot go through the scanner due to the medical conditions they are invariably rude and frequently leave me standing for several minutes. I work in an industry where I frequently test positive for certain chemical combinations which further puts the wind up in them even though I carry all the proper credentials and in all likelihood have had a more extensive background check to work in my industry than they do in theirs. I establish my credentials and usually have to demand a superior to handle the questioning and pat-down which makes the process longer but more civil. In short there is too much of the them-versus-us attitude from TSA. Other amenities are reasonable the toilet facilities are superior in cleanliness to most airports but the bars are irritating demanding identification-proof of age from those of us past 50 for a drink. Nonsense. In short PDX has both positives and negatives much like most airports access is good from the freeway the traffic jam is TSA.,NA,NA,NA,4,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Seating often fills up and people are forced to sit on the floor and wait for a flight to depart to free up some seats. Check in is slowed by immigration and security agents checking each passenger's papers before you get to the airline counter. Security lines can back up since there is only two lines.

Not sure if they've switched to post paid at the international side too - but for the previous comment who was complaining about the range of fares to Defence Colony I wonder if s/he was comparing air-con radio cab prices (about twice yellow-and-black cab fare) to old non-a/c-yellow-and-black cab fares - since the former would be around Rs 600 for Def Col and the latter Rs 300.

The airport practice of being a complete rip off remains. 8TL (£3+) for a can of pop bearing in mind that they practice a liquid restriction (though we saw evidence to belie this) what kind of profit is this airport now making? Check-in staff were friendly but just not quick enough. The airport was unbearably hot. Entrance scanner staff must have felt that they needed something to do as I was asked to unpack a camcorder and produce passports. Duty Free prices are all in Euros so you can bet your life that you are being fleeced due to a dynamic currency conversion.

On arrival in the airport there was a strong sewage smell on the apron. The police officers at passport control were wordless and unsmiling (although on the return flight from Berlin this was different). The toilets in arrivals were very small dirty and there was an overpowering smell (not a pleasant one). On a positive note you do get out of the airport very quickly as it is so small. For the return flight the check in queue did not move for ages. The airside/shopping area was cramped and far too hot. There was far too many people in this area considering the size of the airport. The airport is clearly not intended for this amount of passengers as there is very little seating areas so most people had to sit on the floor.

At the northern end of the terminal are 12 checkin counters for Qantaslink Jetstar Virgin Blue and Tiger Airways which has created more room than before. Southern end of the terminal has two baggage carousels added with car rental counters opposite for Avis Budget Europcar Hertz Thrifty & Red Spot. New upgraded retail outlets are provided in the central section of the terminal which are Newslink Long Bar and Hudson's Coffee. This central area has been expanded with a greater amount of room making it easier when more than one flight is in at the same time. New security area directs passengers downstairs to new roomy departure lounges which are now at the lower level. Windows at the central section and the departure lounges give visitors and passengers great views of the mountains east of the airport.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,L. Ho,Canada,2015-06-18,"It doesn't matter if you check in on time. Somewhere along the way, the ineptitude at Pearson will guarantee that your experience is stressful, frustrating and a downright joke. My family missed our flight out of Terminal 3 yesterday due to the snaking line of hundreds of people waiting to be processed by US customs. Eventually, we asked the yellow jackets if anything can be done to move people up and was told that they don't do that anymore. She assured us that we'll make our flight even though departure was 40 minutes away. They clearly do not have enough US agents processing the volume of passengers coming through. We did not make our flight but to the credit of the American Airlines counter agents, we were put on today's flight. Today's experience was again so horrible that it sealed it for us. We showed up even earlier today after yesterday's fiasco. The line for non-US passengers was a fraction of yesterdays line and we were thrilled when we got here but get this, there was only one agent who was also taking passengers from the other lines. Granted, there were other agents serving those lines but it was painfully clear that the yellow jackets were uninterested in keeping our line moving. Good luck if you are in the non-US resident line. By the time we made it near the front with hundreds of people behind us at this time, that lone US agent got up and walked away!!! They were short staffed but how could it be this bad? We missed our flight again (of course!) but at least the wait for our next flight gives me time to sit and ponder what an absolute disaster travelling from Pearson has been. It cannot consider itself world class by any stretch. We have travelled all over Asia and even in the cities where English is the second language or barely spoken (Tokyo, Taiwan, Siem Reap, Hanoi), you are not greeted with apathy and rudeness. Staff there are competent, helpful and most importantly, not in short supply. High volume airports in HK and Singapore put Pearson to shame. Deal with the volume, Pearson, if you want to rise to the top. Teach your staff what good customer service means. Don't make the travellers you covet suffer the endless problems at every level. You charge an arm and a leg for use of your facilities. After yesterday and today, I truly feel ripped off.",Departure Only,17-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,1,1,2,2,NA,2,1,1,NA,0
larnaca-airport,/airport-reviews/larnaca-airport,Larnaca Airport customer review,M Sayer,NA,2010-01-12,First time through the new terminal. We use off airport parking so can't comment on the airport arrangements but there seemed to be plenty of well regulated space for drop-offs right outside given that it was a quiet day. Nice building: a bit like a small T5 at LHR with an uncluttered and spacious arrivals hall. However finding our airline check-in desk was a challenge as a computer failure had cut off all the electronic displays at the desks and not one staff member we approached knew where BA checked-in! We found them at the back around the corner and once there the procedure was fast friendly and efficient. Passports and security checks were just fine although they took longer and were more thorough than at the old terminal; better be safe than sorry though. We then searched for a departures display to keep an eye on the time and found just one tucked around a corner by the loos. There may have been more but at least this one was working. On to the shops and the cafes. Elegant but extremely expensive a growing trait in Cyprus regrettably and not all the fault of the exchange rate. I don't think £4 is a fair price for a coffee nor £6 for a roll and you could beat the prices for most items in the duty free in local shops. Call forward and the bridge to the aircraft were just fine and a marked improvement on the cattle market and bus at the old terminal. Overall?

Heavy snow has meant flight cancellations so when we arrive at the airport the departures lounge is utter chaos. Flight are not up on the departure boards information desk staff have no info and there is absolutely no crowd management. Surely the airport knows to expect this? We were some of the lucky ones. Our flight was ready to board only a couple of hours late but was made even later because of the difficulties in first checking in with queues criss-crossing across the concourse weaving between groups of frustrated holidaymakers sitting in groups surrounded by piles of luggage. and then queuing for security. There was one belt open in security so passengers were being checked one at a time. It's the busiest Saturday in February! There were no ground staff marshalling passengers through or forming queues so no one was going anywhere. We eventually left 4.5 hours late but as I say we were the lucky ones.

The check in area has low ceilings! While checking in firstly there is line for the baggage to be X-rayed and there again the airline checked the ticket and made a log entry. During check-in the ticket is seen again the bags from 2 aisle of check in rows go forward and then into a tunnel that separates the check-in aisles the area over that is just cement coated!

The business class lounge is on the small side. There is a small snack bar and a duty-free shop in the departure area. A few other shops a restaurant a bank and car rentals in the general public part of the terminal. Boarding is done by busses often they use both front and rear doors to board/de-board a Boeing 737-500 which makes it incredibly fast and easy. Parking is just in front of the terminal frequent public bus service to downtown Krakow (about 12 km the trip on the bus takes 20-30 minutes). Also the airport is 0.5 km away from a motorway exit the A4 motorway brings you into the city of Katowice in about 40 minutes (less than 70 km). This makes the airport a good choice for both Krakow and Katowice bound travellers.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
rhodes-airport,/airport-reviews/rhodes-airport,Rhodes Airport customer review,J Prior,United Kingdom,2013-10-10,Dreaded using this holiday island airport but was pleasantly surprised. Baggage reclaim on arrival not well lit and a bit chaotic but probably due to large number of flights that had just landed. Even more chaotic trying to find Thomson rep had to go out of terminal and re-enter through another door just to find her! Return journey was much better no thanks to passengers for other flights on our coach who just wanted to push and shove to get their bags and into airport. Dealt with very efficiently at check-in Thomson rep even wheeled my mother's case to the scanner for her. Upstairs departure area very bright and clean even the toilets. Strange that our departure gate could not be accessed as dividing doors to that part of terminal remained closed for about 2 hours leading to congestion (people queuing) and no seats then available in gate area. Overall was not as bad as I had expected.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
brussels-charleroi-airport,/airport-reviews/brussels-charleroi-airport,Brussels Charleroi Airport customer review,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,2013-12-20,Relatively new and shining clean due to the generous use of stainless steel. Epitome for the low-cost airport of the XXI century: Extra long and narrow tarmac to avoid using buses or skyways. Where the similarly long and narrow building can't reach there are long covered walkways airside. Be prepared for possible long walks both on arriving and departing. This is an airport that depends on Ryanair so you can't expect any pity. Asking for a boarding pass (a minimalist slip of paper) for a checked in flight costs 70 euros no matter what. There are two ATM machines in the hall one near the arrivals one at the opposite corner of the building (on the left exiting from airside). Exiting at this same corner you can reach the bus station where you can buy a ticket for Charleroi South Station from the machines (coins notes cards accepted). The bus station is not covered and Charleroi is a very rainy place but lucky enough you get the bus from platform A which is the nearest to the terminal. On departing I was puzzled by the double way in at security apparently doing the same things but working alternatively. Security fast and professional. Duty free looks good but I had no time to spend. After stepping to the gates you are in no- man land: long minimalist bleaky corridors where the stainless steel only adds up to the coldness of the environment. There's a bakery stand before the last hop to the tarmac. In winter I suggest buying a hot drink. The low cost travel industry states that if passengers have to wait they have to do it as close as possible to the aircraft they are boarding and in this airport this means in the open air though under a covered walkway.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

At least the airport is designed to take all this into account and the hand baggage X ray is more relaxed then anywhere I have seen and the fact that you can pack as much liquid as you like means that panic attacks over the size of your sun cream bottle don't exist.

I live in the Philippines (I am British) and use the airport several times a year. While not a great airport I never thought it was a candidate for the world's worst until now. The place was on the point of collapse with the flight information system not working the drop off area like a war zone chaotic queues laughably confusing inaccurate or non existent signage immigration staff who did not have a clue how to process foreigners with resident status and disgusting airport lounge facilities.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2011-03-25,A lot of negative comments (quite rightly) about Immigration at BKK. On the plus side last time I travelled earlier in the evening (1800hrs) things were much improved in Departure Immigration (10-15mins) all desks were operational and there was no segregation between Thai and Foreign Passports. Security fine and there are now some decent seating areas close to the Gates with soft seating TV's plants etc. On Arrivals it's very much hit and miss - I've rarely taken longer than 15mins to get through Immigration baggage is still slow (30 mins from aircraft parked to bags on the belt) but there are fewer taxi touts cluttering up Arrivals. They've also done away with this ridiculous system where Landside some of the travelators were restricted to Airport Pass users (ie to get between floors you had to use the Elevators). BKK airport management have finally come to realise that the airport is there to serve the needs of the customers - not preferences of the employees.

I was travelling from New York to Minneapolis and thankfully we arrived early as getting through that mess took time. Overcrowding led to the passengers having to make their own check-in queues. The staff were unfriendly and uninterested in properly organizing this mess. Getting through security was hopeless as well and I had to walk through the security scanner and then be manually searched by some clearly annoyed security staff because apparently holding your ticket in your hand while walking through was forbidden. To be fair it's a decent airport once you get past the mess that is check-in and security. A fairly nice design on the terminal and quite a few shops to look around in as well as enough places to sit down whether to eat or just relax.

Bus from the station is not an option as it gets caught in the traffic. Using the 30 mins free drop off facility in the car park is not a solution as the bus servicing that gets caught in the traffic. There are people getting out of cars all over the place and walking the final stretch up to the terminal despite the prospect of the £80 fine. The problem is not new. The introduction of the £1 drop off charge by the terminal was being blamed for this chaos in 2009. Surely time to sort out a solution ASAP.

Beyond the spacious and airy Grand Hall where check in counters are located the terminal is pathetic. The international pier (Pier C) has all the charm of a bus terminal the food on offer is inadequate (pizzas unappealing sandwiches) and yet incredibly expensive (I paid $13 CDN for a salad and small pastry). The sit-down-with-a-menu outlets are always very crowded at peak times. Toronto temperatures had reached 15 degrees one day but they obviously had the heaters on because it felt about 35 going through security and in the Duty Free area. The entire terminal should be relegated to low-cost airlines only. I had the pleasure of walking through the grand hall of the new Terminal 1.

Reasonably short walk to passport control where there were no queues. Luggage arrived very promptly. Minor queue at customs. Could be done with more bench seating outside where hire car buses pick up. It was hard to see our bus arrive due to others waiting a considerable about of time before moving off usually without picking anyone up too! Flew out domestically to Sydney. Security queue fairly short. Didn't spend too much time in the terminal as such because we had access to the Qantas business lounge. Not a lot of seats at gate area though. Finally transited through Melbourne airport on route from Auckland to Dubai. International transit a short walk from gate with easy enough signs to follow.

Arrivals is always chaos with staff at the immigration desks acting as if they have just crawled out of bed with no sense of urgency and barely any courtesy to tired passengers! I have used the Domestic terminal on a couple of occasions which I found to be much better than international. For some reason they think it's acceptable to be more efficient in the domestic terminal than in the international one. How does this make Kolkata look to international travellers.

The security officers would not read the documentation and insisting on going through and pulling apart my medication. I kept telling them that I had documentation that would explain the condition and the medication that I must carry but to no avail. The horribly disappointing thing was that they would say in French that they did not know what they were looking for. I do not speak French very well but I understand it.

The assisted check in area was a dream compared to the regular line up queues. I noticed that the wheelchairs were larger than the normal 16 inch width and readily available without charge.

charlotte-airport,/airport-reviews/charlotte-airport,Charlotte Airport customer review,Sam Comfort,United States,2014-08-20,Charlotte is a busy airport - a hub for US Airways - and TSA lines there can be tough. There are - when all areas are open - five TSA lines so check out other lines if the middle ones are full. Once inside the airport has pretty good amenities - massage and decent fast food. US Air club is very nice one of the best in the USA. Outside there is a lot of construction. The Hertz rental car center is atrocious - very long lines in May. Attendants in men's room is a lost occupation but does exist here. Stopping off at the men's room is usually a nightmare in most airports. Full time attendant makes it much cleaner. Overall this very busy airport has more southern charm than say Atlanta Hartsfield. For those renting cars the local highways are atrociously under- signed. Often there is one sign and when you look around for more guidance there's nothing. Charlotte NC and NCDOT need to do a much better job in adding signs: Those of us renting cars are new to the area and we will get lost.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,Pieter Boone,Netherlands,2013-09-08,Although this airport is far above average I have been annoyed by a few disturbing 'patterns'. My last few arriving flights could not be accommodated at a gate right away because 'the ground staff had not arrived yet'. Even though the delay was less than 10 minutes I find this very strange none of the flights were early and taxi times after landing are extremely long (15 minutes or more) so I gather this should be enough notice. It also seems that connecting a jet bridge at Schiphol takes way longer than any other airport and ground staff seem to struggle moving the jet bridge having to make a few tries before doing it right. Schiphol is a large airport and the fact that 'moving walkways' leading back to the terminal almost always are out of use is just unacceptable. What is the problem?

Just push and shove. Probably 200 yards long. Overheating causes passengers to faint. A TSA rep charges into the crowd shouting and closes a line. Eventually we arrive at the 4 agents. Surly at best.

Two things that really bug me are: lack of airside trolleys - most EU airports provide these and are a godsend for those of us with small kids etc. You are required to have a pound/euro to release trolleys landside/on arrival.

Too many flights departing within a few minutes of each other in such a small space would make the claustrophobic and agoraphobic go into seizures. Only one set of toilets servicing 12 gates of wide body jets mean snaking queues especially for the ladies' room (singular). The sea of humanity makes the air-conditioning practically non existent.

I found the airport staff to be very rude and surly. They have no idea how to be polite to travellers. The point is if it wasn't for travellers they would not have a job. Another thing is they take your duty free away from you even when you are in transit. If you travel from England (for instance) and you are in transit you have to collect your luggage and book in with LIAT or what other airline you are travelling with and then when you check-in at customs they take your duty free that you have with you. Surely people are entitled to take their duty free to their destination. I think the airport should have a transit lounge so that travellers don't have to go outside and back in again.

This works relatively 'well'. Our flight arrives late to Heathrow though, and then the real fun begins. After a thorough security check by British officials in Edinburgh, we are subject to that all over again after an excruciatingly long bus ride between idiotically poorly connected terminals (arrival at T5 and departure for LAX at T3). Both times we're ""randomly picked"" for a 2nd level security check. So OK, through all that and then we need to re-check in again for the AA flight to LAX (after printing boarding passes online with all docs verified). Why? Then we are so lucky to actually learn of the departure gate a full 5 minutes before all the other clueless passengers who are anxiously watching the monitors. This is one of the silliest parts of the operation: holding the gate secret until 20 minutes before boarding. Anyway, rush to the very far away gate, and then into a new secure area- yes another check of passport and boarding pass that gains us access to the usual ugly 'stall' with no services and no bathrooms. There more poor people (thankfully not us) being checked by yet more random searching. Heathrow, the world's worst large-sized airport in my opinion, needs to have its security and other logistical systems completely overhauled by efficiency experts.

No one was there organizing the 3 lines that they had so no one knew which line was which. Our flight was delayed because it took them so long to check everyone in. Security line was not as bad maybe about a half hour. Seemed like there was no air condition as it was really hot and uncomfortable. No wifi bathrooms were dirty and the two snack shops also had huge lines.

Fly from Reagan National instead even if it means forgoing a nonstop flight. Amazingly despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on improvements at Dulles in recent years it now takes longer to get through the airport than before and the amenities are just as bad. Although the much ballyhooed ""AirTrain"" recently opened which should have sped travel times from the main terminal to the satellite terminals amazingly it takes even longer than the mobile lounges (aka Star Wars mobiles) of old. Fortunately the Star Wars Mobiles are still plugging along. Use them instead and save yourself 15 minutes.The security lines are the worst I've ever routinely encountered at any major airport. Allow at least 45 minutes to get through. There seem to be enough security lanes but rarely are enough of them open. Amenities (restaurants shops etc.) I can't speak for the entire airport but they are wholly lacking in the United Airlines concourse (and since United moves well over half the traffic at Dulles you'll probably be flying United). You'll find long lines and limited choices. Terminal design I'm speaking for United's facilities but you may have to walk (yes walk--there are no moving sidewalks) over 1/4 mile between your gate and the AirTrain or mobile lounge station. Allow at least 10 minutes for this. Dulles is to be avoided if you value your time. If you are parking in the economy lot plan to arrive there 2 1/2 hours before flight time in order to ensure you can reach your departure gate with time to spare.

Travelling with only hand luggage passport control and customs was a breeze. Baggage hall looked quite busy . Had it not been for a second-rate local car hire company not cancelling my booking upon arrival I would have been out of the airport in ten minutes.

Passport control was a shambles and although my family have e-passports, the queue was incredibly slow and took us 45 minutes to get to use the passport electronic machines. These are obviously not working effectively as they were taking over a minute to do each passenger. NORTH terminal is not a good representation of the UK for anyone entering our country or for any national wanting to 're enter. The staff were rude, gave bad service and little information to the public. One member of staff refuted that epassport were designed to make passport control easier and quicker for the public.

khartoum-airport,/airport-reviews/khartoum-airport,Khartoum Airport customer review,Abdalla Salih,NA,2005-09-12,I'm a native Sudanese (born and raised in Sudan) who travels a lot around the World. Whenever I visit my beloved Sudan I always feel sad twice. The first time is when I arrive at KRT Arrival Terminal. This terminal was opened in 1986. It was as it is now small with two halls handling maximum of two airplanes at any time. But it was nice clean artfully designed and the staff members seemed to be happy working there. Unfortunately since then nothing has changed improved or fixed (as in some cases); and it's been getting worse and worse every time I see it. The second time I feel sad is when I leave Sudan. Not only because I'm leaving home but because of the waiting battle at KRT Departure Terminal where bureaucracy is at its highest level. This terminal was born more than sixty years ago and never raised. It's still small and always seemed very crowded even with one airplane passengers. You always have to have extra money with you for the unannounced new fees or stamps. Sudan has just signed a peace accord ending more than 22 years of civil war in the South. The oil money has started fueling the economy and a new state of art airport is being planned in the east side of the River Nile in Omdurman. Hopefully this new airport will be opened soon. There's more than ten millions Sudanese who leave outside Sudan. And always willing to visit their family no matter what (sometimes twice a year). The great generous and passionate people of Sudan deserve much more than what they have now.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The result: more seats available but hardly anyone using them because of the need to get up to find a screen. Also returning to a very wet and windy Liverpool yesterday really made us aware of how unwelcoming ""International Arrivals"" is.

As I had a boarding pass and only hand luggage I assumed that 5.30am would be early enough to go through security. I did not pay extra for fast track as I thought this would be unnecessary at this time in the morning. Big mistake. I arrived to find a football match-style crush at the entrance to security with no sign of any airport staff to control or direct what could have been a dangerous crush. I eventually had to ask other passengers to let me go ahead to avoid missing my flight. This is the worst organisation I have seen at any airport in many years of flying all over the world.

The assistance on our return was excellent with a wheelchair waiting for her at the aeroplane door with two pleasant and efficient staff members. Two days before the flight I sent a message via their online contact form advising that we had booked assistance that we would be arriving by taxi at c.4.50am (at this time of the morning journey time from home is eminently predictable) and asking how we should implement the requested assistance. We did not receive the courtesy of a reply so we were left completely in the dark. LBA do not allow taxis other than Arrow to drop passengers even disabled passengers - at the terminal door. This is obviously nothing to do with security and everything to do with maximising revenue by trying to steer passengers to using Arrow. We were therefore dumped in the car park by our taxi with no idea what to do next. We had two options: 1. For me to walk the 200 yards to the terminal and then walk to the far end where the KLM desk is situated ask for assistance and then walk back to the car park. This would necessitate leaving my wife with our luggage standing in the car park at 4.50am on a January morning with no shelter. 2. help my wife to walk to the check-in desk while carrying our luggage. We obviously had no choice but to go for option 2. This makes a nonsense of requesting disabled assistance. LBA charge for taxis to drop passengers in the car park and charge taxis for collecting passengers. They also even charge for luggage trolleys. We used Arrow taxis on our previous visit.

Space in the two boarding gates area and the sides of the building are inadequate especially the one for non-schengen flights. If someone is not interested in boarding first it is better to wait up to last minute before passing passport check because the experience after this step is frustrating. Toilet are upstairs and only a small vending machine at gate level. The space available for the four gates is ridiculous. This time it was very foggy and we were called to the boarding gate. We rushed in and after passport control it was announced that we were going to be moved by bus to another airport. Being trapped in such a small area for almost one hour was not funny.

My BA aircraft was parked about as far as possible from the body of T3 and the walk to customs and immigration was long. However no sooner had we left the aircraft than we were subjected to an unnecessary extra passport check. The actual immigration point was less friendly than my recent experiences in the US. The baggage hall was only adequate and had no immediately accessible restrooms. Another long walk was necessary for car rental which is at least on airport.

He had checked in online the previous day with Singapore Airlines. Term 2 had grouped all the airlines together and so no individual queues for the airline you were travelling on. It has never been as bad as this in the last 40 years we have travelled through Heathrow. Who's so called bright idea was to lump groups of airlines together. The staff had to keep taking people out of the queues as they were going to miss their flights as the gates close an hour before take off.

RER B to Antony takes a while from Central Paris and is often is packed out taking commuters into the southern suburbs whilst the ORLYVAL is a rip off.

There is a new food area called 'fed and watered’ where 'Rankins' used to be (nice but usual airport high prices). Also after leaving security you are deposited into the recently refurbished original food court area looks nicer but is still over-priced. My personal impression of security (see previous reviews) was a little better than usual on this trip but only just and from observing interaction with other travellers it's still poor. The term 'officious' in previous reviews reflects my experience of security well in general. The web site shows that the current round of investment has now finished so that unlike the last few years the airport probably won't change layout every couple of months. Finally I have neglected to mention before my experience on return. UK boarder control has been excellent and the baggage hits the carrousel very quickly.

Took forever to taxi to a gate followed by a walk the length of an upper floor of the terminal followed by a very long escalator down to a lower floor and an equally long walk back again. Finally reached passport control. Usual lengthy line for non-EU passports. Fortunately I have a UK passport and headed to the line for the machines (chip passports). Only 3-4 out of maybe 8-9 machines were operational and turns out it was a lot quicker to walk up to an agent where there were no queues (as an aside why are there so many desks for EU-passports that seem very lightly used when the number of desks for non-EU passport seems so inadequate - even in a new terminal?). On return to Canada was fortunate to be able to use priority check-in (very good) and avoid the chaos of general economy check-in. More long walks. AC business lounge is close to the gate miles beyond the main shopping area (there are a couple of shops near the gates but very limited selection).

There are now a large number of flights departing to the U.K mid morning and as at early May 2005 neither security nor passport control was ready for this. The upshot was that there was such queue at passport control that passengers on the Ryanair flight to Liverpool could not respond quickly to the last call or boarding the flight missed a slot it had for an early departure and in fact left 20 minutes late.

Having been in London for 3 years I was shocked but the lack of forethought that had gone into the redesign of the area. Signs did not give accurate indications of where to stand particularly when there were crowds doors opens into queues the microchip scanning only works 50 percent of the time and seemed to have been designed by someone who assumed only 4 or 5 people would be using the service at one time. Staff couldn't care less that the scanning area was ineffective and that people were wandering around looking for assistance when the automatic machine wouldn't allow them to pass through. After queuing for the auto machines I was told the queue for assistance I then had to join wouldn't take long. Having seen the people in the standard queue who exited the plane with me leave the customs area I then had to stay for another 15 minutes. When I got to the front of the queue there was no apology or explanation for the delay or malfunction of the equipment in fact the woman was chatting to the other woman next to her about her weekend. Se was rude and when I didn't utter a word when my passport was handed back she commented to her friend that I wasn't very happy in a sarcastic tone. Out in the baggage collection the same issue with snaking queues and lack of movement was evident. The entire design seemed to be based on creating collisions with no forethought to the fact that people had to push huge trolleys throw queues of people with huge trolleys. Unsurprisingly the woman directing us to aisles for baggage checks was equally obnoxious.

kathmandu-airport,/airport-reviews/kathmandu-airport,Kathmandu Airport customer review,MJ Wayatauaah,Nepal,2013-01-10,Without doubt Kathmandu domestic airport is one of the disgusting places. Many who travel through this place on route to trekking or climbing adventures. There is nothing dignified or organised about the place and for regular travellers it twists a knot in your stomach every time you pass through. You have to avoid the army of porters who want to carry your luggage the 15 metres from security to check in and will give you a disgusted look if you pay less than a dollar. Then you need to check in. Queues don't exist- so it's a matter of crowding the desks. Then through security again and then the endless wait. Don't expect to sit down as seats are never enough. Do not expect to get any info about your flight.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

memphis-airport,/airport-reviews/memphis-airport,Memphis Airport customer review,S Jones,United Kingdom,2012-08-19,First the positives! The most welcoming TSA staff I have encountered in the US. We arrived in Memphis so can't comment on facilities but ground transportation was efficient and it was easy to find a taxi. The most annoying thing was having to be screened on entry. We had already been screened in Norwich and Amsterdam but to be screened on arrival is over the top. Some people in the queue missed connecting flights as a result of this extra screening. I appreciate that we have to go through the terminal but if an airport deals with international flights then they need to review this and ensure that those departing in Memphis can leave without going through the terminal.,NA,NA,NA,5,1,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0
sofia-airport,/airport-reviews/sofia-airport,Sofia Airport customer review,Arlene Olver,United Kingdom,2010-07-04,We've flown in & out of Sofia several times now and have used both terminals (depending on who we've flown with). I'd agree with others that prices for drinks etc are OTT but that's common to most airports. Another reviewer mentioned going to a taxi kiosk - you really should book a cab at the desk and be put into it by the person managing the rank if you don't want to be ripped off. The person in the office will give you an estimate (between x & y depending on the traffic) of cost to your destination. We've used ok taxis to and from the Central Bus Station a few times and have never been charged more than the estimated fare. Do make sure you book at the desk though. There is a shuttle bus service to the City Centre - we haven't given this a go yet but have seen the buses and they seem quite frequent. One thing to watch out for I'm afraid is being over charged at the duty free shops. This has happened to us a few times. Ask for the till receipt as well as your credit / debit card receipt and check the number of items on the till receipt against what you actually bought. Do this as close to the shop as you can and go back if you need to. Someone else was waiting to query her bill while we were being dealt with. The woman in the shop claimed that there was some problem with their bar coding system. If this is so they should get it sorted out - the problem seems to having been going on for quite some time.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

When you have checked in you then have to go upstairs to the so called lounge, there are two or three food outlets, basically lunchbar food, if you pass on these then you go through to the departure lounge where all semblance of service ceases. The food in this so called lounge is definitely of poor quality, but the prices are the dearest in all of Australasia.

I landed at 2.10 pm joined the long line for non US immigration at 2.25 pm and was finally processed at 4.45 pm. There were only 3 immigration booths open for non US travellers whilst many more were open for residents and US citizens. The staff managing the lines were most unhelpful and bullied people along in a brusque manner. There were families with young children elderly people clearly uncomfortable with the delay. At first I thought I was unlucky on this particular day but frequent visitors in the line told me this was pretty true to form. I am a frequent traveller to the USA and I can honestly say I have never had more than 40 minutes to wait at immigration at other international airports. If indeed this performance is typical I will make it a point in future never to come in again through O'Hare on an inbound international flight. Baggage of course had been taken off the belt and it took me another 10 minutes finding my bags with no signage nor anyone there to ask.

So around 30 of us were left waiting for this one officer to deal with us all. While we were waiting two immigration officers who had been dealing with the EU passengers were just sat at closed desks having a loud conversation and sipping tea and other officers were milling around why couldn't they have just helped out for a few minutes and got us all through quicker?

budapest-ferihegy-airport,/airport-reviews/budapest-ferihegy-airport,Budapest Ferihegy Airport customer review,A Milossavlevich,Ukraine,2014-11-12,The airport is very small and cramped. Terminal 2 is divided in two parts making it really small and uncomfortable. Queues are huge both at check-in and security. If not for the Skycourt after security and the maze-like duty-free it would really be claustrophobic with the lack of daylight being a real nuisance. The link to the city is very poor. The bus / metro combination is both uncomfortable and expensive making it impossible for you to reach the city center without a transfer. The entire terminal has only one exchange booth but most appalling wasn't their scarcity but the rate they're charging which was nothing short of a scam - welcome to Europe. Coming from Ukraine (IEV) the contrast was even more evident. Toilets weren't clean broken faucets soap lacking in many. Next - the Wi-Fi. BUD supposedly offers 2 hours of free Wi-Fi that is available once you get passed a lengthy security/rules agreement check-page that directs you then onto another useless page that given the speed takes ages to load. Even once passed those mandatory checkpoints the internet was still very slow and almost completely useless.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,D Macleod,United Kingdom,2012-10-09,There are so many good things about this airport that make it my favourite to travel through on and off for the last thirty years almost. It may be big but it is never a real chore to walk from one point to another and in many trips through the airport I have perhaps fortunately not found myself seriously having to race from one flight to another. The shops the bars and restaurants are generally of a very high standard as are the lounges and staff are generally very pleasant. I have but one criticism and that is security for flights to the UK. On my outward journey last week security check for the leg to Helsinki was fair and thorough but just a common ordinary security check; on the return journey from Amsterdam to Aberdeen the security was oppressive and obtrusive. Some staff were thoroughly unpleasant process was slow and perhaps amusingly and reassuringly the captain was forced to go through the scanner three times before he was allowed to board the flight. Nevertheless I find it strange that flights to the UK should be so much more thoroughly checked than others. Are we a greater risk or at greater risk or is this just a reaction to our not being members of the common border agreement in the EU? For all that I would still say Schipol is my favourite airport of the majors in Europe. I have noticed this disparity of treatment several times in the last few years.,NA,NA,NA,9,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

The building is old and not air-conditioned. The arrival hall is too small to handle a 767-300. The hall gets crowded and there is confusion as to which form to fill out. Tanzania does not recognize East African Visa nonetheless we had to fill both forms out. The entry fee for USA citizens is now $100 - everyone else $50.00. Baggage Claim does not have a conveyor belt - rather the bags are taken from the baggage cart and stacked in the hall. The departure area is marginally larger - no air conditioning - Baggage has to pass through a x-ray machine before being allowed to enter the check in area. Once the baggage is tagged - the bags are carried by a porter through a secured area to a waiting car to be loaded on to the plain. The one bright spot is the Dhow Lounge on the second level of departure lounge. It is air conditioned provides hot and cold food snacks and beverages.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,R Brook,United Kingdom,2009-06-09,I have been using Manchester frequently over the past 15 years. Overall it's getting worse although with the recent addition of many more screening points the security queues are much shorter and efficient than the previous horrendous experience. Check in (having used many different airlines) is usually OK. As with any airport if you want to avoid long lines arrive early. In Terminal 1 beyond security I hate the way one is led through a maze of perfume stalls before reaching the departure lounge. I don't mind airport shops but not so 'in your face'. It really creates the wrong impression. They've avoided this particular folly in Terminal 2. T2 business lounge (mostly use Sky Team - KLM/Air France) is very small but adequate if not busy. Arrival experience is variable. Long delays in getting off the plane are common due to no one to operate the air bridge/no one to drive the mobile steps/no buses waiting when parking remotely. Queues at immigration have lengthened over the years as on average has waiting for the baggage. If using the long stay car park and pre-paying on the internet to avoid the extortionate on-the-day charges the part where you are supposed to insert your credit card at the entry barrier doesn't work. Instead call them at the exit barrier when you leave and quote your reference number. My card was charged correctly after this. Overall the airport looks shabby doesn't operate particularly well and can't really be called a pleasant experience.

I use a stick but don't want to use wheelchair help. I find this time they now make you walk through all of the duty free shops. we were called for flight showed boarding pass went down the stairs to board plane. We were kept at bottom in a corridor no room on one of the hottest days of the year. No information was given as to why no seats to sit. I struggled to stand and had to lean against post. After 40 mins of this we were allowed on to plane I asked what the problem was and said how hard it had been for me. It turns out Stansted could not provide people to come and get 2 wheelchair people off the previous flight and we were not allowed on until they did. Then that caused us to miss our slot and we had to sit for 40 mins in a super hot plane as no air-conditioning until take off. On arrival back the trains were crowded jammed solid not helpful and then the queues to get through passport control were terrible stood for an hour and a half. No help for really old people or people like me no seats they just exspect you to get on with it. Staff were very unhelpful. We have said it before but after this last visit we are not going to use Stansted again.

Thankfully our arrival at security was perfectly timed as whilst we didn't get stuck in the very lengthy queue ourselves we did see it snaking its way behind us as we made our way through to departure on Friday evening. Had we been 10 minutes later we would have got stuck at this stage ourselves. Unfortunately we weren't so lucky on our return last night! We were dismayed to reach the passport control hall to find a very long queue of people and only three officials dealing with those with EU passports. Thanks to the lack of officials and chaotic organisation which allowed for significant queue jumping it took 40 minutes for us to get through passport control. Given that Friday and Sunday evenings are peak times with a high number of passengers heading off/returning from weekends away it seems ridiculous that Luton Airport is not staffed to deal with those demands!,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Services are very poor (food offerings no better than a typical US highway plaza and do not expect shops of any quality) orientation to the city virtually non-existent currency exchange and ATMs limited. The airport is extremely difficult to navigate with multiple international arrival and departure terminals with no central information point or monitors (recently I had to go to 3 separate terminals to locate an arriving international flight). Amazingly for an airport there are few seating areas and what do exist are cold uncomfortable with no electrical service. The entire airport is aesthetically dreary and ugly.

The mission of this airport seems to live in the age of state-run airports and flagship carriers. Sadly that age has mysteriously disappeared a long time ago. Thus the airport is not friendly for weekend commuters and budget travellers while trying to suit the needs of business travellers and charter flights. The check-in area is spacious and rationally planned. The choice of shops before security is sufficient. I'm travelling on a Sunday morning and the flow of passengers is scarce. Security looks very professionals and friendly enough though procedures are strict. After security there is virtually nothing in the non Schengen area. Gates areas looks minimal but there's enough seating and two vending machines a coffee shop a toilet and TV screens with no audio. Area doesn't look to be cleaned on a regular basis and looks small. Two 190 pax flight leaving at the same time may bring to chaos apparently.

There is not enough waiting room to wait for the check-in to open. The queue for security is not sufficient. The actual terminals are announced only when boarding begins. There is not enough waiting room. Boarding is actually a two stage process where there is not enough space to queue and not enough room while you wait to walk to your plane. The airport completely lacks any useful concept of how to handle a significant amount of people. I'm not talking of a minor capacity issue during peak times. I'm talking about 20 seats for 200 people who have to wait hours! In addition to these fundamental issues the airport is dirty everywhere. It's ugly. The food options (at least outside of security) are terrible. Yet you have to walk though (not besides) duty-free shops. At least the staff weren't unfriendly but not especially helpful or friendly either.

If you are not skiing on a Saturday when it appears to be bedlam (as it is not a big place) it is a fast modern and clean place. Fitting are generally high quality. It is true that it can be annoying that the airline lounges are before security as you can't stay in them up until the last minute as the time to clear security is highly variable. It can be very fast at slack periods or there may be quite a queue. If you want a high quality Swiss watch all the brands are there in Duty Free - an impressive selection. If you want to bring home Swiss food don't wait to clear passport control - it will cost you an arm and a leg. You should use the shops near the train terminal.

lyon-saint-exupery-airport,/airport-reviews/lyon-saint-exupery-airport,Lyon Airport customer review,K Greeley,NA,2007-10-08,I fly weekly through LYS on Air France. All AF arrivals to this hub seem to be timed to get in at the same time and depart 30-45 minutes later - great in theory. However the ridiculous security procedures would drive you crazy. All inbound transit passengers must queue again in order go though security/Xray once more before going back down to the gate again. As everybody is on a short connect everyone seems to be irritated and close to panic in case they will miss their flights. The only ones not in stress are the security guards. So my question that nobody at MRS can ever answer is; if I have cleared security at a French airport (MRS) why do to I have to clear security again 10 mins after landing ? Either they don´t trust the other French airports (in my case Marseille or CDG) or this is just a way of creating another few unnecessary civil service jobs.

It is probably one of the worst designed ""new"" airports in the world. It is one big shopping mall with airplanes a long way away. The check in is chaos unless your in Air Asia's business class but if your doing a connecting flight you still have to go through customs and drag your bags to be checked in for your connecting flight and if your flight is many hours away you can't check in early to get back into transit to use the transit hotel. You can't stay in transit if you can get to transit for more than 10 hours so if your connecting flight is say 12 hours you have to stay in the country side of customs I believe this is all planned to get you to shop in their giant mall. Going from arrivals to departures for connecting flights is mostly a mystery as the signs are confusing and sometimes the moving stairs don't work and the elevators get jammed up with baggage carts. I had to go through three security checks. At Singapore Airport they check at the gate! Wise up Air Asia! The gates seem like miles away and you have to walk 99% of it.

harare-airport,/airport-reviews/harare-airport,Harare Airport customer review,Charlotte Humphrey,NA,2004-05-08,Flew through Harare International several times during a recent trip to Zimbabwe using both the Domestic & International terminals. The current Domestic terminal was the International one until a few years ago - no updating has been done since as the customs & immigration desks are all still there. It was quick to pass through and pleasantly decorated however there was a distinct lack of facilities (only a few domestic flights each day so it probably hasn't been worth their while putting shops etc in) and the toilets were in dismal condition - to be avoided at all costs. International terminal was a much better experience. Opened only a few years ago and built for a much larger number of flights than it currently handles it seemed very spacious. Facilities were all well-maintained with a good range of shops. Food in the only restaurant was also good. Customs and immigration checks both arriving and departing were quick & courteous.

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,David Harrison,Australia,2013-08-07,I travel internationally every month so have reasonable perspective on service norms. Arrived flying J class on Air China on Fri 2nd Aug. An absolute disgrace that it took 2 hours to be processed. Got through the Smart Gate in a couple of minutes. But the queue for aliens was huge and the delay on processing those pax was a major source of my ultimate slow progress. Got to carousel 4 to find it full of Malaysian Airlines bags. But the pax were still back in the immigration queue not present to pull their bags. So the conveyor belt bringing new bags just stopped. I asked baggage services for a handler to come and either put the unclaimed bags on the floor or rearrange them on the belt to fit more on. Refused to do either citing work practice rules. There are employees pulling the bags down in the basement why not up on the carousel too? Finally the MY bags were cleared and about 10 J class bags from my flight. But then no more. Eventually Y class bags and finally most of the J bags. A 90 minute wait. I contacted baggage services 3 times during this period. Walkie-talkie calls to the baggage room below described chaos down there. Then got into customs queue. It was approx 400 meters long snaking along 3 walls of the baggage hall. Two yes two customs officers were at the exit causing the backlog. Why not 10 officers? All in all an absolute disgrace. On leaving the airport it crossed my mind that in fact Melbourne Airport is a private monopoly and earns its highest income from the car park.

Always annoying. Public transport to Copenhagen by rail is fast cheap and comfortable. First class! Departing Copenhagen one noticed that there was a lot of building work going on. There were too many shops crowding in on public areas as well which makes it look more and more like a UK airport which is not a good sign. Finally many passengers nearly missed their flights to various UK destinations since there was one immigration officer at the piers passport control.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,Giannicola Bonora,Italy,2012-06-07,In my opinion T2 is the most rationally planned of the 3 terminals in MAN airport though maybe the most anonymous. Both floors arrivals and departures before restricted areas have space devoted to the needs of arriving and departing passengers with minimal resources for friend/relatives and passers by. The impression on arrival is about under-utilization of space. At departures security is well planned. Flying out early in the morning on a week day crowd was medium and 6 desks out of 12 were open. Pass through in less than 10 minutes also thanks to body-scanners. Agents professional and respect passengers. The duty free area is just the way I like it to be. If you want you roam around if you don't you just go straight to the gates area. The gates area has plenty of coffee shops takeaways and restaurants. Most of the gates are just at hand but you should allow for a 5 minutes walk for the farthest at the two sides. Excellent view of apron. A few mini coffee shops spotted near the far gates are a gem for people which are rushed to the gate by the speakers only to find out that a 200 people line is just lazily forming. From the airport it is a 5 minutes indoor walk to Radisson Hotel and 10 to the Airport Train Station if travelators are working.

Departure was horrible though: first of all two chaotic queues were formed in front of one check-in desk. After some minutes the checking-in was moved to other desks! As you can imagine this involved a lot of pushing - I do expect airport staff to manage such situations more efficiently. Staff worked very slow. We finally got our boarding card but after this everybody had to move their luggage to the one scanner that was working at the other side of the departures hall. Again chaotic queuing and pushing. After this another queue for the security check - the whole ordeal took more than an hour. Facilities in the departure lounge are extremely limited just one very small shop and 2 bars.

Not much else to do and not many spare seats or relaxing areas. The fact no planes pull up to gates mean annoying bus transits.

The expansion project is now complete and the airport looks great. It is airy and functions well. However all flights to the U.S. clear US customs at the airport prior to landing in the U.S. This works well except that if you arrive early you are made to wait in US customs waiting area that has too few seats. Most people had to stand for the 45 minute wait. The duty free shop is somewhat limited so that is only worth a five minute distraction. Once you clear customs you are also restricted to a certain set of gates and you are not free to wander the airport. There is only one little food shop with outrageously priced food ($7.50 for a small sandwich).

mauritius-airport,/airport-reviews/mauritius-airport,Mauritius Airport customer review,Durvasa Luchowa,NA,2004-11-22,Because of the increasing number of flight passengers Mauritius sought to improve its airport facilities in the late 1980s modelled on those of Europe. While this improvement was seen as innovative and welcoming it was also sad to see the erosion of its uniqueness which Mauritius once prided itself upon. It does not make the facilities better by having a few more chairs two lounges and a cafe/bar that is extraordinarily expensive. . What matters is how passengers are treated .For example the airport personnel such as the police check-in staff immigration officers health officers etc used to be welcoming friendly and helpful and always had a smile on their face. Now if you see a helpful person with a welcoming smile on their face then you must count yourself lucky. Also as soon as you get off the plane you are met with the sight of around 6 to 10 people looking at you with stern faces some in police uniforms with a revolver or pistol in their hands pointing at you. What a welcome hey? Some of the police hold absolute power and sometimes abuse that power by stopping you for no reason. Some security guards who had failed to become police officers and now content to work as security guards sometimes also assume the power of the police and will check your hand bag after you have already checked in. Some of them will even tell you that your have excess baggage even though you have already been through check-in procedures and satisfactorily fulfilled all the requirements. The good thing though is there is now a system where you have to queue for check in or immigration control. Therefore this has been a significant improvement. Although some people complain about the queues they are no worse than those of British or European airports. However you can still jump the queue if you have a relative or a friend in high position of authority at the airport. This is done in a more subtle way nowadays.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
sofia-airport,/airport-reviews/sofia-airport,Sofia Airport customer review,Ivan Ilieff,NA,2006-10-26,Being a Bulgarian native I fly into and out of SOF on a regular basis. The old building cannot possibly handle the increasing passenger traffic and the launch of the new shiny terminal is being posponed since November of 2005 until present day. SOF has the unfriendliest check-in staff in Europe and the United States (New York excluded). Make sure you check the weight of your luggage carefuly before leaving for the airport and distribute the luggage evenly in your bags. I was made to remove stuff out of my 55-pound suitcase and put it in my 35 pound one at the check-in desk in front of the entire line or else threatened with an excess luggage charge. Early mornings turn SOF's departure hall into a zoo since a few carriers (LH OS AZ BA) have flights departing between 6 and 8AM carrying primarily connecting passengers for long-haul flights out of the major hubs in Europe. The airlines usually send their planes to arrive in Sofia late on the previous evening so that they can depart early in the morning. On several occasions however due to technical problems at SOF (the explanation given when that actually happened to me was that the lighting system on the runway was out of commission) said planes never make it to SOF in the first place. So it is a good idea to check with your airline the night before your departure to ensure your plane had safely landed. Bar on the second floor (departure hall) is way too overpriced - they charge EUR3.50 for a beer with an average price in the city for the same brand of about EUR1. Security and passport control are usually smooth and once on the airside a visit to the duty free shop is a must since it still offers the lowest prices of tobacco and liquor in the world (A carton of Marlboros costs EUR 15.00!!!) Transfer to the planes is by bus and the boarding procedure is nonexistent since everyone is trying to cram on the plane at the same time. Bulgarians are very skilled in running and pushing people around so even if you are the last one to board the bus that is the first one to get off the bus and climb the stair onto the plane there is no guarantee that you won't be overrun by the crowd.

It could be so much better for a major international airport. The parking fees are over the top. They should have first 3 hours free like shopping centres then a fee per hour after that. This would ensure traffic movement and give people a greater sense of relaxation rather than panic at having to 'move on' to avoid the push or a fine.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Added to this problem was the cleaners who were leaning on the wash basin having a good talk rather than cleaning and making sure that there was soap in the empty dispensers.

However I had an 'interesting' experience on Saturday night (24 SEP). Whilst waiting at the check- in to sort out a minor problem with my ticket I asked the lady if I could weigh myself on the baggage scale as I was curious to see how much weight I'd picked up on the last trip. My normal weight is between 64-66 kgs. You may imagine my surprise when it registered me as 47 kgs. I got on and off again with the same result! I told her jokingly that I would be happy to use that same scales with my wine laden overweight suitcase on my next trip. I then went to the next counter which showed my weight as 78 kgs (also twice.) A third and fourth one were correct. I do wonder if there is some sort of scam going on here as I find it hard to imagine that such a huge error could not have been picked up and addressed.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,Robin Roy,United Kingdom,2014-06-25,"According to the airport's website ""it's our mission to make your journey as smooth and simple as possible"". I regret to say that judged by the experience of myself and my wife on 2 trips through the airport this year drastic action needs to be taken to even begin the process of 'mission accomplished' - particularly in the areas of effective staffing security procedures reduction of queues staff training and customer relations. On 27 March at 11.50hrs we arrived at bag drop (2hrs before departure) having checked in online and then spent the next hour or so going through the queues at security. The x-ray scanner for some reason detected a problem with my cabin baggage (after 12 mins wait I was told it was my camera and after another 7 mins or so I was finally cleared without explanation or any word of apology). Staffing appeared inadequate and uncaring as to the needs of customers. We had no time for a coffee or to go to the toilet before boarding. On 7 June we had a repeat performance. Having arrived at terminal 1 at 04.45 (2hrs before departure) once again we spent the entire time before boarding waiting in security queues. This time my wife's cabin baggage was chosen for a random check (passed ok) and mine for search again apparently because it contained a piece of soap in a plastic soap box (perfectly allowable). The security officer did not go to the soap straight away but at a snail's pace opened and took out all my various pills and other items before declaring on opening my washbag that it was the soap causing the query. She could not adequately explain why the scanner/scanner operator should find a piece of soap problematic and I said that I did not believe her explanation (she had just reopened my wash bag for the second time!). To this she replied ""Tough"". Very much a 'take it or leave it approach'.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

colombo-airport,/airport-reviews/colombo-airport,Colombo Airport customer review,Gyan Fernando,Sri Lanka,2012-11-28,The problem with this airport is that it is well away from Colombo the only road can be very busy and therefore you need to arrive well ahead of time. Getting into the building takes a long time because of the security. The problem here is that non-travellers try to get into the terminal which is not allowed (except with a permit) and so the security guy at the entrance checks your passport and asks for your ticket. With e- tickets there is no need to carry any documentation and so this causes a little bit of unpleasantness. Once past security all baggage is x-rayed which is fair enough but there is only one machine. There is a lot of queue jumping. Once past that hurdle the next one is trying to get to check-in. If you arrived early you will have to hang around until the check-in opens. Once past check-in things do get better. Immigration staff are generally courteous and immigration is painless. Once airside there is one reasonable but overpriced restaurant. Service is slow. If flights get delayed do expect chaos with the lovely but clueless hostesses. It is very easy to get into the wrong area as gate staff are pre-occupied. This is the only International airport in Sri Lanka at the time of writing and therefore I have no choice but to recommend it but with reservations.,NA,NA,NA,4,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

kingston-airport,/airport-reviews/kingston-airport,Kingston Airport customer review,N Clark,NA,2007-09-17,"Norman Manley International Airport (KIN) has apparently been under construction continuously ever since my first visit to it in 1987. More recently I go through KIN several times each year. I must rate KIN as ""poor"" for now -- bordering on ""very poor"" --- especially compared to other Caribbean airports. It is shamefully inadequate as the international airport for a capital city in one of the most important countries in the region. Each time I go through KIN I notice that the renovations and expansion have made a little more progress. It is a major project and is beginning to produce results. The terminal no longer has the shabby mildewed atmosphere. I see signs that when the expansion is complete KIN might deserve three or four stars; but there are some problems that will probably take longer to solve: There are more jetways than before but many of them don't work. As I learned during my most recent arrival on American Airlines just because your plane pulls up to a jetway does not mean that you will deplane through it. Immigration simply does not have enough space to handle the peak times. Even with every desk staffed and a typical transaction time of less than two minutes waiting times of one hour or more are frequent especially in the early afternoon for Jamaicans and visitors alike. Baggage delivery is totally unpredictable. KIN has the fastest and the slowest baggage delivery in the Caribbean. Sometimes the first bags off the plane are lined up in neat rows sometimes they are all piled in a small heap. Air Jamaica and Delta seem to do better than American in this category but all are somewhat unpredictable. The whole inbound process plane to taxi has taken me as long as 90 minutes and as short as 10 minutes. The times to avoid are in the late morning and early afternoon. Late afternoon seems to be better.Outbound travel is challenging. Arrive at least two hours before flight time. Unless you are a premium traveler check-in can take a half hour or more. One exception seems to be Air Jamaica who appear to do much better at moving people. Air Jamaica has a pleasant lounge upstairs quiet usually uncrowded with good WI-FI access and a respectable but not lavish offering of snacks. The security screening area would be inadequate in an airport with one-fifth of KIN's traffic. In a terminal the size of NMIA it is a disaster. Security is the most disagreeable part of the KIN experience. There are only two screening machines feeding directly into the outbound immigration desks. Conditions are crowded and the outbound immigration line often backs up through the machines. Expect very long waits during peak outbound travel times. The majority of the security staff who try to be helpful and are professional in their bearing are hampered by a very few colleagues who are the most disagreeable security personnel I have ever met anywhere in the region. Some of them do not appear to be well trained and sometimes try to confiscate items that clearly are permissible in carry-on baggage. This small minority are rude unsmiling and are obviously the only people in Jamaica who have never learned the words ""please"" and ""thank you."" Requests to speak to a supervisor are often ignored. Where to they find these people? They seem to be unique in all of Jamaica. The airport has recently completed very nice departure gate areas upstairs but passengers are not allowed to use them. Instead you must still wait in a small crowded noisy lounge area where seats have been crowded around T-shirt and souvenir stands. The only positive note are the interesting small shops around the perimeter of the lounge. People appear to be an afterthought in the waiting area. There often are no seats available. When your flight is called for boarding only then may you go upstairs (there is only one elevator) and directly to your gate where you must board the plane immediately. If you do not have to enter Jamaica via KIN use Montego Bay instead especially if your destination is anywhere on the north coast. Montego Bay is often as crowded as KIN but better laid out and a little more efficient. If you must use KIN try to avoid the peak inbound and outbound times - and pray for a swift completion of the project.",NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

adana-airport,/airport-reviews/adana-airport,Adana Airport customer review,Robert Clark,NA,2006-05-17,"Adana Airport is a chaotic airport at best yet not as bad as airports in other countries that surround it. There are two terminals to the Adana Airport Domestic and International. In most cases the International side is only for the pilgrimage flights to Makkah Saudi Arabia and some limited flights into Northern Cyprus. The Domestic side starts with citizens wanting to take your bags up to the security screening (right at the entrance to the terminal). They will expect a tip for this very small action. Tell them ""hayir saa olun"" and you'll be left alone. You'll put your bags onto the belt and your passport will be checked. Even if you are flying domestically have your passport on you at all times. They will check the validity of your visa and if you have over-extended your welcome. Once you are through (P.S. Security does not speak English so bring some phrases with you) you will have to go to the airline of your choice. Even if you have no luggage and paper tickets you will still have to check in. Organized chaos is the best way I can put it. Regardless if you are flying Turkish Pegasus or Onur Air you will still have people cutting in line using Hefty bags as luggage and uncomfortable closeness. When you finally get to the front the people at the ticket counter normally speak english. MAKE SURE you ask if your bags get taken all the way. Some times they do - sometimes they don't. You may have to pick them back up in Istanbul so its important they make it clear. Once you are done you are left in a terminal that reeks of a foul Turkish soguk gone bad sick passengers that don't cover their mouths when they cough passengers that make that disgusting ""spit like a man"" sound and the ever famous stare. There is a smoking section but it is not seperate from any other room so non-smokers will be subjected to 2nd hand smoke. There is a small store that sells refreshments but does not open until 6am while some flights are much earlier. You'll be hard pressed for a seat so get to the airport early or get used to standing. Keep an eye on your things at all times. Lots of people look suspicious. The loudspeaker is hard to understand in this dimly lighted building and its usually only in Turkish. Just line up whenever everyone else does and try to sneak a peak at their ticket to see if it is your flight. You will go through a second security and enter the gate area. Once again - organized chaos. There is no ""area calling"" and to ""rows 1-10."" Its a massive cattle heard. Just try to get in the front. Once your identity and ticket are checked you will walk out onto the tarmac where you will see a bunch of suitcases (and Hefty bags) This is where is can get confusing. Before you can board the place you must claim your suitcase yet again and give it to the baggage handlers. I guess this is good since you do ensure it gets on the plane but if its a large flight it can be difficult in the dark to find your items. DEPARTURE INTERNATIONAL: Should you get lucky enough and go through immigration in Adana it is much easier than Istanbul. The Duty Free section is very tiny and only has alcohol and cigarettes but the customs queues are tiny in comparison to Istanbul. This may happen to you even if you are going through Istanbul to an international flight so it is always best to check over at International first to see if you leave from there or domestic. For your sake I hope you leave Internationally. ARRIVAL: Landings are pretty simple. If you go through customs (there will only be like 10 of you) you will go through a small customs kiosk your passport will be scrutinized and you'll get to have a rare ""Adana"" stamp in your passport unlike most who travel to Turkey with the ""Istanbul"" stamp. Your bags will come on a low riding baggage claim separate from the domestic fliers and quick out the door. If you are flying in domestically (or after checking into customs in Istanbul) you will have to wait quite a long time before the bags finally arrive onto the low riding baggage claim. In here is where you can rent a car as well about 4 companies are available on site and for those going to the NATO base there is a Hertz located in the Burger King. Back to the airpoort when you get outside you can be picked up by your people (they will not be allowed into the airport) or you can hire a taxi. A gentleman usually brings the taxi to you and loads your bags he will expect a tip. 2 YTL is good enough. P.S. - A good taxi (spelled taksi in Turkish) to go with would be Gate Taxi at +90(322)316TAXI - they speak English. It will cost more but the drivers have better English than the airport taxis) In the airport just dial 322316TAXI. One more thing before I forget - turn around whern you enter the terminal - you'll see the lost luggage department. If you fly here to Adana more than once - expect to go in here a few times. The airport itself is a dirty mess...it smells the facilities are usually dirty it reeks of smoke and it gets pretty loud.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Passport control did not take long luggage arrived extremely quickly but to be fair it seems only two flights had arrived simultaneously at that time (including mine). On departure check in was very quick gate easy to find. the only definite improvement that could've made things better would be either enlarging the waiting area in front of the gate or adding some facilities such as vending machine. There was a 2nd (and visibly less strict) security check at the entrace to the boarding gate waiting area which probably can be abolished and the waiting area joined to the main terminal area.

Customs and immigration not that helpful and my wife had to give up some perfume we had just bought or they would not clear us. Limited shopping there but the toilets were clean.

Rental cars are centralized but shuttles are frequent and the rental car building is bright and pleasant. On the other hand it is an pain to get from one terminal to another (give yourself at least 20 minutes).

The airport looked clean but it has changed a lot since my visit last year. A lot of the eateries were removed so choices are few and far between. The biggest change is moving the car rental companies to a parking lot across the street. There are no shuttles to take you where the car rentals are. If you have a lot of luggage you are going to have to hire a baggage handler to take your luggage where the car rental companies are at. Even if you don't have a lot or no luggage at all you have to walk a significant distance to reach the car rental companies. There a no pick ups for the disabled if you have to go there you'll have to do that on your own power.

However I have had enough! paying £3 for 23 minutes in the express parking and £2 to use a trolley is legalised profiteering. My Local International airport gives you 15 minutes free Parking and free use of trolleys. They even provide free tokens to use for the trolleys! It is a real pleasure to go there. You feel treated like a customer not a profit centre to be milked for as much as possible as quickly as possible. There is limited seating unless you spend your time in the bar / restaurant area enjoying the sixties decor. The Car rental area is located in a depression which is difficult to access when you have heavy luggage even when you are fit! The offices are like a big shed with limited space to stand inside if there are many people waiting to get cars. If is raining you could get very wet queuing outside. The cars are parked on a gravelly/muddy area. No fun when it is raining either for you your shoes or luggage. If you are travelling with someone leave them with the luggage at the shed and bring the car round and load there. The approach and exiting of the parking area is poorly marked and dangerous. There are certainly plenty of staff around to stop you doing anything that might conflict with the jobs worth mentality although there are some who will help. Herded at gates which reminded me of pens at a cattle market with virtually no where to sit. No I am not going to sit on a floor which has been tramped over by hundreds of shoes in good clothes!

This charge is so unpopular and unfair I have heard normally calm people start swearing when they have to pay just to get in to the departure area but they have no choice.

This being a late morning departure it was not overly crowded. On arrival into the building there was a standard security check quite normal. Although there were monitors indicating the departure gates we found no information on the specific location of airline counters within the check- in area. Eventually after some searching we found ours. Although we arrived at the terminal relatively late (two hours before departure) the line wasn't long and with four desks open the check-in procedure took no more than 15 minutes including waiting time. Immigration cards were completed after which we proceeded to pay the user charge 750 pesos per person (USD 17.50 would also have been accepted) a five minute wait in line. Passport control was next; this entailed the longest queue roughly 20 minutes. Immediately thereafter was the aviation security check only a minute and we were through. A brief stop at the washroom which was acceptable although slightly crowded. Finally a 6-7 minute walk to Gate 3; considering other reviews regarding the Terminal 1 waiting areas we were pleasantly surprised as it seemed relatively recently refurbished. The only complaint we might have would be the acoustics which left somewhat to be desired. It was difficult to hear the many announcements with all the chatting among our fellow passengers.

On my most recent trip from Heathrow I landed at 4.30 in the afternoon my flight was clearly the only international flight disembarking and I went straight up to an immigration desk without any queuing at all. Much clearly depends on when you land. Immigration officials do seem to have become noticeably more customer-oriented over the last 18 months too. A Supershuttle to Maryland was easy to find and easy to arrange despite a lack of pre-booking - and less than half the cost of a taxi to the same destination.

Big Check in Halls can cope with mountainous amounts of passengers. Security is good and fast and the airside is ok. Nothing special but adequate. Arriving can be a bit tiresome but again as with all charter airports baggage handling can be slow but have never had major issues. The one they could really do is join up the thinking here. The south coast of Spain is now a massive long city and there is a train running along it.

Car stopped probably for fifteen seconds max charge levied. They should advise on the Express drop off sign that there is a charge. Pathetic toilet provision. After security downstairs toilets out of use requiring a journey up the very congested staircase to the food court to find that the total provision of toilet cubicles for male passengers at what pretends to be an international airport is five. Security was quick and courteous.

However the drop-off point is about 300m from the terminal front door which given the location of the airport and the habit of the weather to at times be inclement means if it is raining you receive a wonderful wet start to your travel experience. In the airport itself although there are reasonable facilities they are expensive - it can cost almost £10 for a prefabricated snack that would cost £3 in a supermarket.

By virtue of its small size passing through is incredibly swift I have been on the train to London within 12 minutes of arriving! I have never had to queue for any length of time at security and although the terminal is compact it copes admirably even when busy and results in very fast transit times through the terminal. There's lots of building work going on at the moment yet this has not impacted adversely on the airport experience.

T2 is rather convenient with short distances and easy access. It seems a bit worn out but clean and organized. No lines good access to T3 if you use Priority Pass Lounges. T4 is a new modern piece of art but not as comfortable as it is rather large. Depending on the gate you could use 20 minutes after security to reach the gate so plan enough time. Overall it is spacious and clean you just need to be good in walking. Also transferring from either T1 2 or 3 to T4 takes some time. So does taxiing on the airport.

At first sight I found the terminal quite original and nice (the green mosaic); but tiny and really overcrowded. The terminal is non smoking but this is theory as it smells cigarette smoke everywhere. In fact there are smoking areas in bars but no smoke extractor so the whole terminal looks like a smoking room. Going from the 2nd floor to the 1st one using the stairs is hazardous as smoking is not prohibited in the piano bar between the 2 floors. Toilets are on the 1st floor. There look really old fashioned and are not so clean (lot of water on the ground). So what to do when you are in transit? There are 3 bars/snacks but it's almost impossible to find a seat. Prices for drinks are OK. Not so many duty free areas. Ideal for short stopovers as it takes only 5 minutes to go from one gate to another but probably the worst airport I've ever seen for people in transit.

There are far too few toilet facilities - only one really as the smaller toilets at one end are often closed or unusable/filthy and the hand dryers hardly ever work. As for security I can only echo many other comments. Border control staff are slow and inefficient and if 2 (or more) planes land at the same time it can take over an hour to get through. Hopeless. They have passport reading machines that they must have bought in the 80's as they take forever to read them. Compare that to landing in Spain where a quick swipe of your passport is enough.

The personnel (both Delta and the airport security) were some of the most courteous airport employees that I have seen in a while with an genuine eagerness to serve. The only downside to DAB is the relatively small number of airlines and flight choices; prices are often higher than Orlando or Jacksonville and you will probably have to catch a connecting flight through a major hub to get to your destination.

Awful in all regards - even after their improvements. They are never staffed appropriately. The line/crowd management is terrible. Their transportation system continues to leave you walking forever and still takes too long. Hard to believe they can't learn from other airports. My most recent case was yesterday when it took me 2 hours to move through check-in and security. So poorly managed that they had to hold people in the main airport area and not let them down the escalators until the security lines moved. Flyers have to make reservations. Knowing how many people are moving through your airport at any point during any day should not be guess work. Far from it. They have all security lanes open when there are no lines and far too few security lanes open when the airport is packed. Many of the facilities (e.g. escalators) are broken on a regular basis.

Easy directions around the airport if you are driving in - very clear to follow which route. Dropped off hire car at the entrance (same location for collecting taxis). NB: if returning a hire car and fuel is needed at this stage the first petrol station you come to off the O31 access road to the airport is open 24 hrs and is the best one to use for filling the car. Straight through first security to dept hall. No queues in the airport of course at that time at any point other than couple of mins. waiting at check in for flight itself. Airport very clean nice and bright facility. Ample signage for directions around airport. Cafe next to check in desks if wanted. Passport control prompt. Through to gate - further small cafe for hot drink / snack. Duty free open - good prices on most items. Further security check at gate plenty of seats for waiting. Free papers if required- German/US/UK titles (for Lufthansa flight). I must praise the check in staff who had a really nice approach to pax at that time of day and were friendly efficient and a pleasure to meet.

We saw many people taking clothes out and then wearing extra shirts jumpers jackets etc this took so long by these people in front of us.

Quite modern bright and very clean indeed but an airy feeling as there isn't many passengers around at night. Immigration and baggage collection is swift and I found myself at the taxi stand very soon. Departure wise the luggage needs to pass thru an x-ray machine before check in at counter though I don't fancy that experience as the officer asked me to open for full inspection. Check-in was fairly quick but there comes another inconvenience. After my check-in luggage was pushed into the counter it passes thru yet another x-ray and I was told to go inside the counter to open up again for almost a full-scale check. And the officer could tell me that they are from different dept compared to the earlier checks. How troublesome was that! They could simply set up a single checkpoint for all check-in luggage like many major international airports. The immigration staff doesn't look friendly at all. Duty free item is limited and shopkeepers selling souvenirs and local products greeting and eagerly following behind you whenever you are browsing around. I'm surprised to see automatic rubbish bin which the lid would closed by itself. Very clear announcement and many seats and TVs around the waiting area.

calgary-airport,/airport-reviews/calgary-airport,Calgary Airport customer review,S Katt,Canada,2014-07-17,While the US-Transborder areas are atrocious for food options and lounges the airport as a whole is not bad. Checking in is easy (usually) and is made easier if you are elite security has long queues through the transborder checkpoint but this is resolved by using the NEXUS lane (if you have one) (it is a great investment) and that brings me to Customs and Immigration. The CBSA hall is quite a trek from your arrival gate but it isn't as bad as LHR T2. Once at the checkpoint the officers are polite and if you have NEXUS you can be out of customs in 2 mins. Going through US CBP on the way to the US takes a bit longer though agents are generally polite and expedient. Back to NEXUS (there's a theme forming here). If you apply and get accepted you also get Global Entry benefits for US CBP so if you have it US CBP is also 2 mins. Sorry for skipping around here but the gate area for domestic flights (Concourses A and D) is big enough to find something to eat and somewhere to eat it and also has Lounges if you are so inclined. Transborder; (Concourse C) Is another story. It has very limited food options due to the opening and closing of gates for transborder traffic (if you've travelled through YYC you know what I mean) restrooms are few and far between and there is only one (paid entry) lounge which is nice for getting to the airport early but it is really not worth it. I guess a suitable end to this review is Baggage and well the few times I have checked a bag at YYC it has been about a 5-15 min wait domestically and 30-45 mins for international arrivals. I'm truly shocked if you're still reading at this point but in conclusion; most of the gripes I have about lines and food options should be solved in October 2105 when the IFP opens.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Security is simply a money making scam at this airport. The only liquid I had was an anti-bacterial gel less than 100ml which I took out of my carry on bag and placed in the tray for x-ray. The security person said it needs to be in a re-sealable clear plastic bag. I asked for one he said they were £1 each. I said the anti-bacterial cost less than that and he could keep it. I then noticed the person in front of me had several loose liquid bottles in their tray (not in a bag) and pointed it out to him. He said ""I didn't check that tray my colleague did"". However this wasn't the only issue my wife never takes liquids out of her handbag when going through security and she's been pulled up on it every time at Gatwick Stansted and Heathrow. My wife was behind me this time at Luton airport security and again left her liquids in her bag. They went through the x-ray machine and no one pulled her up on having liquids in her handbag and it wasn't one little mascara but several liquids in small bottles such as cosmetics nose drops and an anti-bacterial.

While they have made improvements (improvements which were torturous for passengers by the way) it does not and will never compare with the spacious Mirabel. I fly regularly to Europe on business and I recall the year in the early 2000's when AC switched from Mirabel to Dorval - it was like going from luxury accommodations to a shack. While it is better than that now there is no room for airport expansion (seems short-sighted) and access by car remains a nightmare. True that the City of Montreal (strangely) pushed for this and financed most of the improvements but I cannot imagine that the residents near Dorval like the noise and congestion. Lastly and generally speaking I have found that security staff at Trudeau-Dorval to be some of the rudest (though there have been a few nice ones over the years).

The check in agent was friendly and the airport police stationed at the entrance of the departure hall was friendly too, it made me feel really welcomed. Being an aviation enthusiast, I decided to do some plane spotting airside. I headed down to Terminal 3, hoping to photograph a Qatar Airways A350. I set up my tripod, and start taking a few shots of it. A tourist was intrigued by my camera and tripod, hence we both started chatting. As the tourist left for his flight, a fellow police officer, I saw who was watching me the whole time, walked up to me and told me off that I could not spot there. He warned me rudely that my camera could be confiscated and I could be jailed. I asked him the reason why, and he told me he was not sure but still insisted I leave that place immediately. That ruined my mood in the departure hall. I headed back to Terminal 1 as there was not much at Terminal 3. Since Changi does not offer plane spotters like me to openly go into gates and spot planes, I decided to take photos of the screens at each gate. In the process, several gate officers rudely shouted at me not to take the contents inside the gate and I felt terrified each time they do. I gave up on plane spotting in the airside, sitting near my departure gate waiting for my gate to open. Being a passenger and a Singaporean departing out of my home airport, I was extremely disappointed with the service of the Airport police.

They had the audacity to charge £7.90 for an hours parking on what looks like a bomb site then wanted another £1.75 to pay by credit card and all with a very long walk and no shelter from bad weather from terminal to car.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Jay Towney,United States,2014-06-01,I read a lot of horror stories about this airport but it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. Upon arrival we were at a remote stand and had to take a bus to the terminal. The immigration line was about one hour but most stands were manned so we figured that this was a result of multiple international flights arriving at the primary entry point to Turkey. While it wasn't fun we understood why the line was that long. A couple of days later we returned to depart for Bucharest early morning arrival. Security to enter the terminal was not long at all and the check-in for the airline was about a 10 minute wait. Same for outbound immigration and security. We had breakfast at the food court it was more expensive than downtown Istanbul but comparable to Western airports. Boarding was not a problem but no seating at the departure gate (again by bus). Returning home we were transiting from Bucharest through IST to Boston and we didn't have connecting boarding passes (although our luggage was checked through). No line at the transit desk to get the connecting boarding pass friendly staff. No line at the international transfer security checkpoint. Although our transfer time was only 1 hr 20 mins we had plenty of time to go through duty free between flights. Boarding for BOS the departure gate had the enhanced USA security which meant standing in line about 20 minutes but it moved along quickly. All in all IST was a good airport. There are plenty of signs to direct you wherever you need to go as long as you pay attention to where you're supposed to go next you won't have any problems.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

stuttgart-airport,/airport-reviews/stuttgart-airport,Stuttgart Airport customer review,H Asche,NA,2007-09-20,STR is a pretty neat airport one of these nice German regional airports that have so much less hazzle then e.g. Frankfurt has. STR still does offer some attractive connections and make it a real alternative for intra-European flights. But beware: Although they promise a minimum connecting time of 30 minutes this is absolutely not manageable. The problem is that in some instances you can't transfer airside but have to land yourself. This is definately valid for those flights arriving from non-Schengen airports. You have to go through immigration control and customs go out to the public area go one level up and proceed through the normal security control. Depending on the time of day this can be VERY lengthy. And from here it still might be a pretty long way to your departure gate. In the end this is even more hazzle then transferring in Frankfurt.

The 18.15 departure to Istanbul. Check-in was very busy but the line moved quickly and the check-in agent was friendly. Passport control and security at terminal B (non Schengen) was very fast with friendly officers. The flight was boarded in zones and this was enforced. Passengers in an other boarding zone were not allowed to go to the plane until the passengers from the announced boarding zone were boarded. The return on the 25th of August at 21.35 was smooth. No lines at immigration and when we reached the luggage reclaim the bags were already coming to the carrousel. Clean airport with nice and friendly airport staff.

singapore-changi-airport,/airport-reviews/singapore-changi-airport,Singapore Changi Airport customer review,Alfons Wilbert,NA,2009-01-25,Budget Terminal Singapore Changi Airport. If you fly on a Budget Airline you are not flying from any of the Changi Main Terminals - this is now a sub-class travelling experience. Firstly despite the fact that you may had your luggage checked through to your final destination you actually have to collect it from the belt of your connecting flight at SIN Changi and go through Customs as you have to physically leave the airport to get to the Budget Terminal. Once you arrive at the Budget Terminal you are in the hands of Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS). After check-in which took ages you are left in what can only be described as a totally stripped down version of an airport. You travel on a Budget Airline so you will be made to you feel like a sub-class person in this Terminal. Having been shepherded to towards the departure gate we found this gate to be closed and unstaffed despite it being 40 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Departure time came and went but still no one attended the gate despite all passengers being clearly able to see that the flight was standing outside. 1 hour past the scheduled departure time I did go to one of the other gates that was staffed and demanded that someone would attend our gate as the whole flight was sitting on the floor in the corridor outside the gate. Nothing happened for a further 30 minutes when I lost my patience and went looking for anybody from SATS to demand to see the Terminal Manager.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I have never considered flying to Sharjah but when I realised how much cheaper the flights were and that Sharjah was a short distance away from Dubai I decided to give it a try. The airline I normally chose to fly Dubai takes us to Terminal 2. There is very little in T2 so I was pleasantly surprised that Sharjah airport outshone T2. Although Sharjah is dry you can buy alcohol from the duty free. Also on the return you can also buy it from some of the eateries! From deplaning to passport control it was very quick with no queues - staff are surely but it's the same in Kuwait and Dubai. When we returned to the airport for our departure we were able to use the self service check-ins as we only travelled with hand luggage so no queues. Then a short queue to passport control.

Well sandwiches start at 10TL (about £3) and coffee starts at 5TL (about £1.50). It's normal price for an airport. Some people on here also complained about limited seating availability.

edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,A Jennings,NA,2009-08-09,This was my first time using Edinburgh Airport. Departing Edinburgh was a decent experience. However the queues for passing through security were not so good. It took us 10 minutes to check-in with nearly all of the airport staff helpful and polite apart from one young staff member in his twenties who was swearing and cursing at passengers under his breath. Then we got something to eat before clearing security. It seems that at Edinburgh there are more shops and places to eat before security so if you are planning to eat- get something before security. Going through security took about 15 minutes- even with all of the screens being used. Slowly we got through. Boarding the plane was quick- although we departed about 15 minutes late due to missing passengers. Returning to Edinburgh was poor. We arrived at midnight and got off the plane quickly- but clearing immigration was pathetic- why do they make you walk round and round before reaching the desks? After clearing immigration we had to wait and use the same baggage belt as another full flight even when the other belts were not being used! This meant we ended up waiting over 45 minutes to collect our bags. I understand that it was midnight and there would be less handlers on duty- but 45 minutes is a disgrace at any airport- especially an international one like Edinburgh. I think Edinburgh airport is a good one (despite the wait to collect our luggage) - the signage is clear and well designed making the airport easy to navigate. The toilets were clean too. It is clear that Edinburgh Airport needs expanding in the future.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The flights to and from the US left from a gate with a jetway however the flights to and from Nice required bus rides. For bus rides it went pretty fast although on the return (flight from Nice was delayed) it was a long ride. The worst thing was the chaotic departure from the A-gates for flights to the US. You go through security right at the gate and after you go through security there is not enough space for all the passengers for a full wide-body plane to sit. It's really crowded and chaotic. There was also a confusing counter near the gates which said ""US Document Check."" I didn't think we had to stand in this line but there was no way to be sure. Fortunately a very helpful airport staffer saw us (I was traveling with my elderly uncle who uses a cane) and looked at our boarding pass and said we didn't need our documents checked (Austrain needs to clarify who needs to stop here on the sign). We then went to the really long security line and our helpful friend said my uncle was in a wheelchair we could go to the front of the line. So he grabbed a nearby wheelchair got us right to the security machines then got us right up to the jetway. Many thanks to this most helpful person.

Bus tickets strictly cannot be purchased on board ! If a ticket vending machine is broken down (as in my case) one has to find another source for buying a ticket (a kiosk or go to the next bus stop). I was unable to find a kiosk selling bus tickets at the airport (but not all kiosks were open - so there might be one). To make things more complicated the ticket vending machines accept only coins (bring a lot of coins to purchase a daypass !). If more than one flight is leaving at the same time waiting times at outbound immigration and subsequent security check can be long.

Queuing time was really long at about 1h due to lots of Indian tourists arguing over the baggage allowance of 30kg. To make things worse there was only 2 check in counters for the whole A380 flight for economy. There were 2 business class counters and 2 online check in counters that were quite empty for the whole time but they refused to serve economy check in until their supervisor asked them to. Not very good to make so many passengers wait. This was the only letdown at ZRH. The security check area is efficient with polite staff but it lacks dustbins or areas to pour away excess liquids/drinks/water or throw away any forbidden items which caused problems for some passengers. The departure/transit area was clean with good shopping and dining facilities. Signs were clear. Lacks toilets. What's truly impressive is the airport staff's honesty and efficient service. My father left his wallet on the economy check in counter and just went into the departure area without it.

amritsar-airport,/airport-reviews/amritsar-airport,Amritsar Airport customer review,Mikele Singh,NA,2008-04-10,Airport security is incredibly lax and inconsistent. You initially undergo a brief bodysearch when arriving at the airport. My dad and our driver were both searched but my sister and I were not subject to this search. Maybe they can tell that your not dangerous just by looking at you? Our baggage was not checked when entering the airport. Due to cancellations we had to have our baggage security checked twice. This means you put your own suitcase into a big machine for x-ray while a security official watches a screen as it passes through. This is the baggage you check-in. The first time all bags were aloud through unchecked. The second time one of the bags was flagged as containing a suspicious item. Why was this not flagged the first time? The security staff then wrap security tape around your suitcase to indicate that it has been checked. You then proceed to check- in on your own. This would allow enough time for you to insert dangerous items into your baggage. As far as i'm aware there are no more checks on your checked in baggage. The procedure is flawed. Then comes the second stage of security as you enter the departure lounge where your hand baggage is checked and you as a person. My sister got through with a nail file in her bag. In my opinion as long as you look like you're not a threat to the safety of the hundreds of passengers you're about to fly with you'll get through with anything.

Many shops to browse but overpriced like the typical airport shop. There are more to shop and places to eat outside of the gate area.

However it costs about the same to get to Torp as it does to get to Gardermoen due to the outrageously expensive (but very efficient) Airport Express Train going to the latter airport. When choosing between coach and train to Torp note that the train takes slightly longer and is about 60 NOK more expensive - but more comfy and a beautiful journey at times.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
berlin-tegel-airport,/airport-reviews/berlin-tegel-airport,Berlin Tegel Airport customer review,K Pearson,NA,2007-12-12,Berlin Tegel is really past its sell by date. At the booking-in desks there are usually long queues with little or no supervision and to make matters worse some of the queues tend to merge with other queues. On 7th December 2007 we waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes just to book in for our flight to Amsterdam. There was a further 20 minute wait to pass through the gate security. The departure lounges have little or no facilities so people tend to delay arriving at the gate until the last minute and this probably helps to create the long queues. This also impacts on the small shopping area where to obtain a coffee you invariably have to stand as all the seating is occupied.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
vilnius-airport,/airport-reviews/vilnius-airport,Vilnius Airport customer review,Andrius Uzkalnis,NA,2004-05-23,VNO is trying but this is an example of a lack of planning and forward-thinking. The best thing that can be said is that it is very close to central Vilnius and a taxi will take you there for an equivalent of $7.00. Otherwise it is so hopelessly inadequate for the new stream of passengers brought about by Lithuania's admission to the EU and God only knows what it is going to look like after number of passengers will almost double this summer with all the new flights launched. Arrivals hall is dark cold and uncomfortable albeit clean. Departures: check-in lines are long but tend to move quick passport control and security is quick. Airside waiting areas are clean but seats are few toilets are spotless but there are not enough of them. Duty Free is a joke. Once airside you cannot buy a book a magazine or a newspaper. One little tip: when people are reduced to leaning on the walls you almost always CAN get a seat in the bar because it so obnoxiously overpriced that it is only half-empty at the worst of times. Most travellers would not buy $3.00 coffee or a $4.00 glass of water but to me it sounds like a bargain for a guaranteed seat and a table to put my laptop on. And for flights in winter when it snows outside the views through huge glass windows are magnificient.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

For this reason it can take a while to get from one side to the other. In my case I took nearly 30 minutes to make my way from my Dragonair flight to immigration - and this was on a quiet Sunday morning. You will never experience overcrowding! Check-in areas are adequately signed and customs staff are efficient if not a bit dismissive.

There is a requirement to go through security even though passengers making connections have already passed through security at the airport(s) of departure.

The security line at Terminal 3 was appalling stretching out into the main Terminal and with only a few of the scanners actually working. Passengers were constantly being called out of line to meet flight deadlines but the inept handling staff clearly didn't have a proper list as the flight I was on was not called.

The passport control on returning to the UK is ridiculous we now have a electronic passport and the queue is smaller but even then it is rare that all the booths are working. The queue for the normal passport which you have to use if you have children with you is horrendous I would estimate that it is usually a 2hour wait and often 3 hours. Stansted have got to do something about this. On the last occasion airport staff were not even letting people into the area as there were too many people there and they were holding them back in the corridors. There is no assistance for older travellers who have to stand and wait I did mention this once to the passport control as there was a very old lady in front of us they said if they asked they would have been sent to the front of the queue but many are visiting.

The only things he does not mention is the endless queuing for each stage of the mindlessly bureaucratic departure process and the frequent sense of panic as you are separated from your baggage during the numerous security checks. All this is compounded by the fact that most passengers and staff are half asleep and extremely irritable due to the fact that many flights depart between 03.00 and 05.00 in the morning.

vienna-airport,/airport-reviews/vienna-airport,Vienna Airport customer review,Pavel Iosad,Norway,2010-05-01,Arrival OK bussed to the gate butthat's pretty normal with low-cost carriers here. Once inside met by airport employees giving out tourist booklets. Some waiting for luggage but nothing too bad. Out through customs slightly cramped and signage could be better. Signs to the train steers you towards the airport train which is the same as S-Bahn but costs much more: make sure you go for the S-Bahn it is very easy to miss. Departure: if you arrive by train (whether S-Bahn or CAT) you have to go through the arrivals area and a narrow corridor to find an elevator to departures: suboptimal. But the worst part was that our flight to Oslo was not on the screens! It turned out that low-cost carriers have a separate check-in building across the road from the main terminal. Though HG flights which also have to be checked in in that building are on the screens. There is basically no information on that: very bad. Once we found the check-in desk and dropped the luggage (which went reasonably fast) the rest was OK. Security is at the gate so you go first to a very decent selection of shops and cafes. The ground-floor boarding area (the bus-gates) is shambolic though lots of flights with probably three security channels and while the security people were doing their best there was some queuing. Once in it's very packed and there is a pretty useless shop wedged in between the gates so there were two chaotic queues trying to get through some very narrow space.

First of all announcements about departures are made in both Slovak and English with the exception of Slovak charter flights which are often (but not always) announced only in Slovak as the passengers are Slovak and perhaps Czech nationals. On the other hand arrival announcements are only in Slovak as there are quite a few monitors/screens which are directly linked to the system here at OPC and hence automatically display current information. The arrival announcements are made in Slovak as they are not aimed at the passengers (they have the monitors) but at different workers at the airport i.e. mechanics catering bus drivers as we bus passengers to/from the A/C with some minor exceptions baggage handlers etc). Announcements in the gate are made if the airline wants them and these are made at least in Slovak and English. I would also like to state that often we make announcements also in other languages ie. for the twice weekly SU flight to SVO also in Russian and sometimes in Hungarian Italian German French but that only if unnecessary and very seldom.

While the newer larger terminals Continental uses are rather nice with a decent array of eateries and shops our onward flight departed from Terminal A which looks like a small crowded terminal built decades ago and never updated. Woefully over-crowded. While the main terminals had bars/restaurants run by Heineken and by Samuel Adams beers Terminal A had just a Budwesier brew pub/eatery (being the only sit-down restaurant in the terminal it was filled with a long line of people waiting to get in). The main terminals could use a desk giving ground transportation information (the only one is outside security) since at one point we were given the option of trudging out to Laguardia to get a flight to Ottawa but the reps at the customer service counters could give us NO information at all about time and cost of getting out to Laguardia.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The airport is probably one of the worst in the country however it has its positive notes. 1) There is a metro (light rail) train which pulls up directly to the airport and can take you to anywhere around 20 locations around St. Louis. In a matter of 30 minutes (about the same as driving) you can be in the shadow of the arch. It makes it nice for layovers. 2) The food is interesting.

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,A Obee,NA,2009-10-12,Travelled through here in October 2009.On arrival there were long queues for immigration and not many people had a pen to fill in immigration cards which were not given out on the plane we had to collect them and fill them in on arrival. On our return journey although we had checked in on line everyone was made to queue and check in again causing very long queues and many frayed tempers as the staff tried in many cases to say baggage was oversized or overweight. We pointed out that the scales already read 1.8kg before we put our hand baggage on there and that was the only reason we appeared to be overweight in fact our bag was weighed on another scale and was only 8.7kg well within the 10kg limit. He then tried to tell us it was oversized until we placed it in the sizing basket where it fitted quite easily! Be aware that you must fill in an embarkation card before checking in or you will be sent to the back of the line to do so. Once through to airside the 2 cafes take dirham but the shops do not so at least you can buy drinks and snacks with any loose change. Water was 10dh similar for a croissant. Taxi from the airport to centre was 120 in a grand taxi (couldn't bargain any lower he started at 150) and on the return was 80 in a petit taxi from Jeema el Fna to the airport (we did not even try to haggle lower as felt it was reasonable),NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
hobart-airport,/airport-reviews/hobart-airport,Hobart Airport customer review,Robert Noga : Mngr Comm & Corp Affairs (Hobart Intl Airport),NA,2005-08-15,"In June 2005 a $5000000 Stage 1 reconstruction of the Domestic Terminal Building's commercial precinct security screening point and departures lounges was completed with expanded areas to cope with recent growth in passenger throughput and to eliminate congestion in these areas. These works were accompanied by a much needed upgrade of car park facilities and the relocation of car rental firms to a new purpose built facility outside the Domestic Terminal. Completion of Stage 1 brought with it modern and bright facilities including new retail outlets operated by Australian Way and Delaware North incorporating a separate news and book shop gift shop cafeteria and food and beverage bar. New personal care facilities were constructed including toilets disability facilities and baby change facilities (airside and landside). It is anticipated that an internet cafe will be operating shortly along with an additional airside ATM. Stage 2 of the project has commenced with a further $2000000 expansion of the departures lounges. Expected to be completed by October 2005. It is anticipated that Stage 3 of the project will commence in 2006 with reconstruction of the Qantas and Virgin ends of the Domestic Terminal Building installation of contemporary ""Check In"" desks facilities to accommodate ""checked bag screening"" and arrivals lounges. The nature of these exciting works and their cost will be separately announced on our Web Page at: www.hobartairprt.com.au. Hobart International Airport will retain its international flight capabilities and looks to grow this business particularly in support of Antarctic flights and regional SE Asia and South Pacific routes. These routes do not require runway extensions and the Airport enjoys a 24 hour operations capability without curfews and with significant capacity to cater for further aeronautical growth. After initial adverse comment in relation to changed parking and traffic arrangements the comments relating to completed works have been overwhelmingly positive.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

After check in we were sent to the SriLankan shared lounge at Gate 22 Terminal 2 without being given alternate information on where exactly the plane was boarding. Our flight was also not shown on the in lounge screens as well. Upon asking about our flight which should have commenced boarding the lounge assistant tore our boarding pass rushed us to a gate down the ramp and ushered us onto a bus. After 2 minutes I left the bus and walked across the tarmac to ask for our boarding passes and passports. She began taking us back to the lounge. It appeared that our flight was near closing time for boarding and we were really concerned. After running about 100 meters back toward the terminal we finally found a screen only to see that the plan was in fact our plane and that it was about to close for boarding. We had to run all the way back to the plane and made it as they were announcing for us by name. I have never seen a more disorganised airport and more useless lounge staff and I must compliment them for their incompetence. The airport itself was disorganised and we stood in the checking queue with two people in front of us for 45 minutes trying to check into J class.

The arrival service was fast efficient and pleasant - no queues baggage delivered quickly and the immigration officer even welcomed me to Colombia! Departure was another matter. At about 3pm when most of the flights to Europe are checking in the departure hall was so full it was almost impossible to move. When I checked in with Iberia they explained that I had already paid the airport tax on my ticket but I'd have to get an exemption stamp from the airport tax office. This meant another queue for at least 30 minutes; but if I was willing to pay the tax for a second time I could have done so immediately. This just seemed to be a way of extracting extra cash from people willing to pay not to stand in another long queue! Once I had finally checked in things improved and there was little queue at immigration or security.

Recently I had to travel with my mother-in-law who is in a wheelchair. The airport does not have wheelchair facilities when you enter the airport you have to get in first through all the checks inform the counter and then bring somebody outside with the wheelchair. All this while my MIL had to wait without assistance. We were asked to wait in line even though she was in a wheelchair. Thirdly I was charged for the wheelchair facility! I was informed that the aircraft would land remotely and we would have to climb stairs to which I said my mother in law could not climb stairs! Told we needed an ambu-lift which at other airports I have been given access to. Here in Mumbai I was informed I will be charged for this. My argument and discussion fell on deaf ears as employees showed no concern nor compassion towards anybody. I agreed I would make her climb the stairs but we needed at least 15 mins. It took more than an hour to clear immigration. Once we cleared immigration the wheelchair attendant vanished and never appeared again. I had to take her to the boarding gate myself! Once at the stairs of the plane nobody bothered to help her. I offered to lift the wheel chair and then a couple of people helped and carried the wheel chair all the way up.

Fairly typical modern airport terminal - clean spacious lots of steel and glass. 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 for connecting flight - while still architecturally eye catching showing its age and feeling a bit sticky. 10 or so free internet terminals several of which weren't working. On the return flight we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed to a gate close to terminal 1. Long layover of 6.5 hours. While deciding what to do I was approached by a friendly airport employee who explained my options including (as a UK passport holder) the option to pass through immigration and leave the airport if I so wished. In the end decided to find somewhere quiet to try and catch up with my sleep. Rather than proceed to my departure gate I went up the elevator to the arrivals floor and walked back towards terminal 3. Limited seating en-route and no facilities other than toilets but very quiet and I was largely undisturbed for several hours. I noticed a room full of seating close to the transfer desk. Approaching departure time I made my way back to the departures level and through security (peculiarly I don't remember needing to do this on the outward leg). Once through security the route inevitably winds it's way through a huge shopping area before reaching the T3 departure gates. As is the case with T1 there were several free internet terminals.

The terminal design is not for everyone a narrow mile long structure with gates on each side. Plus Points; Lots of space and seating plenty of eating places easy to navigate and very clean. Negative points: The choice of eating places depends on where you are. If you want to see whats on offer at each place you need to spend time and walk a lot. Shopping is quite limited.

dublin-airport,/airport-reviews/dublin-airport,Dublin Airport customer review,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,2010-04-11,I find Dublin a very frustrating airport in many respects. Arrived at what I consider to be the original part of the airport and it is extremely tired and user unfriendly for less able passengers. As usual long wait for the bags - 45 minutes - I have a theory that they prioritise Aer Lingus flights. Departed from the original part of the airport - lacking in space. The new terminal looks impressive hopefully the bags will be deposited a lot quicker in it.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Only 4 staff to screen thousand of passengers many with young children who cant be even carried on buggies as the airlines don't return these immediately after landing. It would make a lot of sense to have a fast track lane for families with children as would make the whole process a lot faster.

There were seven of us and the taxi attendant was very helpful in organising a mini bus for us. We decided to catch the train to the airport from Central Station when leaving Sydney and was quite disappointed. The trains are very old and dirty and carry suburban passengers out to the western suburbs as well. I expect a better service when you are paying $15AUD for a 10 minute train ride.

The airport has one of the worst immigration and custom processing facilities in the world. It isn't unusual to find that only one luggage security scanner is operating. The queue is always hopelessly long, and the immigration personnel can be very rude. I suppose with the monopoly of being the only airport in Sydney, they can afford to do so. The parking charges are incredibly expensive. Trying to squeeze too much infrastructure within the limited space, has turned their car park into something resembling a maze. The lane lines are confusing. The signage is poor. The congestion entering and exiting the airport is incomprehensible for a modern city.

There were no weather concerns for that day so every person in customs area had arrived on a scheduled flight. It seemed that no one at IAH customs had any idea that people were flying that day. A total of 5 stations at customs were manned I think there are about 75 stations. After we basically checked ourselves through an electronic kiosk we then had another line to give the forms to the agent. After that line we had another hour in the line/scrambled mess of people to get the one piece of luggage cleared. Once again there was no queue - just a mess of people with agents coming through yelling to get your forms filled out. Total confusion reigns. Finally you reach a place where only 3 agents are manning the door quickly look at the passports again and you leave. The agent controlling the leftmost lane - was purposefully slow - processing 1 person for every other lines 10. Like most travelers I would do all this without complaint if there were a weather emergency or that this long time in customs was necessary for all passengers and their belongings to be carefully scanned to protect our country. I felt like I was in some argument between airlines/airport managers/customs officials.

On departure however you are firstly required to go through a pre- security screening on arriving which includes putting you're belongings through for scanning. This was all over the place and the workers were very rude and unorganised. After this you queue again to show your passport and boarding pass before getting through this congested area to check in. Check in took over an hour with each queue having about 10-12 people/families in it. Staff did not have a clue. We went through the next passport check which was fine for us but if it was busy it could get very messy. Then onto security there was no trays left and when I got a tray from the next line someone tried to skip me. After this I think it was through to duty free where the shop staff are helpful enough on the floor but the till staff were rather rude. Finally it was boarding which seemed to take ages and when I got to the front my barcode wouldn't scan the machine had broken and the woman was very unwelcoming!

To make thing worse customs only opened one lane for people to check through. As a result passengers were queuing in a long line to get out. This has been going on for years without any improvement.

The seating are for eating/ waiting is smaller than the duty free shop and has one information board facing at the duty free shop with the back of a TV the only view to those waiting to board flights.

It's all very quiet in the wee hours the police with their German shepherds is monitoring the airport (but not bothering you) and there are seats around that can even become makeshift beds for a couple of hours. A smaller drawback of the airport is that all the stores and restaurants are rather pricey. Though the quality of the food in the restaurants is (typical German) pretty good it lacks a bit of variety. Just the usual fare from Pretzels to Schnitzels. And the only major drawback are the many bus rides to the planes that you will have to take if you're a frequent traveler to/from Stuttgart. Taking a bus to the aircraft might not be such a big problem for passengers of the proliferating low cost carriers that operate out of Stuttgart such as HLX.COM but for the rest of us it's a hassle that we would rather avoid right?

Certainly the security is tight with security before you even enter the airport and while the lines were longish they moved quite quickly and the staff seemed polite. The airport is certainly crowded but after a week in Istanbul you realise that is the norm for this city we travelled on public transport at various times and never scored a seat so maybe we were not surprised. The toilets seemed clean the shops varied (the ones selling Turkish delight certainly offer enough samples to make a meal!) and the other amenities seemed adequate. All in all the experience was fine - it is a busy airport and I can imagine when it is operating at capacity things could get quite hectic. One last point public transport is pain to the airport because of the crowds take a taxi but negotiate your fair before you set out.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Compact airport with easy to follow signage and layout. At departure level check in counters well staffed and provide quick and efficient service. Duty free shops are to be avoided since liquor and cosmetics items cost more than in city stores. A1 to A6 gates recently renewed and look very bright and modern. New reconstructed Business lounge is very spacious and provides a good selection of local / import beverages and a well stocked hot buffet is a nice touch.

Probably around 50% of all the hand luggage has to be opened and is fully checked often by the one individual security person causing severe delays and queuing. In probably around 25% of cases your passport will also have to be closely examined and a small removable sticker attached for (many) further examinations.

Yesterday after being called from the cell-phone waiting area I went to meet my party at the handicapped loading zone right next to the Delta / Horizon zone put my handicap sticker in plain view in the front window and before I could even finish pulling over and popping open the trunk I was verbally assaulted by an unbelievably obnoxious meter maid demanding that I move on.

On our return journey the customs software went down (Aug 2013) which happens but the time to get the system back up and operating was extremely slow (2 hrs). With major events like the Grand Prix coming up I really hope they ramp things up to accommodate for the crowds expected. Just small things like customs staff wearing iPhone headsets under their head dress and they have absolutely no interest in being welcoming at all.

Lately we started using Amsterdam simply as it is the best of all the 4 main hubs in Europe and we really enjoy spending some time there. Frankfurt doesn't inspire Paris CDG is a rubbish place to spend some time just a soulless place (unless you have lounge access I guess which we don't have) and we tend to no longer fly BA as it's just to expensive to the destinations we regularly fly to. That leaves Amsterdam and we tried it a few times now and really like it. There's just so much to see and do the range of shops eateries and places to relax are awesome and every pier has something else to offer there's even a museum and if you have the chance to go through customs to go to the railway station you're greeted by a rather large shopping mall as well. Some airport staff recommended we went through customs to go to the roof terrace where we found to our surprise that an airport was parked on the roof for the public to see really cool. I do agree to some comments that security staff at the gate need to learn some manners as some of them are just awful. I guess that's down to translation issues but the Dutch clearly have to learn to add the word 'please' to their vocabulary it just makes all the difference. Airport staff needs to give security staff some proper training as some have very limited English and as a result sound very rude. Overall KLM airline staff are always pleasant to deal with they really stand out from other airlines it is really noticeable. But back to the airport by far the best airport to kill some time in Europe if you depend on a transit airport.

If you arrive from Europe (normally in late afternoon or evening) you will always systematically spend at least one hour if not more to go through migration because they only have very few officers at that time of the day - one per flight which means you may find yourself among other 500 or 600 people waiting to be taken care of.

Desks are specialised by directions and it is not explained where to check in for which city. After you are checked in for the flight you have to go to another desk to check in your bag. Another queue but like everything there moving fast. Staff speak very limited English so listen carefully and don't shy to ask again if you need to be at the right place. Security control is not efficient but is well staffed (overstaffed I would say) so there are lots of available desks on duty. Boarding is a funny procedure when they form two queues (priority and normal) that are of equal length but boarding begins simultaneously for both line and looks like entering subway station during peak hours. They board 747 within 6-8 minutes. Food facilities are plentiful landside but spreaded chaotically throughout the terminals. Airside there is almost nowhere to eat. Deplaining in Japan is like evacuation exercise. You're off the plane with your bag in the train to the city probaly within 15 minutes.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,S Brown,Australia,2013-01-10,Both terminals run by Sydney Airport Corporation (this excludes the Qantas terminal) are dirty disorganised and incredibly noisy. The eating options are barely passable - thankfully most domestic travel is so short you don't need to eat anything. At international with the exception of one or two outlets the options and quality are pitiful. The airport's food offer makes airline food seem the appealing option. The shopping is the same offer as every suburban shopping centre and is largely irrelevant to travellers needs and interests. I have not had major issues with Customs or the other government agencies working in the airport which were not essentially the result of poor/inadequate facilities. There is room for improvement in service levels and general pleasantness - but that seems to be an issue worldwide. Sydney Airport is a patchwork of buildings and facilities which scream systematic under investment. The terminals appear to struggle to meet today's traveller numbers and needs - I cannot see this changing in the future which suggests at some point in the near future Sydney will not have a functional airport at all.

edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,Ian Miller,United Kingdom,2011-10-23,Still can't get over the drop-off and pick-up charges. Check-in queues are variable as usual. I don't understand the advantage of checking in online if I have baggage as I have to stand in a long queue anyway. Security clearance has improved and I found the staff extremely friendly. Passport control is much better although the slalom like barriers make me laugh. Luggage retrieval is haphazard - sometimes it's good but not if there are any other flights. They seem unable to cope with more than one flight at a time. Cost of parking is a nightmare here and the pick-up charge for pre-booked taxis is a rip-off.

heraklion-airport,/airport-reviews/heraklion-airport,Heraklion Airport customer review,Tom Maule,NA,2007-10-27,This has to be one of the worst airports in Europe! On arrival passport control was very quick but that was the end of any efficiency. After a wait of about 15 mins the monitors (which are badly positioned) showed the carousel for my BA flight. However after another 15mins - still no baggage and it was only when another passenger went into the other baggage area did we find all baggage delvered on another belt. Departure was equally chaotic as check in staff took forever to get themselves organised. When you eventually check in you have to take your bags back and stand in another line for security checks. Heraklion always seems busy and it is difficult to know which line is for what check in desk or security point and there are no staff around to organise anything. As it was a BA flight to the UK the extra schengen gates are used - this was the only flight so that part was quick and the lounge comfortable because of low numbers. Buses to the aircraft again - for about 50 feet. Catering is poor with little choice - weak coffee and stale cheese pies!,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

By far in any standards the worst airport terminal in the world. Signage is non existent and after landing you walk around the airport terminal outside beside airplanes so to get in into the terminal. The most disrespectful treatment of passengers starts here queues to immigration are mind-blowing. Took 2 hours to get through and once you reach the counter it takes 20 seconds to get a stamp this makes you wonder what is taking the time? Could be that one immigration booth is constantly chit chatting with each other or another one having lunch during work time. Also there were only half of the booths open. No aircon so with 1000 passengers and 2 hrs you will feel dirty as ever upon arrival to Kuala Lumpur. After immigration finding a taxi or bus is a joke again no sign. No taxi will run you on meter if you are tourist adding insult even more. This terminal is a joke to mankind and an example of how low one can go.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
kolkata-airport,/airport-reviews/kolkata-airport,Kolkata Airport customer review,A Sabaratnam,Singapore,2013-12-31,Greeted by helpful airport staff who directed me to the right counter. I arrived at 7pm to board a 10pm flight to Singapore. The airport was sparsely populated at that time. The environment was clean too. So what was lacking? 1) WiFi - Apparently the airport offers a 30 minute complementary WiFi. If you have a laptop iPad or mobile phone all you need to do is to give your mobile phone number to receive a serial number and password. Beyond 30 minutes you need to purchase WiFI. I made several attempts but I did not receive a text message at all. 2) Food If you are hoping to get a bite before you enter the departure lounge you will be bitterly disappointed. There are a handful of cafes offering unappetizing snacks. I would strongly suggest you bring packed food if you are going to be a long while in this airport. 3) Security Tags - When you are checking in be sure you ask for security tags for your hand-carrying bags. They will not tell you this. At the Customs check point the officers will stamp this tag. If you don't have one they would have to find one and then you will get a ticking off for not getting one. How are we to know we need one if this is not practised world-wide and the person at the check-in counter does not tell you?

It took 45 minutes of chaos to get through - there were no controls for the lines so lots of jostling pushing-in etc a recipe for passenger stress and frayed tempers. The security lines themselves were under a huge amount of pressure but were slow and under-staffed. Once through I found a very small terminal building with few shops one overwhelmed cafe (with you guessed it a long queue) and then one of those glass smoking areas that was leaking vile tobacco fumes across the whole building.

Then at immigration I was denied entry and told that my boarding pass was not valid because it might be a fake which totally did not make sense. I was ordered to go back to the check-in hall and wait for the check in counter to open (only 2 hours before the flight) and issue me an 'official' boarding pass.

Arrival was on time but many passengers as there were 2 planes from Saudi Arabia. Bags already waiting and out in no time. Taxis hunting for arrivals so a good idea to avoid them and take an official taxi to avoid rip off. NO Sky Priority for any Business class passengers. Departure was a breeze at check in. No priority fro C class passengers at passport control. Couple of nice shops and cafes. The C class lounge is quiet and nice with non-functional internet which managed to irk most guests. The holding boarding gate is too small to hold a full B777 so it caused great discomfort to passengers and the numerable carts and wheelchairs. Very claustrophobic. Bussing to and the terminal is OK.

My first experience was decent; not bad not enjoyable. This airport is very confusing and cumbersome to navigate and the staff is not very approachable. The train system is a good addition though. Not much to do here if you have a long layover. Inadequate dining options and it is hell to find an electric outlet for charging needs. Some bathrooms are very dirty. The second time around this airport made my life a living hell. I had been traveling for almost 30 hours and when I landed here I was greeted by a long immigration line. Took almost an hour and a half to clear immigration all the while putting up with the extremely rude and seemingly arrogant staff. You get treated like vermin here. Baggage claim was smooth and I was happy to get out of the airport.

The check in itself was makeshift with half a dozen tee shirt clad youths throwing bags onto trolleys once finally checked in. Then another queue for security. Few trays to put things in when you got to the departure area (4 gates) it was completely full. I suspect there were at least a thousand people in a room designed for 200.

I never understand why one has to take the stairs up one floor only to take them right back down again - this is the case in Tashkent transit lounge. You get bussed there when your plane lands - one bus to arrivals and one bus to transit. First of all there are no signs when you get upstairs. People do not understand where they should go so they typically just stop there. To be let into the actual lounge the passport gets examined (in my case - Swedish passport - very thoroughly) and boarding card stamped twice (another stamp is added on the way out later on). There are no seats to talk about. They cram about 600 people in the lounge and there are about 50 seats somewhere. Very uncomfortable at that. Loudspeaker calls are unintelligible. The airport staff runs around shouting the next departure. Do not fall asleep you will not be awakened to catch your flight. That said if you're late you will still be hauled away to the plane just as long as it's still on the ground. The lounge is supposedly non-smoking however not all are able to read English and obviously ignore or do not understand the non-smoking sign and chug happily away like steam engines.

It is not as bad as the posters say. On the other hand connections beyond the airport leave much to be desired. The NY planning authorities have not - despite decades of service by the airport - begun to even plan to have a rail transit connection to either Manhattan the area rapid transit or the commuter rail lines. All of this is due to kowtowing to the residents of a nearby neighbourhood. A rail connection would be simple: just add an elevated line above the expressway from an existing elevated transit line about three miles from the airport. Yet bureaucracy and politicians' fear of that neighbourhood (Steinway section of Astoria to anyone out there familiar with Queens neighbourhoods) have prevented taking the logical action!

However there are a few issues/problems: The toilets/bathrooms are not clearly marked on the map. The lifts to the mezzanine level are too few and far away from the gates. Due to poor lift access the food outlets are difficult to access. The pricing of the food (compared to normal KL pricing of food) is expensive. I don't understand why there are 2 security scans. The first is simple and quick (no taking out laptops and jackets etc.) but the second is more thorough (take out laptops etc). They airport staff should warn passengers about this. Security/airport staff at the security check were not helpful and attentive. I had to wait some time for the security staff to take the box I used to scan my laptop. Once at the gate there is no clear signage clearly stating which one is the boarding gate.

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,Steve Wadham,NA,2009-03-13,Travelled LHR to MIA and arrived at rear of 90 min queue for immigration late afternoon. Lucky we changed our plans 2 months earlier as a result of reading this site. We had allowed 1 hr 45 mins to change to AA flight to Cancun which was OK with airlines who allow 1 hr 35 for transfer but clearly not enough time. We therefore stayed overnight and travelled the next day. On our return flight it could not have been more different we arrived early afternoon and there were no queues at all we were through immigration in 5 mins. That was great but we will never transfer through an airport again unless we can overnight as you just don't know how long the Immigration Q will be not just in the USA but worldwide. Miami is an older airport in the BA and AA areas and reminded me of 1960's 'Thunderbirds' film settings. Real vintage stuff but it has all you need with regard to toilets and food. Passenger search was reasonably quick and no complaints there.

The Immigration transfer counters are overcrowded only 2 counters open to serve all transit passengers. Line of 30 meters long with people waiting even if you do not intend to visit the country you have to come through immigration and get a red stamp in your pass. Unnecessary. Immigration officers are unfriendly putting their stamp right in the middle of the empty passport page making it not usable any more. WiFi is only available if you have a Chinese SIM card. Very bad in other airports your flight ticket and the passport are already enough for getting 1 hour of free WiFi but not in Beijing.

As with things in India it just needs someone with a brain to sort it out. If you are in the BA club lounge stay there. The outside bars/food are overpriced. If you are a smoker go to the Celebrations bar but they will make you buy a drink first (beer £7!). How is this bar allowed given that it is a no smoking airport! Never let your credit card out of your sight as a few passengers were complaining about misuse on their prior visits. The duty-free shops are bland with US$ prices: no Indian whisky. Presumably Indian whisky is considered too downmarket! As for the repeated robotic security checks just grin and bear it: you need those stamps on your luggage tag ! As many flights leave 0230ish I found the frequent roundup by airline staff useful especially as I was nodding off.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Andy Williams,United Kingdom,2014-11-12,Terminal 1. I have just returned to the UK from Manila via Terminal 1 NAIA. I visit the Philippines 2-3 times a year and have done for several years. The last time I used this terminal was May 2014 and I honestly didn't think it could get any worse. How wrong I was! It's almost like the authorities set about doing everything they can to make it bad. On a plus side arriving at this place is not too bad. I always try to time my arrival for a Sunday afternoon which normally means immigration queues for foreigners are not to bad. Baggage reclaim slow as normal. The noise and chaos of the meeting area can be off putting for foreigners who have never been there before and I would suggest if you haven't got transport organised or are being met then walk out to the main road and get a normal passing taxi. Departing is a nightmare. The renovations continue which now means there is virtually no drop off area which causes traffic chaos. There is no clear signs to direct people. Once you have got past the initial security check just to enter the terminal the check in queues stretch from one side of the terminal to another and despite arriving over 4 hours before my flight it still took me 2 hours to check in. Terminal fee still exists so another queue followed then by another queue for immigration and then yet another security check with another queue. All in it took me 3 hours just to get from my taxi to duty free and this was at midnight when the place was quiet! Seating is still an issue as is places to get food or drinks. You can pay 650php to use the lounge upstairs which has a a smoking room constructed from plywood here is sadly probably the best seating in the house where you can enjoy a lukewarm beer and a smoke while listening to the airport announcements telling you that you are in a non-smoking airport! The departure gates are still not big enough and involve yet more queues. I unfortunately cannot avoid this place but if you can then do avoid. The aircon still doesn't work but that's the least of anyone's worries in this place!,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
dallas-fort-worth-airport,/airport-reviews/dallas-fort-worth-airport,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,A Maidment,United Kingdom,2014-08-07,After a long flight from LHR we were met with queues queues queues and unhelpful staff. Not the best impression for an international entry point for the USA. Do not even attempt to make a connecting flight with under 3 hours to spare. We had to queue 25 mins for an automatic passport check queued 20 minutes to see an immigration official then picked up luggage then queued again to someone to check our reason for visiting rechecked bags then had to clear security again (more queuing). On top of that the boarding cards from LHR didn't work so we were sent back to the American Airlines desk to be reissued new ones. Until we got to a gate staff were almost universally unhelpful (we were told by all that we had time to make our flight easily). American airlines blame the airport and take no responsibility for the systematic chaos and the airport staff apparently don't get any feedback that people are missing their flights because of the queuing. We missed our flight to SLC were put on standby for the next one late at night were booked onto one the following day in the end which was cancelled when we arrived at the airport the next morning. Not to mention last minute gate changes causing havoc and confusion for passengers. We did get to SLC in the end having been issued 5 separate lots of boarding cards. The journey back through DFW was much easier but from other reviews it sounds like our experience of entering at this airport is not unusual. Next time we will clear immigration stay overnight than tackle the internal flights the next day. Seems like the only sensible way with kids in tow.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,Hans Gross,Switzerland,2013-12-23,This time it took 2 hours instead of the usual half hour for landing and immigration. The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers.

It took 45 minutes to clear passport control the queues were as far back as the travelators. It would have been a stampede if there was a fire or any kind of incident.

No staff were coming through the queue and directing tired and frustrated passengers down to the numerous kiosks positioned by the smartgates - so no-one knew they could form different lines. Half of the kiosks seemed to reject passports which shouldn't have been rejected so it took a number of attempts again leaving painful queues. If you could successfully get the kiosk to work the smartgate then rejected some of the tickets.

At one coffee shop they even began mocking a customer (in German of course) who had the nerve to request a bag to carry a muffin with her to the plane (and what kind of airport coffee shop doesn't have containers to let you carry stuff aboard with you?)! Beyond the obvious personnel problems FRA is cursed with a horrible design that goes to extreme lengths to sort passengers into areas based on their destinations - and clearly wasn't originally designed to do so. Signage is atrocious - one sign actually had marker scrawled on it by staff to clarify just which gates were in which direction. A horror to navigate made worse by the constant fear that turning the next corner will accidentally take you outside of one border/security area and require you to pass through that whole process over again.

Logic and experience at other gateway airports indicates that bags are checked through to the final destination; even the layout of the airport supports this with the only customs facilities available at the exit; the ""connecting flight"" route offered no facility for inspection or indeed passing transit bags to the airport. Is this only for connecting passengers without luggage? I think not. As it happened my bags went astray anyhow so the problem for me was academic.

One should really work hard with travel planning to avoid going through Oslo airport - Gardermoen. Right now, my wife and I are stuck here for most of a Saturday after a 20 hour flawless travel from Indonesia. The trouble is largely related to very slow baggage handling, the fact that you must clear customs here despite going elsewhere and that there is NO service for a rapid re-check of the baggage after customs. (Like in the USA). I know how this works, but I am certain that many tourists are very confused. You should haul your luggage upstairs and essentially go through the same procedure as if your travel originated in Oslo. You have to suffer through a completely new security check etc. Everyone knows that this is a bad system, the airport officials have traveled the world ""to see how it can be done"", but nothing ever happens.

If you are tired and agitated after getting to the airport parking and getting a transfer to the Terminal and passing through security you are insulted by being forced to walk what seems forever through a parade of shops selling overpriced goods. You can't avoid it - you've to go through it. Once past that you eventually come out into the concourse where the masses are herded together to be preyed upon by the next set of vultures selling even more expensive poor value food and drink. If you make good time you wait and wait until your airline puts up the gate you are to go to - usually with Ryanair five or ten minutes before the gate is scheduled to close. All you want to do is make your way to the gate and sit and relax but you can't do it.

However immigration staff were helpful and the queue took about 45 minutes to clear.

I'd previously come into Chicago and there also was processed very sternly that was my first trip to the US and I was then unprepared for all the personal questions about how much money I had what I did for a living etc. But this was something else the official asked me 3 times if I was in the country on business in a sarcastic unpleasant manner as if he were trying to catch me out. Each time I politely told him I was on holiday. It was genuinely distressing. I'd just come off an 11 hour flight and had waited an hour in line.

The TSA officials are very efficient and courteous and the Aerotrain is also very convenient as well. Coming back is another story even though Dulles has improved. First of all are the ancient plane mates which take you to the international arrivals building but which will be used for the foreseeable future. Second even though the electronic kiosks for U.S. citizens in theory are a good idea they are complicated to use at first and you still have to hand the print out to a border security agent. Third the border security agents are extremely rude even to U.S. citizens. The agent who looked at my passport asked me where I visited which I told him and then he began grill me about why I didn't mention the other country I visited (Turkey where I only changed flights) even though I never left the airport to get my connecting flight! Fourth your luggage is routinely removed from the baggage carousel and placed in a pile without you even knowing. I made a complaint to Dulles Airport's Twitter handle and was told that the airlines are doing this and not the airport but that they would look into it.

Please beware when you are walking alone towards the Car rental offices where not much passengers roam there are 3 Police officers just outside the door after the first escalator (down) and going to the Car rental offices (up again). These Police called me and started asking me questions about my visa and travel documents on which I think is inappropriate since the immigration officials had already checked. They started asking questions on which I think it's not their job and jurisdictions don't they supposed to guard and protect the arriving passengers from potential scammers? They held me for 5 or more minutes and they refused when I asked them that they should take me to the immigration if they want to see proof of my travel documents and stuffs.

The British philosophy of security seems to be to zero in on easy targets no common sense is applied such as spending 20 minutes on a 90 year old wheelchair passenger. Lastly having to ride a train several times as well as go through security again and then sit around waiting for a gate number which might mean yet another train ride is just about the worst scenario you can devise for people who have to ride in cramped poorly air conditioned planes for perhaps 12 hours to get to Heathrow and then have to do the same to their next destination.

It may not be as new or flashy as HKG or ICN but updates and refurbishment have kept it looking fresh. Check in often busy but well organised and the airport staff friendly and helpful. Clearing security is always a pleasure at Narita - efficient and professional staff (unlike London Heathrow - where you are treated as a potential terrorist). Good choice of shops and cafes/restaurants which are good value. It may be well out of Tokyo but there is a choice of trains or buses for downtown TYO and both are of course fantastically efficient!

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,Sam Yeager,United States,2015-05-31,It is hard to believe an airport like this is allowed to operate as it does. It is clear that this airport is the result of saving money at the cost of any customer service or customer facilities. There are hardly enough seats for anyone to sit at a peak time the seats are uncomfortable and this is specifically designed this way so you will visit one of their many restaurants which also are the only places where there are any outlets to charge your devices. On top of this rude tactic to bring in customers they have their reserved area which costs 25 pounds to go in just for the time you are there which is ridiculous. There are plenty of more seats and shops near the gates however they don't inform you of which gate you are at until just before your flight time.

(Having used Stansted regularly over the past 15 years before that) I noticed a steady decline in the airport. I couldn't be dropped outside the door of the airport anymore. Forced to pay £2 for 10 mins to park in the car park just to get my bags out. I have a leg injury and wasn't pleased that I had to walk all the way up to departures. The trolleys are coin operated and having spent the last of my change already had to go without. Check in was fairly smooth and friendly but then to security. Queues were unbelievably long. The line took 30 mins to get through. I am used to traveling and had my laptop already out of the bag etc but the security woman still insisted on asking me several times if I had a laptop. Through security I went to Starbucks to get a coffee staff were exceptionally rude making it clear that you were an inconvenience to them. The duty free and shop selection is quite good but flying Ryanair I couldn't buy anything with their strict cabin baggage allowance. I was disappointed at the lack of free wifi a facility I have encountered in the majority of airports across the world. £1 for 10 mins internet is excessive I think. A long walk to the gate and a lot of bag checking and weighing by Ryanair staff more sets of stairs and I was finally onboard. Glad to be leaving the airport and the stress behind. I am very disappointed at Stansted it used to be a lovely airport to fly from. It's extremely stressful now and the customer service in general is very poor.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,G Chandler,Estonia,2015-07-18,"We had connections through this airport leaving and returning to the EU as EU citizens. Our connections were to Calgary - YYC (leaving) and to Helsinki - HEL (returning) with Air Canada being our intercontinental carrier and Lufthansa our EU carrier. We left through FRA in June and returned through FRA in mid-July 2015. The first impression we had of FRA was disorganization and inadequate information, including poor language skills by security personnel. Travellers are lost in their own struggle to get through controls and security and find their way to gates to make flights. This individualistic collection of various ""struggles"" makes for stressed and rude passengers combined with inadequately trained and uninformative airport personnel. We arrived from HEL and needed to get to the Air Canada lounge and gate in another part of the terminal. This involved a long walk to a small and overused elevator down to a sublevel with moving sidewalks, only to have to resurface to the original level via another inadequately sized elevator with passengers waiting in line or others simply giving up to use the similarly overcrowded stairs which are not unlike those in a regular office or apartment building. All in all, that experience was stressful but we had 4 hours and eventually found a place to sit and wait for our Air Canada flight to Calgary. However, with only a 1-hour connection awaiting us on our return, this did not bode well. Travellers such as ourselves who consult with Air Canada or even Lufthansa personnel will often be told that since flights are in the same terminal (Terminal 2 in this case), everything is ""close and they will certainly have more than enough time to catch connecting flights"". Nothing could be further from the truth! Be warned! Upon our return in July from Calgary going to Helsinki, the situation we had been fearing and about which we had been ""re-assured"" by Air Canada and Lufthansa personnel, was much worse than we had originally thought. Anyone with less than 2 hours to make connecting (non-Schengen, Schengen) flights should not consider Frankfurt. When we arrived in Frankfurt, automatic border control (for EU citizens) was not operational and a lady was running around trying to pursuade EU citizen passengers to use another re-entry border agent's line which was completely empty. We soon learned why more experienced passengers were avoiding that line. Border agents screamed at us for waiting a short distance behind another traveller - ""one at a time!"". There was no clearly-marked single line and no signage telling us exactly how far behind the other traveller we should stand. I ended up having to redirect my fellow passangers to a place further back, with the rude official glaring at me from the perch of his glass box. Another chaotic security control was required as was running up and down the same sets of stairs we had encountered before on our departure.

There is now only a single designated area for both pick-up and let-down which is in the new car park and is a shambles. No other airport I know of has this absurd arrangement. The upper level (departures) area was ideal and un-congested but now it is closed off completely. What a waste of infrastructure that functioned so well. The new overhead walk-way from the car park has eased the congestion caused by the old 'Zebra' crossing but one support for this walk-way is in the road underneath! That road is only 2 lanes wide but now is reduced to one just where taxis congregate. When one disembarks from a plane the air-bridge does not go to the correct floor level.

They use buses to transport you from the plane to terminal which means de-planing takes a long time.

Many conversations heard about how it was intentionally bad because they didn't want the cheap airlines but I was horrified by the number of travellers saying they would not come to Florida again - having tried both MIA and FLL and found both to be terribly organised.

There are little amenities behind the security check. The new terminal seemed to be in line with international standards however I did not see its past-security area. Terminal 1 is dated indeed but this will only really matter to regular passengers.

The staff are completely useless again typical Spanish. I especially like the need to ride on about 25 escalators or take multiple elevators up and down to get anywhere. The security check also has been very poorly designed. Putting everything into the plastic trays to then be forced to carry or hold them as the tables don't extend to the actual screening point.

The new terminal is very welcoming well planned and organised. It was good to see Irish language signs and to have a sense of arriving in a wonderfully welcoming airport. I found the use of art work and the theme of the 'gathering' to be very nice and both professional and sentimental. The airport seems to employ a lot of non-Irish people some of whom are very surly and let the airport and indeed Dublin down. The catering facilities are rather good but it is a puzzle that staff have a poor command of English. At a time of high Irish unemployment one would like to see Irish people employed rather than those with poor English and a bad attitude.

Arrival was simple – though the plane had to stop short of the jet way lower the cabin door / stairs then taxi up to the jetway (TAM uses Fokker jets). Through passport control with no issues. While waiting for the baggage to be unloaded we were “found” by a rep from the Hotel Excelsior (the $110/nt suite included pick-up & drop-off at the airport). He helped us through the customs line (though the help certainly wasn’t needed) then on to the outside world where another contact with our name awaited. I asked about money exchange (zero Guarani for tips) & the initial contact took us over to a Hertz booth where we exchanged money. Most likely not the best rate. In retrospect the first contact was probably a local minion with the ability to get through to the Customs area & pass himself off as our legitimate contact all for a little “propina” which he was not hesitant to ask for once we got to our car. For departure we left the hotel at 4:30 AM for our 6:00 AM flight arriving with just less than an hour before flight time. No problems. TAM was efficient this time (see report under SCL) and check-in was completed in 10 minutes or less. Then on to the airport tax window – to the left of the check-in counters & to the right of the entry for passport control. $25 US p/p departure tax. The lady didn’t have US dollar change so we paid $310000 Guarani – probably not a very good rate but it allowed us to leave the country with essentially zero local currency. Through the departure doors & the lady immediately to the left verifies you’ve paid your taxes & stamps the receipt. Then to the immigration officer. Again no problems. In the gate area with 30 minutes to spare. Harp music playing free drinks (coffee soda water) at a little TAM kiosk. Restrooms are difficult to find – to the right of gate 2.

After going through immigration and customs I felt like I was in an aquarium: there were probably about 1000 people standing all around - including above - looking down on the arriving passengers. Once outside the pick-up/drop-off area was totally chaotic and traffic barely moved. Unlike other international airports I've been to arrivals and departures were in the same place.

Nobody was on hand to tell us it would be anything like this far (I'm mildly mobility impaired and have a limit of about 10 minutes for walking - had I known I might have been able to pace it better). Only one toilet passed in all this time which was a tiny '2 seater' with a big queue and in a poor state so just had to persevere. Usually I use T5 last time 27th June and next time 8th July which is generally marginally cleaner but also involves yomping huge distances gates which are 20 minutes away by the underground transit but only announced at the last moment and glacially slow queues for security and immigration where we are all treated like cattle. Even the escalators are slow. The one thing they have lots of is highly priced 'duty free' shops. Don't expect any bargains - it's like looking at sales on Bond Street: 10% off doesn't really help when the thing was marked up 50% in the first place. Few airports are fun but this really gives a poor impression of this country to visitors. Staff can make a huge difference - every now and then I meet someone helpful (like BA's Mr Law who helped me last month when my daughter was flying out to China from T5 and got downgraded by BA despite a full fare ticket) and would encourage them all (security staff immigration airline and service providers) just please to try to treat people as they would want their visiting granny to be treated.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

First we checked in using the awesome virtual checkin machines. This went great. It was quick and easy to do. Then we had to try and find the place to check our bags. Well that was a different story. We asked the lady who was supervising the check in machines and she just sort of pointed in a random direction and said ""over there"". Well over there turned out to be an area a quarter of a mile down the corridor which we found more by accident than because the signage was helpful. When we arrived in this area they were filtering people through by their flight times. The area was way too small to hold the number of people who were coming through. There was a lot of yelling and pushing by the staff. They kept announcing the flight times they were taking and when no one was coming to the front the only person who was filtering people through would wander away to yell the info to the end of the line. 90% of the time no one there was waiting for that time. So the line up just kept getting bigger and bigger. They managed to create a bottleneck that was just ridiculous. We waited in this area for over an hour and 20 minutes before they would let us check our bags and go through to customs. We arrived at the airport as instructed 3 hours before flight time. This should have given us enough time to check in, grab breakfast and relax before boarding. Instead we had to rush just to make our plane. I'm still not sure why they were filtering people through this remote area. When we finally got let through we had to walk back to basically where we started, another quarter mile. For anyone with mobility issues this would be cruel. When we got to the next area there was nobody there but there were about 500 hundred of us that got let through at the same time because almost everyone in the holding area was waiting for an 8:45 flight. So again we had a bottleneck that took forever to get through. When we finally finished we barely made the boarding of our flight. We were unable to grab food.

On landing the queues to get through passport control were totally unacceptable. Five or six planes landed at once and only about 3 desks open. Took one and a half hours from when we got off plane to actually boarding the bus to hotel. One couple we met on holiday with 4 children waited two and a half hours! There was also no air conditioning which made the heat unbearable. On the way back our plane was delayed by over an hour due to the mismanagement of this airport. The pilot explained that we had missed our slot due to the cases being loaded too late and as we were already on the plane we just had to sit and wait. Our Tunisian friend said that the airport is always like this and that he has quite often complained. It is absolutely horrendous total unorganised chaos. p.s.

The immigration staff did all that they could to reduce delays by checking forms in the line and correcting them rather than making people go to the back of the line and fill the forms in again and directing people to the US citizen desks once these were empty. This is more than can be said at many east coast airports.

Processing was fairly quick although the officer was chewing gum looked bored and didn't say anything! Why don't they do what other airports do and just have one queue? Luggage was already on the conveyor. Changed money before leaving the airport at what turned out to be quite reasonable rates. Return flight two weeks later at same time of day - long queues for Security but moved reasonably quickly and staff all seemed cheerful (good English skills).

glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,J Bradley,NA,2009-01-06,Over the last couple of years the standards at Prestwick seem to have fallen to match those of the major no frills airline which supplies it with most of its business. From its shabby toilet facilities with cracked wash hand basins broken taps and peeling wall paint to the surly and rude security staff we encountered it provided a totally disappointing travel experience. On arrival at the airport we had to negotiate a ridiculously awkward pair of wooden swing doors at the entrance as none of the automatic doors appeared to be in working order. On to security who seemed genuinely annoyed that people were getting around the one small carry on bag rule by cramming hand bags etc into other bags or more ludicrously as the guy in front of me did by wearing three jackets. It is the only airport I have been through in the last 6 months which applies such a policy. The departure lounge was crammed with people and appears unable to cope with boarding more than one flight at a time. Their attempt to board three flights simultaneously when we were there descended into farce with people struggling to even reach the queue for their departure gate due to the crowds and confusion. My advice would be to stay landside as long as possible the dining and drinking area there is much more spacious and comfortable. In the years immediately following its revival Prestwick was a good airport and did what it did well. Whilst it may be content now to cater only to budget and seasonal charter airline business it should at least make an attempt to present itself as a reasonably comfortable place to spend a couple of hours rather than just a soul-less transit station,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Airport continues to be efficient and pleasant to use on departure but arrivals are a little hit-and-miss: airbridges are still rarely used and waiting times in buses can be a little on the lengthy side. Security and immigration were cleared quickly on all occasions. Baggage reclaim tends to be rather slow. Transiting can be awkward when arriving from abroad - the signs seem to indicate the direction which passengers should go but this leads you to security then the main part of the terminal and not to passport control - the correct way to transit is to follow the signs which say ""passport control"" and only then to clear security but the signage is confusing! This is not an issue when arriving from another Polish airport however. I have been caught out twice like this and it is not due to language issues. As transit security generally consists of only one X-ray machine pax arriving in a full or widebody aircraft need to ensure that they have plenty of time to make connections. Security are firm but polite and fair and ground staff are fine. The terminal continues to maintain good hygiene standards - cleaners seem to be ubiquitous.",NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

The boarding process at Terminal 3 is to say the least chaotic. Especially if your flight involves being bussed from the terminal to where your plane is parked and because of this (notwithstanding the tight connection times between a lot of Etihad flights) they never seem to leave on time. Facilities do leave a lot to be desired. With planned construction of a new terminal building you hope that issues such as being bussed to and from terminals (abnormal in today's era of international airports) and chaotic boarding are ironed out.

nassau-airport,/airport-reviews/nassau-airport,Nassau Airport customer review,Jamal Wells,NA,2005-12-05,Nassau airport is fully air conditioned and endures long lines because of The US pre-clearance facilities. Peak hours 11am - 2pm. Security will be stricter than most other airports in the world because your getting pre-cleared there. Many people don't fully understand that. There are multiple bathrooms and little snack shops downstairs at check-in. However only 1 restaurant 1 bar 1 gift shop and bathrooms upstairs. The air condition was i believed damaged during the passing of a hurricane and subsequently it malfunctioned 1 day. A new one has long since installed. The airport is airconditioned throughout every terminal and section. Departures - There are no Bahamian Customs or Immigration for departure. Any checks you stop to strictly involves the US Customs and Immigration. So complaining about long lines have nothing at all to do with the Country. If the agents feel it necessary they will stop and further question you. Arrivals - Immigration is smooth with up to 10 stations opened. The problem - many people incorrectly or don't fill out the Immigration card causing hold ups on the lines. Customs is a breeze for any tourist.

Should have done this before we travelled. Unbelievably reviews written in 2012 could have been ones that we experienced in September 2014! Really dreadful airport. The queues were horrendous check in didn't open until 2 hours before flight due to leave but even though people had been in the airport queuing for 1 hour before check in opened it still took us until 15 minutes before the plane was due to leave to get our boarding passes. The queue for EasyJet was the entire length of the airport! Last call for our plane was made and we were still only half way down this queue. Many signs around the airport blaming the Italian government for the hold-ups but the problem was the queues which could have been sorted if there was enough staff on duty! Only 2 staff on duty checking in 3 EasyJet flights to Paris Gatwick and Perugia - easy to work out the total number of passengers standing in line for hours with no Easy Jet staff to speak to or help. And then final annoyance check in staff desk sent us to wrong gate No 28 instead of No 31! Gate 28 was downstairs no 31 upstairs - for so many passengers rushing to get to the gate this was not well received! Toilets dirty no toilet rolls and in one no water for hand washing.

Bought water and soft drinks plus two sandwiches. Though expensive (13 to 15 zlotys each) the food was delicious. We departed on time. Bottom line no drama! We travel a lot and have been through different situations. And Etiuda was by far not the worst. Taking into account what we saved by flying Norwegian I found the terminal ok.

Food selection in this terminal was horrible. I couldn't believe it as I pictured JFK to be a busy international airport with lots of options. Last month I had flown into Atlanta and that airport is above and beyond what I experienced at terminal B at JFK. I had to walk about 20 minutes until I found a customer service desk. I do have to say when arriving at JFK I went right through immigration. There were tons and tons of lines open and even though there were a lot of other people flying in I waited no more than 5 minutes to be attended by the custom agent. Luggage also came in fairly fast and that's why I thought this airport was much better as I was told horror stories about the immigration queue there but really it was a breeze.

If I'd left it any later I'd have been queuing for Departures for more than the 55 minutes it took me and wouldn't even have had time for a quick snack.

Most people seemed to be flying to European destinations and were bemused by the chaos.

Restaurant facilities are under criticism. Bad and over-priced food served by ignorant staff. None of the staff I encountered anywhere in the airport wanted to be there and this was reflected in the level of courtesy given. The staff at the information desk were by far the most ignorant! Flying out from T2 a week later the situation was only made better by a larger selection of food outlets. Security was a nightmare.

First notice. Less and less airlines are allowed for in-town check-in. Less and less airlies provide free rail transfer. The airport itself remains very well organised clean and easy to navigate through. Two serious minuses. Most of the airlines haven't heard about line management. It causes situations like the one I was in. My flight was about to leave in 55 minutes. Despite being checked in online i should stay in regular line because they don't have bag drop-off desks. When having being in the line for about 20 minutes (the queue was about 35 people) I've decided to take a look at the other side of the isle of desks and found there three working check-in desks with nobody lining up. Would be very helpful to have line manager there. Immigration on departure was slow and not very polite. Departure area after security is full of good cafes and shops but very overpriced.

Situated some 45 km out of town you can either use the SAS Flybussen (14 euros o/w) or train (20euros o/w) neither of which are cheap. I found it a bit odd that BA check-in desks were a bit of a free-for-all and that there was no seperate Club Europe desk. However if you've hand luggage only there are several self check-inmachines but you need to have the credit card used for the ticket purchase. A modest but comfortable BA Terraces lounge is available after security check but I guarantee you will go round in circles looking for it. Located on the domestic departures side it is very poorly signposted as the lounge attendant has probably been told 100s of times. Take the spiral staircase on your left after security and continue to the end of the corridor. DO NOT go to international departures after security as you won't be allowed to step back into domestic even though there's no barrier between the two. Instead you will have to exit at gate 42 go thru customs and back into the departures hall - really annoying.

santiago-de-chile-airport,/airport-reviews/santiago-de-chile-airport,Santiago De Chile Airport customer review,S Dale Hancock,NA,2006-01-20,Arrived at Santiago after an all-nighter on Delta. Arrivals was very simple – US citizens veered to the left (at least in the terminal we arrived in) just before immigration to pay the $100US reciprocity fee. The booths were clearly marked and the lines went very quickly. They will staple a receipt in your passport good for the life of the passport. Immigration followed also very efficient. We exchanged $100US for Chilean pesos before we left the secure area. A subsequent ATM withdrawl showed we had paid a premium of about 3 ½%. Certainly not a big deal. Next we picked up our bag & exited customs. All luggage including carry-on was x-rayed & you turn the customs declaration form in as you pick up your freshly x-rayed bags. We probably took 20 minutes from the time we left the plane until we were in the free world including making the reciprocity payment passport control money exchange luggage pick-up & customs. Once outside it was a hectic mess. Everybody & their little brother wants you to arrange a taxi through them. We picked an official-looking fellow with a portable radio and agreed upon $25 US to the Marriott. There was no need to have exchanged money at the airport – the cab driver was happy to get the $27US I gave him. The exchange rate at the Marriott appeared to be exactly the same as at the airport. Departing was a little different. My wife went ahead and the bellman put our bag in the “hotel taxi”. I asked how much & was told $40000 (about $80US). I said no way took the bag out of the trunk & said I just wanted a regular taxi & pointed to one on the street. The bellman said it would cost $50000 to the airport. I said no way I’d only paid $12000 when I arrived. A little Spanish between the parties and I was offered the hotel taxi (down-scale limo?) for $16000 (about $32US). Okay. Based on posts here and other places we elected to get to the airport about 3 hours ahead of flight time. Good choice though this will probably not apply to you. We booked our South America itinerary (SCL-ASU-MVD-EZE-GIG) through TAM for $1253 (two tickets) in Miami. We had called 4 times in the previous 3 months to make sure there would be no issues & every time we were told the tickets were electronic & all we had to do was give them the number at the ticket counter. Don’t know why we were suspicious but it was an issue. After 2:45 screwing around with every TAM rep in the building and calling Miami twice we finally got paper tickets issued. TAM doesn’t use e-tickets throughout most of S.A. I was perhaps most perturbed when the TAM manager came down & said it was our fault because the “agency” issued the tickets incorrectly. The “agency” was TAM. He finally understood & I was happy to tell him exactly what I thought of his professionalism. Other than TAM related issues the departure was fine: about 10 minutes to go through a courteous immigration control plenty of duty free shops (though we didn’t have time to even stop for a bathroom break) and it appeared there was plenty of seating. Couldn’t tell about eating places – again because of TAM. Overall a very good airport experience and a rather poor airline experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,V Brown,United Kingdom,2013-07-07,I have long been of the opinion that Stansted has no concept of customer care. The whole place seems vaguely grubby staff are frequently rude and security is a nightmare. However dropping off or picking up passengers was always fairly simple. To drop off you drove up to the terminal your passengers got out (under cover) you drove out. To pick up you drove to the pick-up zone your passengers got in you drove out. Not any more. The whole thing has become shambolic. This morning I drove my husband to Stansted with the objective of dropping him off at 5 am for a 6.30 am flight where he had already checked in online but we were allowing at least an hour for him to get through security (see earlier comment about security). Arrived at 5 am discovered you could no longer drive up to the terminal and then took another 10 minutes to get to the so-called drop-off area where we were confronted by vehicles in the parking areas on both sides and also in the central lane which explained why there was a traffic queue trying to get into the drop-off area in the first place. As there was absolutely no chance of parking properly my husband got out and then wended his way through the melee. Fortunately he had no luggage to impede him. If the drop-off zone was properly sign-posted perhaps the log jam in the first lane would not occur but at the same time you cannot blame people for wanting to be as close as possible to what is anyway the far end of the terminal building. This morning was dry and warm so not a problem but in inclement weather with luggage? I wonder whether the designers of this chaos have ever tried it out as paying customers. In my book Stansted has gone from mediocre to completely shambolic.,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

Do not park in the first 5 or 6 bays on the left hand side after the disabled bays these are 15 min bays which should be separate from main car park. These bays apart from one were full I backed into that space and did not see the sign came back 3 days later to find £80 parking fines on all vehicles in these bays. If you pay within 7 days its reduced to £55 not many people holiday less than a week so the con costs the full £80.

taipei-taoyuan-airport,/airport-reviews/taipei-taoyuan-airport,Taipei Airport customer review,J Tung,United Kingdom,2012-06-06,Last time I used TPE airport was 2 years ago. I tend to use the old terminal 1 and was very disappointed by the facilities. Arrived at the end of May this year the arrival hall was just day from being handed back from the renovation. The place is dirty dusty and has no soul. Its just like a temporary bus station. The immigration process was perhaps the best in the world. There was no queue and the immigration officers were extremely friendly and approachable. The luggage as usual didn't come out quick enough considering how empty the airport was. Then its a hassle to get to the taxi rank – again it had the feeling of a temporary bus station rather than an international airport at a capital city. Leaving the airport was another experience. I assume that the check-in area has been refurbished and the lighting was great. It might have difficulty dealing with large quantity of passenger though as the luggage belt at the check in area wasn't properly designed. After checking in I proceed to the immigration on the second floor. Again the wall and ceiling was covered by plastic for the renovation. Immigration and security again was no hassle. Once I passed the security I could feel the difference of a new airport – beautiful wall with art work nice duty free area with helpful staff a new small library plenty of plants on the wall and super deluxe toilets. Despite the low ceiling the airport was spacious and spotless and its so much better than other big airports. Free Wifi worked perfectly!,NA,NA,NA,7,5,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Its hard to even find decent snacks and sandwiches to bring on the flight. The lines are also often long for the food places. The restaurants close at 10-11pm so if you have a very late (or early) flight don't count on getting any food.

Memories of past experiences with post-soviet airports are all too clear. They've made the effort its evident but its still no where near the standards of 'world hubs'. If there's one thing that's hit me over the years at this airport its the sheer over-crowding probably because everyone's moved from Sheremtyevo. Anyway they still have the annoying scheme of scanning the baggage before you even enter the building. Im all up for security but surely this is crossing the line. Its a job weaving your way through the terminal with heavy baggage endless numbers of people explainable by the fact we were travelling in the winter season back to London. No electronic check-in scheme so there was a long queue. Surprisingly clean airport still with the aroma of cigarettes but the interior looks modern enough. Immigration very swift security was average. Busy busy busy is all I can say afterwards. There's the lack of those wide open walking areas or rest areas with huge ceilings that you get in 5-star airports in Asia. We found it hard to find anywhere to eat although when we did it was ridiculously expensive! Lack of seats duty-free shops also very expensive. There's no doubt that Moscow has made great strides since the Soviet and Post-soviet era but its still miles off the 5-star spectrum.

venice-treviso-airport,/airport-reviews/venice-treviso-airport,Venice Treviso Airport customer review,E Armstrong,United Kingdom,2010-08-01,I have just returned from a 22 hour delay at Treviso Airport. The flight to Treviso and arrival was absolutely fine but on arriving for the return flight the queues to check in were over an hour long. There was hardly any information on the screens as to flights and once through passport control we found out our flight was delayed indefinitely. Eventually after waiting for over 5 hours without any news (1.30am the next morning) we were told that our flight was rescheduled for the morning. The toilets and general cleanliness of the building were disgusting by this time. We went back through to find out information about where to stay but there was only one member of staff their to help 150 passengers. Everyone was told to sleep on the airport floor or find their own accommodation for the night. (This was very difficult at now 2am in the morning.) We were told to return at 7am the next morning for the rescheduled flight at 9am. Again everyone queued up for over an hour went through security then we were told the flight would now be rescheduled to 5pm. Many people went back through and complained but airport staff were rude and unhelpful and would not help anyone to change flights or find an alternative way back. We were given food vouchers by Ryan Air of the value of 5 euros every 3 hours. However there was only one cafe in the departure lounge. In this cafe they refused to let you spend the voucher on any food you wanted - you had to have a bottle of water and a specially made up panini. These were stale and very unpleasant. They cafe had much better food but would not let any people with vouchers use them for this. After three meals of paninis we complained and were eventually allowed a slice of pizza but still not allowed salad or fruit. The airport was very stuffy and hot the toilets were unclean and the staff were very rude. The flight eventually left but security was dreadful - anyone could have boarded our flight and passports were not even checked. I would strongly advise anyone traveling to this airport to cancel their flights and readjust their itinerary.

new-york-jfk-airport,/airport-reviews/new-york-jfk-airport,New York JFK Airport customer review,Gil Cureau,United States,2011-09-19,Prior to my wife and I going to Europe I knew we would be flying back to the US via JFK instead of ATL which we originally planned. We arrived at JFK from Rome (FCO) via Delta and I was surprised. Everything went smoothly from passport control retrieving our luggage and re-checking to going through security again. Employees were helpful and courteous. However given the layout of the airport and the heavy volume of passengers this airport handles things do have the potential to go south in a second. Additionally NYC was not my destination so I did not have to rent a car or take a taxi to Manhattan. Had I done these things maybe my review would be a bit different. I will say the layout of the airport needs to be updated and the food choices could be improved. However we waited for our connecting flight in another part of terminal 4 (I believe Delta gate 23) There were a few decent places to grab a bite to eat or grab a beer. You are not going to get the amenities that you would at the Atlanta or similar airports but this isn't the worst airport either.

However there were easily 30 counters open in the non-US-citizen section. So the wait time for me was about 20 minutes. The agents at passport control were all very friendly and welcoming. This gave the airport a 5-star welcoming experience. However I am rating at 4-stars because the Air-Train stopped working for a while and I got shoved into the train going the opposite side of where I wanted to go. As a result missed Amtrak connection.

In the past  if you had a re-entry permit you could line up with the Japanese people at the immigration counter. That system was very good. However they changed the system recently. On my last trip from Vietnam there was 7 lines for Japanese 4 for tourists and 1 for immigrants (re-entry permit holders). As I was not aware of the new system my first reaction was to queue with the Japanese people but big mistake... I was sent to this huge line that was for the immigrants only. I have always loved Japan and unlike many foreigners I have never had any problems in Japan. But after queuing for a good hour and seeing that the only remaining line was ours I felt quite insulted. It was clear that Japanese were to be first second tourist and finally immigrants. A few people shouted while they were queuing as the situation was outrageous. All the counters were empty but they refused to let us go to the empty counters.

We arrived two hours before our flight which we assumed would be ample time but alarm bells began to ring when we saw massive queues everywhere both outside and inside the terminal. When we found the check in desk although the queue was not that long the check in person took a ridiculous amount of time to deal with each party so it took ages to reach the front of the queue. We then discovered that we had to join another queue to have the bags x- rayed! After that we queued again to get through security and this was a free for all with no system at all and the staff again were really slow and didn't seem to care at all. By the time we finally reached the gate the whole process had taken over one and a half hours! Had we arrived at the airport much later we easily could have missed our flight altogether! The airport clearly neither has the staff nor the capacity to deal with the amount of traffic it receives and is a shambles more akin to airports of the 1960's. This experience means we are very unlikely to ever visit Crete again and this is a shame as the island has much to offer.

bordeaux-airport,/airport-reviews/bordeaux-airport,Bordeaux Airport customer review,Mike Saunders,United Kingdom,2014-08-07,Avoid this place-it looks like an abattoir from the outside. Inside the cattle theme continues as you are herded around like farm animals particularly at the gate where you have to wait in a sort of holding pen rather than being allowed to sit down. The queues were awful. The bag drop was awful. There was not enough space in the departure lounge. Sandwiches cost 6 Euros a coke 7 Euros. Worst of all were photographs of groups of people around the place wearing T shirts spelling out BILLI - as if they had something to be proud of! They couldn't even bring themselves to give it a proper name like 'terminal 2'. The only good thing I can say about it was that it made the easyjet flight seem luxurious. I will do my best to avoid this airport in the future - particularly if I have kids with me.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
vienna-airport,/airport-reviews/vienna-airport,Vienna Airport customer review,Gavin Burns,Australia,2010-05-29,The boarding lounges are far too small. Earlier this year we boarded a full 777-200 flight to Narita and the gate was shoulder to shoulder-in fact security had to stop screening passengers as there was physically no more room for any more passengers to stand.

charlotte-airport,/airport-reviews/charlotte-airport,Charlotte Airport customer review,J Edvardsson,NA,2008-01-13,I agree with the other reviewers about the Charlotte airport. It's a gem once you get inside. However if you are returning with a rental car I suggest you give yourself plenty of time. The rental return signage is the worst I've seen in 20 years of air travel. I've been there 5 times and it still takes me a extra time (and a u-turn or two) to find the rental car lot (I use Hertz but they all have the same problem). If you're an airport manager or city planner for Charlotte please see what you can do to improve this one glaring defect. Oh and by the way this Hertz airport rental operation is not the smoothest either. They use one or two big shuttle buses so the wait for a pick-up can be long. On the inbound they didn't have my car ready for me although my arrival was on time (and they forgot the nav system). On the return the bus driver almost ran over me when I tried to board the bus. I'm not kidding. Happy travels.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,Chutima Googijwatana,Thailand,2015-04-19,I and my colleagues went to New Zealand together and transited at Sydney Airport during Thai New Year Holiday. There were so many tour groups in the queue. At first we were waiting in a different line but after a while the flux of the tour group crowd were pushing us to the back. That wasn't the worst thing airport staff seem not bother managing the tour groups the small groups or individual travelers. There were bunches of individual travelers trying to cut the line with the reason that their flight was boarding. We were almost late for boarding our flight. We finally had to ask the Officer to help us with the queue when we had only 10 minutes left before boarding time but the Officers didn't bother to do anything. I suggest the airport looks at managing the queuing system to at least separate the lines by the group size of travelers and the next flight time.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

If you are flying low cost airlines there is a direct train (not as frequent and does feel like an airport express although for the price one shouldn't complain).

You can't drop off/pick up near the terminal without paying a fortune there is a free area but not well sign-posted if you don't know it in advance you end up paying. The road that separates all the bus and paid parking zones in a dangerous joke. The new scanning machines into security do keep queues down until you get in there and most x-ray machines aren't open and staff are rude as usual not enough chairs to put all your stuff back on after. The departure lounge is too small it looks like a refugee camp most of the time less shops more chairs please and the info screens are too small. On arrivals the passport control area is a joke. The other day there was one member of staff to meet all passengers off the tram and direct everyone possible to automated machines which she then had to supervise. There are only 5 machines one wasn't working and the rest rejected on average 50%. Forget arriving on a non EU passport. My girlfriend is American with UK rights and had to queue for 35 mins just to get to see someone who asked no questions at all.

Very efficient immigration very quick baggage service very helpful security staff. The airport doesnt look overcrowded I would even say the opposite: it's very calm and tranquil place. Very unusual for the airport of such a scale and passenger volume. Railway station is underground and easy to reach. Some security procedures may seem strange. For example arriving to the airport by bus or taxi you're stopped by the road police at the check point before the airport and asked for documents so don't put it to baggage which is not with you in the cabin of the bus. Otherwise you're asked to find you bag in the hold and present your passport which is actually checked not very thoroughly (mine was taken and looked at upside down). Some minuses of this airport: after 9pm nothing works there. No food outlets no cafes no bars are open. Buildings become deserted and even information desks are empty. However special telephones for information service are available and calls are responded. Terminal 1 layout is very confusing and not clearly mapped and signposted. I've spent good 20 minutes trying to find post office. Toilets landside were not clean and even more I noticed some insects there. Very unpleasant and strange for this airport. Airside food and duty free facilities are limited I found a single coffee outlet open and noon after security. It was overcrowded. All in all a good airport. Functional and comfortable.

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,J Kandiah,Australia,2010-11-17,Perth Airport is a small international airport by any terms but the increasing air traffic in the last few years had caused the airport to struggle when it comes to peak periods. To get the best of going through the procedures when departing make sure you arrive on time then there will be the least hassle. Check-in during weekday afternoons when Malaysia Singapore and Qantas all depart within 20-30 minutes within each other can be a hassle but it always done without fuss. The same goes with immigration and security procedures have improved efficient-wise in the last few years. The downsides are that food and parking are way overpriced. Arrivals is a different story immigration queues are acceptable (even better if you're an Australian passport holder) and so is baggage reclaim but if you have something to declare with customs especially during peak hour you're looking at a wait of up to an hour! Overall it is an okay airport but could be improved immensely and with the master plan that Perth Airport is currently implementing these issues will hopefully be sorted out.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Was there over 90 minutes before the flight but still had to be jumped ahead by a member of staff as it was nearly time to board. To top it all when I got to the bag drop desk the lady automatically printed off a new boarding pass and luggage tag so no wonder the queue was moving so slowly. The security check was more queuing. Can't comment on any airport facilities as there was no time to use them! The shops and cafes must be for people who miss their flight due to the inefficient check-in and security procedures.

When I arrived at the security line about 6 or 7 people were in front of me and it took 15 minutes to get through. They now open and search every bag and I had a pat down search because I set off the alarm even though I had less metal on me than I have had at any airport before (glasses wedding ring and trouser clasp and zipper were all the metal I could think of). I originally had 1 hour 50 minutes scheduled between flights at Frankfurt but that was cut to 1 hour because of weather delays. I almost missed my flight and now I will try to never have less than 3 hours scheduled for Frankfurt. For those who have not connected through Frankfurt on their way to the U.S. you do not need to claim you checked bags in Frankfurt they just go onto the next plane. But you will need to go through security and a passport check on your way from a regional flight to the US. flight. You also are carried by shuttle from your regional plane (at least for some) to the terminal so everyone waits for the last person.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,Simon Manning,United Kingdom,2014-07-03,"Arrived into LGW NT at 01.00 Sat morning an hour and a half late. Despite being late had to wait 15-20 mins for ground staff to arrive. Then after winding our way around tatty corridors arrived at passport control to find it bursting at the seams. Almost an hour later went to get the bags and had to wait a further 20 mins before they arrived. All in all it took over 2 hours to get out of the place. Welcome to Britain in 2014. Compare that to Hong Kong where I've parked on the furthest stand from immigration passed through the airport onto the Airport Express and been in Central in under an hour. I've also been to 3rd world countries where the experience has been far better. When are people with some responsibility going to admit that the Airport is either badly run badly managed under funded over capacity or any one of a dozen more things that are probably also contributory factors? The only saving grace was that at 3 in the morning the M23 and M25 were quiet. Unless people in high places take some bold decisions that put the country first and stop pandering to various minority groups that swing their votes sadly nothing is going to happen and people forced to use this sorry excuse for an airport will see no change.

Ryanair bag drop was a breeze so we set off through security which was not too painful. For those who haven't seen it you are then led through a gleaming brightly lit and literally sparkling (the floor) shopping experience. This ends in a vast dimly lit 'herding shed' where hundreds of passengers were waiting for their flight to be called (note that the toilets at the end of this shed are new and immaculate). The food outlets adjacent to this area were also overcrowded (there aren't any in the shopping mall). On our return landing at 12.35 on a Tuesday the shuttle train was like the London underground in the rush hour and the immigration hall was as described by many previous reviewers.

dusseldorf-airport,/airport-reviews/dusseldorf-airport,Dusseldorf Airport customer review,B Wireman,Thailand,2015-04-22,As I have family in the region I have used the airport at least 30 times within the last 20 years. Comparing to Frankfurt this airport does not cut it for me. Coming in by train with heavy luggage many times the moving staircase at the station did not work which in course caused 50 or more people waiting to use the only elevator available to get to the sky train station finally bringing you to the actual airport. No baggage carts available at the station nor other than in Frankfurt check in facilities right at the station. 5 or 6 times the sky train did not work and substitute transport by bus was arranged. Again a real hassle if you travel with heavy luggage. First spot to find a luggage cart is only to be found after the moving staircase down at the actual airport and that only if you walk out of the airport and pay 2 euros. Hence while also in FRA you have to pay for luggage carts it does not reflect any international standard. One repeating deficiency is the security personnel (not Federal Police but private contractors) after immigration. While immigration is very professional fast and friendly the security staff are while obviously effective very unfriendly in their with no doubts not easy job. I do not expect any entertainment or similar while passing security but the words please and thank you are considered basic respect and education. I have to point out that I have never been directly offended or treated unfair by any means but it very much looks like the contracted security company does not even require a basic education for their staff and hires out of the long unemployment lines just about anyone with a clean police record regardless of ability to deal with the public and/or paying passengers.,NA,NA,NA,4,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

beauvais-airport,/airport-reviews/beauvais-airport,Beauvais Airport customer review,G McDonagh,NA,2007-04-19,"As a family we have used Beauvais a number ot times during the past few years and have seen the changes that this airport has had over this time frame. When we used it first I thought that it was a great airport with the fact that the plane comes right up to the door and the luggage was there as soon as you arrived at the pickup point and you were away within 20 mins of arriving. The departure check in was also a dream and you could live with the ""tent"". Having just arrived back from our most recent trip I have now changed my mind. The airport is now a lot busier with more flights arriving and departing and quite frankly it is not geared up to handle the situation it finds itself in. The problem starts as soon as you arrive. The arrival area is quite small and the luggage conveyor is also quite small. Flights are nearly full and 100-150 people trying to get in to get their bags makes it quite tight. The conveyor soon fills up and with the short distance of travel before bags start to come around again leads to a lot of stopping and starting of the belt. On this occasion it did not effect us as we were in no hurry out of the airport as we were were staying in a local hotel (which was prebooked) for the night before heading on in the morning. The car hire pick up point is fine and we had no problems. This is the third or fourth time that we have picked up a hire car and have never had any problem. One point could be that all the car hire offices with the exception of Hertz close before the last flights arrive so you are limited to which company you can use if you arrive late. The departure hall is also very small with no information as to which check in gate that your flight will be at apart from the screens that are behind each desk which do not display any info until the flight is actually checking in. With the lines of passengers checking in for other flights this leads to mad scrambles from where you may have managed to find a seat (Which are not exactually in plentiful supply for the amount of people) to where your flight eventually checks in. The problem is the depth of the actual hall. The distance from the desk to the window means that the queue tends to turn down along the hall where it gets caugh up with the queue from the desk beside it. After you have checked in you need join the queue to go through the security check. This you may feel is the same at every airport and is quite necessary and I do not have a problem with the check in itself. The problem is that at Beauvais there are not enough machines for the volumn of people passing through and also the area in which these checks are carried out is also quite small which leads to the large queue forming behind this. Having got through this you arrive in to the ""new departure gates"". This area still has no information regarding the particular gate that you will eventually board your plane until it actually opens for boarding. People start to queue where the think the flight will board only to find that they are at the wrong gate and another mad rust starts to get to the correct gate . Seeing as the gates are so close and when pass through the gate you walk to the plane how difficult would it be to put the information up at the gate before the flight arrives so people as least have a chance of being in the right area. If you are traveling with Ryanair book the priority boarding option. It cuts out any messing around as you do not have to join the mad scramble to try to get near the front of the queue for getting on the plane. Ok if you are traveling alone but with children you want to get seats together. Familys with children no longer get priority when boarding the flights so you could end up being split up if you are unluckly to be further down the queue for boarding. The facilities in this ""new area"" leave a lot to be desired. The gents toilet was in need of a good clean to the point that I would be reluctant to let the children use it. The cost at the ""cafe"" inside the departure area is a complete rip off and now that you cannot bring any thing through the security gate you are at their mercy. €3:90 for a small bottle of coke and not much cheaper for a ""large coffee"" which is in fact a slightly bigger then normal paper cut which is not even full. ( I would hate to see a small cup). Pretty negative feed back you may feel. In saying all above I would still use Beauvais again as it is a means to an end and the flights are quite cheap compared to other carriers but be prepared for what you get when you arrive.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,B Josef,United Arab Emirates,2013-10-22,This airport is a joke for all the tall claims Qatar Airways or their ads make. The Airport is a disaster starting with the longest bus ride from the plane to the Terminal (at time waiting at the door of the plane as the Bus has not yet found its way to us). Once you get to the terminal things get worse. There are two or three outlets where you can buy food. The selection is rubbish service is shabby. The prices are over the top. The available lounges are small and most of the time they refuse to honour the complimentary access assured by our Credit Cards (Platinum and above). I would hate to be stranded there more than an hour or so.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
edinburgh-airport,/airport-reviews/edinburgh-airport,Edinburgh Airport customer review,D Mitchell,United Kingdom,2015-05-27,I am a fairly regular traveller (around twice/mth). Overall airport is very good indeed these days in all aspects except for security. A lot of money appears to have been spent on changes and now seems to be a poorer service than before especially when so-called 'Fast-track' is chosen. on the last visit (within the past week) staff were telling customers what clothing/items to put in the trays just before finally going through the screening machines i.e too late and especially confusing for the infrequent travellers - appears to be a staff training issue.

yuzhno-sakhalinsk-airport,/airport-reviews/yuzhno-sakhalinsk-airport,Yuzhno Sakhalinsk Airport customer review,H Bois,Russian Federation,2012-10-22,This airport is in dire need of an upgrade. There is a tiny check in area (we flew domestic today) with 4-6 check in desks but there are no lines or barriers and in typical Russian style there is no coherent queue. People are lining up all over to get in the correct queue. Upstairs there is a nice cafe called Lime which does decent coffee although double the usual cost. Still it is the only decent place to sit and wait. Then you go through another security check into a waiting room (full no seats left) then downstairs again to board the actual flight. This downstairs waiting room was also packed so we stood for about 30 mins in total with our squirmy 3 year old. All announcements were exclusively in Russian and we had to guess when our flight was called.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,Pasindu Karunaratne,NA,2009-01-06,Hanging around in any airport is to be avoided and in Abu Dhabi all the more so. It is a deeply boring place to have to spend any time there being nothing much to do. The seating – what there is of it – is comfortable. The airport seems tiny. The mosaic dome makes a change but it allows voices to echo so is noisy. This is exacerbated by the continual – and I mean continual – announcements which are also impossible to understand. There is a Costa so you can get a good cup of coffee and pay in £ if you wish. I didn’t particularly notice the smoke that so many people have complained of. Crowd control is southern ie long queues and lengthy processes. The toilets are reasonably unpleasant. Shopping is very limited to the usual Duty Free fare of watches perfumes cigars and alcohol. There are no quiet places to sleep so if you have an 8 hour stop-over during the night as I did you are going to have little fun. You can get a little sleep on the carpeted floor in the passages to the gates. All in all an experience that is not recommended.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
larnaca-airport,/airport-reviews/larnaca-airport,Larnaca Airport customer review,Geoff Wyndham-Jones,NA,2007-11-06,Used LCA twice during October both times arriving on scheduled flights and transiting when no charter or holiday flights were arriving. Thus Arrivals (just a big shed) handled the numbers of passengers well although baggage took a long time to come through bearing in mind the fact that the aircraft was parked just outside the terminal building. Departures again worked well with efficient security and adequate seating and eating facilities once through security. Check-in staff somewhat lethargic so allow sufficient time to check in rather than leaving it to the last minute. Generally the facilities are clean and well-maintained and the staff polite.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

This was because I had put my bag in the tray provided in order for it to be x-rayed I assumed all was ok for me to proceed until he looked at me rather aggressively and said ""get your bag out of the tray""! The parking is dire the toilets are dire the staff are dire too! I have been traveling out of Bristol for some 3 years now and it gets worse every time.

belfast-airport,/airport-reviews/belfast-airport,Belfast Airport customer review,C McAlin,United Kingdom,2014-04-07,I travelled through Belfast International Airport last week and my overall experience was good. I found the Airport to be small and quiet which was nice as airports these days are a bit chaotic at times. I went through security with no issues although the large scanning machine is a bit intimidating seems like something out of a sci-fi movie. (Is this thing really necessary?) The Security Staff were very friendly and processed my items in a timely manner. I didn't have much time to shop which was good because the selection was not great. That being said I did see all the usual places Coffee Shop Newspaper Shop Duty Free etc.. A clothing shop within the airport would be nice though. There was no public address announcement to go to the gate which kind of spoiled things as I had to constantly look at the Flight Monitor for information. Staff at the boarding gates were friendly and the walk outside to the aircraft was short. I had no issues upon my return although the baggage hall in the arrivals area would need some paint soon. Overall I was satisfied with the service I received in Belfast International Airport and will be using the airport again.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

T2 was the same no aircon working here so very poor for all passengers waiting in hot stuffy terminals. No wonder they are rated some of the worst in the world thanks to incompetence by those who run this airport.

Picking up and rechecking my luggage was very quick and efficient.

It is very sad that there is absolutely nothing to do there except stare into the shops and restaurants below. The airport should have some way for D and E gate passengers to go downstairs. Usually D and E gates are catering to non Schengen area / international passengers with more to spend! Surely Spain Airport Authorities should wake up and realise this potential!

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,T Cliffe,United Kingdom,2014-08-18,"Appalled by the extremely large queue at passport control when returning to Manchester airport on 15th August at 1.30am. Only five members of staff checking passports one male member of staff stood looking over his colleagues shoulder not assisting in any way. The queue snaked along the corridor of the terminal and it took approximately 30 minutes to even reach the zig-zag area. A number of flights had obviously landed and there must have been over 1000 people many with young children and babies waiting in the queue. The electronic desks were not in use! What is the point of having one of these passports if you are unable to use the facility they are issued for? When we finally reached a member of staff after waiting over an hour we complained only to be told in a flippant response ""Well it is a busy time of the year"". I then used the toilet facilities which were dirty and didn't appear to have been checked. Not a good impression for any traveller entering the UK.

They were very vague as to what we should remove from our bags to put in the trays for x-ray. I asked if we had to remove cables and wires and they did not answer so we left them in as you do on US flights. They then insisted that I empty a bag containing underwear in front of them. They then took my husband into a private room while they searched his bag. Surely a bit of kindness and common courtesy wouldn't go amiss? Later at the gate they asked over 150 of us to queue to have our boarding passes checked with our passports. We then sat down only to be asked to get up immediately to have boarding passes checked again as we boarded. It was laughable.

Yes it can take 10-15 minutes to get through security (and we have occasionally had our bags searched) but staff have always been very polite and professional. The airport is getting much busier and it can only be hoped that the internal changes make a positive difference. Our big gripe is that gate numbers are now given only 30 minutes or so before the flight departs - there can be no reason other than airport management trying to keep people in the departure lounge to encourage them to spend more money. Stop it! It certainly has the opposite effect on us and suspect it does on others too. This also serves to make the departure lounge very crowded noisy and hot (small wonder tempers are frayed).

My brother made the costly error of dropping me off in front of the terminal he must have spent no longer than 3 minutes in the car park but was relieved of £3 for the privilege. There is a free one-hour drop off parking zone further away but nevertheless this is really expensive when contrasted with arrangements at other airports like MAN. Security was excellent nice chap processed me and I was through in no time (bear in mind this is late Sunday though usually very quiet). Used the Yorkshire Premium Lounge (if you have BA Silver Gold you can use this) and opted for the 'business side' rather than the 'family side'. On reflection the family side appears more inviting and with more 'natural' light admitted - the business side lacks visual stimuli (no windows - no planes to look at) to the extent that an hour is just about long enough in there. The Yorkshire Tea and Scones with Jam were nice though! Lady on reception very welcoming and polite. Their isn't a WC in the lounge - one has to leave the lounge and use an adjacent facility - which is filthy like many areas of the airport. Boarding was a mess the usual faffing around being held in an ante-room after boarding passes have been checked. It seems that things become more complicated when other planes come into the equation at LBA we were left waiting a while until passengers had disembarked from another flight it reminded me of a few weeks ago when we landed at LBA - we were 'contained' in a locked corridor for 7 minutes after disembarkation to allow some FlyBe passengers to board another flight. The usual airbridge facility afforded to BA flights was not working so we had to use stairs and access the aircraft via steps - thankfully a sunny day and whilst climbing the steps I managed to get a nice look at the engine! This airport remains and unwelcoming and largely dysfunctional facility that does not provide a warm welcome to Yorkshire - I hear that RAF Church Fenton is being developed into a rival operation for LBA?
