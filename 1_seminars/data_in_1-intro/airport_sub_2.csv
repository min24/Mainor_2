aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Klaus Malling,Denmark,2014-02-11,"A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well.

aalborg-airport,/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport,Aalborg Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,France,2011-05-22,AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly.

aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,M Ferguson,United Kingdom,2014-06-12,One luggage carousel poor quality and expensive food airside.

The seating in the gate area is not that comfortable most often you get on and off the plane by steps-rarely an airbridge as in many other airports. The addition of the multi storey carpark indicates extra footfall and the check in queues have been alleviated by the move of the BA desks round the corner but the airport has a long way to go!,NA,NA,NA,3,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
aberdeen-airport,/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport,Aberdeen Airport customer review,S Davidson,United Kingdom,2013-03-26,I wish to echo the sentiments expressed in the review by Marion Johnston. The flight options to common holiday destinations like Tenerife etc are abysmal from Aberdeen Airport. Unless you are going on an overpriced package deal with Thomas Cook Thomson's etc and book around 8-12 months in advance you're only other option is a convoluted chain of flights transfers and even overnight hotels via Edinburgh Glasgow or London.

The staff remain the friendliest and most polite I've seen in any airport and there is something exhilirating and about coming into this Northern city usually in a small aircraft bouncing in through high winds.

It did not catch up with its growth over the past few years and passengers have to pay dearly for that shortcoming. It took me 2h from stepping into the building until I reached the gate. There are long queues everywhere check in passport control security and even toilets. Staff are stressed and grouchy. There are at peak hours no seats anywhere in or near the gates.

In a way I'll be sorry to see it go as its tiled doughnut satellites have stood the test of time architecturally speaking. Compare this with the monstrosity at Charles de Gaulle which seems to have aged in less than 10 years. The biggest problem in landing at the international airport is it take about 15 mins to taxi to/from the runway as the new airport terminal construction means that there are a series of contraflow taxi ways. I read a lot of complaints but I took a family of three young children through the terminal at 2:00am and nothing but praise for the staff and services.

This time I had a tight daytime connection (1hr 20 mins) and the inbound flight was 1hr late.

On the plus side the airport is built on a human scale and is easy to transit through there's plenty seating and access to clean toilets (things that Dubai fails badly on).

As a Silver member of an Etihad guest I can access the Al Reem lounge which is a big plus apart from duty free not a lot of things to do apart from free wifi. However as previous travellers note at peak times the security clearance for transit passengers can be very poor - I saw the longest line yet all the way back to T1 nearly on the way out but no queue at all for the return flight.

abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,M Taylor,United Kingdom,2012-02-09,Through AUH to BAH. Arrived at a remote stand and bussed to Terminal. Clear signage made it easy to navigate along with plenty of Departure screens. As previously stated quite busy so seating can be a bit hit and miss but they can be found. However after 7 hours in the air a walk about was most welcome. Boarding through Gate 18 was bizarre a doorway that actually led to Gate 17 and 18. Even weirder was that two flights were through this door at the same time which led to confusion for passengers. Security was a drag with two flights passing through one metal detector and two x-ray machines. They got it sorted and we were bussed to another remote stand. Return was at night. Arrived at another remote stand and again a bus to the Terminal. I was travelling with an infant access to a stroller would have been advantageous at the gate. Upon arriving at Flight Transfer we found a fleet of strollers. Why position them here? A reasonably long walk down to Gate 34 (10 mins) with plenty of seating at the Gate in a clean and airy environment. Overall not a bad experience. Terminal 1 is rather dated but great for people watching and shopping. Terminal 3 is modern and bright but can involve a fair trek down to the Gates in the 30's. Be prepared is my advice. Roll with it as it can be busy and perhaps not follow the norm expected of some western airports.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
abu-dhabi-airport,/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport,Abu Dhabi Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2011-04-03,Passed through a couple of times - T1 to T3 connection and another connection within T3. 2 hour connections both ways so no problems. T1 is a crowded dump. Signage is poor in both terminals and T3 is a 10-minute walk. Transit Security seemed pretty disorganised but only took a few minutes. T3 had plenty Duty Free Shops with prices similar to DXB. Eating options were adequate and no problems finding toilets. Air conditioning was a bit brutal and there appeared to be plenty of cold people in the middle of the night. Biggest criticism for me were the dreadful flight information screens which are tiny and only covered departures up to 45 minutes ahead - you didn't know which gate to go to and the single information desk wasn't even manned. On balance I think I prefer AUH to DXB for a 2 hour transit - at least AUH is built on a human scale.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I usually go from the plane to the transit hotel to the lounge and then to the plane. But this time I was unfortunately travelling economy and experience the nightmare of Abu Dhabi - it is just a bad airport with staff not really knowing what they are doing saying ""yes you can find a trolley around the corner"" I nearly walked to London and did not find one.

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,A Fleming,Ghana,2010-06-13,I have been through Kotoka International Airport more times than I care to remember and the attached domestic terminal a couple of times. Against most other African airports I have passed through (around 30) it is at the top end and there is an evident desire to improve. The airport is relatively small has only two gates for international departures and there are an ever increasing list of carriers adding Accra to their routes. Departure is not usually too bad security keeps the majority who may bother travellers at bay. Many first time passengers do not realise the need to go to the extreme right end of the airport for a customs check before going to their check in queue. This can result in additional queuing for the uninitiated as there is no signage. There are well in excess of 20 counters so whilst it can be crowded in the evening as others mention it is not unmanageable. Passengers must go upstairs for immigration and here is the best eating place in the airport - the only problem is that is security are doing their job they may not allow your friends to come and eat with you. In this case there are a few outside eating options within a short walk of the departure area of which Airport Landing is probably the best for a full meal. Once through immigration the shopping options are limited and overpriced but there are places for drinks snacks or even small time gambling. Business passengers will according to their carrier be assigned to one of two lounges - whilst neither is spectacular the lounge used in the main by Skyteam partners is my preference. It has a view of the runway and usually some kind of food as well the usual drinks. This lounge is close to the departure gates for intercontinental flights but there are times when African flights including Kenyan are from the gate located at the other end of the airport. The other lounge is used by BA Emirates and also Star Alliance partners (South African Lufthansa and United and apparently soon to be Turkish). This has minimal food no natural light but is nicely decorated and probably has the better drinks selection. The main x-ray security is before you go to your gate and you then sit in an often poorly air conditioned room awaiting boarding - it is rare for boarding to start when they first announce that it is. These areas often have passengers from multiple flights at one time and there is some small risk of boarding the wrong plane in the chaos that can ensure. It is not the best end to the departure experience but with the limited space and an expanding range of carriers it is hard to overcome this and as others state staff are for the most part friendly and polite. On arrival immigration is normally not more than 10 or 15 minutes bags can be quick or slow like most places (though I find very slow for late night flights) and you must then go downstairs where you are likely to have your baggage tag checked to confirm you have picked up the correct item(s) of luggage. Beyond this point it can be a little chaotic - people will almost certainly offer you a taxi and try to carry your bag then put pressure on you for a tip. If you do not want any of these services it is best to smile and say so - personally I would always favour trying to arrange a reliable pick up at any unfamiliar airport and in Accra most hotels can arrange for this. The domestic terminal is fairly spartan but perfectly adequate.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
adana-airport,/airport-reviews/adana-airport,Adana Airport customer review,Robert Clark,NA,2006-05-17,"Adana Airport is a chaotic airport at best yet not as bad as airports in other countries that surround it. There are two terminals to the Adana Airport Domestic and International. In most cases the International side is only for the pilgrimage flights to Makkah Saudi Arabia and some limited flights into Northern Cyprus. The Domestic side starts with citizens wanting to take your bags up to the security screening (right at the entrance to the terminal). They will expect a tip for this very small action. Tell them ""hayir saa olun"" and you'll be left alone. You'll put your bags onto the belt and your passport will be checked. Even if you are flying domestically have your passport on you at all times. They will check the validity of your visa and if you have over-extended your welcome. Once you are through (P.S. Security does not speak English so bring some phrases with you) you will have to go to the airline of your choice. Even if you have no luggage and paper tickets you will still have to check in. Organized chaos is the best way I can put it. Regardless if you are flying Turkish Pegasus or Onur Air you will still have people cutting in line using Hefty bags as luggage and uncomfortable closeness. When you finally get to the front the people at the ticket counter normally speak english. MAKE SURE you ask if your bags get taken all the way. Some times they do - sometimes they don't. You may have to pick them back up in Istanbul so its important they make it clear. Once you are done you are left in a terminal that reeks of a foul Turkish soguk gone bad sick passengers that don't cover their mouths when they cough passengers that make that disgusting ""spit like a man"" sound and the ever famous stare. There is a smoking section but it is not seperate from any other room so non-smokers will be subjected to 2nd hand smoke. There is a small store that sells refreshments but does not open until 6am while some flights are much earlier. You'll be hard pressed for a seat so get to the airport early or get used to standing. Keep an eye on your things at all times. Lots of people look suspicious. The loudspeaker is hard to understand in this dimly lighted building and its usually only in Turkish. Just line up whenever everyone else does and try to sneak a peak at their ticket to see if it is your flight. You will go through a second security and enter the gate area. Once again - organized chaos. There is no ""area calling"" and to ""rows 1-10."" Its a massive cattle heard. Just try to get in the front. Once your identity and ticket are checked you will walk out onto the tarmac where you will see a bunch of suitcases (and Hefty bags) This is where is can get confusing. Before you can board the place you must claim your suitcase yet again and give it to the baggage handlers. I guess this is good since you do ensure it gets on the plane but if its a large flight it can be difficult in the dark to find your items. DEPARTURE INTERNATIONAL: Should you get lucky enough and go through immigration in Adana it is much easier than Istanbul. The Duty Free section is very tiny and only has alcohol and cigarettes but the customs queues are tiny in comparison to Istanbul. This may happen to you even if you are going through Istanbul to an international flight so it is always best to check over at International first to see if you leave from there or domestic. For your sake I hope you leave Internationally. ARRIVAL: Landings are pretty simple. If you go through customs (there will only be like 10 of you) you will go through a small customs kiosk your passport will be scrutinized and you'll get to have a rare ""Adana"" stamp in your passport unlike most who travel to Turkey with the ""Istanbul"" stamp. Your bags will come on a low riding baggage claim separate from the domestic fliers and quick out the door. If you are flying in domestically (or after checking into customs in Istanbul) you will have to wait quite a long time before the bags finally arrive onto the low riding baggage claim. In here is where you can rent a car as well about 4 companies are available on site and for those going to the NATO base there is a Hertz located in the Burger King. Back to the airpoort when you get outside you can be picked up by your people (they will not be allowed into the airport) or you can hire a taxi. A gentleman usually brings the taxi to you and loads your bags he will expect a tip. 2 YTL is good enough. P.S. - A good taxi (spelled taksi in Turkish) to go with would be Gate Taxi at +90(322)316TAXI - they speak English. It will cost more but the drivers have better English than the airport taxis) In the airport just dial 322316TAXI. One more thing before I forget - turn around whern you enter the terminal - you'll see the lost luggage department. If you fly here to Adana more than once - expect to go in here a few times. The airport itself is a dirty mess...it smells the facilities are usually dirty it reeks of smoke and it gets pretty loud.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

adelaide-airport,/airport-reviews/adelaide-airport,Adelaide Airport customer review,H Davis,Australia,2014-09-30,Adelaide has a small airport without many shops. Certainly no massage or gym. Security is very relaxed - no guns and is a very pleasant place to sit and wait. The food expensive but not-so-great - but this is the case for most airports. However the primary function of such a building is to arrive and depart. Although a car ramp was built several years ago allowing passengers to be deposited 3 metres from the terminal this has been permanently disabled. Now taxis and domestic vehicles can only pass from over 30 metres away. Hilariously its been mentioned that this is to prevent terrorism but in my experience Adelaidians are not this paranoid self-aggrandising or stupid. If it were true I'm sure they would beef up their security in more sensible ways. More likely a structural issue that is taking too long to fix.

It is bright and spacious and there is free wi-fi which is painfully slow. Arrivals is a bit of a let down with you being forced to go through an arrival duty free shop. There is only one baggage carousel for international flights which makes it a problem if a large aircraft lands let alone multiple long haul flights. Customs is slow with numerous people asking you the very same questions. Perhaps they should consider having more people man the immigration booths and less customs staff. They obviously have little to do in such a small airport so are overzealous. On return check-in facilities were good friendly staff. There were many shops in the departure area which is a communal area for both international and domestic departures. The actual immigration and customs for international flights is a small area which is hard to miss! One other drawback is the pick-up and drop-off area what a mess!

As stated before the observation area is nice and quiet - with good views of the Monzano mountains and the active runways. Decor is South-western and very classic - with a lot of the original building that existed prior to the terminal upgrade back in the 1990s. It's not O'Hare with lots of flight options but also not the delays and crowds. Just wish there were more flights as prices can be high to various hub cities.,NA,NA,NA,9,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
alicante-airport,/airport-reviews/alicante-airport,Alicante Airport customer review,J Morgan,United Kingdom,2015-03-09,I have used Alicante Airport for 15 years or more and can say without doubt that the new terminal is a complete and unmitigated disaster. Announcements are incomprehensible Security often slow and rude the air-conditioning at best ineffective at worst a disgrace. People struggle to keep cool and there is so little seating that at busy times it is impossible for the elderly to find somewhere to sit. The food is over priced and of very poor quality.

We cannot see any obvious advantages in the new terminal over the older ones. OK the new terminal was conceived during boom times (and is far too large for current needs) but they obviously decided during construction work to cut the budgets and many of the finishes (loos being the biggest area) are cheaply done and showing wear already. The public address system is useless and they are clearly saving money by not using the air-conditioning as even in October the place was like an oven. The link from the terminal to the car parking/rental cars is a shambles and very poorly sign-posted - every new arrival who doesn't know the route is bewildered and gets lost.

alicante-airport,/airport-reviews/alicante-airport,Alicante Airport customer review,Ian Waddell,United Kingdom,2012-04-29,Whilst the new terminal has the general ambience of better-known international airports corners have been cut in the detailing probably due to the Spanish economic situation. The car rental situation is quite ridiculous. I have been through the new terminal 3 times since it opened and the route from the car rental desks to the car pick-up area is confusing without any adequate signage. There are always groups of bewildered people wandering around lost. You have either to go down by escalator from arrivals cross the road and up in a lift or up in a lift from arrivals to a bridge cross over and then down in a lift (the levels are numbered differently on each side of the bridge).

almaty-airport,/airport-reviews/almaty-airport,Almaty Airport customer review,D Kim,Australia,2014-12-18,Almaty airport is a tiny and dilapidated building compared to most international airports. The international terminal is cramped when you are waiting for an overseas flight and sometimes you'll be lucky to even find a place to sit. As you are coming in passport control is fairly swift and quick and collection of luggage and exiting is fast as well. As you are coming out be prepared to be greeted by a horde of gypsy taxi drivers. Most of them will overcharge you if you don't speak Russian so if you don't feel comfortable there is an official taxi booth near the exit charging 3500 Tenge. If you do decide to utilize a gypsy taxi driver come to an agreed upon price before getting in a price of 1500 - 2000 Tenge is reasonable. When buying something from one of the shops at the airport if you don't speak Russian it's important to not agree to buy anything unless there is a price tag on it. Shop keepers routinely over-charge foreigners double and even triple the amount. Overall it is not a comfortable airport to be in especially if you are waiting for an overseas flight.

almaty-airport,/airport-reviews/almaty-airport,Almaty Airport customer review,H Dalem,Netherlands,2014-04-27,An old building with old services although parts are modernized. The domestic side is on the right side with no connection to the international part. You have to exit the building to get to from domestic flights to international flights. You are not allowed to go to the airside terminal before your flight is announced for check in. This means you have to wait outside in the departure hall. WiFi is available for free but do not expect great speed. Check in is in a rather small area. Passport control is reasonably swift as is customs control and safety control. There are no shops on the domestic airside. The business lounge is almost always closed. And the local airline Air Astana does not provide this service for domestic flights. There is a small restaurant in the old and new part. There are shops in the international airside. There is a small restaurant/bar. The business lounge is available and open 24 hours. Use of this service is based on the airline. Lufthansa gets a limited menu of drinks and food. KLM seems to be more generous (no apparent restrictions). But it is an old room with plastic leather seating and not much else. There are enough ATM´s available to get cash. There are no newspapers/magazines for foreigners. Only taxis ordered or outside at the official taxi stand have decent fares. But agree on a fixed price no meters installed. Ignore offers inside the building.

The annoying thing is the security-at-the-gate which always annoys me but otherwise I think this airport is reasonable for it's size and location. As others have noted there is some walking required - but I don't understand people's insistence that when travelling 10000km they should not have to walk a single pace without some kind of mechanical assistance.

On a recent flight from London-City airport we landed on the‘remote’runway so had to endure a 10-15 minute taxi to the gate. Once we got there the gate was stilled occupied so has to wait for another allocation (typical for this airport). Once we pulled up to the new gate we had as usual to wait for what seemed like ages for the jetty to dock with the aircraft then the endless walking and travelators to immigration added another 10 minutes to the journey. Luckily the immigration was very fast. So given a 40 minute flight from London we spent at least 35 minutes taxiing disembarking and endless walking. I don't find this airport at all suitable for shorter commuter type flights.

amsterdam-schiphol-airport,/airport-reviews/amsterdam-schiphol-airport,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-03-05,I generally like Schiphol it is large and busy but well laid out and has plenty of facilities and never feels particularly crowded. I have generally found queues short and staff helpful. However my most recent experience was rather less than perfect because KLM has introduced some very short transit times. Going out was 55 minutes and on return 40 minutes. The first was just doable but the second very stressful and I only made my flight by jumping a queue (on instruction from staff) and running the last part (I was not alone). The problem is exacerbated if you are on short-haul Cityhopper flights which park away from the terminal and require a bus to and from them this reduces the transit time by at least 10 minutes. On the second occasion my second flight was 'now boarding' as I got off the bus from the first flight and 'gate closing' appeared when I was still some minutes from having my boarding card checked and going through security. This was despite going straight to the gate at a brisk walk anyone unfamiliar with the airport or unable to keep up a good pace would really struggle. In the end Schiphol worked but I found the experience unnerving and I caution transit passengers with less than hour between flights to be ready for a stressful experience.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Another important thing was plentiful and clean toilets. Signage was also a pig plus: clear and often. The building despite being huge Is nice and well kept. Boarding process was also ok.

antalya-airport,/airport-reviews/antalya-airport,Antalya Airport customer review,L Frederic,Germany,2011-06-04,Been there quite a number of times. Terminals are wide apart only Havas Bus runs to city and is overpriced. There is a local bus but no apparent stop and schedule. Usually huge lines at terminal entrance due to X-ray and check in counters due to holiday travellers. Celebi and Havas check in agents which handle almost every airline are usually not friendly. Airside area usually very crowded not much place to seat long lines at security not organized. All airport outlets terribly overpriced. Only good thing is that it's quite modern and clean.

antigua-vc-bird-airport,/airport-reviews/antigua-vc-bird-airport,Antigua Vc Bird Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2015-03-17,I did not find Antigua as bad as some but it was not exactly trouble free. Immigration took about 40 minutes bad but I have suffered worse elsewhere and the officer was polite and welcoming. Departure is rather chaotic you queue to check-in (about 20 minutes in our case) and to go through emigration (over 30 minutes) though security was cleared quickly. Once in the terminal it was crowded but had (just) enough seating. The snack bar was reasonably priced but souvenirs can be found cheaper elsewhere on the island. The good news (hopefully) is that the new terminal building is complete and due to open in the next few weeks according to locals it is much larger than the present one and looks a better design - there are several dedicated piers for large aircraft. Antigua is a great island and I look forward to experiencing the new facilities.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

As we previously had visited the USA, had a valid ESTA and a machine readable passport we were able to use the passport machines. Quite straightforward and my wife and I were able to get clearance in the same transaction. A little tricky getting our finger prints in the correct position on the scanner. The machines printed out a form which we handed to the immigration agent. A few brief questions and a passport stamp and we were through. This was much the quicker route than traditional queuing. Bags arrived promptly and 30 minutes after getting off the plane we were standing at the taxi rank. Some airport hotels don't send their shuttles to the international terminal so we took a taxi to the Hampton Inn College Park. About $15 and well worth it. The alternative would be to take a shuttle to the domestic terminal and then wait for a hotel shuttle. A most pleasant arrival, we were having our first beer in a restaurant 60 minutes after arrival. Departure - Dropped off our car at the central rental centre. A shuttle bus took us to the international terminal. The bus arrived after 5 minutes waiting - but it was small and some people were left behind. We arrived at the terminal 3 hours before our flight at about 7pm and no queues at the BA check in desk and security was very quick. Didn't do any shopping and went upstairs to the food court. I cant say I was impressed. An expensive restaurant and 4-5 fast food outlets. Similar to a shopping mall but twice the price. My recommendation is to eat before you get to the airport if you want a good meal at reasonable prices. Fortunately, we were able to use the Club lounge.

Once cleared immigration had another queue to get through customs then the worst thing is you have to recheck your baggage and go through security why when you have got off an international flight and not left the terminal do you have to go through security.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,Rich Jenkins,United States,2010-01-08,"ATL's major function is providing domestic connections for Delta passengers and it does this fairly well with an efficient train system between concourses. OTOH the concourses are long and Delta customer service (such as it is) has been greatly cut back. Earlier this year I encountered a situation where the wrong type of aircraft had been provided (after a long delay and cancellation of flights before and after ours) and the ticket staff were less than gracious in dealing with the fallout. The food selection remains relatively unhealthy and the largest food court (outside of the main terminal) tends to be crowded. The selection of reading material is generally pretty awful but typical of Atlanta in general. CNN is loud and inescapable and the airport generally provides even less opportunity for peace and quiet than the average. Departure security is centralized and unpredictable but not quite as timeconsuming as it was 2-3 years ago. The ""secret"" North terminal alternative to the main terminal security has been closed--this had provided much faster screening because it was known only to people using the T terminal and carriers other than Delta. Baggage areas have been remodeled but there no longer is security to check tags. Beware of taxi operators who approach you in the baggage claim as they charge more than the ones in the queue outside. Expect taxi drivers to not know anything other than major hotels - bring mapquest-type directions to your destination. Long time Atlantans don't know much of the area either. Marta rapid transit service has gotten slightly better although the process of paying for fares with cards is cumbersome compared with the old token system. Marta is the best way to reach major hotels downtown in Midtown and Buckhead. Customer service is generally horrible in the airport although better with carriers other than Delta. Despite many years of living in ATL and much international travel I always cleared customs elsewhere (my int'l travel was mostly to Asia and on United so ATL was rarely feasible) my understanding is that international arrivals are variable and often unpleasant. The international terminal which used to be dismal is apparently being redone. Delays are common at this airport - the weather in the Atlanta area is volatile with downpours and thunder storms being quite common in Spring and summer plus Atlanta gets the back end of hurricanes in the fall. Often things will seem mild or only drizzly at the airport but will be violent somewhere in an nearby flight path and this will cause delays. Some delays occur because of problems elsewhere in an airline's hub/spoke system and this is particularly true of Delta which dominates the airport. Morning departures are more predictable and less prone to delay than afternoon or evening flights.",NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Apart from the puzzle of two separate duty-free stores charging near-identical prices I quite liked it: the EGates worked fine not too long to wait for baggage (but only because the other EK flights were on time) and the customs/agricultural processing has been sharpened up by getting only a proportion of passengers' baggage through the X-ray machines and waving through the balance. The bus to the city works well but at $NZD28 return is a bit expensive.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Ed Roggeveen,New Zealand,2013-04-02,What an extraordinary range of reviews for this airport and I guess it reflects different times / dates and expectations. I use it fairly regularly - admittedly mostly going to and from Aus and have found it very good (far superior to Sydney). I agree with the comments about the pushy Duty Free salesman but overall I always find going in and out either alone or with my infant son very easy. On a recent arrival I mentioned the pushchair had been on the beach and in the forest in North Queensland and they happily took it away and cleaned the wheels thoroughly - great service! Enough food options - how many do you need? And with one exception I have found all customs immigration staff very helpful and friendly.,NA,NA,NA,9,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,2012-11-15,Into AKL on EK Thursday 18 Oct exiting 11 November. A game of two halves: arrival was a pretty fraught process because EK have so timetabled it that two A380s and a B777 arrive within half an hour of each other (early afternoon) and the baggage hall is not really large enough to deal easily with that number of people at once. The E-gates work fine. Departure was much better; EK had extra staff on to speed up check-in and the two Pier B gates have enough room just to cope with two A380s' worth of departing passengers. For once the duty-free was decently priced. I still like AKL but its international baggage collection now needs work.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,2012-09-10,Last used ten days ago when returning from Brisbane. I agree with parts of most of the latest reviews although from this first page you would think people are talking about two completely different airports! Yes it is a long walk to/from either Gates 14/15 (Virgin Australia or the A380s) and also those at the end of the main pier (9 10 etc) and I was surprised that there is no travelator in the main pier (possibly because the corridor is a bit too narrow to safely install one). However the entry through the carved Maori gate with accompanying music is far superior to any other airport I've ever seen. I too resent having to walk through the duty-free shops to reach Immigration but Smartgate makes up for that - kiosk and photo took no more than 60 seconds. MAF was no problem and I was outside 25 minutes after leaving the aircraft. Departure had also been easy - short queue to drop my bag as I had checked in on-line although again there is the long walk to the far gates. Food prices although a bit expensive are still far less than at Australian airports.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,2011-10-10,Inbound 25 minutes from plane to welcoming area - a lot of this is the E-gate system and the authorities have also done a lot of other things to make things work well.

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,2011-03-05,I was an international in-transit passenger and the experience was not a great one. Arriving on an international connection flight from Christchurch (NZ302) the whole plane of connecting passengers firstly had to be processed by one of two security lines. Then we had to hot foot it to the connecting gate (10). This is the gate used by ANZ US flights and is some distance away from the arrival gate. There were not enough seats at that gate to accommodate more than 25% of the flight no one could hear the boarding announcements there were only four toilets and it was generally not an good experience. Consequently the flight left late. The main shopping area in the international terminal is very smart and well lit downstairs is not and is shabby.

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,2010-10-10,Check-in very quick and painless as I had checked-in online. One great thing about Auckland is that because it has fewer international flights than most comparably sized cities elsewhere in the world there is not the major panic to get through Emigration and Security to make sure that you don't miss your flight. Result - a much smoother transition with staff who are generally smiling and friendly. As I live fairly close to the airport I don't normally bother eating there although prices don't appear too much worse than in the city (certainly not the eye-gouging 500-600% markup I saw in Russia). The only criticism I would make airside as I have before is that it's a very long walk to Gates 15 and 16 and that more than one short travelator would be welcomed by most. Returning was easy for me - although there were quite long queues at Immigration I was directed to the new SmartGate as I have an e-Passport. Through and done in under a minute - brilliant! Luggage was already waiting on the conveyor and I was through MAF screening and out in the concourse in just a few minutes.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Darren Kilminster,Australia,2010-07-20,Arrived in Auckland and after going through Immigration our travelling party was given the 3rd degree.

Was sent down a corridor for further screening and the woman there was not sure why. She went away for a moment and came back and said it was a mistake and to just go through. A nice warm welcome to NZ ? Left 6 days later - painless check in and customs clearance. Airside at Auckland is a bit lousy.

auckland-airport,/airport-reviews/auckland-airport,Auckland Airport customer review,Anthony Gibbons,New Zealand,2010-03-29,Flew Auckland-Apia (Samoa) return. No queues and best bit was clearing immigration in less than 1 minute using the new Smartgate self processing kiosks available to NZ/OZ passport holders. Then straight down to baggage claim. Would have been out in less than 10 minute after landing but for needing to go through Red lane (goods to declare). Even after being stuck behind a gaggle of passengers was still out of airport 15 minutes after landing. Only weird note is ladies calling to you from the inbound JR duty free to come visit their store - and offering mini-Toblerones as an inducement.

It's quite a long walk from the new gates built for the A380 and although the line for Immigration was moving fairly quickly it still took another 15 minutes to reach the desks where everyone appeared to get a really friendly welcome.

There are four travelators because it's a long way from the main departure concourse (at least 400 metres) to the lounges at Gates 15 and 16 but only the first (and shortest) was working.

I arrived by domestic service (I understood some international flights do use this airport) so customs were negligible. The airport is built on the edge of the desert and is surrounded by picturesque desert panorama.

bacau-airport,/airport-reviews/bacau-airport,Bacau Airport customer review,A Dron,United Kingdom,2013-07-20,Probably the smallest airport I have experienced. On arrival distance between the entry doors from the apron to the immigration desks can not be more than 5 yards. This means that passengers have to queue outside which in inclement weather must be unpleasant. Passport checks were fast however. On departure similarly tiny landside area with minuscule cafe to left of entrance doors. Incredibly cramped check-in/security area to right of doors although check-in agent friendly and helpful. Security checks are very thorough - had to remove belt watch etc and they found small jar of jam I'd absent-mindedly packed in my carry-on bag. Departure lounge was standing room only for a single Boeing 737. Couple of vending machines are the only refreshment sources. Local people told us that a major expansion of the airport is planned but from look of abandoned foundations beside the existing terminal this is unlikely to be completed any time soon. In short staff seem fine but can not recommend because of lack of space and facilities - even allowing for the fact it's a regional airport not a major hub.,NA,NA,NA,4,4,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

It has a 'restaurant' and a souvenir shop (selling souvenirs you are unlikely to want). Security is tight and photographs are not allowed. My bag weighed more upon leaving than arriving and the only way to resolve this problem was to quietly pay a bribe less than the excess baggage cost. The toilets were smelly the seating areas both landside and airside were sufficient for the number of passengers using the two gates. The airport is totally disability unfriendly.

bahrain-airport,/airport-reviews/bahrain-airport,Bahrain Airport customer review,Syed Adeel Raza,United Kingdom,2012-11-15,I fly Gulf Air mostly and every time the torturous part for me is Bahrain International Airport. After landing and disembarking the aircraft there is a short walk to the transit area. Everyone for some fairly odd reason has to take off their belts shoes mobiles watches etc and pass through the security gate. I just don't understand this. We have just come off a plane! Security checks have taken place in our point of departure. So this is always painful as the lines build up rapidly if a few flights come in and the area is small. The staff at this security gates are not helpful. The airport itself isn't too great. The smoking area is a disaster even for smokers its too small and packed out.

You cannot do a lot of things and it's even difficult to find a seat in the departure area. There were only 2check-in counters for a full a320. But I guess that this is more Air Malta's fault than the airports. On the inbound flight lugagge was very slow. It took nearly an hour before the first bags came out and that at 12pm in the middle of the night with no other flight arriving due to a late arrival. There was no information given by the airport to when the luggage will come out. The luggage area was very small. I don't know how they want to handle a few flights at the same time.

Our bags are always out within 5 mins of arriving at the belt - never the case in the UK or the 'Western' world. Departure - numerous security lines and clear signage plenty of shops and restaurants. Genuinely no complaints. International - arrival security check is cumbersome and time consuming and the immigration process can be bureaucratic but after that the bags are out quickly and getting a cab is safe easy and well priced.

No international travel so far. Enjoyed every single visit. Entry to the airport is via a six-lane road which branches off from the Bangalore-Hyderabad highway. Smooth drive all the way to the curb-side drop off. No congestion at all. Check-in was a breeze with plenty of space and no crowding. The very high ceiling gives a feeling of spaciousness and feels really good. Security check was also very quick with no hold-ups. Departure lounge feels crowded with all the retail outlets taking up lions share of the available space. I wish the planners had given an additional fifty feet ""depth"" (i.e. distance from security check to departure gates) to the departure area - that would have eliminated the congestion. Aircon worked well all the time. Announcements were soft but audible. Flight information displays were hard to spot. I spotted them only on my second trip! Departure lounge cafe was excellent for early morning (Indian) breakfast. All my flights departed on time. Boarding was always smooth even when using the bus to get to the aircraft (which happens often given the small number of aero-bridges available). Arrival experience has been superior. Most time I do not check- in any bags and hence I could just walk out. The one time I did check-in a suitcase it came out on the belt just as I reached the belt!

bangalore-airport,/airport-reviews/bangalore-airport,Bangalore Airport customer review,S Sankar,NA,2008-09-05,Used BIAL 4 times within 2 weeks for 3 domestic flights and one international departure. I found the whole experience very good. Everyone cribs about the distance of the new airport to the city centre. Over time people will forget about the old airport and will factor the distance to the new airport into their overall journey. Once the Namma metro is complete the journey will be even more convenient. At the moment one has to travel either by taxi or take the city bus. The city bus transfer is clearly signposted and very efficient with around 8 different routes into the city departing every 20mins or so. My journey to/from Indiranagar took just over an hour on all occasions. The airport itself is finally the first international standard airport in India (I haven't been to the new airport in HYD) with decent shops the Kingfisher bar cafes lots of immigration and security queus and clean tiolets! My personal overall experience was very positive. The only issue I could see was with the size of the international departure lounge. My BA 747 was full and the 350 passengers took up around half of the available seats in the international departure area. I imagine that at around midnight when AF LH TG SQ and KL all operate 777s or A330s that the departure area will be bursting at its seams. From reading the press I understand this has been recognised and they are already talking about extending the airport which will probably take 4-5 years.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,I've been a regular traveller (10-15 times/year) through Suvarnabhumi since it opened in 2006. It's a large airport and it's busy - always. Rule #1 - check in early. Rule #2 - if you have to wait for check-in baggage don't expect to be in a taxi less than 1.5 hours after landing. If you manage 45 mins you've done pretty well. Check-in can be slow but that's down to the airlines. (I always check-in online). Most of them seem to have enough counters available and international flights will typically be open 3 hours before Departure and occasionally 4 hours - so check in early. Upstairs Security Screening is usually only a few minutes wait I've never waited more than 10 minutes and I can think of many worse airports in this respect. Immigration both in Arrivals and Departures is poor and can be the longest wait of the trip through the airport but if you've allowed enough time it is what it is - chill and bring a book. The Baggage Hall is big enough belts are well sign posted and the longest I've ever waited on a bag was a Domestic Flight from Chiang Mai (about the same length of time as the flight). 20 mins in the baggage hall would be more typical. You very rarely get stopped in Customs and queuing times for taxi's is not bad. If you have to wait around there are plenty lounges Airside and seating in the lower levels both Landside and Airside. The Terminal Hotels are expensive and there are better options locally or in the city. Food is expensive and the choice isn't great but there is a food court Landside which is good value. (Burger King seems the busiest eating place). I rarely bother with Duty Free Shopping in BKK - I can shop better in the city. Distances to and from the gates are lengthy in some cases but they're pretty good at keeping the travelators working. Toilet cleanliness may not be at the standards of the best airports but they are cleaned regularly. Signs are OK and Flight Information Screens are very good. Touts still congregate in Arrivals and I still ignore them. The Airport Rail Link isn't the blast to and from the city which was envisioned but it works adequately. Unfortunately it's pretty overcrowded at peak times because of stops at intermediate stations. BKK is a better airport than it was 5 years ago but the Immigration 'experience' is poor and is a major bottleneck. Security is much better organised than before and the budget airlines moving to Don Mueang has taken some pressure off BKK. Given the space they have and passenger numbers they handle BKK should be a better airport than it is and as a passenger it's not a good airport to be in a hurry to get through. Lots of problems go away given enough time.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2014-04-22,I've been travelling through Bangkok maybe a dozen times a year since the airport opened and there's definitely improvements. There's not much seating in Departures so it's best to arrive around the time your check-in opens (typically 3 hours with International Flights). I always check-in online for shorter queuing times. The upstairs security screening is reasonably efficient as is Immigration with somebody usually managing the queue system. Check-in early and kill time airside rather than checking in late and having to rush. I don't bother with Duty Free in BKK - it's expensive as are all the airside restaurants. There's not much seating in the main concourse but there are quiet areas 1 level down and obviously out towards the gates. Arrivals usually commences with a log walk from a remote gate but plenty travellators to help you on your way and highly variable queuing times for Immigration 20 minutes would be typical most times of they day but an hour not unusual at busy times. The baggage is pretty efficient in BKK and it's unusual to have to wait more than a few minutes for luggage. Plenty of taxi touts in Arrivals but just follow the signs downstairs for Public Taxi or Airport Rail Link. Also the lower levels are quieter if you have to spend a few hours between flights. There's also a food court with better Thai food than the airport restaurants. Now they have Security Screening out of the way upstairs in Departures the whole flow of the airport has improved.

bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,/airport-reviews/bangkok-suvarnabhumi-airport,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport customer review,John Bauman,United Kingdom,2013-11-12,Flown in twice in the past few weeks. Queues for Passport/Immigration have become ridiculous. Earlier this year the queues zig-zagged out of the arrivals hall and down the ramp. Thought this was a one off issue having used the airport many times previously and never experienced any real problems. Not so. It is now the norm. Took in excess of 1 hour 30 mins in queues on both occasions just to get to the Immigration/Passport desk. Once at the desk all formalities completed in a couple of minutes. The reason for the huge queues is that very few Immigration desks are manned. Officers are employed to look at the queues and then disappear only to emerge minutes later to do the same again. eparting was so much faster. A real breeze. It appears that BKK is heavily promoting the paid for fast track arrivals coupon for THB850. I'll avoid BKK and go elsewhere rather than endure such nonsense again.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

Upon arrival on Friday afternoon the queues for immigration were very long and many of the desks closed. Took around half an hour to get through which after a long 11 hour flight is poor. Going out on Saturday early morning it took over an hour and a half to check in go through security and then immigration. Once through we had to run to the gate to ensure we made our flight. The shops were empty - presumably because everybody was late for their flights! Coming back in was terrible - 45 minutes to clear immigration again hardly any desks open.

It only took five minutes to clear immigration. The bags took awhile to arrive but this just meant that I had time to exchange money at one of the many (competitive) vendors in the arrivals area. Departure - Horrible airport. It hard to believe that it is only six years old. The design seems like something from another era. Up through security I have no major complaints but then the entire experience really goes downhill. The first priority does not seem to be getting you to your gate but rather making sure you are exposed to every single one of the very high end shops. I did not see one newsstand or bookstore anywhere although I did finally see a great drugstore. There are some normal food options toward the end. The gate situation could not have been designed by anyone who travels much. You sit outside the gate area in a place with few seats until shortly before boarding. It is a crowded miserable experience. Your boarding cards are submitted as you enter the (secure) gate area where more seating is available.

The building itself is rather monolithic and therefore lacks the bright and airy feel of terminals like HKG and the arrivals concourse can seem rather stark. My only two gripes with this airport are: air- conditioning. It never seems to be working properly and queuing at immigration outwards and inwards. Individual queues in front of each counter is a hopeless set-up. It is frustratingly slow to the point of desperation. I wonder why they haven't set up a single queue and have the first available counter call the next person in line. Also the officers at the counters processing Thai passports only when they have cleared their queues are happy to just sit and let the foreign passport queues swell.

They've also done away with this ridiculous system where Landside some of the travelators were restricted to Airport Pass users (ie to get between floors you had to use the Elevators).

It looks as though it will have a very nice landside terminal when the the work is finished and once through security the (I hope) temporary shopping arrangements will improve once the new units are finished. Things must have moved on quite a bit since October because the airside waiting areas at the gates seemed adequate with four wide-bodies on the stands and no sign of overcrowding. Improvements could be made in the way that check-in queues are managed with handling agent staff positioned at the entry to the queues rather than down at the desk end. On the second occasion I used the airport the signage above the desks clashed with airline information displayed on the monitors above them and resulted in some annoyance among people in the wrong queues - hence the comment about need for agents at the tail end of a queue. The public address system could also be improved (they REALLY need a good sound engineer to sort out the audio). There also seems to be a problem with the way airlines access the PA system. It would be better if there was a single person making all the announcements. That would reduce the variation in announcement ""styles"" (some barely decipherable) and techniques (some too close to the microphone and some to far away) and would ensure that all announcements were aired. One last improvement would be the change of access to the business lounge so that it was from airside rather than landside. That would make it a much more relaxing place because users would already be through security and not have to judge when to join the security queue so that they would be on time for boarding. I suppose the down side of that would be that the lounge would need to be bigger to accommodate a greater number of users.

We used T1 for the first time and whilst the terminal was fine the Shuttle bus between T1 and T2 was hair raising. I think the driver thought he was Fernando Alonso. Fast driving and hard braking was the order of the day together with what felt like cornering on two wheels. The quicker they finish the Metro link the better. If you're using the shuttle hold on tight because it could be a rough ride.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,Nicolas Simonis,Greece,2014-02-10,In reading some of the reviews I simply wonder if these pax have ever visited this lovely airport one of the nicest airports I have ever seen. Huge well designed signs everywhere very willing personnel excellent shopping area in fact I find no reason to complain apart from my pre-booked pre-paid taxi service (Aerocity) who had instructed me to proceed to their office on the lower lever their office however was closed and they never bothered to phone me. Wasted two hours trying to obtain their disappointing service whilst on our departure date they never showed up! BCN airport is simply great with moving walkways (something they missed when building Athens airport) fantastic shopping ideas and shops. Check in on Vueling was very fast.

Then you discover there are signs to three possible baggage delivery areas in Terminal 2 and have to peer at small screens to discover where yours will end up. Driving back to the airport we found ourselves going round in a circle after filling up the hire car - you get to a crossroads and have to guess and we guessed wrong.

The airport is situated in France and run by French staff most of which are impolite or not bothered to say the least do not speak any foreign language (i.e. German or English - bearing in mind that they work on the Swiss side of the airport and should at least have some rudimentary understanding that they may have to converse in German at Basel or the lingua franca which is English and not French) and have a 'cannot do' attitude to customers. The security staff simply do not understand that BA's Club Europe is Business Class and try to refuse entry to fast track. This is even more surprising given that only Turkish Airlines Swiss Lufthansa Air France and BA operate from and to Basel as proper international airlines and surely it cannot be that hard to learn their business class products. This has been happening for the last three - four months now. The airport facilities are extremely poor.

Bus line 50 connects the airport to Basel central station every 10 mins - reliable service at CHF5.80 one-way travel time around 20 mins. On the French side more limited service - no direct connection to Mulhouse: a shuttle bus brings you first to Saint-Louis railway station from there you can catch a regional train to Mulhouse. Upon departure check-in at the self-service machines hassle-free. No queue at security but staff prefers speaking French than English. In the public area large terrace with nice views on the apron. The restaurant on the Swiss side is truly delicious with decent prices; but I would rather avoid the bistro on the French side - gloomy with only basic food. Boarding gates are lacking proper airconditioning so that it can quickly become very warm there.

I have travelled Ryanair a lot but I have never set foot in what must be the worst airport they fly into. We fly out of Terminal 1. The airport is well sign posted from the road. We took the bus and it dropped us beside it. The check-in area was basic but efficient. My tip to anyone is do not go though security until about an hour before your flight is due to leave as once you get though security there is nothing there. Only enough seats for around 50 people in the departure lounge. We stupidly thought that maybe there would be better food in the departure lounge. All there is is a small Illy cafe which cost us 12 euros for 2 bags of crisps and 2 cokes. I know airport prices are bad but that took the biscuit. The departure lounge is so small and there was around 600 people there with only seats for 50 of them. One other poster said this airport reminded him of a barn I'd agree with that.

At 10 AM no bus were at the starting point but at 10.15 AM 13 buses had arrived. In Beauvais low cost companies have this tiny box where you have to put your luggage to be able to get in the plane. There are people who check and ask every passenger to fit their hand luggage in the box and if it doesn't send you back to the company. The security people are nice and welcoming it's just a pain to queue for 100 meters going along bags' check identity check and security check.

On the flight back check-in was fast (we arrived 90 minutes early and they had 2 lines open). Security was also fast. But then came a nightmare- they have 4 gates and there are no screens that tell you where your flight will be. They are all very close together so that in our cast there were about 400 people wondering where they have to line up. Shortly before boarding they tell you where to go but you are squeezed in all the time- very unpleasant and stupid because they could change that easily.

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,M Bates,NA,2009-02-16,The new Beijing Capital Terminal 3 is architecturally fantastic especially from the air. The check-in area is huge and not too crowded and generally easy to navigate and I have always found the check-in process to be reasonably smooth whether for domestic or international flights. However things go downhill from there. Although the check-in area is huge all the passengers are congregated into one smallish area for access to the gates. Domestic passengers have it easy in that once through the security check the gates are right there in the same building as the ground side area. But as in the old terminals at this airport it seems like the airport authority likes to bus as many passengers as possible to remote stands which is simply ridiculous in a modern airport. It is even more ridiculous when you are on the bus looking at the airport with most of the gates unoccupied and all the planes parked a mile or so away on remote stands. I have travelled on domestic flights through this terminal eight times since it opened last year and only once have been to a proper gate. As for the international passengers all have to go down two escalators to a train that is often broken. You then get transported out to the furthest of the three buildings at the end of the dragon (the intermediate building is not in operation yet) where you then immediately go into the passport control and tiny queuing areas for security. Once through into the airside terminal be sure to have a jacket as it is always about 10C in that building. There are lots of glitzy shops to spend money in but almost nowhere to eat. For such a grand project there are so many small problems with this airport that could have been fixed with just a little thought.

belfast-airport,/airport-reviews/belfast-airport,Belfast Airport customer review,A Magowan,United Kingdom,2011-10-05,What a shame. Belfast International used to be a lovely airport a real pleasure to travel out of. These days however the feeling you get as you walk through the door is that they want to squeeze every penny they can out of you. For a start most of the seating has disappeared only to re appear in the food outlet area so now to sit down you either have to be at the airport first thing or buy overpriced food. Add to this a £1 charge to pick up or set down £1 for a trolley and £1 to use a smoking room. I found security to be ok not as friendly as Heathrow but certainly not as bad as Newark. I found that the servisair people were quite rude I stood at the servisair booth for 10 mins before one of them acknowledged me and asked me to wait.

Smoking is permitted in the terminal building and it can be difficult to find a place to sit or eat that is not smoky.

However there is only an automatic exchange machine which wasn't working. The lady at the information desk agreed that it doesn't make sense not to have one airside.

Leaving was worse; having joined a very slow moving queue in Terminal B we were advised to go to A as 'there are no queues there'. Wrong there was a short queue for initial luggage scanning but we then joined a very slow queue (over 20 minutes) for secondary screening. This was entirely down to one scanner out of four available being used despite several staff standing around chatting. As we reached the head of the queue they started a second luggage scanner but it made very little difference as everyone had to go through one body scanner and almost everybody seemed to set it off.

Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus connection with Berne central station upon each regular incoming and departing flight - one-way costs 5.20CHF.

The airport itself is small but there is a good bus service which will take you into the city centre pretty quickly. On arrival on the 13.00 HRS AF 7638 flight from CDG this flight seemed to coincide with a number of other flights from the UK which made the baggage arrivals area chaotic. In addition the toilet facilities landside need some upgrading and definitely could do with the cleaners visiting there on a more frequent basis especially mid-afternoon which seems to be the peak time for the airport. The rubbish bin in the gents toilet was overflowing when I was there which left a poor initial impression! The airport does have an excellent tourism booth with very helpful staff however. In addition from the airport one can get onto the nearby motorway very quickly and the care hire agencies also had very helpful staff at the airport (especially Europcar). On departing Biarritz back to Paris however I discovered that the departures area has only one very small cafe so passengers may not want to enter this area too quickly as the wait could be long and somewhat boring. In summary the airport is convenient but it falls well short of the new fresher and modern design of nearby Pau airport which is excellent.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It's worth noting that BHX is trying for more long haul flights now that the runway has been extended for larger aircraft, but heaven help arriving passengers if this come to be, it'll be a nightmare under the present system of baggage handling on arrival.

birmingham-airport,/airport-reviews/birmingham-airport,Birmingham Airport customer review,Arthur Jackson,United Kingdom,2015-03-17,It really puzzles me why how this airport can so consistently get departures right and yet consistently make arrivals such a nightmare. I've rarely queued for check in or security which is so much better these days. The departure lounge is reasonable with plenty of choice for a relatively small airport. What annoys without fail is their arrivals handling. Maybe it's because there is less opportunity for financial gain from arriving passengers (although their charges for baggage trolleys might suggest otherwise). I've never found immigration anything but busy that is on a good day. On a bad day the place is heaving with passengers queuing up the stairs to the gate concourse. Problems are caused when passengers use the lift to reach immigration leaving them with no option but to push into the queue. One might assume that after the time taken to clear immigration at least your bags would be merrily enjoying their carousel ride. Rarely is this the case. Why is this airport so slow at getting bags to belt? Sure every airport has occasional delays but Birmingham seems to have nothing but delays when it comes to the arrival experience. Odd as you'd think the airport would want the passengers last memory of the airport to be a good one obviously they don't otherwise they would resolve the issues.

Checked in online and got dropped off at Birmingham Int'l railway station (to avoid the short stay parking charges) and was through security in about 20 minutes which included having my bag searched.

The return was even less eventful. Off the plane and through immigration within 10 minutes (using the automated passport gates).

On the way out to Dalaman we were caught in a quite ridiculous queue for security which looped from the escalator right the way round the first floor shopping area and then along the passage way eventually and after a few more loops into the security area.

On return at about 23.25 a week later I was kept waiting about 45 minutes for our luggage. I then had an unpleasant walk in the rain to the far side of the long stay car park as the shuttle bus service becomes almost non-existent by late evening and is totally inadequate when several flights arrive at the same time. I then had to return to the drop off car park to pick up some luggage and passengers; I was there for a little over 10 minutes - enough to for the parking charge to click up from £1 to £2.

At 5.30 in the morning you don't expect to be greeted by any queues! I dread to think what the situation will be this Easter weekend or in the summer. The problem is easy to see and the designer of the security area wants sacking. You cannot pick up a tray until you get to the X-ray machines so there is no way to start preparing to remove liquids belt jewellery coat boots laptop coins and everything else that has to go in the tray. Hence the delay. Once through there are only a couple of tables and chairs so you struggle with the largest tray imaginable and have to sit on the floor to put everything back again.

On the third time of flying out of here recently myself and my family were booked on one of the two flights scheduled to depart at the same time this showed how inadequate this airport is at handling more than one flight. The sole cafe in the departure was overwhelmed to a point where the lack of staff meant they could only offer bacon/sausage/egg barms instead of the other breakfast offerings such as a Full English. It is unacceptable that the facilities are not geared to cope with more than one flight. The second criticism is the car park. Spaces are effectively unmarked and in bad condition the overflow car park to the side of the terminal building is a large lawn with some tarmac for cars to drive along.

The addition of this terminal means the free period in the drop-off car park has been reduced from 30 to 10 minutes. If this is what the chamber of commerce think is going to attract more low-cost airlines maybe a re-think is needed.",NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
bordeaux-airport,/airport-reviews/bordeaux-airport,Bordeaux Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,2010-06-09,The new low-cost terminal is awful. Not quite as bad as the inhuman misery of Marseilles- Provence but not far off it. Laughably it is called Billi - are we supposed to feel better about being treated like cattle if the shed has a stupid name? As you enter leave your dignity at the door you are now a piece of self-loading freight. They have not wasted money on seats information screens (there appeared to be one) staff computers and other luxuries. Surprisingly they have found the money for a 'duty free' shop (most prices seemed higher than in the supermarket). You will stand in queues with your luggage to show your boarding pass passport and of course a good 20 minutes at the 'gate' (ie a door). What really puzzles me is why they have done this; I have used the main terminal at Bordeaux several times with low cost airlines and found it perfectly adequate and not overstretched - why is 'Billi' necessary? I can only assume it is about putting people in their place and if you are a low- cost passenger that place is beneath contempt. If the people who design these horrible places read this have you ever tried using one of your terminals under normal circumstances? Probably not you are too busy enjoying the business class lounge. If you are responsible for managing one ditto and put someone who knows what they are doing in charge; also invest in some new technology - checking people by hand went out about 20 years ago at most airports. If you are a passenger complain write reviews and fight against this they have nothing to do with efficiency and everything to do with increasing profits through sub-standard facilities.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

There is not nearly enough room for the lines of people waiting to board. Thel snake thrugh the small terminal making it difficult for others to walk by. My fight was not through a jetway but via a shuttle bus. The monitor above the door we were to use first correctly reflected our flight and time and then suddenly switched to another flight leaving from another gate (there had been no gate change). Brazilians commented that a tourist (e.g. for the World Cup in 2014) would be completely lost. The bus trip to the plane was very long. For arrivals the directions on where to go for the baggage claim area (vs. connecting flights) were confusing. The bagage claim area is rather big confusing and dirty.

The fact that this was a Friday afternoon when parliamentarians may have been fleeing Brasilia to return to their home towns may have exacerbated the situation. To me it looked like an older smaller airport in the midwestern U.S. that could call itself international due to one or two flights a day to Canada.

Tickets are sold in machines or news-stands only (no driver sale !!!) so look around for coins. Terminal - absolute lack of seats inside and not visible security precautions.

The airport web site advises using the 'Airtrain' - or a taxi (they must be joking!) The Airtrain is in fact the regular service to the Gold Coast operating twice an hour so if you just miss one you have to spend 30 frustrated minutes on the platform from which the other terminal is clearly visible at the risk. And the train costs $4.00. (Only travellers arriving and leaving on Qantas flights have complementary travel by train.) There is a further inconvenience: getting yourself and your luggage to and from to the elevated train track; this may involve another $2.00 for the use of a trolley. There is an alternative: the airport-city mini bus service. The fare -- $3 when I last used the service - is paid at a kiosk just outside the arrivals hall and you have to wait nearby while a confusing sequence of mini buses bound for various destinations comes and goes. So inter terminal travel at Brisbane isn't a seamless experience and with trolleys and train fares factored in can cost around $6.00. .

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,Roger Stone,NA,2009-03-17,As a regular travelling through both the international and domestic terminals at Brisbane Airport I thought I would add my comments here. Compared to many airports throughout the world I have travelled through Brisbane Airport compares very favourably. Airbridges and steps to the aircraft tend to arrive quickly (unlike Heathrow for example) and immigration is mostly very efficient although I would recommend evening arrivals rather than early morning arrivals if you can plan it that way. Sitting next to passengers arriving from other countries I have noticed some confusion regarding transferring to the domestic terminal which is only about a kilometre or so away from the international terminal on the same airport and suburban trains are available for the transfer. However an odd problem I have noticed is that many in Australia seem to confuse the term 'terminal' with 'airport'. This means that you may be asked to transfer to the 'domestic airport' when arriving at the international terminal in Brisbane. Please do not be dismayed. This is in fact the 'domestic terminal' which is located on the same airport. There is no other airline-used 'domestic airport' in Brisbane separate from the main Brisbane Airport (as would be the case for example in Bangkok) The same issue applies in Sydney where the domestic and international terminals are located on the same airport despite what the confusing signs may tell you. The other main issue with Brisbane Airport is that although many flights now arrive from international destinations between 1030pm and 1am there are no trains into the city at all after about 7.30pm. The railway authorities do not seem to have realised this need. Otherwise both domestic and international terminals offer good shopping with airy walkways and plenty of parking and plenty of taxis are usually available.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

After going to the baggage drop-off and having my suitcase weighed and labelled I mentioned that it was hand luggage and the member of staff said he did not know what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but it would be more than helpful if there were signs saying where passengers with just hand luggage have to go to check in rather than have them queue in the wrong place. It would also be helpful if there could be signs (or staff) telling people well in advance when they will need to show their passport / boarding cards and what needs to be placed in the trays for scanning rather than wait until passengers are at the scanners and therefore causing unnecessary delays. On the return journey (EZY6002 on 9 April 2015) we were rudely told to show the glossy photo to the scanner and stand on the footprints on the floor. My mother and I had no idea what the two female members of staff meant and eventually one of them took my passport and showed the photo to the scanner but once we stood on the footprints the two members of staff wandered off leaving us unsure what to do next - the picture on the machine was confusing. After several minutes the two staff members were altered to the fact that we were still standing on the footprints and returned to tell us we could go through the gate all of which could have been prevented if the staff had taken the time to explain the procedure and waited to check that we had understood rather than wander off for a gossip!

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,2013-10-18,After my review in July I flew four more times to or from Bristol in the summer each time the flight departed from or arrived at a gate on the western apron necessitating at 350+ metre walk meanwhile every aircraft parking spot in front of or adjacent to the terminal building was empty. I sent an email to the airport politely asking why this happens as it seems inefficient on a number of levels and inconveniences passengers for no apparent reason. Two weeks have passed and no reply I assume there is no rational explanation. It also indicates the indifference with which the airport's management appear to regard their customers. For all this I am not entirely negative about the airport I have never encountered rude staff at security or border control as mentioned by others some appear rather bored and disinterested but to be honest it is not the most exciting job however they have always been polite. My opinion remains that Bristol is an acceptable airport let down by poor management whose only interest is maximising revenue at any cost.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1
bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Mark Thomas,United Kingdom,2013-10-07,"A place where the customer is simply gouged! Extremely poor access - small roads and no motorway access. Rip off car parking prices where your car is parked in badly lit and sign-posted areas. In the terminal you are again expected to stand around as the place when busy has hardly any public seating as it has been given over to Duty Free and other retailers who are allowed to charge what they want. Plus who else puts a large Starbucks in the middle of the concourse and builds a new gate system that is about a quarter of a mile long with no traveling escalator. It is dreadful when you see elderly people struggling after a long flight to walk all that way. As other people have commented many of the security and staff have a real ""job's worth"" attitude towards the people who ultimately pay their salaries - the customer - I find they are often the most officious of airport staff I have come across and I travel a lot around the world.

Departures have generally been quite good with queues for security no more than 5 minutes seating can be crowded particularly early morning but there were always some places. Flights particularly from the western apron are called early. Arrivals were not so good but just acceptable the passport readers were working but very slow - at least once it would have been quicker to queue to see an officer. My main gripe is the misuse of resources my last arrival was typical: the aircraft was parked at the far end of the western apron giving us a 400+m walk to the terminal building (they do at least advertise the distance). As we walked along we saw at least a dozen aircraft parking spaces closer (including 3 in right front of the terminal) none of which was being used. Surely a more efficient use of space that would make customers' lives easier is a relatively easy thing for management to achieve? Also why do you have show your boarding pass to buy a newspaper?

Car hire is a nightmare with the reception being a long walk without cover from the terminal and the car return is now about 100 yards from reception. I queried this with Hertz and they apologised saying it was an airport authority ruling about which they were not happy. Security is now vastly improved with friendly staff and more machines with an impression of thoroughness (they always query and thoroughly check my medical equipment). This last time I used the Executive Lounge and although the snacks are minimal there is a reasonable selection of alcoholic non-alcoholic hot and cold drinks. A receptionist who noticing that I was limping escorted me the quickest way to the boarding gate took me to the head of the queue and notified Ryanair staff of my problem.

I recognise some of the complaints from others are valid I heard several people complaining about the £2 charge to use a baggage trolley and sympathise (fortunately I had hand luggage only).

I was hoping for things to have improved since I last used the airport about 4 times last year. Not a chance. My first gripe is the outrageous car parking charges. £38 for a long weekend in midwinter is a bit over the top. Secondly charging for a trolley is profiteering. Why doesn't the government do something about organisations ripping off captive customers. Thirdly in an attempt to lure passengers into buying something from the shops after going through security the owners have reduced to a minimum the area available to actually sit somewhere whilst waiting for your flight. Finally big queues for immigration. Why isn't this facility given a bigger room and more border control staff? Come on Bristol. I'm even considering travelling up the M4 to Heathrow now.

The duty free shop is oversized there is simply no logic to the flow of passengers and dependent upon the gate allocated to you you may or may not be waiting on the right floor. If you are unfortunate to be using gates 14/15 be prepared for a very long and uncomfortable walk without travelators or escalators to negotiate the long distances and multiple steps and stairs. Arriving at these gates is equally unpleasant. Bristol has lost what it once had going for it when it was worth paying the overpriced car parking charges and baggage trolleys.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,2011-12-08,Bristol is my local airport and at last I feel I can say something positive about it. On departing this week it took 5 minutes from locking my car to sitting in the departure lounge I had pre-printed my boarding card but there were no queues and staff were cheerful. I also think they have increased the seating since my last visit there was plenty free. On arriving we were bussed to immigration but again no queue and I was driving out of the car park 20 minutes after landing. It was my best experience here for many years however there was still an absurdly early call to the gate - a 300 metre walk followed by 20 minutes standing staring at four grey walls. My flight left late morning when about 5 departures are scheduled in two hours and we arrived just ahead of the evening rush. It is clear that there are far fewer flights using Bristol this winter than in the summer or previous winters and at these traffic levels it copes well and is pleasant.

We were through security in 3 or 4 mins (about six or seven security stations open) and found strolling to the far end of the western walkway no problem at all and we are both in our late sixties. Before that we enjoyed an inexpensive lunch and wine (admittedly again on promotional offers open to anyone) at one of the eateries. We returned a week later on a Saturday at teatime and were one of six international flights 150-seat plus sized aircraft to have landed in a twenty minute period. Everyone to whom we spoke was polite which is our usual experience at Bristol (with the very occasional exception down the years) perhaps because we are always polite to them and try to co-operate with all requests. We were driving out of the car park within thirty minutes of our landing wheels touching the runway.

OK if you are reasonably mobile but are there more seats when you get to your gate? Guess. So that is another 15 minutes of standing around.

The design of the airport maximises transfer times due to large distances and a design combining multiple walkways and escalators. It took us more than 10mins to walk to the passport control from our flight gate. Several passport control desks seemed to be unmanned resulting in a wait of approx 90 mins to clear it. The only advantage of an almost 2hr transit between the flight landing and baggage collection was that the baggage was on the carousal when we arrived there. Upon arriving at the train station at the airport we had to wait approx 15 mins to be served as only 2 counters were open. During departure via Brussels airlines we had to wait 45mins to drop off our bags (checked-in at the airport kiosk) which is probably not the airports fault.

Generally it is a well-organised easy to use airport with good facilities. However two things are very irritating and both could be improved at little cost. Firstly if one arrives from a non-Schengen state and the aircraft is parked in a remote spot (as is often the case) you are taken by bus to the terminal. This is fine except the bus drops passengers at a door that is a good 200m from the immigration control point so a rush of people up the stairs and along a very long corridor develops. Why not simply drop everyone closer to the passport check point - there appear to be doors already in place? Secondly there is a train into the centre of the city: frequent regular and efficient.

Quite a number of shops which I didn't use; a previous report described them as expensive but all a/port shops are. Check-in was rather awkward because the area is rather small not much room for queues and already despite its newness can get very crowded.

budapest-ferihegy-airport,/airport-reviews/budapest-ferihegy-airport,Budapest Ferihegy Airport customer review,A Allen,United States,2015-06-24,"Arriving at the airport at 4 a.m., we entered to check in, check our baggage. We saw one massive mob in front of the KLM counter area going all the way back to the entrance doors. The small, designated line for baggage drop off and boarding pass printing kiosks were not visible. No signage available. We asked a person in line where to start. They pointed to where the boarding pass kiosks were located. There were no crowd control stanchions to designate a line in front of each kiosk. Having no choice, we joined the mob slowly forcing their way towards the kiosks. 25 minutes later, we reached a kiosk. Check in process was slowed by long response times by the kiosk. After scanning our passports, later on we were asked if we had our passport. Really? Kiosk didn't know it had already scanned it. (What we were not told by our travel company, Viking, was could we have avoided this hassle by printing our boarding pass at the hotel.) 4:40 a.m., boarding passes in hand, we joined the other mob moving forward slowly to access a very short line with crowd control stanchions. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6:10 a.m., would we make it? I got the impression the airport didn’t have a clue about crowd control, how to use more crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. At 5:20 a.m. we had our bags checked, headed to the security lines. Was shocked to see the security section had crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. Guessing the airport manager has never seen this, never actually gone on the land side the airport. Passing through security, we go right into a fancy, spacious, shopping area. Wow. Going through we reach the area to access departure gates. Was amazed at all the open space for retail sales, shops everywhere, no problem finding space for display racks, etc. No professional management, no crowd control, nothing. Airport managers must only live and work on the airside, never seeing the hassle passengers must go through.

Travelling on Air France and although the plane parks at Terminal C you actually arrive into Terminal B. The line for immigration can be long but just make sure you are in the right one. When I was there the line for Argentines was much longer than the non- Argentine one. Staff at immigration and customs were professional. Once through to land-side things can be a little hectic. On Departure Air France use Terminal C which is brand new. Immigration was fast and friendly. Terminal C has two places to eat a large Duty Free area and a few smaller stores.

I arrived at 10am 2.5 hours before my flight and was through check-in security and immigration in about an hour.

buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,Simon Smith,United Kingdom,2011-06-05,I found it a very good experience and better than many airports in the UK. There are two terminals. A is new clean and used by international airlines. B is old and (I believe) only used by some Aerolineas Argentinas flights. Arriving in terminal A I was outside having collected my bags in 30 minutes. Checking in opened 4 hours before the flight and I was through quickly. Departing it was all very organised and what appeared long queues at passport control and security went very quickly 5 minutes maximum. Some tips (partly covered already). On arrival best rates for exchange are at Banco Nacional. There is a desk in the luggage hall if this is closed then exit the arrivals channel completely and take two turns to the right. Much better rates than elsewhere. Taxis ignore all the spivs hanging around and go to Taxi Ezezia desk in the middle of the floor when you exit arrivals. 150 pesos to city centre including tolls. On departures there is very little once airside however there are several cafes landside including a McDonalds with an outside terrace. This is a good place to sit and watch events outside the terminal incessant hooting whistling etc which of course everyone ignores. I watched an amusing episode where two people cut each other up got out and hugged/chatted then cut each other up again trying to exit the drop off zone. Airside I found perfume to be cheap but everything else relatively expensive by local standards.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,Roger Stone,Australia,2010-08-26,Unlike other reviews I found EZE a fairly unpleasant experience. The boarding gate areas were almost always crammed and stressful places. The terminal seems to have very few good shops and poor information on arriving flights. In fact no information was available for arriving flights on any monitors I could find. I was looking to see how delayed my colleague's flight was on an arrivals monitor but cound not find one anywhere including the American Airlines- One World Admirals Club lounge (although the staff there were very helpful). Another reason for referring to arrivals monitors is to assess how honest the departures monitors are - eg: if the arriving aircraft from a certain airline is running many hours late it would be unlikely if its associated departing flight was on time. I found the general staff overly officious the business lounges incredibly small and crowded (don't use the Iberia One World Lounge - it reminded me of a very small regional airport lounge in Australia) and the restaurant and food outlets extremely limited. In winter poor foggy weather can cause major flight delays so be prepared!,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,B Diener,Canada,2010-08-22,I arrived and departed from EZE. To fully enjoy this airport you really have to like waiting in line. Upon arrival you have to wait in line at immigration which is normal at most international airports. However when you depart you have to wait in line at the check-in as the check-in kiosks aren't common at EZE yet. In addition you have to wait in line for passport control and of course security. The security check is fairly thorough but they only have a few stations which causes huge line ups. I really appreciated the smoking room in the departure level as well as the pretty large duty free shop. When you depart from EZE in the evening you need to leave for the airport on time. The trip from downtown Buenos Aires can easily take 1.5 to 2 hours during rush hour. The public transport to/from the airport is adequate.,NA,NA,NA,4,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I was prepared for a hard time in an airport which has not attracted good (or even adequate) reviews but it was not too bad. Upon arrival (mid morning) my only comment would be that Immigration was heavily overloaded although they did their best to process us as fast as possible. Luggage delivery time was quite reasonable. We arrived early for departure having read all of the comments about delays - it took us about 45 mins to check in pay our tax and get through security and immigration.

buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,S Koenig,NA,2008-04-28,Most comments are concerning EZE the international airport outside of town. The domestic airport near the city center is smaller and simpler but relatively modern with plenty of dining options. Do beware of theft: my digital camera was stolen from next to me when my back was turned. There was no place to report this within the security area (woman at the info desk suggested I look for someone outside of security and when I later at another airport asked an Aerolineas Argentinas rep about asking whether a camera had been turned in she essentially said kiss it goodbye). Back at EZE one point is that the most obvious money exchange places as you exit give the lowest rates. The national bank branch giving the best rates is outside of security and a couple of turns to the right. Not at all obvious. Ditto on taxis: those easiest to find are very pricey. For cheaper ones you need to hunt a bit outside.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site; other such as Budget and Enterprise require a shuttle bus) I quickly walked to the terminal and got a luggage cart and we returned to the terminal and checked in. I think we were the only ones in the TSA security line. Breezed through. There is one restaurant outside security and a smaller eatery and bar inside. A couple of small shops inside the terminal.

Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed.

cairo-airport,/airport-reviews/cairo-airport,Cairo Airport customer review,Adam Simmons,Spain,2013-09-15,"For an airport which is less than 5 years old and which was (presumably) purpose-built for its home carrier Egyptair CAI is a horrific experience. The terminal is built in a V-shape  with F and G gates extending along the arms of the 'V'. H gates are for flights accessible by bus and the gates are downstairs at the base of the V. There is no real holding area where passengers can wait for their flights except two largeish restaurants. As a result the arms of the terminal (i.e. the F and G gates) are severely crammed with passengers awaiting flights. The layout of each arm means that access between the restaurants and the F/G gates re often blocked by passengers queuing for flights and every available seat was taken. I visit the airport twice in September. On the first occasion I was changing from Egyptair to Ethiopian (both international flights) and had to hand in my passport for it to be checked by immigration. Surely this contravenes the laws of international transit? I then had to go back downstairs to international arrivals to pick up my passport and get a re-issued boarding card one hour before departure of my ET flight. On the second trip I was changing between MS flights so I thought ""great no problem"". However my onward boarding card was handwritten and was forced to join the long international transit passenger queue by some unpleasant jobsworth. There were around 10 people behind the counter but only one was actually doing any work. It was only when a second official asked if anybody had an onward boarding card that I managed to queue-jump and get a re-issued printed boarding card quickly. Internet access is available outside one of the several lounges for Star Alliance Business/First class passengers. Finally there is a smoking room opposite gate F2 but this was simply disgusting: dirty too small and with just three chairs.

I spent 30+ minutes in the business/first class line because they allowed individuals with group passports (5-10 passports in a stack) to cut ahead of the business and first class passengers in line!

So it's great for passengers at the moment - huge amount of space short queues for everything lots of road access and parking great views of the runway good lounges.

However an annoying issue is that now Canberra Airport's Terminal managers have decided to play terribly loud music through the main buildings. Why on earth this decision has been made is beyond me - it certainly doesn't fit the style of the average passenger passing through this terminal. Indeed its enough to make me try avoid this terminal and make a point of not buying anything from the commercial outlets.

canberra-airport,/airport-reviews/canberra-airport,Canberra Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,NA,2009-03-13,"Day return from Sydney - only had hand luggage so straight off plane (airbridge) and into terminal. Bus fare seemed reasonable ($9 one way $15 return) but I wasn't aware until told by a policeman in the terminal that it was a public holiday so bus service to town was infrequent. He told me where to find the bus stop (easy enough) but there was no timetable! I got a taxi instead. Departure was rather more troublesome - I had checked in for both flights in Sydney so didn't need the check-in facilities at CBR but finding a seat that was out of the quite fierce sun was rather difficult. Food prices were also high ($6.50 for two sandwiches $3.50 for a small bottle of soft drink). Then when I went through the scanner for security everything I was wearing set it off! I had to take off my belt then my shoes but it still beeped because I have metal pins in my feet. When I asked why I had not had any similar problem at SYD I was told ""our scanner is more sensitive!"" Way too sensitive is more like it. No airbridge this time - just a very short walk to the plane.

The problem here has consistently been complete and utter lack or organization and not enough staff and officials to process people. On top of that they just don't care. The airport authority doesn't care and that filters down to all the staff and immigration guards. I am not an airport official but I am an efficiency expert in my field of work. I would love to have a week in this airport and overhaul all of their processes! New cash grab! Smokers do not bring more than one carton of your homeland cigarettes through this airport! They will fine you 500% of the value of one carton for the excess. They consider it ""foreign merchandise"" and it will be taxed. I watched dozens of people utterly flabbergasted by this new tax grab. Be prepared to have all of your bags and luggage rescanned and searched. The trouble with these officials is they don't get the difference between what is coming into the country and what is being taken out.

There was only a small immigration queue and passengers appeared to be processed relatively quickly and the immigration official was pleasant. Short wait for bags to arrive and we were through customs in less than 5 minutes - again the customs official was polite welcoming and helpful despite requesting an additional baggage search of the person that I was travelling with. My main criticism was after leaving the terminal building it was unclear where to go for onward connections using public transport. On the return journey the airport was extremely busy - long queue for check-in although the check-in agent and BA's ground handling team generally were pleasant and helpful. We were very grateful for a short and efficient security process. No BA lounge so used the TGI Fridays which again was very busy but decent food at an ok price as we had complementary BA vouchers. Decent range of shops and managed to find a postbox for my postcards despite being told by several airport employees that there was not one in the terminal. Boarding was crazy but thankfully I was entitled to use the priority line.

cancun-airport,/airport-reviews/cancun-airport,Cancun Airport customer review,M Keenan,NA,2009-02-04,"Third world airport is a scary sounding phrase but Cancun airport doesn't deserve the scary reputation that this suggests. In several trips through Cancun in the past three years I have never had a problem. On arrival transiting through immigration was reasonably fast and checked baggage always turned up quickly. Sometimes (if your 'number comes up') Mexican customs makes a more thorough search of your baggage (including x-raying) but even this wasn't too much of a problem. On departure I’ve found that the airport processes people quickly and that security line-ups are minimal. There is plenty of comfortable seating in the departure area and many options for the shopper or traveller with time on their hands (including one of those typical Mexican pharmacies that sell just about any kind of drug without requiring a prescription). I only have two issues with Cancun: Firstly the number of time share hawkers waiting to pounce on you right after you exit customs some masquerading as representatives of the tour companies. Just ignore them and keep walking. The other issue is temporary – Cancun is building a new runway and the road network is a little messed up while construction is in progress making it slow driving in and out.

caracas-airport,/airport-reviews/caracas-airport,Caracas Airport customer review,Alasdair Brooks,NA,2010-08-26,Nearly two years on from the most recent review by A Hetier and much remains familiar at Maiquetia. Entering the country is easy and immigration is quick and friendly. Leaving the international terminal however is a far more stressful experience. The problem seems to stem from the multiple security agencies operating at the airport who often duplicate security checks. So one set of police screened everyone queueing at the check-in desk. Once in the customs/immigration area carry-on bags were x-rayed twice in rapid succession by two entirely different security groups. Then - and this was the real delay - passengers were called from the boarding gate in groups of 5-7 at fifteen to twenty minute intervals to go down to the working area of the airport for hand inspections of their already checked-in suitcases. I was in the penultimate group to be called down for an inspection at 6 PM - for a flight that was supposed to have left at 4:20. Some passengers claimed that TAP (with whom I was flying) and Iberia are singled out for this type of additional security check; others claimed it was common on all international flights though perhaps not to the same degree we were experiencing. I can't verify either of these claims. And even after these suitcase checks our carry-on bags (already x-rayed twice remember) had to be be hand searched in the airbridge by the same police force who had been checking our passports at check-in. These constant overlapping checks can cause significant waits and long delays. It took me two and a half hours to complete the check-in and immigration formalities and after that my flight was then almost four hours late leaving. Do also make sure that you have _more_ Bolivares than you think you need for taxes as all taxes have to be paid in cash. In addition to the airport tax (currently BsF 162.50) I had to pay an additional BsF 30.50 at check-in as the separate departure tax - usually included in tickets - had gone up in August forcing everyone to pay the difference in cash. Several passengers had only brought enough Bs to pay the airport tax and were placed in some difficulty since the ATMs upstairs only accept local Venezuelan cards (in a pinch some of the travel agencies downstairs will reportedly forward you cash; at a price). For all that airside is modern with plentiful duty free and food options - some of which will take a non-Venezuelan credit card - so at least you won't go hungry. I also used the domestic terminal several times in July and August. This is considerably easier to leave than the international terminal and I always found it a pleasant and stress-free experience. Do be careful though if your flight is using Gate/Puerta 5. This is not a standard gate but rather where the buses for smaller planes that don't use airbridges leave from; announcements for boarding are called out by an airline representative and actual boarding does not always match what the airport departure boards claim is happening. You need to pay attention and speak enough Spanish (not a huge amount to be honest) to understand these verbal boarding announcements. Like international airside in the domestic terminal is clean modern and with plentiful food options. The usual warnings about not taking unlicensed taxis from Maiquetia still apply; if at all possible have someone meet you and if this isn't possible only take an official taxi booked from the official desks. The warnings about robbery and express kidnappings from unlicensed taxis should be taken very seriously. Harassment inside the terminal however isn't as bad as some airports I've used. It was less full-on than the old Bangkok airport for example.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On arrival migration services seem more efficient (search me...) and luggage is delivered efficiently. It is a pity not to be able to get money from an ATM in the international space (only local cards seem to work). On departure when you pass migration you get into a renewed part of the airport with plenty of space totally different from the departure area which is crowed.

Drop-off area was good and no charge (well done CWL). Check-in staff were fine security was no worse nor no better than most airports we use so all in all not bad. As part of the modernisation Cardiff seems to have followed the Bristol plan - enlarge the Duty Free shops at the expense of seating - not good.

There are good dining options upstairs and they can be reached by an escalator at the very far south end of the terminal that is is you can make your way past the thronging check-in queues. Looking for the toilet? Back downstairs you go and through a labyrinthine corridor and you will find them but if they are not closed for cleaning they will be reduced to an unusable state. Once you make it past the interminable queue for the security check be sure to keep an eye on the one central FID. Announcements regarding delays or gate changes (for those flights lucky enough to be parked at a gate) simply do not exist. Seating and toilet facilities airside are extremely limited and you will almost certainly have to take a bus to your aircraft on a stand-off bay.

We arrived quite late from HKG and had to wait quite a while for immigration to process our full flight together with a PAL flight from Japan. Luggage claim area was like stepping back in time....a bit dodgy but ok. Leave the terminal and you are literally bombarded left and right by taxi drivers and money exchangers. Leaving was a different story. The check-in desks for the international departures are behind doors that are kept locked until a few hours before departure which means you are sitting in a rather dingy terminal until your airline is ready to check you in. Security is a joke but that didn't surprise us after being in the Philippines. Once you check in you have the option of going through to the gate or back into the main terminal. We were told to go to immigration and were surprised with the fact that we had to pay an airport tax P 550 or $ 11. Once through passport control you are at the gates. There is ONE store: Phlilippes Duty Free (total rip- off and joke) and two cafeterias which were asking ridiculous amounts for everything on the menu. As the gate area was kept closed you wait in a huge area behind passport control just behind passport control. We had a laugh as we stood (there were only 5 chairs) behind the passport control people who were playing video games on their computers. That explains why they snarled at us when we arrived! We interrupted them!!!! Other than stand and wait you can be massaged by ladies that await you when you clear immigration who bother you even when you barely look in their direction.

After that we queued again to get through security and this was a free for all with no system at all and the staff again were really slow and didn't seem to care at all. By the time we finally reached the gate the whole process had taken over one and a half hours! Had we arrived at the airport much later we easily could have missed our flight altogether! The airport clearly neither has the staff nor the capacity to deal with the amount of traffic it receives and is a shambles more akin to airports of the 1960's. This experience means we are very unlikely to ever visit Crete again and this is a shame as the island has much to offer. Since the island is very much tourist dependent the authorities need to get a grip on this problem as it is a disgrace.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

On the return we were on a small plane (Dash-8) from GSP. As expected some of the larger carry-on bags were taken from us and put in the baggage hold and given tags to retrieve the bags upon landing. Upon arrival the unloading of bags on the tarmac seemed to take a long time and when a thunderstorm approached we all had to go inside. Finally the workers were allowed to get our bags and gradually put them in the terminal where we waited. The airport is quite big and can take a while to traverse with somewhat confusing signage though certainly nothing like some other airports such as ATL.

The departures waiting area had nothing of interest even for Chinese travelers let alone foreign ones. There were several shops selling the same souvenirs at inflated prices. The shop girls were standing bored as no customers even entered the shops. There was one book shop selling only Chinese books and 2 restaurants serving standard bland and tasteless fare not the renowned Sichuan cuisine again at inflated prices.

For International Departures there are 2 main dining options before Check-in either KFC or local Chinese food. There are a few stores selling various local foods and some souvenirs.

chennai-airport,/airport-reviews/chennai-airport,Chennai Airport customer review,S Narayan,NA,2008-09-24,"Arrivals has continuously improved in the past 4 years. Passport control quick. Luggage arrival may take a while (30 mins to 1 hour); Customs is quick and easy. Smoking permitted inside terminal - a nuisance. Duty free can be purchased upon arrival not much of a choice though. Basic stuff. Foreign exchange - Thomas Cook office within the secure area available. Free local phone call permitted from assistance booth near baggage collection area. Most staff speak good english and respond well. Long-distance / international calls can be placed from telephone booths (labeled ISD/STD) which are manned and you can get receipts. If you have someone to pick you up at the airport: Clear customs; Exit immediately after customs and wait there. You will turn left to exit the ""secure area"". Do not do this unless you have seen the people waiting to receive you. If you have do not have someone to pick you up: Clear customs; Exit and as you turn left you will see two private travel agencies within the secure area (one is Akbar travels and the other is Airport Express). Both of them are prepaid safe reliable. Akbar costs 350 rupees (less than 10 USD) (as of Aug 2008) to a ride anywhere in to Chennai city. Tip the person who rolls your luggage (about 20 to 30 rupees); and tip the driver about the same. Walk very closely to the person who takes your luggage to your car since you might get lost in the crowd outside. MAA International Departures: Arrive at least 3 to 4 hours prior to departure time. Must have a ticket / itinerary printed and in your hand with passport to get in to the airport. No other options allowed. Check-in queues are very long and slow. Elite status helps (depending on airline). No food for purchase prior to check-in. Passport control is usually quick (max 30 minutes with a 100 people in line). Duty free available. Overpriced food available prior to and after security check (for your handbags etc). The food is actually good in the mornings (between 6 to 9:30 AM) and after that its not that great. Make sure you have a luggage tag for your hand baggage - this is true for all Indian airports. They will make you leave the line and go and get one. Also make sure you have exactly one piece of hand baggage...no matter what it is.(so fit everything in to one bag). Did not use any lounges. MAA Local airport: NEed ticket with ID to enter airport. Some food available prior to check-in. All luggage is screened with X-ray machines similar to international airport. These queues are long. Otherwise its generally quick to get through to check luggage and clear security. Individual airlines may be slow depending on quality of service. After security check there is extremely overpriced stuff to eat. A coffee dispensing machine. Its pretty boring otherwise. Nothing to do except people-watch. Most airlines need you to take a bus to the plane. Watch for the gates being called out.

Wow what a change from old Midway. Chicago Midway new terminal does not even resemble the old crowded Midway airport. A lot of room around the check-in counters and in the departure hall. A large corridor that connects the departure hall with the gates area. This corridor serves as a security check-point waiting line. Very large and roomy and can accomodate easily everyone. Departed during the peak hours of 7-9 am. Large food court and decent shoping option. The new gates area is roomy with plenty of seating space. If you are unlucky to use the old gates though (Southwest still uses some of the old gates) the same old very dense area with very tired look and feel. But these are phased out gradually. When returned docked at a remote gate and had to walk quite a bit to connect to the new terminal arrival hall. Once in the arrival hall luggage carousels are quite big and not too crowded. There are security personnel that make sure before you leave that you picked the baggage that belongs to you and not someone's else. Good connection to the loop via train only $1.50.

Terminal two lacks in outlets and other similar amenities but I only stayed there for a short while so no need. On the return I flew United from Pisa to Chicago via Munich. The international terminal five is horrible. We arrived at peak hour and it was hopeless. There were dozens of flights from Europe and Asia that all seemed to arrive at the same time. This caused lines that stretched almost down the entire hallway just to go through passport control. After that the baggage hall was chaotic. With mountains of luggage being taken off early from the conveyor belt just to make room for more flights. The entire terminal unnavigable with the amount of craziness that was going on. There was a line that stretched through the baggage hall and all around it just to get land side. The line took an hour an if someone had any connections they wouldn't be able to catch them.

However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare.

I use O'Hare regularly and find it as tolerable as any airport - none of which I would describe as pleasant places to spend time.

Also the structure seemed to be updated. But didn't have much time here and was running from landing at Terminal 5 to catch my connection to Terminal 1.

T5 is the best of all the terminals at O'Hare since it is smaller then the others so there is less walking time to get around it the car parks are just outside and Coach USA are outside every hour they offer good value travel (go their web site to see where they go) the train to other terminals comes around every 10 minutes and takes a few minutes to get to T2 the roads around the airport can be confusing but that can be said about most airports.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

I had to line up for over 1hr to go through security so with the hour long wait for immigration & the hour wait to line up and go through security you need at least 3hrs if you are transferring to a domestic flight. O'Hare does need to have an Air Side transfer to reduce lines for security in the terminals otherwise passengers will start to go to other gateway airports.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Access to down town via the subway is good and quick. The biggest issue is in T5 and that is the almost absence of any decent retail outlets (food and drinks etc) either side of the gates.

Came into Terminal 5 - zero signs for international transit and first area you show up has 1000+ people in line. Crazy. Figured out by myself there must be a different place for transit but still lines by no means short. Once through the customs little info to help on where to go to get your next flight. Finally figured T1 so train it was. Then at T1 crazy long security lineup - why did they have me leave the security zone I was in when I landed in T5 to then go back into the security zone in T1 - job making I guess as it sure is inefficient and wasted 2 hours of my time.

United have fantastic baggage service for passengers who have to clear customs and need to put checked luggage onto final destination. 5m from customs clearance United just grab your bag scan it and put it onto the belt. Hands down best system I've seen in a long time. Children's museum in terminal 2 is must. Its more like a play area and my four children spent 2 hours there without any sense of boredom. Could have been there much longer without worry. Traveller's Aid Centre supplied free diapers when nearby vending machine had ran out. MacDonalds in Terminal 1 had no seating area.

I wanted to give this airport 4 or even 5 stars for the experience I have had of Terminals 1-3 however T5 drags it right back down. Departures: There are almost no facilities beyond security bar a few carts selling candy and cigarettes. There is no bar except for a temporary stand selling bottled beer - not exactly the way to unwind before a long flight. Before security things are a little better - you can at least get something to eat albeit at McDonalds. Arrivals: There's a long wait for bags however my destination has always been from Ireland where immigration is done before take-off so this mitigates that somewhat as we don't have to queue. There is a bar in arrivals (one might have considered putting the bar in departures?) and a shop but little else and the area is cramped with few seats. The rest of O'Hare is a pleasure but it's as if International flights are an afterthought.

The whole place is telling ""come here again"" but as to the functionality of the venue I have to say some unpleasant words. First cleanliness of toilets is a must not facultative. Second the fact that trolleys are not allowed at the transit train between terminals makes transiting painful for passengers with bags (especially for families). Third terminals 2 and 3 are not lit enough. In the evening arrivals areas on the ground level look gloomy. Terminal 1 is not well signposted. If you fly with United and your departure terminal is #2 you have to check-in at Terminal 1 and then go to Terminal 2 through a special passage for United domestic passengers. Stupid and terribly confusing for those who fly first time. I've spent some 20 minutes in Terminal 2 trying to find United check-in desks among ones of Northwest and Continental and then somehow guessed it should be at the Terminal 1. Food I ate at the outlet near the gate (Terminal 2 airside ) was iedible. Departing from Terminal 5 on British Airways was a difficult experience.

The worst aspect of it for me was the 50 metres my elderly mother had to walk in the icy wind from the only drop-off point to reach the terminal (200 metres to International Arrivals). There is neither roof nor windbreak. Wheel chairs are available only once you reach the terminal. Have a look at Auckland: out of the car/taxi/bus - into the terminal; Singapore Wellington and thousands of others including the old Christchurch airport the same. What genius designed this in Christchurch? The regional terminal is a zoo with grossly inadequate facilities - especially seating - to service the volume of passengers. The old airport used to be pretty good - perhaps a bit of a mess in terms of design but it had a lot of character and history behind it. The new(ish) International Lounge area is also good with lots of glass and natural light and good passenger facilities.

copenhagen-airport,/airport-reviews/copenhagen-airport,Copenhagen Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,France,2010-05-03,Arriving at pier A resulted in quite a lengthy walk to the exit area. Had carry-on luggage only but noticed very long waiting times for baggage reclaim. Railway station located just after exit. Ticket kiosks easy to use but check that you use the correct machine - DSB kiosks sell tickets for all Danish destinations grey SJ machines are mostly for long-distance cities in Sweden red or violet Skanetrafiken machines sell tickets for Southern Sweden. Transfer to the Swedish city of Malmo is convenient - modern regional trains shuttle over the Oresund bridge every 20 mins. Travel time is around 25 mins and costs 105SEK one-way. Departing CPH is a mixed experience. Self-service machines did not work properly so had to lose half an hour as only two check-in desks were open. Flying back on Saturday evening meant no waiting at security. However staff there very unfriendly not to say downright rude - no words spoken only some vague gestures. Airside the terminal resembles a large shopping mall. Catering facilities overpriced but of good quality - spent around 150DKK for an orange juice and three fresh open-faced sandwiches.

corfu-airport,/airport-reviews/corfu-airport,Corfu Airport customer review,Derek Coster,United Kingdom,2013-07-30,Pretty poor airport but it does the important things ok. Food and drink wise there is a cafe/bar landside and some sort of Taverna outside but all you have airside is a smallish outlet serving sandwiches/pies and drinks (if you're lucky) and unbelievably doesn't accept cards of any type. Worse than that there is no allocated seating beyond a few small stands. Just to round things off the staff were rude and miserable. There is no cash machine airside nor is there a drinking fountain should you get thirsty and have no Euros. On top of that you are packed in with far too many people for the seating available. There are a couple of duty free shops. Thankfully there is air conditioning or it would be pretty unbearable. If you are a smoker then get your fix before you go through security if you have a long wait for your flight as there is no smoking anywhere. Note take no notice of your holiday rep telling you to queue outside. It'll be boiling hot and there is nothing to stop you waiting in the air conditioned terminal or going to the cafe upstairs. A pretty poor show for such a busy (at least in season) airport. Corfu is not some small little island that only sees a flight a day and it should have an airport that is appropriate to modern needs. Having said that Greece is really going through it at the moment so nothing much is going to change anytime soon. It won't bother me though I'm not going back to Corfu again.

Then they couldn't get buses to take passengers to the plane last call was flashing on the screen and 100's of passengers were still waiting to be transported to the plane.

Avoid DFW at all cost if you have to transit in the us! They have 60 booths for immigration when I went through they only had 3 open for non US Residents which is not a great impression when arriving into the US. So many people were getting very angry about missing their connecting flights and the people on duty to assist with passengers who had tight connections spent most of their time talking to each other! I would really have thought that after building a new international terminal at DFW they would ensure that the passenger experience would be a great experience but I am sorry to say that DFW is far from it. The staff in immigration are rude and have a lot of attitude the airlines are aware of the situation when you speak to staff but they say there is nothing they can do about it.

It is very far from one terminal to the next. Both the monorail system (Skytrain) and the Terminal Link bus convey passengers to the different terminals. The terminals themselves are very nice and modern. Security screening involved lengthy lines although passengers in wheelchairs get priority. Unfortunately all the food outlets are airside so it is necessary to go through security screening before getting something to eat or if you are exiting the terminal you must get your food before you leave the airside area and take it out with you. Unlike airports in Asia there are no smoking kiosks near the gates; the smoking areas are outside the terminals. Immigration is in a huge room which was very crowded when I entered. There was a customs officer pre-screening passengers entering the immigration section. Customs itself was smooth and non-eventful.

Amenities are on par with other large US hubs but security checks rarely take more than 15 mins of queuing. Customs/Immigration is probably the fastest I have experienced in the US and although int'l transfer passengers must exit the secure area and undergo an additional security check this is not really different from any other US airport. Gate-to-gate transfers can be quite a trek given the size of the airport but are quite simple if your gate is closer to a Skytrain entrance. The biggest gripe is the fact that the baggage system is slow and outdated.

Arrival was painless. Immigration looks as if it will take forever at first but as soon as immigration staff realise it's going to be busy they open more desks and the queue soon clears. Customs scan every bag from every person as you leave. When returning you must have your checked luggage scanned before check in otherwise you cannot check the bag. Queues for check in weren't too bad but then I was 3 hours early for the KLM flight. Be prepared before going through security as although the queue looks long it moves fast and security staff get annoyed if they have to ask you to remove your belt watch etc but they are very pleasant if you are ready. The flight I was waiting for was leaving at 1:15am and there were a few international flights but the cafe was closed. The only place to buy refreshments was from a ""trolley"" however the coffee wasn't bad and wasn't too expensive but nothing to eat that was hot. There is one duty free shop with various items for sale (including washing powder?) and prices are okay. I walked from one end of the airport to the other which took 10 minutes at normal pace and only 6 gates had passengers waiting by them.

Domestic terminal for flight to Goa was a little chaotic. But terminal is bright and clean. Security is heavy but understandable. Good range of cafes in domestic terminal. On return transited from domestic to international terminals. Quite a long distance. Had to wait a long time for bus and it was very cold outside. International terminal was very pleasant experience. We arrived there at 11pm and our flight wasn't until 4am. But we were able to check in early and go through security. Duty free shops had a great selection and very cheap. Walking distances were short enough within the terminals as well. Overall a pleasant experience. And a great contrast to Abu Dhabi which was chaotic overcrowded and very expensive.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,2014-03-11,This relates to T3. We arrived International with a Domestic Connection. Immigration queues were short and did not take as long as last year our baggage arrived reasonably quickly but in order to catch our T3 domestic flight (same terminal) we had to go landside recheck in our bags and then go through landside security. This is stupid and takes a long time - why do they not have airside connections to Domestic we wonder? Hence the three hours connection time we had was only just enough. The airport itself has a reasonable range of facilities there is free wifi but you need a working mobile in order to use it (a security code is sent to your mobile).,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I still think this airport is great after 3 years. Lots of security checks but I would rather have that than be sorry later. Security staff not overtly friendly but their job isn't to be nice but thorough. I like the shopping which is pretty vast and found prices to be fair. Had a nice Indian lunch for Rs 200 ($ 3.50) which is significantly cheaper than a meal at any US or European airport. Boarding areas and bathrooms all clean. Arrival was also easy with 3 lanes reserved for business/first class passengers.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,D Gill,Canada,2014-01-25,DEL T3 is much better than what they had before. It is certainly more pleasant although the carpet color and design seems a bit too loud. The lines did seem a bit longer but nothing that one shouldn't expect. Airport seems to have more choices in terms of restaurants but unfortunately the prices are blatantly high. That is something that they should seriously look at. I think they are using international standards when it comes to pricing. Sadly that is not quite the same when it comes to customer service. I still found washrooms well below par and there were pigeons flying around inside the terminal. If you haven't used DEL before make sure you take the print out of your ticket with you otherwise you will not be allowed inside the terminal. Seems like DEL is the only airport to do that. Although I do understand that they only want to allow the passengers to get inside the terminal.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,2014-01-13,In transit from LHR to BKK with Air India. Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge).

Very important even if you are checked in online you need to get in a line for your boarding pass because your airline is not allowed to let you print out your document. I was told the check-in closes 2 hours before departure I don't know I arrived 25 hours before. When your hand luggage has been screened you get a stamp on your luggage/hand luggage/airline sticker with the date. This stamp will checked before you get on the plane. If you do not have this you are in trouble. So after security you should check your sticker/leaf for the stamp. And you need to get in the line many times. Without air ticket you are not allowed to enter the terminal. For the whole building there are 4 old blind men to check this documents. Imagine how fast this is. Then check is line immigration line security line enter the waiting room designated for your flight than one more old soldier who checks the stamps. I was lucky I did not find any crowd at any time. Every line took me about 3-4 minutes there were only a few international flight out that time (8 am). The terminal is huge to get to your flight you need to walk 2 miles.

It took about 35 minutes to get through immigration but the queue was constantly moving albeit slowly. There were plenty of free baggage carts available and clean free toilets although in both cases it did not stop an airport employee trying to get a tip because we wanted to use the free service. Our bags were on the belt when we got through immigration and leaving the airport was easy. We then flew internal from T3 and it was surprisingly easy and orderly. Very short queues pleasant staff and seats in the waiting area for our delayed flight. The drive from central Delhi to the airport took about 30 minutes but the roads were relatively jam free for Delhi on a mid Monday morning. Arriving back a few days later at the Domestic Terminal we were quickly bussed to the terminal our luggage arrived within minutes (it was a full jet so we were prepared for a long wait) and we were quickly out of the terminal past the numerous food stalls outside. Departing from T3 a couple of days later to London was a struggle. Check-in was fast but the queue for immigration took 30 minutes and that for security took nearly an hour – the problem being not enough staff on duty for all of the scanners (and this was at a peak departure time).

A few things I should warn you about specially if you've never been there before make sure you take your online flight schedule/ticket etc with you. I know it is only a printed piece of paper but the security personnel don't allow you inside unless you have it. No one is allowed inside the terminal unless he/she has a flight and they want to see the proof. Oh yes be ready to be checked at least three four times. Be ready to be approached by employees (from cleaners to policemen) asking for well let me just say some tip. Feel free to say a firm no.

While the outlook of the terminal is greatly improved I still had to wait in a long queue outside to get in. They have at least 8 entrances to the terminal but only 2 were open to passengers after checking of tickets and passport. Why not open a few more to ease the flow of passengers getting in!! Once inside another long queue at the check-in counter of Jet Airways who seemed to be checking in all domestic and international passengers at same counters.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,Ali Jacques,Australia,2014-04-21,"Generally speaking my views are identical to Mr Powell's review below. There were no ""aero bridges"" available for both my arrival flight or my Departure flight. The arrivals hall wad enormous spacious. I had arranged the VIP service through Garuda Orient Holidays so it took around 5 minutes to have my visa in my Passport. When my flight arrived from Brisbane there were already 2-3 International flights that had arrived before mine so was a rather long queue ahead but all Immigration counters were open and fully manned so the queue moved at a steady pace. All luggage came out at the one carousel what a mess. I waited around 10 minutes for my suitcase I was then whisked away to yet another long queue to have all luggage X-rayed. This process over you exit the arrivals hall into the mass of people from Hotels/Tour companies and the like waiting for arriving passengers. The traffic is non stop out of the Airport. Now the Departure information: You are dropped off at a ramp where you can get a trolley for your bags it's a short walk up to the first Security check where your bags are X-rayed takes a couple of minutes. Then if you decide to have your luggage plastic wrapped there are around 4-5 stations where this can be done. The ""check in areas"" are spacious plenty of signage areas A-E and the entire area is spotlessly clean. There are no restaurants/Cafes in the Check in areas a huge mistake as there were many passengers in need of a cup of coffee. After check in there was ample seating in the Departure/Check in areas whilst waiting. After check in you walk the short distance where you pay the IDR 200000 Departure tax (A$20.00). The waiting tine at this point was only a couple of minutes. Then more Security screening separate lines for both men and women moved quickly. Then we have the shopping Duty Free and a lot of high end makes Designer and beautifully displayed very impressive. They are set out whereby all passengers must pass by every single shop. There are a few restaurants as you pass by the endless shopping a little expensive but convenient. The Gate areas are well laid out but the carpet is somewhat worn. The Boarding gates they cannot get it ""right"" too many passengers running all over the place with the constant changes. The worst gate being Gate 10 where the majority of Aussie bound flights depart from and as in my case my Garuda Indonesia flight to Brisbane was scheduled to also depart from this gate along with 4 other flights on Virgin Australia Jetstar bound for Perth Adelaide and Melbourne. It was total chaos. Headed down the escalator to yet another holding area where all passengers on the four flights were jammed in like sardines with airport staff screaming out the flights to a lot of confused people never seen anything like it in my 40 years of traveling. The airport may be lovely when first observed but the organization of the Departure/Gate areas require urgent attention. My holiday in Bali was just wonderful but with the airport debacle at the end put a sour taste to my Bali experience.

denpasar-bali-airport,/airport-reviews/denpasar-bali-airport,Denpasar Bali Airport customer review,D Olsson,Australia,2014-03-10,My review will be less inflammatory than others because I have the good fortune to only ever use Bali airport at off-peak times. So I'll acknowledge that it's a massive improvement over the old terminal. There's more space and it's much more comfortable and attractive. There were still hints that despite spending a lot of money on a new terminal they still didn't cater to the existing demand (immigration took 20 minutes and there was a relative lack of seating airside otherwise things moved quickly). There are definitely still problems - hopefully some are temporary - that people should be aware of. Most flights are using buses at the moment and the terminal entrance where they drop you has 2 big steps and no wheelchair ramp - I saw 3 staff struggling to get a disabled guy up them. We didn't get arrival cards on the plane and there is very little in the immigration hall to tell you that you need one or where to get one (there were piles on some - but not all - of the VOA counters) plus there was one single desk in the entire cavernous hall where you could fill them out. Signage is not finished (or it's intended to be terrible) and it can be hard to see how to get from arrivals to departures (with a new terminal they really should have catered for airside connections) or where the taxi booth is. There are rigorous security checks before AND after check-in - the first one seems like an afterthought since there isn't enough room to do it smoothly. There are no ATMs in departures so if you forgot the R150000 departure tax (I had miscounted and I ended up R500 short!) it's back down to arrivals and then through security again. And what is the stupid serpentine gauntlet of shops that you have to run to get to the gates? I wonder where this horrible trend started - I know Sydney's done it for decades (but mainly in arrivals). All up a massive improvement over the old terminal in off-peak times.,NA,NA,NA,6,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

We didn't have any real problems with VOA Immigration and Baggage collection. No doubt we were the only flight in at that time. On the way out of Bali - 2nd January it was another story. The first security screening was grossly inadequate. The queues were massive and as there appeared to be only 2 x-ray points it took forever. I pity the poor tourists in front of us who waited for approx. 45 minutes in the queue to be told they were in the international departures area not domestic. No signage of course. Once through the first security screening it was another long wait to check in. Purchase of the departure tax was quick but the next queue through immigration was very long and slow. There were more people collecting the departure tax than there were checking at immigration! The fact that we are now forced to walk through an enormous duty free ""hall"" is annoying. Whilst it appears most airports are doing this it would be nice to bypass them. There are no restaurants just a couple of cafes with a couple of tables each and a couple of ""hot dog stands"". There is little seating and plenty of people were sitting on the floor. You can't go to your departure gate to sit down because you don't know which one you are allocated to until it is announced. Once at the departure gate the duty free purchases were wheeled in on a flat bed trolley!!! We had to get on buses to board the plane. The first two buses delivered passengers and then didn't reappear with new passengers for an hour.

I was arriving on Malaysia Airlines from KL and our flight was delayed for 1 hour. Maybe that was the reason that there was nobody queuing at immigration and we were outside within 20 minutes after arriving. Immigration and customs took no more than 5 minutes as my passport allows for a visa free entrance to Indonesia. Once you leave customs there is a long row of money changers but don't be a fool and change money there. The rates in town are much better. Our arrival was very efficient and I could not fault it except the long walk from our gate to immigration which took about 5-10 minutes as gate 2 is at the far end. Departure was not as good as you already have to pass through security just to enter the building. Check-in was ok and took a while even though we were already checked in online. Paying the exit tax was pretty straight forward and involved no queuing. Once pass immigration there are a few shops but the prices are not competitive if you compare it to other Asian airports in the region. The airport is old but I have seen worse. You pass through security again at your gate and once inside there is nothing much so do not bother going to early. Boarding was civilized but the infrastructure is really outdated. The gate agents set up a microphone and stereo set to announce the boarding calls as the gate did not have a speaker system.

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,F Martin,United States,2014-07-03,My biggest complaint with this airport is that the layout was confusing for me on my first arrival in terms of figuring out how to leave the airport and get to the exit I needed to be at. There weren't many maps available to help me navigate so I essentially followed the herd and ended up at the wrong exit even though my pick up was able to find me later on. Amenities are OK.

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,A Morrison,United States,2014-03-29,Denver airport has flights departing all through the night but amazingly there are no facilities open for their numerous red-eye travellers. Lounges shut at 2100 hours leaving you nowhere to rest or work after that time - apart from the airport floor. Surely extended hours would bring in business and provide more local employment? The airport is vast. It took about 3 hours to get from the gate wait for the train wait for bags wait for bus to the car hire lot travel to the distant lot and pick up our car. Combined with the airports location (on the wrong side of Denver) and the huge traffic jams on I-70 it's impossible to spend much of a weekend break skiing in Colorado.,NA,NA,NA,3,4,5,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

I was chatting to the CBP guy for 5 minutes since there was no one behind me it seems that immigration had been full at 2pm with flights from 'Asia' but is slow at 3pm for a while. I continued on past baggage claim (I only had hand luggage) and on to security screening again no queues. The staff were very friendly and we chatted about the difference between DTW and the madness at ORD and I was on to my next flight around 20 minutes from leaving the plane and half of that was chatting to officials. The elevators bring you out in departures at the central train stop so on to the train to the north station and the gate was around 2 minutes walk as usual I checked the gate and time I had time to freshen up and bought a Philly Steak which was very nice and around $5.00 soon after they were calling the flight. I have used the airport before without problems I have to give DTW 10 out of 10.

I'd allowed 2.5 hours for transfer and I did it 1 hour. Immigration were helpful - there were few US nationals and lots of internationals so they processed the US nationals in the US only area and then opened it up to non USA passport holders. Sensible. Flexible. Customs were fine. Next help was on hand to ensure transferring passengers sent their checked baggage to the right place. TSA processed us fairly and efficiently and before we knew it we were out in the terminal. There are 2 trains which shuttle back and forth incessantly so it's a quick way to the far end gates. Terminal staff seemed happy and helpful - even ground crew were getting merrily on with the work. The place had a very relaxed atmosphere though it was early afternoon with few flights.

The big fancy new Doha airport has had its opening delayed for several years and it shows as Qatar Airlines continues to expand its massive fleet despite the tiny overwhelmed airport that serves as its transit hub. A few problems to note: 1) The bathrooms would be a disgrace for even a small regional airport let alone a global hub. You would be forgiven for thinking the bathroom line is for boarding a plane because it stretches across the halls. Once you reach the inside there are more sinks than toilets. 2) During peak hours people are camped out all over the floors due to the lack of seats. Sleep is impossible because of the crowds. 3) Perhaps overwhelmed by it all staff are generally friendly but unhelpful or surly and unhelpful.

Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge.

Compared to many other airports it is standard during peak hours you hardly can move freely in the airport. The duty free is small with limited items available. For such a transit terminal it is not entertaining/accommodating enough. The toilets need improvement but still adequate.

What is the point of a smoking room if everyone stands inside with the door open? Duty Free badly laid out on the one side - during peak times you cant move - a very strange mix of products. The food/outlets selection very limited. On the 2nd leg of our trip - we arrived at about 12pm (airport very busy) and sat down at a table - were told to move by a staff member who said he needed to clean.

After our flight from LHR we wanted to freshen up and found the toilets very clean with large cubicles and plenty of paper towels. Duty free was expensive but there is a smaller shop on the 1st floor were you could buy small gifts books papers soft drinksetc at good prices. Next door was a Costa Coffee and we enjoyed a nice coffee for a similar price to Europe so we had no argument there. Didn't use the food court area but it looked okay nothing fancy and not much choice but was serving it's purpose. All in all it was an okay small airport which was very clean and comfortable my only one annoyance was the gentleman on our boarding gate who stopped nearly every non-white person who passed to check their details.

Like many others we were on a remote stand and a bus journey longer than average. However it did mean that you were dropped right by the Immigration desks and transit section. So you didn't have to walk far. Transit processing very quick and I was in the departure lounge 5 minutes after getting off the bus. Doha Airport is small which means that all the departure gates are within the same area - no walking miles. Duty free shop small size good choice of usual items but a bit chaotic due to lots of people. Prices same as other international airports. The food court was small and also chaotic - food below average so dont rely on this! Nowhere to get a beer. My lay over was only 80 minutes but this soon passed as boarding for my onward flight started 50 minutes early due to the plane being on a remote stand. The experience on the return journey was very similar. For both flights we were ready to depart well before scheduled time.

When I arrived the queue for the baggage screening was short so was straight in checkin was fast immigration was not so fast and final security check was okay as the immigration lines were throttling the amount of people trying to get through. Once inside you go straight into the duty free area of which there were plenty of cigarettes but everything else seemed to be lacking for example the only decent champagne was a '98 Dom Perignon everything else was Moet or less. To be honest they did have everything you could want i.e. electronics Mont Blanc Hugo Boss etc but the range they had of each was limited and expensive compared to UK High Street prices. There were a few shops on the upper level but the main shopping was a large single shop on the lower level. Food was also limited no restaurants just 2 food courts at separate ends of the terminal both were very busy until gone midnight then they were almost deserted. Opposite the far food court was a small childrens play area. One thing you could find plenty of was toilets and smoking rooms however some of these are 'hidden' so most people crammed into the smaller easily accessible rooms whereas the larger rooms were empty. At the far end of the terminal were a mosque and next to it a quiet room. The quiet room has very comfy chairs but none were free so a few people were sleeping in the mosque despite the sign ""No sleeping in the mosque"". On a previous visit here I was with BA and had lounge access this makes the airport a much better place to be.

Short connections of anything less than 2 hours should be avoided. Transit security has not improved at all in recent years. Emirates increasing use of A380's on the routes I fly has reduced the amount of bussing from remote stands which is good.

You seem to have to walk a very long way between gates particularly if you are moving from A gates to the far end of the B gates. If your incoming flight parks on a remote stand - as mine did - your transit time can be very long. On the plus side the Emirates lounges are good - if you get the time to enjoy them.

Terminal 3 - the dedicated Emirates terminal - is the best of the three. It's modern bright and airy.

Terminal 1 immigration queues look much longer; I was lucky enough to be travelling business class on the way in to Terminal 1 otherwise I might have been stuck in immigration for well over an hour. Terminal 1 is also clearly just a little bit more run down around the edges than Terminal 3. Metro access to Terminals 1 and 3 is straightforward and often a good alternative to taxis. Terminal 2 - where budget airlines are based - is infamously on the other side of the airport and isn't accessible by Metro (and personal experience demonstrates that taxi drivers are very reluctant to take you the short distance from Stadium the closest Metro stop) though it is walkable when it isn't too hot.

So that's the thick end of an hour just to get into the Departures Concourse where Emirates expect you to turn up at the gate 35 minutes before departure time and do another 20 minute bus ride back to where you came from. You can just about make a 2 hour transit connection - IF the flight's on time and IF you don't need to go a toilet in the Terminal. Any shorter forget it. The reason for all this? Well it's because DXB has more flight slots than they have gates to service them. And who ends up with all the bussing nonsense? Well Emirates the home carrier of course because if they bussed Cathay Pacific passengers then Cathay Pacific probably wouldn't bother flying to DXB next year.

Meanwhile back at the gates there are dozens of foreign airlines neatly parked at one of the 200+ gates. So why are Emirates bussing so many passengers at DXB? Well the airport have sold all of these Landing Slots into an airport which is simply not big enough to park all the aircraft at gates so in order to squeeze them all in the national flag carrier is bussing passengers to and from parking areas - at their home airport.

OK so it looks impressive from outside and it is impressive inside but when your inbound flight is delayed and you have to get to your outbound connection in 20 mins it is not easy. The airport is too large and there should have been more thought put into how passengers get around in transit. We had to go from our gate to security then all the way back out to the gates. There were large queues at security and there was no allowance for the large group of passengers who were rushing for the connecting flight. There were very long queues at security. The duty free areas were OK but the stalls in the middle of the corridor/walkway meant that with passengers going in different directions along the narrower walkways it became congested at times.

I prefer the Emirates Business Lounge in T1 to that awful place in T3. Also Emirates have a bad habit of going from Gate Open to Boarding and onto Final Call - all in the space of 10 minutes some 40 or 50 minutes before scheduled flight departure time - and having passengers all dashing across this very large terminal only to have to wait 20 minutes before they can actually board.

Toilet facilities especially atrocious both in terms of location and capacity - with a large number of people needing to queue. Return in transit to GLA from MEL. The transit times at 5-30am were OK (ten minutes for security no passport check required) but it was not helped by Emirates policy of parking aircraft miles (literally) away from the terminal and then bussing us.

The queue for the electronic passport clearance stretched across the entry door making it difficult for people to get in. By the time we did we were soaked along with a couple of hundred other people. I considered asking my wife to wait with the luggage while I ran to the car in long stay 2 but I could not see any obvious place for her to wait so already being very wet we just walked. There is no transport to this car park. When we were ready to leave the car park it took a while to find my way out.

This is far from the first occurrence since the new security hall was opened but this now appears to becoming the norm at EDI during any busy time. Escalators were roped off with everyone being redirected to the stairs and lifts. Staff appeared to be doing their best and calling out for passengers on flights closing to come forward but some staff were clearly inexperienced and giving out wrong information - particularly the guy at the top of the stairs who told me that easyjet+ customers can no longer access fast-track which is just plain wrong. He maintained this even when I showed him the fast-track symbol on my boarding card.

On arrival two weeks ago check in took over 45 minutes and there was only 36 people in the queue. There were two staff at the desk but one spent most of the time on the phone. After this we went upstairs to security which is a joke. Only two lanes open with hundreds of people waiting in line. Staff are off hand and rude. New security halls are coming into service which is great but why is there a need to provide such bad service at the old ones? Security needs to be done properly however surely more lanes can be kept open to get the passengers through. We arrived at the airport more than two hours before the flight and only just got on the plane with no breakfast and having spent not a penny in the fancy shops because there was no time left. Returning was no better. The plane disembarked onto the concrete and we were left standing outside the building in the rain for 15 minutes because immigration didn't seem to have its act together and we therefore were not allowed inside the building.

My real disagreement is with transport links there is a bus to the city centre every 10-15 minutes which costs £3 and when I used it took less than 20 minutes which seems as good as any other airport I know of in Britain. Obviously it will take longer when the traffic is busy however there is much publicity about a tram to link the airport and city to be opened in a couple of years so it is not really fair to say the problem is not being addressed (albeit rather late).,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

We arrived 2.5 hours before our flight time and spent the next 2 hours queuing to get through to the departure gate. Checking our bags onto the flight was relatively quick and straightforward however once through this stage we had to join the queue to pass through security. We had to go back through the bag check in desk and join the end of the queue which by now stretched to the far end of the airport. Did not appear to be any rational process or system in place to try and move travellers efficiently through this aspect of your journey. This was causing distress to many who feared they would miss their flight. We eventually made it through this stage to the duty free area only to discover that any chance of visiting the shops was not an option as the you had to join another lengthy queue stretching the full span of the terminal to get through passport control and onto your departure gate. Not acceptable and quite frankly shambolic.

Some good leather seating is provided in nice airy surroundings. However the 3 check-in monitors are very small and concentrated along one small area thus meaning passengers must walk up to view them.

It was only when we asked an employee that we discovered the desks for our flight. Even after we had checked in no desk numbers were shown on the screens. Security was quick and trouble-free.

Given that it is really hard to understand what they were thinking when they designed this airport. There are 3 predominant types of users: people with families going on vacation people who speak little or no English and the elderly. Given that fact one marvels at how disorienting poorly organized and poorly signed this airport is. Terminal 1 has high volume cattle car carriers Southwest and JetBlue and there is hardly enough space for the lines at the ticket counters the lines at security and the lines at the small eating places. TSA seems to have been trained to stop terrorism by confusing and confounding passengers. There were different rules about what to take off or take out as you're going through the machines in different lines and each line had someone shouting conflicting commands. In one you left your shoes on before going through one machine then took them off. The rental car center seems well organized. But finding it unless you arrived at Terminal 1 requires GPS and a 10-minute briefing upon arrival. One can wander the big parking garage for what seems to be an eternity. Best example of how this airport works is how one gets to the garage from the rental counter.: There are two pair of doors. You can see the parking garage which is outside of the building through the glass in the doors. One pair has the word ""Enter"" written in bold the other has ""Exit."" Above the door that reads ""Enter"" is a bright emergency sign that reads ""Exit."" Since they both have automatic operators you can only use one. This must provide FFL staff hours of amusement watching septegenarians try to figure out which door won't knock them over.

frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2011-03-15,"After reading horror stories about transit at Frankfurt I booked a ticket with 6 hour layover - how smart decision was it! Not just because Lufthansa delayed my inbound flight by 2 hours but even then having 4 hours to spend on transit I just made my connecting flight. I was connecting from non-shengen to shengen area of the airport. Immigration was open in the following proportion: 6 desks for eu passports (fairly empty) and 4 desks for the rest of the world. No line management no idea of what waiting time is and around 300+ pax from ex-China flights arrived at the same time. After 20 minutes of looking for someone who should expedite us to the right line I've just came to the eu desk (I'm not eu citizen) and went through it however need to say that the officer was quite rude asked me for ""invitation"" despite the valid visa been in passport so it took twice the time it needed. Then another escalator flight down and quite long line for security where all duty free alcohol is confiscated even if sealed and cleared for being taken aboard. Then 20 minutes of trying to get to the right lift going to Schengen A gates. There you're locked into a long wing of the terminal with couple eateries and nothing to do even for a short stop. Toilets smelly and not properly cleaned. In no way this airport is 4 star facility. And never again will I use it for transit.",NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
frankfurt-main-airport,/airport-reviews/frankfurt-main-airport,Frankfurt Main Airport customer review,Peter Goldsbury,Japan,2010-11-24,Other reviews have emphasized just how awful changing flights is here and my experience was no exception though my return flight from Geneva to Osaka was an exception. And my experience has been confined to Terminal 1. On a recent trip it took two hours to go from Gate C13 to Gate A40. There was just one official checking passports at the immigration gate for entering the Schengen zone so loads of passengers were pushing in with varying degrees of politeness because of their earlier flights. On the other hand transferring from Gate A34 to B23 was very smooth with the moving walkway in the connecting tunnel being fully functional and hardly anyone at the passport control. However after passing through passport control so quickly I had to waste time checking the departure gate for my flight. The departure gate for my flight to Osaka was posted on the monitors at Gate A34 but not on the monitors just outside the passport control. So I was wondering if there had been a gate change. Finally boarding the flight by row numbers proved chaotic though this might have been due to Lufthansa. Transferring via Frankfurt is like being an out-patient in a very poor ill- equipped hospital. This is because the publicity suggests that it is a wholly therapeutic experience.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

At one coffee shop they even began mocking a customer (in German of course) who had the nerve to request a bag to carry a muffin with her to the plane (and what kind of airport coffee shop doesn't have containers to let you carry stuff aboard with you?)! Beyond the obvious personnel problems FRA is cursed with a horrible design that goes to extreme lengths to sort passengers into areas based on their destinations - and clearly wasn't originally designed to do so. Signage is atrocious - one sign actually had marker scrawled on it by staff to clarify just which gates were in which direction. A horror to navigate made worse by the constant fear that turning the next corner will accidentally take you outside of one border/security area and require you to pass through that whole process over again. All this makes for a horrible journey point and I haven't even got to the interminable busses between plane stands and the terminals.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

On the outward trip the flight landed at B gates and the trip to Amsterdam took off from B13. I had to pass through passport control and security check but was ushered through the section for Business Class passengers and so avoided much queuing. The relative absence of signs and the general layout seemed confusing especially compared with an airport like Osaka Kansai which I regularly use. On the return trip however the plane landed at one of the remoter gates in Terminal A. On the way I asked at the information desk in English and the lady kindly answered in very flawless German that I had to go through a tunnel.

Both terminals are nice and modern though the domestic terminal may be a little crowded especially during peak hours. For the international terminal it's a pleasure to use. Immigration was easy to go through as there were not many foreigners on the flight that I arrived on. Also the departure gates are not far from the immigration area.

The balcony is on the second floor extremely close to the aeroplanes which offers great views of the runway too. It's a fairly quiet airport though so not many planes landing/taking off. The other facilities are standard if not above average. The price of a coffee is about 1.35 Euro before security and there is a small shop that sells general supplies for reasonable prices.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,J Long,Hong Kong,2015-01-19,This has to be the worst airport experience I've had. Check in queues are ludicrous - the airport simply cannot cope at busy times and you genuinely need to arrive about 3 hours before your flight. If not you'll queue for about 90 minutes then get pulled out into a fast track queue for those flights that are leaving in 60 minutes or less. Then this will take another 20 minutes which will leave you with no time to get through the horrendous security queues. At least the security people were smiling and trying to lighten the mood when we were there. Once in departures there is a depressing lack of any shops or decent food outlets and if you end up at one of the island gate areas there are not enough seats and barely any amenities. Luckily by this point you will probably not have any time to notice this as you will be running to catch your flight. I better not mention that Geneva also has a unique baggage priority handling system which is a polite way of saying they allow people to check in more than they're allowed and then don't load all the bags on the flight. It then takes 3 days to clear the back log! The arrivals part of the airport is no better with our bags taking over 90 minutes to arrive and the place seemed totally chaotic. Up escalators were not working in some parts so you had to lug heavy bags around and the whole place was drab and dreary. It reminded me of Luton train station in the 1980's which was not it's finest time. I live in Asia and the airports here put this and most in Europe to shame.

If you are not skiing on a Saturday when it appears to be bedlam (as it is not a big place) it is a fast modern and clean place. Fitting are generally high quality. It is true that it can be annoying that the airline lounges are before security as you can't stay in them up until the last minute as the time to clear security is highly variable. It can be very fast at slack periods or there may be quite a queue. If you want a high quality Swiss watch all the brands are there in Duty Free - an impressive selection. If you want to bring home Swiss food don't wait to clear passport control - it will cost you an arm and a leg. You should use the shops near the train terminal. The airport is simple to find bang on a motorway and the train station is built in. For info the most convenient car park the P1 is more expensive than the others. The P26 is the best.

You can get to France through the Swiss side terminal - just collect your luggage in the main bagage hall go out into the Swiss side and then walk upstairs (to the left I think) through a small door and you are in France! There is a place for someone to check your passport but I have never seen anyone there. The French side is much less crowded and has a full set of (albeit fewer) check in desks so you can check in and leave your luggage here without a long wait but be warned - you need a boarding card to go from France to Switzerland in the terminal so you can't go back to the Swiss side once you have left - make sure you have all your children with you! I have no idea if there is any public transport or taxis on the French side - probably not - but there is a full set of car hire booths (if you hire on the French side you must bring it back to the French side otherwise Herz or whoever will charge you lots of money to move the car about 100m). There are lots of shops selling pricy watches and chocolate and a reasonably good duty free - before security - but the cafes in the departure satellites (after the security has removed your drinks) are horrendously expensive - €3 for a small bottle of water anyone - but aside from that the only problem is the lack of seating downstairs however if you go upstairs near the frequent fliers lounges (follow sign for chapel) the lounges are usually empty.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There are armed security people at the entrance to the airport and prior to the car parking areas and only passengers can enter the departures area after providing their boarding pass. Visitors can enter with a visitor pass but have to remain in a small waiting area near the glass front of the airport. The staff are friendly and the security only took a couple of minutes. After security it was pretty much the boarding gate as others have said it's a small airport. Be warned there are no walkways to the planes and all connections are made by bus across the airfield. One concern I had was from the customs where there was a large sign advising passengers not to pay bribes if requested and to report any incidences by calling a number. Not the sort of thing I'm used to seeing but at least the authorities are starting to wake up and tackle corruption in India as it is about time someone did so.

The airport is busy and for a major tourist destination it is not a good face for foreign tourist coming and going.

Outside the airport there is a taxi rank usually stocked with cars for each flight and the bus to the centre of Gothenburg. Picnic tables are still outside on the grass where you can relax. Security is OK and then a smallish Departure Lounge which is very busy if 2 flights are going at similar times. The Duty Free has various things but no alcohol. There is a cafe selling hot and cold drinks sandwiches and similar and a small bar selling drinks. There are 3 Departure Doors of which Gate 2 has Passport Control for non-Schengen flights.

On the day we departed the queue for security occupied the majority of the check-in hall disrupting most of the check-in desks as it wound around the building. Having joined the queue to ensure that we made our flight we stood for 1.5 hours while people were rushed through to catch their flights. It appears the best solution at Grenoble is not to join the queue at all but to wait until they are rushing people through and get taken to the front and straight through security. The fun really started when we came to board. Having watched our luggage loaded to one aircraft at least we knew the plane we would be boarding! Wrong! Initially the wrong flight was called they called the flight 1 hour later. having questioned the staff at the departure gate they realised there take and called the correct flight number. As we walked to the plane across the tarmac we realised they were taking us to the wrong plane same airline. Having questioned the staff they were persuaded that the other plane on the apron was the correct plane! Very unpleasant experience.

However few restaurants once you get after the security check and the few coffee shops airside are a rip-off. Check-in (especially international check-ins) and security can sometimes have long queues. Last time when I transferred domestically in this airport I had to de-plane in Area A (the airplane parked at the international area as it was going to fly a international flight next) got on a bus that dropped me at the Area A domestic arrivals run across the airport (I'd say a kilometre long) to the departures lobby (no transfer desks airside) get to China Southern's domestic check-in counter to print my next boarding pass and go through security again to enter Area B and made it to the gate just in time. Luckily my previous flight wasn't delayed and I was flying 1st class so I can cut the lines I didn't miss the flight. Their 50 mins minimum transfer time is really tight.

All in all off plane got visa on arrival through immigration bags and customs in less than 30 minutes. Return arrived about 3.5 hours before flight. Drop off lobby incredibly hot and crowded but just sat and chilled until ticketing opened. Queue was fine got tickets and through all security procedures in less than 10 minutes. Airside some improvements made. Much more offerings. Not pressure to buy anything at all. Prices while a tad higher than in the city were not ridiculous at all.

The new terminal is clean and bright and a huge improvement over the old provided you are flying airlines that use it. Security seems totally confused and amateur compared to other airports and after checking in you simply deposit your checked luggage in a heap manned by security staff who seem distracted and uninterested in what you are doing. Worst of all is upon return it takes far too long to get your baggage. On a recent calm winter night we'd all deplaned a Delta flight and it took about 20 minutes before any luggage began to appear at the carousels. About 15 bags came out and then there was another 10 minute wait for 15 bags and then on and on. You can generally plan on waiting at least 30 minutes to get your bag at this ""small"" airport.

havana-airport,/airport-reviews/havana-airport,Havana Airport customer review,Julie Baxter,United Kingdom,2014-02-20,We have just returned from another visit to Havana after loving the place when we visited in Feb 13. The airport experience was much worse this time than last time. The taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong terminal but it was ok as we were still able to get to the correct terminal (3) prior to check in time. Check in opened and it took us around 1.5 hours to check in and we were about a 3rd of the way in to the queue so you can imagine how long it was for the people at the back! Luckily through previous experience we knew we had to check in prior to queuing to pay tax as otherwise that can waste your time! We queued for about 15 mins to pay tax then about 15min to change cash as we cannot change CUC back to sterling here. The woman at the change counter only had £20 in sterling so we had to have the rest in euros. Then to join the unmoving sea of people trying to get through immigration - there was 5 flights I think going during the same couple of hours and there was people being called for flights who were still stuck trying to get through immigration! It was crazy just standing there watching booths closing for the night whilst 100's of people needed to get through to the other side! The immigration people just seem to do each person in very slow motion - you can't spend 5 minutes per person when there are 5 large airplanes full of people to get through! It got to 20.50pm and our flight was due to start boarding at 21.15! My partner pointed out to me that there was still people on our flight queuing up at check in! The service in the duty free shop was beyond a joke and people panicking about missing flights ended up yelling at the guy on the till to stop chatting to his workmate and get serving people quickly - it was the only place we could get snacks and water to take on the plane as the food and service on the plane was absolutely dire. Needless to say the flight was delayed by 30 minutes purely down to people having such problems getting through check in and immigration!

I would advise contacting airline on the day of departure to check flight times. You do not want to spend more time in this airport than necessary. So many smokers and poor facilities makes it unpleasant. I know of 2 different parties who contracted serious illness as a result of eating the food here.

This because you could wander out onto the runway between planes arriving (there weren't many) and if you wished you could go to your hold luggage which was stacked on a trolley awaiting the plane's arrival and put things in or take things out of it. Many of the Burmese passengers availed themselves of this facility as our plane was an hour late arriving.

This airport has some negative and positive sides in my opinion. On arrival into HEL to connect to a flight to TMP within a very tight schedule I nearly missed my connecting flight due to long queue at immigration counters (all international arrivals at the same time). Airport staff did nothing to help those with tight connection time and were pretty hopeless. I were told that if I missed my connecting flight the airline would put me on the next available flight. Why can't they have a designated line/counter for passengers with tight connecting time? At the end I was running to my gate and was one of the last remaining passengers to board the connecting bus to remote aircraft stand. If they want to become a better transit airport in Europe either they need to look into this or Finnair cannot sell ticket with short connecting time (45 mins). On the plus side it offers relaxation lounge with sleeping cells for passengers. Yes you can actually lay down on a hotel-style bed and sleep with curtain lowered down for privacy!

helsinki-vantaa-airport,/airport-reviews/helsinki-vantaa-airport,Helsinki Vantaa Airport customer review,S Barker,United States,2012-06-17,I had overall great experiences at Vantaa at least for my purposes which were leisure travel from the US on Finnair from New York. I purposely booked flights to Italy that included layovers in Helsinki both coming and going. On arrival to Vantaa on a Sunday morning I was able to easily get information on how to get into the city (two convenient bus options) and a very well-stocked tourist kiosk had great maps and walking tour suggestions in multiple languages. Pretty much everyone I dealt with spoke excellent English with no apparent problem with dealing with a non-Finnish speaker (not always the case on the Finnair flights). My layovers were long enough that I spent two nights in the airport and I was pleasantly surprised at how relatively comfortable this was. The airport had free wifi that had a strong signal (or whatever you call it) and was extremely easy to log onto. Also lots of electric outlets available to recharge devices. There were both brightly lit and diimmly lit areas for trying to settle in for the night to rest a bit and the ones close to the Terminal 2 entrances that I stayed by felt very safe and secure. At the far end of Terminal 2 (across from the new Starbuck's which was overpriced by US standards) is a more or less full service 24 hour grocery store. This was great for getting food and bottled water at something like one-third of the price that the regular airport kiosks charged and also great for loading up on food souvenirs like chocolate and licorice before flying out. Another thing I appreciated was that credit cards were welcome for even the smallest purchases. I was out of Euros on my way back to the states but my credit card was happily accepted for transactions as small as a postcard and postage stamp. Lines for security and passport control were 1-2 minutes in each case for me so that was fine too.

Terminal 2 is simply not coping with the numbers going through. The security queue was enormous - worse I HAVE have ever seen at any airport! But luckily I overheard someone say there is a 2nd security entrance at the other end and I walked there and found hardly any queue at all! The Shengen airside is now a total nightmare. So over crowded it is almost impossible to use the shops or even just walk through. They should do something about this. On moving to non Shengen side past a long queue for passport check (another 10-15 minutes wait!) I found the gate for the UK flight (30) was right there but there was nothing near it . No restaurant no shops. You had to walk some 10 minutes (no travelators) to the Asia hub part where all the shops and the restaurants are to get a cup of tea and then worry about missing your call as you are so far away form the gate. It appears they are only interested in serving the Asian flights as all services are near those gates. Awful experience and very sad to see such a beautiful terminal have such bad logistics. Basically Finnavia seem only interested in keeping the Asian customers and have no interest in the European ones.

It may not be one of Australia's major capital cities but a lot of domestic and overseas travellers pass through Hobart just as we did on a recent trip south for the weekend. Tourism is a major earner for the state of Tasmania and brings in a lot of money so use some of it to upgrade this airport even further. A modern terminal building with aerobridges would be nice. We had to run to the plane during a heavy rain storm and its not pleasant sitting in a plane for a couple of hours feeling damp. The Qantas Club is pleasant but is tucked away in a little corner before security. Not the best place to locate it considering the Qantas Club makes boarding calls after the flight has commenced boarding. Overall Hobart airport does not send out a positive message for our southern capital which by accounts is going through a renaissance of interest from the northern capitals. Its all about appearances really.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
hobart-airport,/airport-reviews/hobart-airport,Hobart Airport customer review,Alasdair Brooks,NA,2005-05-12,I travel to Hobart 2-3 times a year from Melbourne. Hobart may be the capital of Tasmania but the airport's size and facilities reflect the fact that A) Hobart is fairly small and B) is not an airport you use to transit to somewhere else - there's nowhere else to go! Qantas has an actual luggage carousel but with Virgin Blue arrivals your luggage comes into the terminal on the back of a flatbed trailer with a consequent mad scramble as everyone goes for their luggage at the same time. I do wish there were better food and shop services; the dreary cafe and drearier bar are inadequate and the tiny shop is worse. There are no airside facilities - not even a toilet - but then it is a tiny airport and not one you're ever likely to linger in waiting for your flight. Though if you're arriving and are trapped there for three hours waiting for your lift to turn up (as I once was) you're really really stuck for entertainment. Last time I was there (Dec 2004) the old international terminal had been transformed into the new JetStar terminal but I have no idea what the facilities are like there. I occasionally here mutters about reviving the Hobart - Christchurch link and the occasional Singapore Airlines charter flight touches down (according to my local colleagues) but I can't imagine the international facilities were ever particularly extensive. In the end this is a single runway with a couple of glorified sheds acting as the terminal at the southernmost commercial airport in Australia. It's entirely adequate for what it does and realistically doesn't really need to be any fancier.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
hobart-airport,/airport-reviews/hobart-airport,Hobart Airport customer review,Xuess Wee,NA,2004-03-30,A small airport with only 2 opposing counters on each end of the domestic terminal serving only QANTASLINK and Virgin Blue with a common boarding gate and 2 cafes squashed in the middle. The airport is packed to the brim whenever there are several flights departing or arriving minutes apart. For a state capitol airport Hobart International Airport looked pretty understated with its outdated architecture style and grim interior. The good thing is that it takes only 15 minutes via coach to reach the airport from Hobart. With the signing of open air treaties it is expected that real International flights will descend into Hobart in months to come - and hopefully the largely vacant (and locked up) International terminal would be able to support adequately.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-10-31,Hong Kong airport is certainly very clean and has good facilities (water fountains etc) and plenty seating in the gate areas. Food-wise there are a couple of places (a Chinese place and a McDonalds) which while cheap for an airport are more than the same chains charge outside the airport in Hong Kong. The security queue's are almost always very fast (I have never queued for more than 5 mins even over CNY) but the immigration (arrival) queue can be a little frustrating and the bags don't always turn up very quickly (which I suppose is a comfort if you have to queue for immigration first it's not time wasted if your luggage still isn't ready). One tip travellers might be interested in knowing is that the shuttle train is not necessary - if you have time to kill and enjoy a stroll you can just walk past all the other gates to get to the other end of the train which travels underneath the main walkway. The main terminal is a 'Y' shape the train goes under the '|' part of the 'Y'. My gripes about this airport (my local airport) are that there aren't any relaxing places to have reasonably priced coffee it's a long way from Hong Kong proper and there is an annex which requires a bus to get to which is a frustration and not all that pleasant if you are unlucky enough to get relegated to one of those gates.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

While the airport is run efficiently and you will not find it boring but it lacks that extra personal touch that Singapore Changi offers i.e koi pond swimming pools massage area (in Hong Kong you have to pay to get into the lounge for massage) quiet spaces.

hong-kong-airport,/airport-reviews/hong-kong-airport,Hong Kong Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-01-10,I live in Hong Kong so pass through this airport a lot! It gets top scores but other than in comparison to other Asian airports I don't really understand why. It's not convenient to get to the Airport Express is only really suited for business men rather than locals and is also expensive (100$!). The busses are slow the airport is a long way from anywhere on an island. This is gripe number one because I often go to collect visitors so I make the trip far too often. My other gripes are that immigration is painful. I am resident but still need to queue up (albeit in the residents queue) which is better than most visitors - but still far too long especially on departure. The food/shop choices are poor. There is always an enormous queue for the food outlets none of which are any good (a basic sandwich shop would be nice) maybe McDonald's is the most popular (and cheapest). There is no cheap coffee either (except at McDonald's) and the shops are almost without exception fashion clothes watches etc. (all super expensive) which are useless for most people. Security is on the whole (surprisingly) sensible (that is not too strict on the >100ml liquids) and fast. It's clean and has a viewing deck (which costs money another sad point). Overall it's a shame this is my local airport given how far away it is from anyone and how pricey all the shops are. It's only saving grace is that the time to the airport is basically unchanging from most places so you can minimise your time there by leaving as late as possible!,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Travel into Kowloon by the Airport Express a breeze. On the return checked in at Kowloon station and took the Airport Express to the airport. Immigration and security quite fast. The thing I like about HKG is that while there are shops you do not get the feeling like at most other airports that you are in a shopping mall that has planes taking off and landing.

Amongst my six uses I had a late night departure and an early arrival and just about everything other than the food outlets was closed. However immigration was quick (first time) but very slow (second and third times in) - baggage on the carousel each time but considering how long it takes to get from the planes all the way into this area that's not really surprising.

honiara-airport,/airport-reviews/honiara-airport,Honiara Airport customer review,Chris McQuaid,New Zealand,2010-12-27,First time ever in Pacific Islands working for two months in Honiara. I had several trips to and from the airport collecting and dropping off our staff. K Joseph has summed up Henderson International extremely well. You walk from the plane to the terminal (it's less than 100 metres). Queue on arrival was not too bad and luggage was available fairly quickly. Plenty of trolleys but note that they are all kept by the baggage carousel. Be warned though that if you're bringing in any equipment for work (I had a couple of computer monitors with me) you will get stopped by Customs and charged a refundable import bond (only took ten minutes to get the refund when departing). If you need a trolley when departing the simplest thing is to walk straight through the open security door where you came out on arrival across the Customs area and grab a trolley - nobody will stop you (most of the time there's nobody there TO stop you!). Most departure days are nightmarish - the plane for Brisbane leaves at 3 pm and you really do need to be in the queue by 12. Although we had a couple of flights where it only took ten minutes to get people checked in the average was at least an hour an a half. The day we returned home it was over two hours. One advantage of the airport being only 15 minutes from the centre of town is that it's possible to check in really early and then go back to your office or hotel until after 2 pm. The only thing to make waiting at the airport bearable is the quality of the milkshakes - the best in town and at 30 SBD (about $5.50 NZ) it's no more expensive than anywhere else in Honiara. The toilets don't always flush and the taps on the hand-basins didn't work so use those facilities elsewhere if you can.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
honiara-airport,/airport-reviews/honiara-airport,Honiara Airport customer review,K Joseph,Solomon Islands,2010-08-09,Honiara on the island of Guadalcanal is the capital of the Solomon Islands in the South West Pacific and the only international airport in the country. The traffic flow into Solomon Islands is minimal - about six or seven 737 flights a week mainly filled with Australian government officials Asian businessmen and the odd tourist! The terminal itself was built by the Japanese Government about 2000. It is not airconditioned and can be very warm and humid inside given that Honiara is in the middle of the tropics. Due to water and plumbing problems the toilets can be unpleasant. It is a good idea to check in two hours before hand as check-in queues can be long as departure time approaches. Flights are often delayed but airport staff are unlikely to be able to tell you much - one way of checking to see if your departure will be on time is to check the Brisbane Airport website to see if the flight left Brisbane for Honiara on time. Customs and security is usually quick on departure but customs and immigration can be somewhat slower on arrival. Forget duty free shopping on departure - shop in Honiara town instead. On arrival sometimes the duty free booth is open and if so it does offer good prices on alcohol. All in all - a hot humid experience which will not leave you feeling terribly comfortable. On the plus side staff are usually helpful and cheerful and cleanliness has improved considerably over the last couple of years.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Traveling from here to the other islands has sometimes been unpredictable but I have had no real complaints. But now (2015) the usual difficulties of traveling out of Honolulu have been compounded by construction. Problems include crammed lines at agriculture security, no one to deal with priority customers (in my case American Airlines), a long walk and terrible mash up of a line up at the non TSA checkpoint (curiously my line this time around - June - was almost all females with children), one line for everyone, no faster lane as in almost all medium sized or large airports.

honolulu-airport,/airport-reviews/honolulu-airport,Honolulu Airport customer review,Mike Villanueva,United States,2012-10-27,Aesthetically Honolulu Airport is a throwback to the 70s. For a place that is supposed to welcome people to a tropical paradise it is heavy and dark concrete architecture. There needs to be more wood greenery and updates to the fixtures. If you are taking Hawaiian Airlines to a connecting neighbor island flight be prepared to walk if you are in the far terminal where some mainland and international flights are parked. Its even a farther walk (or ride on the Wiki-wiki shuttle) if you're on Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Seattle parked at the far terminal and we had less than an hour to our connecting flight to Hilo. It was a mad dash with several co-passengers in tow scrambling for directions. Fortunately we made it in time. The airport is trying to make improvements and there are better dining options along with more shopping for people waiting at the gates for their flight.

Once you deplane you have to walk a long way to the Delta baggage claim and signage is not very good. The airport is old but everything works. I found it quite interesting to leave the gate area and walk outdoors to the main terminal where baggage claim and the arrival hall is. Baggage was delivered within a few minutes after the first pax made the long hike. Once outside I found the official airport shuttle to Waikiki and was on my way. Departure was just as swift with your bags being scanned by the agriculture department before heading to check-in. The departure lobby is really very old and baggages are stacked behind the check-in counter before being transported to the plane. Security was quite quick and if you are leaving on an international flight you have a nice choice of duty free goods but if you leave on a domestic flight like I did there really is not much. I had some Japanese food before heading to the gate area and I was glad that the plane left almost on time as it's pretty boring being stuck in that airport for long.

What was particularly impressive to me was that IAH seemed to have a roughly equal number of desks open for non-citizens as for citizens; in my experience this is extremely rare in the USA. Since most of the arriving passengers seemed to be US citizens - leading to what seemed to be an extraordinary queue all the way out of the immigration hall for the latter - this led to the even rarer phenomenon of non-citizens often having a shorter wait than the citizens even though the former were being processed faster. For all that I still had to wait about 70 minutes before clearing immigration but a similar length queue at Washington Dulles for example would have required two to three times as long to clear. Otherwise facilities at IAD seem to be a notch above average for major US hubs with clear signage 45 minutes free wifi many plugs for laptops and the best duty free shop I've ever encountered at a US airport.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

hurghada-airport,/airport-reviews/hurghada-airport,Hurghada Airport customer review,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,2012-11-12,The last time I was at Hurghada Airport (some 6 years ago) it was a building site and it still is although now all building work has stopped. Arrival was chaos to say the least with long queues to pay for a visa and even longer unmanaged queues to get it stamped. The price you pay seemed to be somewhat variable depending on where you paid for it $20 at the official desk (for the visa stamped $15) or cheaper from some of the tour guides. Our baggage had arrived by the time we got to the baggage hall (45 mins from arrival) but had been dumped off the belt onto the floor in the general area of a belt – finding it was difficult. The security queue on our return was long and fast track was on offer for €10 but this really would have been a waste of time because the queue moved fast. Check-in was very fast with short queues for my flight (not sure why it was so good) and the subsequent queue through emigration and then security again was fast. The bazaar designed to relieve you of money beyond security was doing a good trade but the duty free alcohol prices were more than those payable on our plane only cigarettes being cheaper. The departure area was large with plenty of seats a little warm and no free wifi. Burger King have a stall but all other food areas were limited in choice and very expensive – water £3.25 for 0.75litres. We were bussed to and from our plane efficiently and without too much delay. Overall this airport experience was not frightful.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Initially you pass through a general screening x-ray security gate (bags passports etc). There were very long queues because they were also using the baggage screeners (at a peak time of the day) to screen cases of duty free being taken through to the shops and also crates of milk. Check-in was fast but the check-in staff tried to convince many passengers that their baggage (which was within weight limits of the way out) was now over weight and surcharges would have to be paid. Perhaps the fact that some of the scales read 3 kg when unloaded and others read 12 kg might have had something to do with it! Immigration and further security was efficient. Once airside it resembles a bazaar with numerous shops adopting the hardsell approach to things you did not know you wanted. The toilets have clear signs saying ""No Tips"" but the view of the attendants is that the notice only applies to staff. Food and drink is available (very expensive water is £3 per 500ml) and duty free prices are in dollars and are also very very expensive. The gate areas are large with bussing to the planes.

Transit can be quite a different story and I agree entirely with your previous correspondents. With over 90 mins for transit on the same airline I barely made the connection. The main transit and security line barely moves with apparently new inexperienced staff there oblivious to the cries from passengers who were missing their connections. I was dreading the return experience. However this time I noticed another transit and security facility only about 100m away that was hardly being used!

Airport itself is nice but there are major drawbacks from using this airport. Firstly there is a rather expensive and needless Airport Development fee of 10 euro for every passenger departing this airport. Check in was smooth but we all had to line up to pay the 10 euro fee. After which they scan your boarding pass and let you into security. Again security was fast and efficient as was boarding. We can't complain about these issues. When we arrived back here we got though passport control quickly and then we discovered another rip off that this airport has. It charges double the parking rates that Dublin charges. My advice is to use a different airport that does not try to rip passengers off.

When we flew (to FRA on THY June 2014) one had to go through full security before entering the terminal. There wasn't obviously anyone to help if a passenger were too frail to lift ones (not yet checked) bags onto a table above waist level for the x-ray. So we then assumed that IST just does security in a different order having cleared security we bought water for the flight (at reasonable prices) before passport control. Only after passport control can you see that there's a second identical security check and you have to discard that water. Still thirsty or hungry? The final set of shops and restaurants have the most outrageous prices you have ever encountered in any airport anywhere. So we had about $10 worth of Turkish lira left but could buy almost nothing with it. Why not exchange it for € or $ at the currency exchange? No they say the amount we had didn't meet their minimum! The roads to IST from Sultanahmet were fast and uncrowded at least at 6am. The ticketing check-in agents were unusually friendly and efficient; the passport control line was really long but moved quickly.

First a security check has been added after you leave the transfer desk if you are taking a transit flight. Second a number of foreign nationals can now purchase a visitor visa upon arrival at IST if they have a US UK Canadian or Schengen visa or a permanent residence card of those countries. The catch is that if you happen to arrive on flight from the US you can not purchase a visa from the booth closest to your flight.

When we first arrived in Istanbul we had arranged for transfers to our hotel. But the driver was nowhere to be found. After inquiring with other drivers one of them called our driver on his cell phone to come pick us up. Clearly I would avoid Istanbul Airport if you can.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,P Berkers,Belgium,2012-08-30,I have used this airport twice in August 2 times I was in transit. First time 4th of August from Brussels to Bangkok with transit in Istanbul. 25th August for return flight to Brussels. Both times the security lines moved quickly because all security lanes were in operation. 4th of August it was around 22.40 and there were lots of transfer passengers but on the return on 25th August around 16.30 it was much quieter. Both times the terminal and toilets were clean. Prices at the bar were very expensive. Lots of shopping opportunities with reasonable prices for Duty Free. Boarding for Ho Chi Minh via Bangkok at 00.40 was well organised in boarding zones. The 19.10 return to Brussels the gate agents did not announce that the flight was boarding. You could only see it when the waiting line began to move. One female gate agent was not friendly The planes for the return flights from Bangkok and to Brussels were parked at a remote stand. There were enough buses for the transportation from the plane to the terminal and from the terminal to the plane.,NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,2011-11-22,The buildings are fine with plentiful seating an airy aspect and a fair range of shops cafes etc (though expensive by Turkish standards). The main problem is queuing on arrival one queues for visa (if necessary) and then to have it checked for immigration (an hour in my case). On departure you queue for security before you enter the building (a few minutes) for check-in (about 15 mins in my case but by the time I got to the desk the queue was about 4-5 times longer than when I joined it) and then for emigration and a second security check. Fortunately a friend had advised me to arrive at least 2 hours before departure I endorse that. I recommend the metro and tram to get to the city centre the price is a tenth or less of a taxi or the shuttle bus and the time is about the same given Istanbul's traffic. Be aware it does require a change if you have a lot of luggage and also there is not a metro/tram stop near all hotels but if there is one it is a reliable and cheap alternative.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,David Walsh,Ireland,2011-09-24,I flew to Istanbul on business in Sept 2011. Flight over from Ireland was good and Turkish Airlines were good. Returned to the airport on a Saturday morning at 6.05 for a 7.45 departure and then the nightmare began. I lined up along with hundreds of others in a common queue to check-in until I was eventually called out of the queue with the rest of my flight because time was getting short. I have never seen such chaos at a check-in desk. Staff did not seem to care and there was no sense of urgency. Next step was to go to the passport control line and this was another disaster with really long queues. I have never in all my time flying witnessed airport police so obviously arguing with ground staff in front of passengers in an airport but saw this happen twice in this airport. I then made my way directly to the departure gate only to be faced with another series of horrendous queues to get through the x-ray machines it was organised chaos. I heard my name being called with other passengers for our flight. I pleaded with an official to let me through to get to the plane but he refused point blank saying that I had time. I missed the flight and had to go back out into departures and fight my case with Turkish Airlines. Eventually they flew me to London and I had to buy a ticket myself to get back to Dublin.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Leaving was another story. We were flying to Tel Aviv and the recent tension between Turkey and Israel was obvious. There were checks and counter checks. Passport control was tediously long with officials on a go slow. They checked every page of our passports with no consideration for passengers boarding times. When we arrived at the gate with about 5 minutes to spare we were confronted by a sign saying that the gate number had been changed to the other end of the terminal. With travelators out of action the walk was extremely stressful. Rounding the corner to the gate we were confronted by another long line to pass through another x ray security check. Thankfully a man let us take his place at the head of the queue. In a lather of sweat we made it to the bus to take us to the plane it remained stationary for about another 10 minutes with no air conditioning before leaving the terminal.

Was asked repeatedly if I packed bags myself - thought answering once would be enough. Got asked again by security staff at airline counter - weird. Once we got to gate area the usual second scanning went fine but then more security staff processing very slowly. Stamped my wife's boarding pass but not mine and I did not notice.

No problems with the visa payments but it took nearly 45 minutes to get through passport control. I had to really search all of the luggage carrousels for my baggage as there appeared to be no signs anywhere? Quite a long walk through the airport to the Metro but what a joy to have to only pay 2.80 New Turkish Lira in total to get from the airport to the tourist part of the city. Coming back- Very slow moving lines at the Turkish Airlines check in desks and even slower ones going through the final security checks at the gates.

It was well organised with quick immigration processing by friendly immigration officers in an adequately staffed immigration area (American airports could learn a thing or two here from the Turks). The separate visa queue also went quickly and efficiently (though travellers from the UK should remember that they only take USD or Euros). I dashed off to use the (clean and modern) toilet facilities at baggage retrieval and my wife already had our suitcase by the time I made it back. Leaving was equally simple with the slight quirk that security is before check-in so you go straight from check-in to passport control without having to go through security again (though there is a second security area once you reach your specific gate). Airside is neatly and sensibly laid out with plenty of shopping without the sense of being in a busy glorified shopping mall you get from most UK airports - though as noted in several other comments food and drink are pricey.

jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-07-03,"One of the busiest airports not just in Asia but in the world. Was very disappointed given you'd think that an airport of this size would be used to handling passengers and meeting their expectations. The lounge in particular was appalling. I paid for lounge access but when I got in they'd run out of beer and I complained and all the staff said was ""come earlier in the day"". I then replied by telling them a high percentage of long-haul flights leave late at night. Another thing which was very annoying and this happened both times I recently arrived was that baggage trolleys ran out meaning I had to carry my big heavy suitcase. At the same time I could see porters who were possibly charging for their services using baggage trolleys. How difficult is it for the management of CGK to order more baggage trolleys? On top of that its not very well organised and can be rather confusing to navigate. Finally (I was lucky because I have a work visa) there was only one immigration desk open at about 4 o clock in the afternoon meaning those who had to get a tourist visa on arrival had to wait ages. Also there was no queue control system like a 'snake line'. On the whole this airport while not as bad as others like Charles de Gaulle and Manila is an embarrassment to Indonesia as it gives first time visitors a bad impression of the country as they get a feeling of chaos poor organisation and a lack of care for visitors.",NA,NA,NA,4,2,2,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I was in the second queue for another 45 minutes - with 6 people in front of me - but I ended up waiting for this officer to process 14 people before my turn.

Saudi Arabia passport/immigration control make you queue for hours (5-6 hrs is the norm). No separate queues for elderly women or children or persons with other reasons for visits. Passport control then spend approx. 45 mins per person at the kiosk flicking through pages of your passport taking fingerprints of every finger on both hands. It gets worse if you have not completed the correct landing forms as you just get waved away without a proper explanation. And there are no clear signs or instructions on where to obtain such forms until someone from the mile long queue points or explains what you need to do. Saudi or Arabic speaking travellers jump the queues and there are just allowed to and we as foreigners aren't allowed to question.

On the outward trip I followed flight connections it took about 5 mins. On return I went through immigration no queues inwards or outwards and security took about 30 seconds. A good range of retail outlets airside and we had a decent meal at News Cafe for R60 (about £5).

This was a nice surprise and even the baggage didn't take that long. They have spend some serious money here yet again this excellent airport is let down by the simplest thing - signage. I needed to go to the domestic side to pick up a car. Well for a start you get terminal A and B (would it really kill someone to put 'Int' & 'Dom' after A & B? Anyhow I followed the car rental signs and took the lift though car rentals were listed on 2 seperate floors with no clue why. I went to the nearest one which seemed to be Europcar (sadly no the company I was using) so back in the lift. When I returned the car again the signs came thick and fast along with the turns in the road all very confusing but I managed to keen in the correct lane until the last when all of a sudden the car rental lane was only valid for some companies leaving me a split second to try and find the companies logo! I decided to stop and take my time and to hell with those behind me and a good job too as I was now no longer in the right line.

We were staying in Ontario but flew out of SNA rather than ONT due to flight schedule and prices. It's a relatively small easy to use airport at least compared to LAX. Rental car return facilities are in the basement of the parking structure immediately across the street from the main terminal so after returning your car you just need to walk to an elevator go up a few floors and cross the main airport roadway at the arrivals level to the terminal. No need to take the shuttle bus of the individual rental company (like at LAX) or a consolidated rental car shuttle (like at ONT). Line through security was short. There seemed to be a dearth of rest rooms in the departure area and options for food were located in the food court area at the far end of the terminal from where we were leaving so we got in a fair amount of walking.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The whole experience very organised and clean and above all positive. Just a tip you cannot use a credit card to buy a railway ticket into Osaka it is cash only. Flying out of KXI to FRA was a very positive experience. International Departures are on the 4th level large Check-in groups A-G and then up an escalator to Security Checking. On International Flights the usual European Rules on liquids apply. Again very quickly processed down an escalator and into International Departures which is a long thin hall backing the piers with the usual selection of shops. There is free WiFi available.

kansas-city-airport,/airport-reviews/kansas-city-airport,Kansas City Airport customer review,F Martin,United States,2014-07-03,There are good things and bad things about the set up of this airport. The biggest plus is the small size which makes it easy to get to where you need to go without having to walk through long sections of stores restaurants lounges etc. However that's because they don't have those amenities except for a couple so if you are a seasoned traveler who expects those you're out of luck. There isn't any real connection to public transportation here (only buses in KC) so you have to take a taxi use a shuttle to your hotel or pay to park in the lot and take a shuttle to and from the lot to the airport. The bathrooms are generally clean and not busy. The waiting areas are small but I've never seen it too crowded either. Security is right there at the waiting area so there's little walking you need to do between entering the airport and getting to your gate. The airline availability here is not ideal but it's adequate to get by. Basically if you aren't expecting to spend much time at the airport it can be quite nice to breeze in run through security and sit down ready to board your flight. If you are used to the amenities of bigger airports expect to be disappointed. Although there is talk of a huge billion dollar plus expansion to be done at the airport but that all depends on whether the people here want their tax dollars to pay for it and so far the attitude has not been positive.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

My mother and I plus several other EasyJet passengers had to ask where the check in desk was as it was not clearly sign posted and the airport was very busy with long queues. After waiting at the Baggage Drop off I was told when I reached the desk that as I only had hand luggage I didn't need to be at that desk! It would be very helpful if there could be a sign saying that passengers flying with just hand luggage may proceed to wherever they have to go next rather than stand in a queue they needn't be in. Also could there be signs (or maybe a friendly human) informing passengers when they need to have their passport/boarding pass ready so that they don't hold the queue up any more than need be. Plus signs well in advance saying what items need to be taken out of their luggage before its scanned as again that can cause unnecessary delays. Finally could ALL airport staff remember that they do their job every day and know the routine but a lot of the travellers going through this airport may be nervous or first time flyers in a different country or tired from a long haul or early flight and would appreciate being treated with courtesy and having any problems dealt with politely. Travellers can be stopped from flying if they are aggressive or rude to staff so could airport workers return the courtesy as good manners cost nothing but go a long way.

Check-in via a booth was the fastest I have ever had at any airport although the seat allocation was poor. Duty Free and other shops are immediately after security although non schengen passengers then have to go through passport control which can be slow (in the afternoon when many US flights depart) and gloomy. Whilst hand baggage trolleys are freely available they cannot (for no obvious reason) be taken through passport control and used as you get towards the gates. Equally for no obvious reason there are only about 20 seats available at Gates 25 and 26 (may also be other gates) and therefore you sit on the floor or stand.

The airport is a nice small airport in design complete with a self-service restaurant land-side and a small shop where one can buy Irish gifts airside. The main comment I would make however refers to the overall cleanliness of the airport. The check-in area is next to the restaurant and the wafting smell of dinner can be off-putting for passengers. In addition the floors and toliets are not shining which is a pity as with a small airport like this it should be very easy for the authorities to maintain this image. I recently was in Pau in France and although somewhat bigger I was really impressed by the ultra-cleanliness of the airport.

At Terminal B (the oldest one) everything was like usual but since the new Terminal D was recently open for operation number of passengers there somewhat reduced which means that things have become more efficient.

Inefficient layout inefficient security procedures (fast just because there are very few flights from there). Even taps at toilets are done wrong so water pours out of sink. There are no airbridges there so you are bussed to and from plane. Two flights of stairs down on departure with bags. Absurd prices at cafes (7 Euro per cup of rubbish coffee). Costa Coffee should take more care of their first facility in Ukraine. Intrusive (but polite) customs officers and taxi scam on arrival.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Immigration had fairly long queues for each counter and it's all a question of luck as to whether or not you pick a quick one but I followed the tip from my seat neighbour and joined the Diplomatic queue (on the right as you look towards the counters). Processing was fairly quick although the officer was chewing gum looked bored and didn't say anything! Why don't they do what other airports do and just have one queue? Luggage was already on the conveyor. Changed money before leaving the airport at what turned out to be quite reasonable rates. Return flight two weeks later at same time of day - long queues for Security but moved reasonably quickly and staff all seemed cheerful (good English skills). The emigration queues snaked all round the room - again it would be so much easier with just one queue.

kiev-borispol-airport,/airport-reviews/kiev-borispol-airport,Kiev Borispol Airport customer review,Michael Little,NA,2010-08-12,The passport control section of this airport is a very bad introduction to Ukraine. Lack of staff at peak times and insufficient supervision of the queues (at first glance the room looks like a giant rugby scrum) make for an unpleasant experience. Avoid the queues which curve round the columns with customs forms in the middle of the room and join a queue which you can see leading directly to an immigration officer. These queues are less vulnerable to queue jumpers and appear to move faster.

The infrastructure is being improved. The toilets are not too bad and have likely been improved since earlier comments. The food and drinks is more expensive than outside airport but is typical of all airports and train stations-I have paid 5 euros for beer in Amsterdam and Prague Airport. The departure terminal has recently undergone upgrade and is looking better - they have also installed a glass smoking area just before the passport control exit barriers. My experiences of baggage reclaim support other comments - theres still much work to be done here. On entry also queues can be frustrating and slow.

Signage is poor it is a very old Soviet building that has had a cosmetic decoration yet is simply not big enough to handle extra traffic. The check in procedure is a joke only one belt shared with 6 check in desks passengers then have to leave by an exit door and go outside around the back to a second building housing the departure gates. The departure area is basically 1 room with a duty free shop no bigger than 15m m2 There is seating for only around 60 while when I was there more than 200 people crowded into the room. No facilities for refreshments and the plasma screens show no flight info just weather reports. Expect pandamonium as military police airline staff airport officials and heavies in black bomber jackets all seemingly want to control things with the result being chaos. Incoming passengers face piles of baggage passed directly from the tarmac through a door there is no reclaim hall-just a 6m corridor. This place makes Boryspil look like a palace. The only advantage is the 7 km from the centre of Kiev as opposed to KBP 33km. All the same be wary of taxi drivers asking for extortionate fees to unsuspecting arrivals- better to get a bus from just outside main entrance.

Check-in system down at departure long queues at security (tip: take the utmost right security gate which will bring you directly to immigration passing the queue of the other security gates).

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Michael Walsh,United Kingdom,2015-06-28,"I have flown into KLIA from Heathrow on average every two years since it opened in 1998, to visit family, with some regional/internal flights in-between. It is a well-presented and apparently well-maintained airport with reasonable functionality and transport links. I will focus on the truly negative aspect for this review as it needs highlighting: queuing at Immigration Control. This applies to both arriving and departing passengers, and the latter seems quite unique to KLIA. Upon arrival at KLIA, it is quite normal to join a queue for foreign passports that will last some 20 minutes or more. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of passenger-flow monitoring and accommodating peak periods. When going through ticket presentation from check-in to security, at KLIA there is a row of Immigration desks for passport/biometrics capture. My experiences over the last 17 years have shown this to be a very quiet area, so I was particularly surprised at the queues that I had to join last Wednesday (24th). I don't know if there was a unique event or incident that contributed to this, but everything seemed normal to that point. My queue lasted 20 minutes, and was the quicker queue as an extra desk opened up towards the end. Up to that point, there were three desks out of 7+ open for foreign passports, with an extra two for ""First and Business Class"" that did not call over any passengers to alleviate the queue when they were not serving anyone. That aside, it was the usual positive experience, if unspectacular. But the queuing desperately needs addressing.",Arrival and Departure,28-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,6,1,5,NA,NA,4,3,2,NA,1

In terms of infrastructure, it is a better airport than the previous LCCT. Lots of room, better laid out, bright and cheerful, good shopping, and transportation to and from the airport were smooth. However, one problem is the distance from the boarding gates to the terminal building. Insufficient (or absence of) travelators, has made the distance to the boarding gates demanding to say the least, especially for the elderly and the infirm. Confusing signage is another problem. And the widely displayed 3D map only adds to the confusion. I have seen people heading towards to the carpark when they were supposed to be heading towards the check-in counters. The 'official' airport staff were unhelpful when it comes to giving directions. The queuing for both the check-in and in-coming immigration counters were not cordoned off, and as a result, queue jumping, pushing and shoving is normal. Where is the security when they are needed?

Shopping is ok the queuing for immigration and baggage took about half an hour. Also one can check in baggage at KL Sentral railway station (for MH and some other airlines as well - it works). My main issues are twofold. First the security screening at the gates can be quite slow - a lot of people at once - when it might work better to have one screening point. Second the free wifi coverage is poor when you can get it to work at all and the free Internet terminals weren't working.

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,M Taylor,Hong Kong,2014-10-31,KLIA feels like it used to be a top-notch airport but has fallen to neglectful bad habits. It's just not well kept and feels a little dirty and cheaply run. The shops are okay (standard big-Asia-airport shops) but still have a sort of tacky make-shift feel about them unlike Singapore or Hong Kong and more like some Manila terminals or SVO (Moscow). My biggest complaint about this airport which I didn't spend a very long time in is the immigration queues. I didn't have any luggage but the queue for immigration was very slow moving. This is partly due to the number of Chinese nationals trying to enter (on my flight from Hong Kong) - and it certainly slows things down a bit when immigration staff insist on checking return flight bookings for certain passports (and in some cases rejecting them - something I have never seen before - telling passengers to contact their airline for assistance after being denied entry initially!). As a British passport holder getting past the lady at immigration was very smooth but there simply weren't enough staff for it to be acceptable by today's standards for big airports - particularly if they insist on checking Chinese peoples itineraries. My other gripe is the lack of reasonable coffee in departures - the best you can find is a McCafe without paying silly money: there is no other major coffee chain inside the airport (that I could easily find and at 6am I was looking pretty hard!).,NA,NA,NA,5,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

A major disadvantage of going with a budget airline apart from the lack of onboard amenities and punctuality is the low- cost terminals or airports from which they fly. I therefore expected a bare and plastic terminal with next to no amenities when I was on my way to KLIA2 which is used exclusively by budget airlines. How wrong I was. In all my years of flying I have never been so pleasantly surprised with an airport. The duty free shops and various cafes and restaurants on offer was excellent and better than most full-service airports from which I have flown. Also the terminal was so clean. In fact based on this experience the only airports I would say are better than KLIA2 are Singapore Hong Kong and Amsterdam Schiphol though in fairness they are mainly for full-service airlines. How KLIA2 heaps shame on many full-service hubs like Beijing Manila Jakarta Paris Charles de Gaulle Shanghai Pudong and Heathrow. Also public transport links are excellent for both efficiency and value for money. My only criticisms of this airport are the lack of travellators in such a large terminal building which could pose problems if someone was in a rush and the fact I had to go through security twice once right after immigration and then again before I went to pier P to catch my flight to Jakarta. Nevertheless I will not think twice about using KLIA2 again and I assume that KLIA's main and satellite buildings must be impeccable as they cater to full-service airlines.,NA,NA,NA,8,3,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

To be fair the airline has its own terminal so this review relates to that one. The Air Asia terminal has no transit facilities - so you need to enter Malaysia and then exit via Immigration. So be sure you have a visa if you need one. You can only check in for your continuing flight about 2 hours before departure and there are few facilities available before you get to the departure gates (after immigration). There are very few chairs and the crowds are huge so don't expect to find a place to sit. The air conditioning hardly works and KL is a hot tropical city. Its less comfortable than most Greyhound bus stops in the US in fact its the worst air terminal I have ever had to go through. Availability of food or drink in the check-in area is very limited.

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,H Yaacob,Singapore,2013-09-30,KLIA used to feel like a modern airport. Unfortunately the airport has been under-maintained and it's beginning to show it's age. First up the Aerotrain system had no announcements. Several monitors next to the platform were dead. Trains looked old and tired. This was not the case before. It seems as if they've not bothered to repair the PA system. There were no queues at immigration but the area has poor and illogical signage. They gave warnings on Taxi touts before the immigration counters without little information on Foreign or Malaysian passport lines until we got to the counters. There were no lines and all counters were open so that they've improved the well-known KLIA passport lines. Then you're squeezed into a small hallway with small monitors detailing the carousels assigned. Upon exit booths for rental cars and airport taxis are cluttered and strewn about. The airport taxi counter has long lines forming blocking the exit. When you exit surprisingly there are other taxi booths all empty. On the way back we were assigned the last check in row which was did not have enough space to accommodate the crowds. Not to mention the oversized check-in portal was also located there creating a huge bottleneck. There were 3 flights being checked in at the same time for our row. We were shoved around because the airport staff needed to put up queue barriers to check in an Oman Air flight at the counters next to ours when there was a line already forming for that flight. They took their own time. Shops are worthless because they're either too expensive or are just uninteresting. Eating places haven't changed since three years ago and were terribly disappointing. Seating is terribly inadequate. Several seats were dirty and rusty and not to mention had come lose meaning that they were not in a straight line and were strewn about. Shops are disorganized and are cluttered around resulting in inefficient floor use and various bottlenecks. Trash cans are overflowing and some had their lids broken resulting in trash on the floor. Not a good experience. Departing and Arriving from SIN (a very well kept airport) you can definitely see the difference ironic because we departed from SIN T1 which is at least a decade older than KLIA. Goes to show KLIA's management needs to buck up.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

A very good feature is the KLIA Ekspress where you can check-in at KL Sentral. Security is quite efficient and immigration officers are not bad. If you fly MAS on a domestic flight there are not many eating and shopping options though. Also if you fly to a SE Asian destination you usually use the gates which are above the domestic ones - and there you also have limited duty free. The satellite terminal has a good choice of shops and restaurants although of course the food is airport food. One annoying thing about KLIA are the frequent announcements in Bahasa Malaysia English and Chinese for everything. Also I do not understand why they are constantly changing gates for flights. Usually it's never the same gate as stated on your boarding pass so you better check the monitors. Especially for domestic flights it is very common.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

Facilities in the satelite terminal are great and there is a lot of shopping to be done. MAS Golden Lounge is good as well. Shopping is a bit cheaper than downtown KL since it's tax free. Sometimes there is some congestion at the gate area as security checks are done at each gate. Staff is usually friendly but you sometimes come across one or two souls who are having a bad day. Immigration officers are probably worldwide a special bunch of people and you never know what to expect. Usually in KL they are ok but give you the silent treatment. Customs is ok and once outside the KLIA Ekspress is the fastest way to KL. Train rides are comfortable quiet cheap and efficient. Once you arrive KL Sentral you can catch the subway to KLCC or other places. You can also check in at KL Sentral when you go back but currently they only offer it for MH CX and RB. Heard they are expanding it though. If you fly domestically things are not as brilliant as in the satelite terminal but still good.

The airport is huge looks good with an all- glass facade and a remarkable design on the roof. The boards outside the airport are small too difficult to read the airline information from the cars. There are five entrances to the airport and it is very difficult (if not impossible) to understand which gate one should use. I entered through Gate 1 and had to walk for a full 15 minutes to arrive at the airline counter (which was closer to Gate 4 by the way). The airport has an in-line baggage scanning procedure in place but the airlines have not started using it. The staff however are quite helpful and try to answer your queries with a smiling face. The airport if working all guns would not allow any queues at all however 60% of the immigration and customs counters re closed so as usual it takes time. Once you are done with the security check is where the trouble begins. There is no good food shop no lounges no shops where you can kill time. I was told that new stores would open in the next few months. The washrooms are relatively clean and I saw people wiping it every now and then. The arrival hall is a huge one fast baggage delivery and lots of carts. Overall a big improvement from the old domestic and international terminals but still lots of work to be done.

I arrived at 7pm to board a 10pm flight to Singapore. The airport was sparsely populated at that time. The environment was clean too. So what was lacking? 1) WiFi - Apparently the airport offers a 30 minute complementary WiFi. If you have a laptop iPad or mobile phone all you need to do is to give your mobile phone number to receive a serial number and password. Beyond 30 minutes you need to purchase WiFI. I made several attempts but I did not receive a text message at all. 2) Food If you are hoping to get a bite before you enter the departure lounge you will be bitterly disappointed. There are a handful of cafes offering unappetizing snacks. I would strongly suggest you bring packed food if you are going to be a long while in this airport. 3) Security Tags - When you are checking in be sure you ask for security tags for your hand-carrying bags. They will not tell you this. At the Customs check point the officers will stamp this tag. If you don't have one they would have to find one and then you will get a ticking off for not getting one. How are we to know we need one if this is not practised world-wide and the person at the check-in counter does not tell you?

That is the most screwed up decision I have ever seen in airport retail. Starbucks before security - gone. Starbucks after security - gone. In place is some other new coffee that will not attract all the same traffic other than the fact that it is the only coffee joint there.

I arrived at Terminal 1 on US Airways and had no issues with signage although it was a long walk from the gate to baggage claim. My only issue was the delay in recovering my baggage due to confusion about which carousel it was on and even this was cleared up after a few minutes. The ground transportation area was very busy but problem-free. For the flight back the biggest obstacle was getting to the terminal through the extremely crowded lane for shuttle buses taxis etc on the Terminal 1 departures area. The driver eventually had to let us off some distance from where we needed to be but everything went okay. The lineups for check-in looked extremely long but there were lots of terminals for electronic check-in which kept things moving and after this the wait to check baggage was pretty short. The TSA security lineups were also pretty fast. There were lots of shopping opportunities before going through security and still some decent shopping and eating after going through security. The waiting areas were quite pleasant and offered a good view of the airport ramps for an airplane nut.

However in recent years it has been taken over by a company determined to squeeze every last penny out of customers. The drop-off area costs £2 simply to enter so many people simply take a chance and drop passengers off on the mini-roundabouts. There is no taxi rank so taxis bringing passengers to the airport cannot get a fare back to the city. The airport taxis are provided by Arrow cabs which are more expensive than local firms (for example £20 to my home instead of the local firm's fare of £10). If you live locally and are flying home take the number of a local cab firm with you and call them when you leave the plane. The taxi will be waiting for you when you exit the airport. Public transport is poor; there is no train service and the many flights arrive or leave outside the hours of the bus services. The terminal is cramped so it can be difficult for example to get through to the lavatories if you are carrying hand luggage. There are shops but the selection is not good and the cafes are crowded so you will not be served quickly. The only advantage of LBA is convenience if you live locally.

Now it's just another miserable big airport in miniature - all of the bad bits with none of the good bits. As other posters have noted the drop-off experience is ghastly and the £1 baggage trolley charge is crass. The former long stay car parking has suddenly been chopped in two. They made the half that's nearest the terminal into short stay. This bit is naturally deserted since LBA has almost zero business/short haul traffic. So you now walk miles across this empty car park before reaching the long stay somewhere near Horsforth. From here your long walk uphill back to the terminal is compounded by all the old entry doors being permanently locked since they now placed the main entrance at the far end of the terminal. Once inside of course they make you double back since security is back in the direction you came from. A good work out for such a tiny airport. Baggage handling can be lame. On my inbound flight when the bags emerged on the carousel they were from the wrong flight. Pax noted this staff did nothing. So staff were alerted who immediately went on the defensive and refused to help ""we don't know any more than you do"" etc. So we all stood and watched the same bags go round for maybe 20 minutes with no-one taking anything off. Because no bags were claimed there was no room to load any more of the right bags. So they just kept going round and round. Staff refused to take them off bizarrely insisting ""please remove your bag so we can make more space"". Hey they're the wrong bags we kept telling them. ""Don't get shirty with me it's not our fault"" etc. Meantime the other side of the curtain 4 baggage handlers sat around doing nothing with full carts that they could not load - stalemate. Eventually enterprising pax started pulling off the wrong bags manually to make the odd bit of space. At which point ground staff suddenly decide to confuse everyone by announcing ""if your bag has not arrived please come and fill in a form"". So now more mayhem as the pax try to ascertain ""did they not even load the bags at all?"" Reply - ""we don't know any more than you etc"" Meantime the odd correct bag suddenly starts appearing one at a time in the gaps created by the enterprising pax. An hour later eventually everyone got their bag one by one. By the way this was the only inbound flight in an otherwise deserted baggage hall. It really defies belief.

It also has nice shopping outlets. Now for the bad. Customs inspection process for VAT refund almost seems designed to defeat those seeking refunds. Still we managed. But immigration in Terminal 1 was inexcusable. We arrived at Immigration to find a long queue and were surprised to discover a single immigration officer serving all non-EU citizens. It seems that we arrived while officers were out to lunch. The wait took longer than we expected and we missed our flight. The following day we returned to the airport for our second attempt at departure. This time the non-EU citizen queue was empty with again one counter open. Once we walked up to the officer he informed us that he was not in service and proceeded to raise his voice in disgust when we told him that waiting hall signs were still directing non-EU citizens to his counter. After our stand-up scolding we followed his directions to the EU citizen line just in time to be chided by the new officer for coming to the wrong line. She demanded to know why we would all come to her counter when there was another officer on duty. We had unknowingly wandered into a battleline of friendly fire.

This is by far the worst airport that we encountered during the last 20 years or regular flying. Long distances have to be traveled by foot between arrival and departure gates. The long line-up before security and time consuming security check due to too few and partly incompetent staff assures the gate to gate travel on foot to become a marathon race for those who still want to catch their flight. We experienced that 2 times out of 2. Another thing is that after arrival from USA (so still in the safe zone) a security check still has to be made where (in our case) a simple and small fishing rod of one of our kids which we were allowed to take as cabin luggage from USA to Lisbon was considered to be dangerous! Checking it in as cargo for Euro 55 - was the only option.

Blue badge owners are supposed to be given up the 30 minutes free but only discover at the exit barrier they have find an office somewhere to obtain an exit ticket. They also employ a parking control company who think they also have the right to control the public roads away from the airport and issue £60.00 fines if driver stops for even 10 seconds. This is of course to ensure they herd all cars into their car park for a instant charge and is of course not lawful.

It's an absolute joke of a car park. Now the airport - it used to be good. It was a small well run and organised business. Now the owners have become ambitious expanded the building in a variety of wierd ways and it's a dog's dinner. Lifts constantly out of order escalators turned off security queues that have to be seen to be believed ludicrous routes to the gates that generally involves zig zagging through endless shops the gates themselves that haven't seen any investment since 1980 staff who have turned disinterested into an artform filthy toilets etc etc. Every cliche regarding a bad airport is captured in this terrible place. Whilst Manchester has lots of problems it functions as an airport. Liverpool doesn't it's not fit for purpose currently and desperately needs top down management re-engineering.",NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Blamed on Gatwick air traffic control. Some of the travelators weren't working and this is unfortunate for someone with arthritis. Gatwick seems to delight in offering long distance treks to get to or from planes. The good thing is that the taxi booth is close to the exit, and fairly easy to find. It was the following day, when we were travelling to Aberdeen from Gatwick North, that we experienced Gatwicks inefficiency at its worst. To be fair, I believe easyJet needs to take a lot of the blame - they are never that efficient at check in but excelled themselves here. We got to area C/D for a 07.20 flight at 05.50, with our boarding cards and flexitickets which technically entitle us to speedy bag drop. The area was roped off. We were directed to a queue about 100 metres long, by Gatwick staff. There was no attempt to prioritise by flight time, you just queued. Beyond the barriers was teaming with people trying to get to easyJet check in desks. We got to the head of the queue after 25 mins. Another Gatwick staff lady directed us to speedy bag drop in the top corner, where there was a queue of about 5 ahead of us. We got through after about 10 mins - it was now 0650. A solid hour when you have paid extra to get through the check in process, and have checked in online. I had requested special assistance, which was lucky. I can't praise the assistance staff highly enough, but that's the only part of Gatwick that deserves it. Our names were being tannoyed at this point. We boarded a packed bus.

Not ideal when your wife is heavily pregnant but it could have been much worse. Through to departures lounge and I have to say the North Terminal was starting to look well used and a bit tired. I've flown Gatwick several times and it's the first time I've felt the North Terminal needed some love. There are plenty of options for places to eat so you can waste some time that way. Our actual departure gate was absolutely freezing. You aren't there for long though but it wasn't good. Coming back from Thailand again deplaned fairly quickly. Immigration queues were pretty long but loads of staff on to get through. We would normally use the new automatic immigration kiosks but we could see they were very slow so just stuck with the human process. Flying back to Glasgow we had to check out of our hotel at 12 and didn't fly out until 4. Spending even more time in North Terminal Departures just confirmed that the terminal is very tired looking.

Both of terminals are in good condition and under the new ownership is being improved very fast and effectively. Check In and Security is fast most of the time. There seems to be more shops and better restaurants in the North Terminal which is bigger but the South is becoming just as good. One thing is that gates do take a good amount of time to come on screen but they are never far away. Boarding is always doing using a Jetway. On arrival deboarding is speedy and takes you straight to immigration. The wait generally is no longer than 10 mins and with the new e booths it is getting quicker. Baggage reclaim can take some time but where doesn't really? Not to mention the cleanliness it is very impressive!

Flew at end of day (one of last flights out of North terminal) despite this it was hard to find a seat to start with as not many around as most of the space is given over to over priced shops and food outlets. It may have also been impacted by building work or that may have been for more shops.

Overall the experience at Gatwick has improved greatly with better facilities and signage in particular. Out of the two terminals I do prefer the South for post-security facilities but that is personal preference. Some of the reviews reference significant security delays from my experience these types of delays are something of the past unless there is disruption and on the past few trips we have waited no more than a minute or two to be seen.

On my return from Italy on Sunday 27 May to the NT I was pleasantly surprised to find a very short EU immigration queue and clean bathroom facilities.

Anyone wanting a black cab especially late at night not wanting to go into central London beware of the shambles that is the queue for cabs. It is managed but you may find that when it comes to your turn the cabbie won't be interested or will want a fare out of proportion to the journey distance (it's to do with the stupid licensing arrangement they have from TFl's taxis dept) leaving you having wasted your time. The queue operative may approach cabs further down the line - but no guarantee that other drivers will take you either. Seems that a lot don't have card readers in their cabs either.

I have travelled the world extensively and have never encountered such rudeness or disorganisation. We travelled with British Airways (who were fine) and were using Heathrow as a transit stop only (this time). Despite being in transit we waited in multiple queues and 2 hours into our transit with only 1 hour to go I asked a staff member ""Are we going to make this flight"". The response was simply ""No"". There was no help either to make the flight or to help us if we missed the flight there was no apology and there was no express queue available to people with short transit times. The staff in general were highly rude un-helpful and despite there being a lot of staff members they were standing around doing nothing. There was only one security check station open lots of redundant staff members and copious amounts of travellers standing around for 2-3 hours waiting to get through. Unless you are actually wanting to enter London do not transit through Heathrow CDG is a much better choice and the staff are delightful.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,B Aldridge,United States,2014-06-04,Heathrow is in short a mess. Getting around is a confusing mishmash of walkways corridors escalators and busses. Signage is clear but the airport is nevertheless extremely difficult to navigate efficiently. I have never seen so many people racing through a terminal apparently trying to navigate the complicated layout numerous times to find where they should be. I am fortunate to usually travel business class so I can avoid the cavernous dirty hot noisy and smelly main waiting areas in favor of a private airline lounge. The terminals seem to be organized to generate sales at the stores and restaurants and not for passenger comfort or convenience. Immigration lines are very long and extremely slow which seems to be a problem at airports everywhere. For anyone changing to a domestic flight I would recommend at least 3 hours transit time. Several times baggage claim has been a single carousel serving many flights crowded with hundreds of people. The ensuing chaos makes for understandably frayed nerves and short tempers. Did I mention the airport is dirty? I have noticed on the London subway that the locals just leave trash everywhere but in trash cans and they do the same at Heathrow. Unfortunately it appears to be picked up infrequently.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,1,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The facilities in T5 are good with several restaurants and a reasonably priced Wetherspoons bar (albeit the bar has a limited seating area for those purchasing drinks and not food). Its a bit bizarre that the smaller Wetherspoons bar in T5b has 4 times the seating. The free wifi is very slow and intermittent worked much better on outward than inward journey. The outbound transit was very quick and efficient. However offsetting this was the usual amount of time to exit/enter Heathrow on the plane - outbound delayed 50 minutes inbound by 30 minutes. Arriving at T5 transfers on 25 May was a disgrace - 1 officer having to deal with fasttrack EU and non EU nationals. No movement at all for 15 minutes. Staff co-ordinator realised eventually situation should be being resolved and eventually 2 more officials came out to assist. My non EU partner was held up briefly as well when eventually seen but issue then resolved swiftly.

I appreciate there is a need for security but when they are just standing around talking & appear to be in no rush I guess it makes TSA look good. British Airways need to be aware that the poor customer service is a reflection on them so they do need to ensure there is a level of customer service set in line with their excellent customer service BA provide. The other area which is annoying is the amount of walking to go from Fast Track which is next to the BA Lounge to then walk halfway down the terminal only to double back on yourself. We all know it is a ploy to get passengers to walk through the numerous shopping outlets which the majority of business passengers ignore so come on BA & BAA allow the business passenger direct access to the BA Lounges next to Fast Track as most of us have no interest in buying anything from the shops in T5.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Relatively short line for passport control. Clean toilets. Short wait for suitcase. Large presence of ground handling agents. Greater presence of customs agent than I had seen for a while which actually offers some reassurance. T3 arrivals landside (including certain retailers) has a very crowded and scruffy feel I do hope this will be the focus of forthcoming renovation and development work.

Departure from both was pretty good with short queues for check-in and security though the scanners at Heathrow seem more sensitive than anywhere else I have been - everybody seems to set them off. Arriving is not so good with lengthy queues for passport checks as others have mentioned the scanners are painfully slow. Buses to and from long stay car parks seem to work well. My main gripe is that on both occasions having landed we were kept on the taxiway for 20-30 minutes as 'we are waiting for the gate to be vacated'. It also happened to my daughter (T5). It is frustrating that on a short flight you can spend as much time getting off the aircraft as you have in the air and on a long flight the last thing you want having arrived is to sit in your seat for another half hour.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,M Riley,United States,2014-04-22,Make sure to look at your boarding passes to determine whether or not you have luggage to claim (I think if you are flying the same airline both flights your luggage goes to your destination). When I landed at Heathrow we were not given any directions or instructions about what we were to do next. Being an inexperienced traveler I assumed that I needed to pick up luggage so I followed the signs toward baggage claim. After standing in line for at least 10 minutes I realized that my baggage had already been sent to the next flight. The annoying thing was that nobody mentioned this to me. After baggage claim I must have made a wrong turn and got completely lost. The layout of the airport can be very confusing and there seems to be a lack of signage in some areas. I asked several employees for help and no one could put me in the right direction. Trying to find my way through this airport was like running through an endless maze. By the time I reached the boarding gate I had just missed my flight by about 5 mins. I went to the counter to have them put me on the next flight. Told it was my fault and had to charge me $275. The return trip was much easier because I knew that I didn't have to pick up luggage and I was with a group of people so that made it easier. As soon as we got off the plane there was an information display listing terminals according to the airlines so it was simply a matter of following signs to the terminal and departure gate. How did I miss this on my first trip? Where was the information display or clear signs in the baggage area? I guess I simply took the longer confusing route. I suppose some terminals may be smaller or easier to navigate then others. There are some nice restaurants and shops and the flights were pleasant but I will still try to avoid this airport in the future after this awful experience.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,G Cleaver,United Kingdom,2014-03-03,I have to say that reading past reviews about terminal 5 relates to the inconsistent performance where one day can be a fantastic experience and the next a forgetful. On outward leg (LHR-IAD) with British Airways bag drop was very quick although the check-in lady could do with a smile. I'm impressed with the structure of this terminal with its wide open walkways and high ceilings very reminiscent of the Asian Airports. It also has the sense of freshness something that all the other 4 terminals lack. Security was a bit slow and took an age considering the number of people in the queue. One thing I must say was after security it was very very busy. Quite surprising considering the vastness of the terminal! Perhaps it was because of the holiday season. Very good range of shops and restaurants/cafes etc and good to see that duty-free isn't a rip off! Next came the walk to our gate which was in the 'B' section of the terminal which meant using the light rail system. Very long escalator trip down to the bottom where the train was located. Must've taken a good 2 minutes without walking. Train was punctual and quick. Disappointing though that if you have a gate located in the 'B' or 'C' section you are cut away from the main terminal which contains the best of shops. Only shop in the B area was a whsmiths. Nevertheless I liked the effort Heathrow have made to move away from the '10km' walk to the gate so to speak. Plane left on time and was overall a pleasant experience. Inward journey was from EWR back to terminal 5. Disappointed that we were not given an air bridge to leave our British Airways plane; somewhat strange considering that this is their hub which means they should have the best facilities for their passengers. Bus took us to the main complex which was near passport control. We were wary of the times we've had to wait in the past so 25 minutes seemed standard. Bag carousel was big and 'airy' and bags were there ready to be picked up. Heathrow connect service to terminal 4 was okay; somewhat tedious since there is no direct service so an interchange is required. Bus to car park was punctual but a bit small. Overall an impressive turn around from the horrible days of cramped airports and long marathon walks to the gate. Hats off to BAA and BA.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

It is already overcrowded beyond capacity for much of the day and it is often hard to find a seat. In spring summer and fall the temperature is too warm and humid for comfort given all the people inside the terminal. There are no pay lounges no lounges for Star Alliance or SkyTeam carriers (or any other carriers for that matter) and BA does not offer paid access to its lounges so if you do not have BA/Oneworld status you have no lounge access at all. This is not true in T1 T3 and T4. There are no pay showers either (unlike T1 T3 and T4)--so if you do not have lounge access a shower is not an option. The toilet facilities are also inadequate - it is not uncommon to be unable to get a stall without a long wait something that never happens in Frankfurt Munich Vienna or most other European airports. There all also very long lines at most transit desks with no automated boarding pass printers like those in German airports. Overall a very unpleasant experience if you cannot access a lounge.

Most recently I arrived from IAD on 27th November and returned 17th December on arrival passport control queues were very short (admittedly arriving on BA216 one of T5's earliest arrivals helps - will be interesting to check out next year when they deploy the A380 on this flight) and on departure (scheduled for 17.00) I only had to wait behind two people for bag drop and the security queue took about 5min. Once airside there were plenty of seats notably at the Crown Rivers pub which has expanded its seating and provides a perfect place to nurse a pint or two whilst waiting for one's departure gate to be posted and the Scotch whisky selection at the various duty free shops is as good as it's ever been. (The rule on no bag drop more than 3 hours prior to scheduled departure helps ease potential airside crowding as well.)

Its noticeable how the efforts are trying to be made by Heathrow as a whole to try and improve its status (terminal 5 being a prime example) but there is still room for improvement. Interior looks very dated. Transaero seem to have their check-in zone tucked away from the main area so its a bit of a task trying to locate it. When we arrived there was an ominous-looking queue and we had noticed that the delayed take-off kept on getting extended every 5 minutes! Turned out that our plane was still in Moscow because of the weather so there was a 6-hour delay at most. We were given £25 to spend each in the airport though which explained the queue. Security was surprisingly swift very friendly staff. Giraffe restaurant very good not too expensive. Waiting seats are very hard comparable to park benches. Free Wi-Fi and good range of plug sockets. Something striking is the very long distances to walk to gates. It was a good 10 minute walk even with travelators! On return taxi to gate was very swift and we left the plane quickly. Immigration is in desperate need of a review in terms of services. Very long queues insufficient tables for filling out details (for some reason we weren't given them on the plane).

Good connection but I think due to light passenger load. All lines short even transfer security which can be a nightmare. Even a little humour from the staff - I think that their lack of this is often simply due to the monstrous number of not always polite people they have to deal with on some days.

The process used is ridiculous and seems designed to delay passengers. I missed a connecting flight because I inadvertently left the dregs of a small bottle of water in my bag. Rather than do the sensible thing (as is done at other airports) and ask me if I had any liquids they decide to remove my bag after screening and have me standing around waiting for more than 30 minutes. All that was needed was to have me identify the bottle of water remove and re-screen which would have taken 2 minutes. Instead they want to empty every item from the bag. Having been through numerous major airports around the world it is obvious to me that Heathrow is about the worst you will find.

However my experience at Terminal 1 was horrific and echoes many comments also written here. The worst aspect for me was having my bag (laptop bag in my case) taken aside for a random second inspection but then seeing it left there for ages in a rack while staff laughed and chatted amongst themselves seemingly oblivious to the fact that we have flights to catch. At Australian airports such 2nd random searches are carried out promptly and courteously by another officer further on in the process and that's fine. However at Heathrow Terminal 1 I had my bag left in a side rack for ages with staff wandering off somewhere else for a chat and a laugh.

Owing to a ticketing problem I then had no choice but to return to Terminal 3 to see Air Canada/British Airways. In all it took 3 hours to re-negotiate the now-longer queues and make the repeat transfer - mind-numbing after a very long overnight flight! To Heathrow's immense credit I found practically every employee I met to be good-spirited helpful and tactfully humorous; from the lady transfer bus driver to the immigration officials.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,G Calafiore,Australia,2011-07-10,You really have to consider LHR as 4 separate airports according to which terminal you use. Arrival from JFK at T5; and absolute joy. Clean bright terminal with plenty of space and well-laid out. UK border control inwards a breeze through the EU passports line (queued for less than 5 mins after 0700 arrival on a Sat) and baggage already waiting at carousel. Reached the big bright arrivals hall in less than 30 mins after touchdown. At an airport like LHR such a feat is impressive. Whether departing or arriving T5 is always a pleasure. Easy transfer to T3 with the LHR express but T3 itself is another story. It is cramped and all thoroughfares are jammed with throngs of pax mostly with overloaded baggage trollies. Seating is an option only if you buy something at one of the food outlets. Queuing at security is efficient thanks to the staff who constantly keep watch and regularly re-distribute the queue. I never sit in the central seating area/food court. Too much like a shopping mall and always unpleasantly overcrowded and noisy.

It's pretty awful by world standards don’t really care though that the distances between transport services are long or that shopping is really basic or that it is really crowded I care like most others how long it takes to get through customs and immigration on arrival. What a contrast after arriving on a Friday morning from Australia I was through in no time at all. Come one week later on a Sunday night transferring through London for one night arriving from Madrid and we spent longer in the queue to get into the customs hall than the flight time itself! No security issue just pure volume of numbers. Strongly recommend if you are an elderly traveller you request airline wheelchair assistance if using this airport more than 2 hours on your feet after a long flight is not a pleasant welcome.

This time in in the morning from Basel and out late evening for Edinburgh. On arrival I was delighted to see far more staff manning the border control checkpoints and more e-gates open. A really quick passage through, only stymied by waiting for our baggage for more than 20 mins. Some you win, some you lose. On my return, I was taking my first 'domestic' flight to Edinburgh. Once upon a time, domestic flights had a different part of the airport, and no security, but those days are gone. I was processed quickly and efficiently by security although the area was very busy. Having a lot of time before my flight I decided to investigate the shops, but wasn't tempted. There is a considerable choice of dining options and with a long wait ahead I enjoyed my meal at Giraffe. Once my gate was called, I had a new experience but not one that I'd care to repeat often. My flight was called to Gate 84, via a tunnel with streams of passengers walking in both directions with no separation of inbound and outbound passengers. Once in the gate area, there were no separations of the four flights due to depart - two to Edinburgh, one to Glasgow and one to Belfast. It was quite disconcerting to see people openly drinking from beer bottles and as there were no separation markers, it was very hard to find out where to queue (especially the difference between 'speedy' boarding and 'other' boarding in the case of my Easyjet flight). Passengers inbound from these aircraft simply walked up to the area where we were waiting and had to push their way through the throng of waiting passengers to get into the tunnel and back to the terminal. Is it always like this on a Friday night at this time?

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,A Pease,France,2015-07-06,"I have been very critical of Stansted in the recent past, but on my latest experience - inbound 2 July and outbound 4 July - I have to say that security was working more efficiently as regards the number of E-gates in operation, and that the dreaded shopping mall corridor, transit corridor into the food area and the food area itself was much more acceptable because the overhead panels had been removed allowing plenty of daylight and reducing the feeling of claustrophobia and the 'hamster in a tunnel' feeling. The exit to the Ryanair 'wing' has been moved and the passageway along the windows has been narrowed and access to the toilets removed. This makes for considerable congestion - including a few brave souls returning to the terminal against the flow, and the narrowing seems to be also in force in the 'underground' corridor between the departures lounge and the steps/escalator to the Ryanair 'wing', which made some of the older people around me panic that they might miss their flight. The airport was extremely busy and the only new, but major, criticism I have was the queue at the Ryanair desk at the start of the Ryanair 'wing' which stretched back into the corridor and the escalator/steps area due to handling passengers whose flight had been cancelled. This made it very congested for passengers arriving at the 'wing' for their gates. It might be helpful if the queue for passengers needing attention from the desk be separated by ropes so that the flow of passengers into the terminal could be better controlled as there is a potential danger of 'overcrowding' in such a small, enclosed area.",Arrival and Departure,06-07-2015,Solo Leisure,7,3,3,3,NA,3,3,NA,NA,0

I do not use this airport anymore but my schedule required I had to do so but nothing has improved. It really is the pits. As you enter the airport you have to weave through passengers now making their way to the new location of the security area. To be fair this was reasonably quick once we had walked about 50 metres back and forward through the ever wonderful queuing pens. You are then forced to wander through a shopping mall and into an unmade bottleneck to emerge into a building site. There are not enough seats and Stansted's owners then believe that by not telling you of your gate number you will utilise the retail opportunities. Really? Once you get your gate number and catch the silly little train you find a quiet gate lounge with plenty of seats and an air of calm compared to the dump at the main terminal. Returning into the border control is farcical. The automated gates take longer than the ordinary gates so don't bother to use them. And guess what? Despite the queues 5 of the automated gates were locked out of use. If you managed to get through with a single swipe of the passport you were lucky and many people were not. There was one helpless officer on the other side dashing back and forth telling people to simply try again. It really is pitiful. There is plenty of room to extend this area and add more machines (in return for the APD paid) but they have not done so as it would mean moving a large area reserved for unused luggage trolleys. Most flights are low cost meaning that people do not need luggage trolleys - they just want to get through the airport quickly and stress free. Stansted is unable to do this and this is because MAG believe that it is a third rate shopping mall that some planes fly from.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,A Pease,France,2014-11-20,Having seen the construction of the 'new' single terminal Stansted Airport and having used it extensively over the last 25 years my latest experience (inbound 7 November outbound 11 November) showed positive changes in the speed of flow through Border Control and outgoing security (which although I could have been 'lucky' in my arrival and departure times cannot be anything but a good thing) but I was horrified by the World DutyFree shopping area which dominates the start of the airside facilities. No daylight lowered ceilings and nowhere to go but to wind my way through hell and heavy sales pitches all too similar to what I hate about Manchester airport. The redevelopment airside is all to do with commercial opportunity and this coupled with the lack of seating and natural daylight really drags this airport down. It's almost a pleasure to reach the relatively spartan wing of the terminal given over to Ryanair's flights and even then today I found myself for the first time going down what used to be the domestic arm of the terminal building which was even less appealing on the eye but far more suited to air travel rather than high-end shopping. It is disappointing to see so few if any domestic flights and the whole airport seems to be losing its function putting commercial activities ahead of a short walk from the street to the gate which was one of the USPs of the initial design. I would recommend the airport for its proximity to London the wide range of destinations it serves and for good ground transport links but regret that I no longer feel that I could recommend it as an airport because it seems to be principally an upmarket shopping experience with a flight thrown in.,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Despite the length of the queues at security checking (and the number of people who seem to have no idea about how to prepare for a security check) on both occasions it took only 15 minutes to get from land to airside. Staff were friendly and polite. Airside was still undergoing its building work and hence was very crowded with a lack of seating poor signage and departure screens too small to read from any distance. Hopefully these matters will be addressed by the upgrade. I think the airport is improving under its new ownership - I hope I am not proved wrong!,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,S Wilson,United Kingdom,2014-07-27,A plea to anyone thinking of using Stansted Airport and arriving at this website - Don't do it. Queues that Walt Disney would cry at. Lack of staff. Masses of people crossing each other trying to get from check in to departures. Lack of seating in departures unless you want to spend more money in a restaurant. Shuttle trains with only one carriage instead of two no information on that one just doors with queues to nowhere. If anyone does use Stansted I hope they have a very relaxing holiday for the return visit will drain you. Immigration queues beyond any I have experienced and as a regular traveller to America its a breeze there by comparison. Baggage hall delays with absolutely no staff to ask. Irregular buses to car parks with multiple stops outside the terminal which just adds to chaos. Southend and Gatwick are by far better choices.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,M Horsfield,United Kingdom,2014-07-06,"I refuse to use Stansted Airport since MAG has taken it over and are systematically ruining it. Lord Foster who designed it designed it be a straight through airport so you walk in one direction through the terminal. Now as you enter the airport you are confronted by a wave of passengers traversing the terminal to the security areas at the southern end of the airport. This area is like something out of Communist era with about as much charm and efficiency to match. And for what? So that more retail outlets can be built that nobody wants. When will Uk airports learn that what passengers want and need is to get through them easily and efficiently. We do not go to airports to shop we go to them to travel and I take great offence at being forced through retail areas directly after security. I also take huge offence at being asked to present my boarding card if I wish to buy a newspaper or a packet of mints. Is it any wonder that there are queues and delays with this unnecessary nonsense. I always refuse. Arriving into Stansted is a lottery with its pathetic Border Control area. In the half hour or so you stand and queue you can amuse yourself by watching the Border Control officers looking down on the queues and the unmanned gates and think ""why don't you do something useful and come and open an additional gate rather than looking at your clipboard?""

Flying into it was good. No issues and the busses are a very short walk from the terminal. The issue with this airport is departures. We arrived back on our bus went to drop our bag and were greeted with a very long line for bag drop. We had pre- booked fast track security after reading some of the reviews on this site and we were glad we did that. Once though security is where our main issue with this airport started. We had 2 hours to wait and there was not enough seats for everyone who was there. The departures lounge was dirty too. The bar had no seats and when you did find one the table still had the previous guests trash on them. Also getting in and out of London takes a very long time from Stansted.

Arrival though was very poor: first we were kept waiting on the aircraft for 15 minutes as 'the terminal doors were locked' in mid-afternoon (was nobody expecting us?). There then followed a very long walk indeed to the truly dreadful passport control area (always extremely crowded) we joined the queue for the automatic readers though an official said it would probably be quicker to queue for a conventional check - he was right. The long-stay car park is very expensive given its distance from the terminal (a 10 minute bus ride) and has the most confusing numbering system for the bus stops known to man - as I have said before be very careful to note exactly where you park your car and which bus stop you use.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Once in the departures area there is a choice of food and shopping all standard major airport fare. A long walk to the gate but plenty of time was given and seating was available at the gate. On return the queue for passport control was enormous (20 minutes wait) no apology or reason given (sheer pressure of numbers I assume). Luggage was already on the belt when I got there (not difficult given the wait at the passport control). The bus from and to the long-stay car park was pretty efficient though you must note the stop you use when you arrive (some 'letter' areas have two stops and colour codes are also used) - if not you will be wandering about for hours!

Departure is where the well thought out Stansted plan fails badly. Too many people for the terminal to cope with. The departure area is cluttered with too many shops and check in is too close to the doors leading to jostling crowds. Very bad. Then security is almost always under-manned leading to long queues.

Yes it looks a bit like a permanent construction site on the inside and yes it can be crowded but I prefer it to Heathrow. On the other hand I never use Ryan Air or Easy Jet (my last flight from STN was on Turkish) so maybe this helps.

For a first timer you will need to keep your wits about you. After collecting your bags you face a very very long trip to retrieve your car from the Long stay. Expect your wife and kids to wait a good 45 minutes for you to return. The problem is the pick up point is effectively outdoors and your companions may freeze to death waiting for you. But if they wait in the terminal how are you going to find each other once you return etc.? In practice you have to negotiate some confusing signage to find the 15 minute pick up zone amongst many similar zones. Choose the wrong one and you've got another lap to do. Once parked sprint as fast as you can to find your companions in the airport - the clock is ticking. Sprint back down again with all your trolleys then the next challenge is to find your car. Stansted offers you a number of exit points all designed identically and impossible to distinguish from each other. You will come out at the wrong one the coaches Zone XX eventually you find your car. Load up as fast as you can and sprint back to the ticket machine before the 15 minutes expires. If you're lucky you will make it. If you're unlucky the queue at the ticket machine will be too long. And the object of all this? Is to obtain £1 from you.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Another person in a red uniform said many of the kiosks in this row were down. So why didn't the person directing me to use them know this? An utter fiasco. As I left to the real person passport check line, people in red were arguing among themselves as to which machines were working, which were not.  Went downstairs to baggage claim and another fiasco. Baggage carousels had signage showing all the arriving international flights, but no information as to which carousel to go for your flight's baggage. Master baggage carousel sign on the wall listed all the flights. Again no information as to which carousel to use.

I about choked when I was told they sell for over $11 each. Funny how retail stores must have a price shown for every item while LAX hasn't got a clue.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,N Raven,Canada,2013-10-22,An atrocious place to transfer between international flights. Also dingy understaffed and too small for the volume of passengers moving through. City and/or state and/or national authorities should be embarrassed by this place which is the first glimpse of many visitors. I understand that American airports have no concept of passengers in transit but LAX makes transferring especially tedious. On my last trip my 747 from Australia dumped its load into a Border Security hall that had only 6 agents working and which looked like the basement of a community centre. It took me 45 minutes to get through. Half the people in the line were panicking due to tight connections. After getting through the border (after which I was just going to be getting on a flight to another country anyway) I had to retrieve my bag go through another passport and bag check and then recheck the bag with United personnel who were behaving as if this was the first time they had done this. Next I had to find out where my next flight departed from. This was very difficult because the departure board in each terminal only shows the flights that depart from that terminal. So I had to ask an off-duty employee to point me in the general direction - which turned out to be the terminal farthest from my current location of course. Next I had to find my way with bags in tow from Terminal 7 to Terminal 2 (even though both airlines were Star Alliance partners). To make this journey one has three options: take a shuttle bus that circulates between the terminals walk the long long way around the horseshoe-shaped road or cut across the horseshoe on foot. Mindful of my short connection time I chose the latter. But the airport does not make it easy. Traffic is heavy there are no guiding signs and crosswalks are few. But I made it. Then I went through security all over again. Having started out with a 3-hour layover I made it to the gate 30 minutes before boarding. Well done LAX. Compare this to my experience in at least 3 other international non-American airports: got off plane looked at departure board for the gate for my next flight walk to that gate wait get on plane for a destination in another country.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Also the non-US line was divided into two by a very elderly man working for Immigration who waited until there was a jam then released some people into a second queue but did so in such a way as to prolong the queue and queue-jump some people.

On other extreme going through T8 travelling in Business or First I normally get through as UK citizen in 10 minutes including the walk. Bags though are universally slow. On the other side TBIT has good food outlet and shopping choices whereas T8 has virtually nothing. So if flying out and peckish you should walk to TBIT to shop and eat then go back to T8 to enter TSA.

Landing at LA for refueling required all transit passengers to have an ESTA and to pass through immigration even though we were not willingly in the US and were leaving in two hours time. What a chaotic and unnecessary procedure! Upon disembarking “continuing the same flight” transit passengers were separated from other passengers and given an “Orange card” some were herded directly into a large secure lounge with an adjacent smaller lounge with refreshments (coke coffee crisps) others at random were directed to the only staffed immigration desk (one of two) for processing in the usual way (fingerprints photographs and strange questions). Then an announcement was made that all those who had not been processed had to go down to the main immigration processing centre – although we are not American Citizens we were made American Citizens for the afternoon because their line was shorter and then we were processed and stamped. At the desk we were asked “what was the purpose of our visit today” even though we had handed in an “orange I am in transit” card and a transit boarding card. Appropriately stamped and approved to be in transit we were then sent to a secure lift (a member of staff who knew code numbers was required to operate it) and escorted back to the lounge where we started out from (and where our names were crossed off a list of transit passengers who had been approved to be in transit) and we mixed again with those who had or who had not yet been processed.

A variety of vans for private parking lots hotels and others use the same area and other people who aren't supposed to use the area also pull in. Chaotic. While in some ways it would be nice to have all terminals together so you didn't have to go outside to go from terminal to terminal the chaos that results in some airports where everyone is under one roof (eg.

There was a line for the baggage drop but it moved quickly. Security was fast and efficient. Officers on duty where not rude as you expect them to be at LAX which was a nice surprise. Facilities at T5 are not very exciting with a McDonald California Pizza Kitchen take away and one or two small shops. Since it was breakfast time I opted for McDonald as you don't get anything on Delta domestic. The terminal had some natural light and did not feel dark or dingy. Arrived back at T5 at night and the terminal did not have many flights arriving. However it took around 40 minutes to get the bags which was extremely annoying. Also there was no ground staff available when a big suit case blocked the other bags to come out. Luckily a passenger took care of this which earned him a round of applause. The signage once you are outside is pretty clear where you have to wait for which shuttle. Next day left through TBIT to Heathrow and found the facilities have improved since my last visit to TBIT. They have done a face lift and are still working on it. Security took a while though and there is nothing actually after security. So eat and do your duty free shopping before security.

Since AA only has two international flights a day from LAX (to NRT and LHR) the facilities were pretty straightforward and easy to use. However when we arrived there were only three people at immigration (2 for foreigners and 1 for US citizens) so I was glad that I ran from the plane to immigration as people who came out last had to queue quite a while to get through. I waited for approx 15 minutes but the immigration officer was pretty friendly and efficient. After immigration my luggage was waiting and I could go through customs where again only two officers were handling almost 300 pax. All in all I was at my car rental in 45minutes after touch-down which was not bad. When I departed the check-in hall was quite busy and AA has implemented the self service check-in everywhere so you could see many pax who were confused and needed help by the grumpy ground staff. TSA was quite quick and so was security. There is no immigration if you leave from T4 on an international flight and you just hand your departure card to the ground staff at the gate. Facilities are so so at T4 and consists of a few shops selling magazines etc and two mexican restaurants. Since it was before Christmas the terminal was quite full and it seemed every flight that day was overbooked. Restrooms were ok but I have seen better and cleaner ones at other airports. I think T4 is not a bad terminal to use and I found it to be quite efficient and rather modern in comparison to other terminals at LAX.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The immigration officials are painfully slow and exeptionally bossy and rude there is no A/C (by the way there are different queues but no one cares which one you're in choose the shortest) it is mosquito infested and dirty... shabby. the toilets will make you want to vomit.... after you've been to the immigration desk they will take your passport from you and you will have to wait an age to get it back with your visa... there are no seats. This is a good time to try and get your luggage sometimes the officials will let you through to get it sometimes not it's completely random just like everything else... expect anything as they change the procedures regularly and without informing anyone. Once you have your bags you're almost there just have to negotiate corrupt officials searching your bag and being accosted by local con men/pick- pockets once you're outside. I can't even begin to describe departure.... long queues to get through.. be careful when you go past duty free as there is a security check (a guy in a glass room looking for a bribe) once you are upstairs it's a bit easier.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

You embark and disembark right on the tarmac and walk right into custom clearance. Folks needing visa-on-arrival will have to purchase 1 there and then. There is only 1 luggage belt in Arrival. Wait patiently for your luggage before you exit the Arrival Gate. An officer will tear away your luggage identification tags before you could exit (I suppose it's some security thing) and they are quite particular about it. Thereafter you'll exit the Arrival Gate and walk right into a carpark with a money exchanger on your right.

In spite of arriving 2.5 hours ahead of departure I have nearly missed 2 out of 4 flights from Luton this year alone due to the ridiculous queues at bag drop with Easyjet and unacceptable queues through security. Staff don't seem to care. It takes two hours to do what is done in around 20 minutes at Edinburgh or Heathrow T5. Absolute shame on the management team at Luton airport - please visit any other UK airport and see how it should be done. It all seems to be about fleecing the traveller from Â£ £2.50 for drop off to charging to 'fast track' though security and it's anything but 'fast' but the alternative is missing your flight.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,M Davis,Ireland,2014-12-10,Very surprised at the negative reviews about London Luton. I have a choice between Birmingham and Luton to fly to Dublin and have chosen Luton most of the time because it's that bit closer. It's not a pretty airport but it's easy to use and I totally disagree regarding the staff they have been some of the nicest (and consistently so!) of any airport I've used especially going through security without exception they have all been beyond friendly and helpful. Food choices are not bad and the facilities are generally clean. On the down side the gate I've mostly used Gate 15 is not great with only a few seats for a full plane load of passengers. In the general concourse too there are not enough seats unless you decide to use one of the restaurants or cafes. And you need a bus to get to the train station long term car parks and the car hire centre. But that can be expected at a lot of airports. Luton doesn't have the big airlines or traffic of the other London airports so I guess it hasn't had the same ability to develop top class facilities but it has always been a pleasant experience arriving or departing every time I've used it. I think some people leaving reviews should bear in mind that at Luton they're boarding airlines like Easyjet Ryanair and Wizzair. It's not the golden age of flying and we're not boarding Constellations to cross the Atlantic. This is Luton Airport with low cost airlines and they've done a great job each and every time I've gone through.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

On the way back queued for 20 minutes at passport control. On the basis you spend all your time queuing there is not time to visit the shops they will try and rob you at every opportunity (£2 for a plastic bag etc). There were two you ladies travelling on my inbound flight with young children one of whom was heavily pregnant. Were the buggies delivered to the aircraft steps? - no they were delivered the baggage belt a good way away and on the other side of the ridiculous passport queue.

Coming back into the UK the EU passport line was very long and the non-EU very short. We were held up a bit longer as non-EU passport holders due to others ahead of us having visa problems but staff worked as efficiently as possible to get through the backlog.

If the person you wish to meet does not stand exactly in the pickup area but at the side of the road at the entrance to it you still have to pay to get out but a couple of weeks later you receive an eighty pound fine from APCOA parking. If space really was a problem they could make a free drop off line with a 3 minute maximum stop to get as many cars in and out as possible. Works nicely at Nice with no need for enforcement. The current arrangement at Luton is just calculated to maximise income. Luton will be my last possible choice of British airports in the future. Liverpool was much better. Not enough seating in departures unless you buy a drink that you don't want and all the little extras to gouge even more.

There is a rip-off fee for 'Priority' security a distance of some 10 metres and a possible time saving of 15 minutes another rip-off scam based on the exact size and the type of fastening of clear plastic bags required for liquids. In the past year there has been a distinct improvement in the politeness and care of the security search staff but you can still be bawled at or humiliated in front of other passengers. The amount of seating in the airport 'lounge' has been reduced (area taken over by Pret a Manger and other cafés). After boarding clearance has begun the holding areas are cramped and are often simply stark staircases. On return I have found the automatic passport gates (installed at enormous cost to the tax-payer) open just 7 times out of the hundreds (see above) of times I have travelled whilst staff actually manually checking passports are always too few while colleagues stand idly by.

Staff are aggressive and moody gum chewing security personnel seem to be in abundance but its still painfully slow also usually chaotic and overcrowded. Now the new overflow security channels are open which issue forth to the old terminal area - so if you want to use the facilities in the main terminal its a 10 minute walk and don't even think about buying the fast track ticket for security (which went up 25% from £3 to £4 last week) as you will be turned away if they are sending you to the overflow security channels.

Having used Gatwick and Heathrow you have a few gripes but if only I knew. With Stansted not being available until Ski Season I am faced with Luton for the majority of the year. Every week I fight to get to the airport on time for my flight. Getting to the terminal is dire the congestion and planning behind the feed into that roundabout is nothing short of mindless. Unfortunately I cannot see how they can now go back. I have not made it to the terminal by transport on a Monday morning for 3 months always resulting in legging it from a few hundred yards the wrong side of the roundabout. In fact the airport carpark shuttle bus regularly just opens the doors and let's its passengers make the dash - I dread the wetter months coming. Once in the terminal it is quite quick - provided you take the £3 priority security option which although very quick compared to the alternative is just a wrong concept when taking into account you are only late because of the traffic congestion arriving at the terminal. Arrivals - the immigration is quite often stacked up and the last thing you need. In general I like to think I'm an easy going guy who doesn't grumble too much - but I really hate getting up at 4am on a Monday morning knowing I'm hit or miss as to whether I will get my flight.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

It took 20 minutes from parking our car in the long stay car park to walking into the terminal queues at non-fast track security were very short and we were through in a few minutes.

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Federico Muscogiuri,Spain,2014-10-28,Madrid Barajas is a complicated airport. For a start it would be more adequate to describe it as a tale of two airports. Terminals 1-2-3 are within walking distance to one another. Terminal 1 is mostly used by low cost airlines and has the ambience and charm of a bus station. It is also used by non-Schengen flights except those operated by Iberia and other Oneworld airlines. The non-Schengen section of the Terminal 1 is a bit quieter and modern. There is only one overpriced eaterie queues for check in and security are long but overall it does its job. Terminal 2 is pretty similar but is used by Lufthansa Swiss and Star Alliance airlines. Occasionally however I have caught the odd Easyjet/Ryanair flight from there. Terminal 3 is more modern and airy definitely the best of the bunch with Skyteam airlines mostly using it. Terminal 4 is located about 4 kms from the main three terminals and it is connected by a frequent and free shuttle bus (I don't understand some passengers' complaints about connection from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4). It is used by Iberia and Oneworld airlines as well as those airlines that have a code-share agreement with Iberia. It is architecturally impressive and compared to the other terminals feels relatively uncrowded however there are three things that really bother me about it 1) long walks from one gate to another 2) the fact that now you find it impossible to transit from one area to another without having to pass through some Duty Free and 3) any eating place is almost twice as expensive than in the city. Despite its shortcomings one thing that sets Barajas apart from other airports in Europe and the US is the public transport which is excellent from all Terminals. I live in Madrid and moan about Barajas but when I travel via CDG or FRA (not to mention US airports) then I realise that it's not bad after all.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Michael Davies,United Kingdom,2014-05-20,Arrival and departure into Terminal 4S with British Airways. Arrival efficient - no queues at automated passport control. The waiting time for baggage was similar to other airports of this type. Taxis into the centre of Madrid now operate a flat fee system of â‚¬30. At least you know what you are going to pay in advance. The journey was quick as traffic was light on Saturday evening. Departure - This time I took the Metro at â‚¬5. Once at the airport the directional arrows take a little bit of getting used to at first. Check in at BA counter quick with no queues. The fast track security also had no queues. Just missed one of the satellite shuttles but the next one came within 3 minutes. I cannot comment on the eating and drinking facilities as I didn't use any. The passage to the gates was through the duty free section - an unavoidable nuisance at a lot of airports now it seems. On time departure and no queuing on the taxiway. Overall an excellent experience.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,Paul Clifford,United Kingdom,2014-01-04,I use Barajas a lot. Your experience of the airport really depends on which terminal you use. Lately I have used Terminal 2 which I think is the best of all of them.

I was surprised to see the negative reviews; my own experience was very positive overall. First car rental drop off is very convenient right at the terminal no shuttle bus needed. (But be aware if you have a morning flight that I experienced pretty awful weekday Madrid rush hour traffic.) It's true that Section A gates are a fairly long walk but free luggage carts are provided after security and unlike so many US airports there was plenty of (attractive) seating at the gates.

Overall the facilities are good and the airport is clean. There also generally isn't much of a queue for or immigration on arrival. Immigration on departure can be slower but additional staff seem to appear when a queue builds up. There are 2 main issues though. Baggage reclaim at T4 is always very slow - last time the bags took 45 minutes to arrive even though we landed off peak when there were hardly any other flights. I don't know how they manage to make it so slow. Also don't plan on shopping for anything practical a traveller might want - there are lots of shops selling expensive branded clothes and luxury products but it's difficult to find somewhere to buy a newspaper and there's nothing useful air-side like a chemist (it would be good to have a branch of Boots or something similar).,NA,NA,NA,5,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

There are plentiful food and shopping options and clean toilet facilities. Outbound to Buenos Aires those of us travelling to the Western Hemisphere left through the back of the plane and were driven to 4S in a bus so there was no need to go through security again.

Keep going until you board the fast train that travels under the airport to where you collect your bags and then if you need to take the incredibly cheap and fast bus into the city.

Many of the catering outlets keep odd hours and some don't accept credit/debit cards. But the bottlenecks that were common at passport control seem to have smoothed out and the signing has been improved. Procedures at security and customs continue to be highly professional and efficient and the staff courteous.

This time we found the road exit and ingress were different: no longer does one pass the San Miguel factory but instead there is an almost direct link with the motorway system which is an improvement. Less helpful was the signage from the hire car return area to the terminal which was actually confusing and we had to wander backwards and forwards until we recognised somewhere familiar. Once in the terminal itself everything went fairly smoothly apart from finding the shortest route through the unavoidable ""duty free"" area. By careful studying of flights already boarding we were able to anticipate the likely gate area for our flight though we didn't go through passport control till we were sure having got it wrong on a previous transit!",NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1

Leaving was far less satisfactory the signing is very confusing the screen suggested we needed Terminal 2 a longish walk but having got there we found that with hand luggage only we had to go to the departure area in T3 - right next to where we came in. Having gone through security (5-10 minute wait) we found seating but when the gate was announced (over an hour before departure) it was a matter of standing around in a corridor through which passengers for other flights were trying to pass.

I'd agree about the distances to be walked for departures. We had less far to walk on arrival but that might have been because we were transferred from the plane by bus rather than airbridge so taken almost directly to Arrivals. Roadworks right outside the airport rather undermine the otherwise impressive appearance of the terminal building: access to Departures seemed to take us virtually through a petrol station forecourt! Security busy but reasonably free flowing but in the departure area (pier B) it was very difficult to hear flight announcements especially those from the desks themselves because the gates are on busy thoroughfares with food bars around them so there is a great deal of noise going on. The fact that we had a late change of gate when the queues for our easyJet flight had already formed did not help matters.

There are no flight announcements so you have to watch the screens. Airside there is a cafe (US$ preferred surcharge for local currency) plus a range of shops selling items you need and do not need and duty free goods at reasonable prices.

As an infrequent user of T3 though I find the geography of the place confusing but to be fair there does appear to be more than adequate signage.

Minor irritations on our return: our Ryanair flight had to wait several minutes before it could access its designated stand and the e passport readers were being temperamental (my wife had no problems but I had to be re-directed to a manned desk).

Last time leaving early am T3 when all the US flights are leaving no delay at security and when I came back was in my car 15 minutes after the plane doors opened (no luggage.)

Although they can be irritating and time-consuming I completely understand why they are necessary. That said what I do consider unnecessary is being on the receiving end of rude and abrasive behaviour from security staff. I travelled through Manchester Airport at the weekend and can honestly say I have never had such an unpleasant experience while going through security. The chap at the conveyor belt didn't speak to me - he barked instructions treated me like I was a moron and even got uppity at the way I picked the plastic tray up off the conveyor.

Flight left at 0700 and the passage through security was painless with plenty of staff and a minimum of delays. Not a great deal of choice if you want to eat before boarding. Tortuous route to the gates through the shops like too many airports they seem to consider they are a shopping mall which lets planes park outside. On return we left the plane to find ourselves walking through very narrow corridors and up steep and narrow flights of steps to get to immigration. Immigration well staffed and no queues. I tried the electronic passport scanning gates while my wife went to the conventional desks. She was through 3 times quicker than I was they are going to have to do something about the electronic system if people are going to be persuaded to use it. Interminable time for the machine to scan your passport then having to stand motionless in front of a camera while it compares the images. Not good.

Staff are friendly and efficient and there's plenty of seating and a reasonable range of places to have a drink or something to eat in the departure lounge. Drawbacks: the forced torturous route to the departure lounge through the duty free shopping area and the weird way in which the piers are configured leading to arriving passengers having to go down a long flight of stairs - not an escalator - then immediately back up a similarly long flight to the same level.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,M Allan,United Kingdom,2011-09-11,"Standards definitely seem to be on a downhill slide at this airport - noticeable over the past 5 years. Generally use T2 - check-in queues are usually just about acceptable (we usually fly early morning) but delays in getting through security are becoming a real deterrent to using this airport. Over an hour's wait on our most recent departure just to clear the secure area. Completely understand the importance of security measures but the airport needs to employ more staff. We were in T2 in August and it seemed quieter than usual - however the food court still had debris all over most of the tables at 6am. Dread to think what it must be like later in the day. Knowing that we normally board approx 40 mins before departure time we presumed that we were on for a delay when nothing appeared on the departure boards - thankfully we strolled down to our gate to double check - only to find that boarding had commenced. No wonder you hear so many last minute calls for missing passengers. My main gripe however is the experience on return. It is not unusual to wait over 30 mins for an airbridge. This is bad enough but then you have to tackle the immigration process - woe betide if a large aircraft has landed from outside the EU - could be an hour's queuing.

The area before check- in made me want to get through security immediately; dark dingy and depressing. After check- in I found myself in what appeared to be a bright massive department store-come-shopping centre. Anything that might suggest the presence of aircraft and boarding gates were missing or lost amongst the neon glare of perfume counters and tobacco signs. I saw a young family who were obviously about to miss their flight frantically ask another passenger in the airport for directions to the gates because the entire terminal was designed to encourage as much transit shopping as possible and no thought was given to the fact that people actually had flights to catch. Confirmation of flight boarding gates are not announced until the flight is about ready to board so unlike almost every other airport I've ever used there is no option to just relax at the gate as you wait for your flight. The other downside of this is that if there's been a delay to your flight which there was both times I flew out of Manchester there's no one to turn to because the only staff around are shop assistants.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

This airport is definitely not the worst in the world judging from these terminals - I found it no worse really than many I have been to. Everyone was friendly and all spoke English. The tannoy announcements in Term 2 are obtrusive. I appreciate it would be expensive to replace the tannoy with monitors. Instead I believe the system could be improved greatly by abolishing the annoying three ""dings"" before and after every announcement. I needed to transfer from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 and from landing to arrival in Terminal 2 this took just over an hour. It seemed quiet when I was there (a weekday afternoon). At busy times I would guess that the transfer system would be unable to cope because it relies on small buses. My bus actually went all round the airport to various buildings before finally dropping me off so it may take much longer than you expect. And don't rely on the driver telling you when you have to get off. You can't enter airside without paying a ""terminal fee"" of 550PHP. This must be paid in cash (PHP or US dollars only). In Terminal 2 there are a few places you can get food and drink. There is also free wi-fi which worked better than the wi-fi where I had come from (Dubai).

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Liam Moulton,Indonesia,2014-08-07,I flew into terminal 1 on a Royal Brunei flight and was amazed at how quick immigration was. Transit bus to terminal 2 was ok if a bit infrequent. Domestic departures for terminal 2 is clean and modern if rather sparse. What disappointed me most was the fact one can't buy a beer once through security. However my worst ordeal was when I flew back to Indonesia from the Philippines. You need to pass through 2 checkpoints just to reach the check-in desks of terminal 1. When I got to Royal Brunei's check-in desks it was understaffed with unhelpful staff and it took 40 minutes for me to get served. I then had to pay for a departures tax which was absolutely ludicrous given this is a pathetic excuse for an airport. When I got through immigration half the facilities were out of service due to renovation and there wasn't even a money changer. This in particular annoyed me as you'd expect this in one of Asia's largest international airports. Furthermore I arrived just over 2 hours before departure which seems like plenty of time but by the time I got through there wasn't that long before boarding and had I arrived half an hour later I would have struggled to make my flight. Therefore you must arrive here at least 3 hours before departure to be safe. Overall this airport is in a sorry state and terminal 1 likely employs the same number of staff as it employed when it opened back in 1981 which makes it chaotic. Unless the Philippine Airport authorities get their act together they will deter both tourists and investors which will only adversely affect its economy. Other major hubs in Asia even much-criticised ones like Jakarta Soekarno- Hatta and Shanghai Pudong provide a much better experience and airports like Singapore Changi Hong Kong and Bangkok Suvarnabhumi really heap shame on Manila. Sadly if you're flying to the Philippines this airport is usually your only feasible choice.,NA,NA,NA,2,2,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Roberto Ligot,Philippines,2014-08-07,Terminal 1 - this is my country's first airport built almost 2+ decades ago! I am ashamed of this structure and whatever is in it. Arriving from KKIA (Riyadh) and Changi (Singapore) you can really see the difference! Immigration was ok except that I felt like I was queuing for cinema tickets! Customs was a breeze. Adding to the humidity and terrible heat is the chaotic meeting area on lower ground! Departure - terribly hot in the check-in area good thing I was invited to stay in the Singapore Airlines Business Club Lounge that somehow eased the stress! Air-conditioning was still terrible on a rainy day. How I wish they would refurbish this very tired Terminal 1!,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2014-06-12,NAIA-1. Complete Zoo of a place. On Arrival I had a 30 minute wait for Immigration and a further 45 minute for baggage (many were longer) with no functioning aircon in either area. Customs is not a problem and taxi wait was OK late at night but I was 1 hour 20 minutes to exit the terminal. On Departure a 20 minute wait just to get into Departures but fortunately I'd checked in online for Emirates but for that the other poor souls would be waiting a couple of hours in queues stretching half way across the terminal. Most of the seating has been removed airside in departures and there were dozens of passengers sitting on the floor. Pretty quick to take your PHP 550 Terminal Fee. Immigration was another 20 minutes and I usually shell out PHP600 to get into one of the pay lounges upstairs - mainly to be able to sit in a comfortable seat relax and to get access to a clean toilet. NAIA-1 is just an awful place - mainly because for years it's been working at 3 times it's design capacity for passenger numbers. My Rating is based on T1 - T3 is much better. I also passed through NAIA-3 - way better experience. Quick into the terminal Cebu Pacific slick on check-in. Immigration and Security efficient with comfortable and spacious Departure Areas. Upon Arrival I was out of the terminal within 30 minutes of landing including Immigration and Baggage.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,2014-04-16,Well it's taken them 6 years but they've finally managed to screw up T3. Arrived early afternoon at the extreme southern end of the terminal. Carpets in the piers are disgusting and haven't been cleaned in years. Not a single travelator was working the entire length of the terminal (and no aircon either). T3 has over 20 Arrival Immigration Desks. How many were manned? 5. With 3 flights arriving within a few minutes of each other it took nearly an hour to get my passport stamped. In the baggage hall there were no information screens working which wasn't much of a problem since all 3 flights bags were on the single operating carousel again no air conditioning. Lots of Customs Officials though doing what I do not know. I decided to get a metered taxi but at mid afternoon there was a queue of about 50 or 60 people waiting with no taxis arriving. (They actually have seats in the Taxi queue). After a few minutes I decided to go upstairs to see if I could get a taxi which had just dropped off but the only way to get there is to walk the whole length of the terminal (again) entering without a ticket on the pretext of going to the Cebu Pacific Ticket Office going up to the Departures level and again walking the entire length of the terminal since all of the doors except 1 are entry only - total nonsense. I was able to get a taxi within a few minutes. I can't imagine how long those people had to wait outside arrivals for a cab. T3 Departures works fine most of the time but the Arrivals experience is getting worse as the terminal fills up. I cannot imagine what T3 would be like if it was working to capacity - parts of it are dirty it's not maintained it's not properly staffed the organisation is chaotic at best and it appears they don't want to waste money on running air conditioning or other mechanical equipment - but it's still the best MNL Terminal.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

I live in the Philippines (I am British) and use the airport several times a year. While not a great airport I never thought it was a candidate for the world's worst until now. The place was on the point of collapse with the flight information system not working the drop off area like a war zone chaotic queues laughably confusing inaccurate or non existent signage immigration staff who did not have a clue how to process foreigners with resident status and disgusting airport lounge facilities.

Minimal traffic at that time couple of minutes wait for security screening entering T3. Zero wait at Check-In very efficient. I went upstairs for a look around. Plenty eating places open but none that I fancied at that time in the morning. They've taken away a lot of the seating upstairs - yes you can sit down but you have to spend money to do so. A few minutes to pay airport tax (550PHP) and get through Immigration and Security. Airside at that time in the morning only a few places were open. Duty Free was closed so I went to the gate area to stretch out and nap until my flight boarded.

The big issue was that the pick up area was totally clogged up. I fly through this airport a lot and it's far from the best of airports but it usually functions. In this case drivers have bribed the traffic co-ordinators to park in the pick-up/drop off areas indefinitely whilst they waited for the people they were picking up. We had a pick up organised and it took over an hour for the driver to move the 200 meters to get into the pick up area.

Hadn't been through T1 for a while - I usually try and avoid it. Arrivals is a zoo with very little you can do to avoid the queues at Immigration other than sitting close to the front of the aircraft and hoping that 2 other flights don't arrive at the same time. 20 mins there would be good 45 mins not unusual. The Baggage Hall is dreadful with poor to non-existent air conditioning and the vast majority of passengers seemingly unable to identify their bag from a distance of greater than 6 inches. 30 mins would be good there 1 hour not unusual. Customs is usually pretty quick and waiting times for taxis are OK. If you exit the terminal 1 hour after arriving at the gate you've done well. Departures - I always get there early (Check In will open 3-4 hours before scheduled Departure Time) so arrive 3 hours before Departure and Check In Online before you go to the airport. Most Airlines have a dedicated Online queue - use it - nobody else does. Fill in your Departure Form and have PHP 550 available for Departure Tax. Immigration is slow but there is a reasonable queue system and avoid getting stuck behind somebody with a folder of paperwork. 20 mins typically in Immigration and if it's much more it shouldn't be a problem provided you've arrived early and have checked in online. Through Security in 10 mins and the Departures area is nothing special. I never buy Duty Free in MNL - I can get a better deal elsewhere - like in town. The Bar and Cafe facilities landside are non existent and airside very poor so bring a snack and a book. There are Pay Lounges but at 750 PHP you need to eat and drink a lot to make it worthwhile. Over all a pretty dreadful airport but T3 is reasonable.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

Overall it appears as though some improvements have been made although still more needs to be done to raise the standard of Terminal 1 to anywhere near that of most other airports in the region. This being a late Wednesday morning departure it was not overly crowded. On arrival into the building there was a standard security check quite normal. Although there were monitors indicating the departure gates we found no information on the specific location of airline counters within the check-in area. Eventually after some searching we found ours. Although we arrived at the terminal relatively late (two hours before departure) the line wasn't long and with four desks open the check-in procedure took no more than 15 minutes including waiting time. Immigration cards were completed after which we proceeded to pay the user charge 750 pesos per person (USD 17.50 would also have been accepted) with a five minute wait in line. Passport control was next; this entailed the longest queue roughly 20 minutes. Immediately thereafter was the aviation security check only a minute and we were through. A brief stop at the washroom which was acceptable although slightly crowded. Finally a 6-7 minute walk to Gate 3; considering other reviews regarding Terminal 1 waiting areas we were pleasantly surprised as it seemed relatively recently refurbished. The only complaint we might have would be the acoustics which left somewhat to be desired. It was difficult to hear the many announcements with all the chatting among our fellow passengers. The entire terminal was overall clean and in reasonably good shape considering its age. On our return ten days later we arrived in Terminal 1 late on a Sunday morning just after several wide-body long- haul flights from Europe and the Middle East. Understandably the immigration lines were long but the supervisor was very flexible and opened the diplomatic line also for ordinary travellers. After twenty minutes we came to the baggage belts which were overloaded; in fact there were so many other flights listed on the baggage board that there was no room for ours. Nevertheless after asking the staff nearby we found our baggage belt and within ten minutes our party had received all four checked bags.

Arrivals is fine with rarely more than a 10 minute wait provided you're close to the front of the plane. (Always preferable when flying into MNL). Bags on the belt quickly and minimal queuing for Taxis. They used to check Bag Tags on exiting Arrivals but that seems to have stopped. Off the plane and into the taxi within 30 minutes.

Cebu Pacific usually open 3 hrs before the Flight Departure Time but you can check in at one of the desks earlier provided you don't have bags. With only a few airlines using Terminal 3 Airport Tax Immigration and Security are quick and efficient 15 mins maximum. Food and Drinks places both Lanside and Airside are disappointing and quite expensive.

marrakech-airport,/airport-reviews/marrakech-airport,Marrakech Airport customer review,P Cullen,United Kingdom,2014-02-18,There are good points: the building is quite airy and there was adequate seating when we were there (though it could not have coped with many more passengers) there was a good choice of eating places mostly not the usual boring international fast food outlets. Getting to and from the centre took about 20 minutes by taxi at a reasonable price (we had pre-booked on arrival which I recommend if you can). However there is one huge downside which has coloured my experience - the absurd process of immigration and emigration. You fill in an immigration card on the flight and then queue to have it and your passport checked and stamped. In our case it took about 30 minutes just about acceptable. On leaving though you fill in another (identical) and form take it to your airline desk to be stamped if you only have hand luggage (as we did) you thus queue (15 minutes in our case) for a process that takes about 30 seconds. You then go to the embarkation area and queue again (5 minutes) to check that you have been to the airline desk. This allows you into the hallowed ground of the emigration area where you queue (about 40 minutes) to have the paperwork checked and a stamp in your passport. All over? Oh no there was another officer standing about 1 metre behind the desk you have just passed who randomly stopped people to check again (admittedly we were not stopped). So over an hour queuing to get a stamp to leave the country. Marrakech clearly needs and attracts many tourists and has much to offer if it wishes to continue increasing the number of visitors it has to find a more efficient way of processing them into and out of the country.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

We had a minor problem with our boarding pass on leaving which we put down to the boarding passes being handwritten and the check-in desk staff forgetting to write down all the relevant details. Family who have just returned from an even more recent trip using the same airline report that they had ordinary printed boarding passes. It's possible that our problem was specific to that day or that new procedures have just been introduced. Airside is one of the older parts of the airport and looks a little tired. There can also be a mad scrum for the gates as (or just before) boarding is announced. The 'standard' duty free shops were slightly better than anticipated but food drink and reading material options are poor. Summed up renovations have helped improve the airport and the overall experience was positive with smooth straightforward multilingual service (though we speak French which doesn't hurt) in a relatively uncrowded environment. Individual subsections however could still do with some sprucing up.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

On arrival we collected our visa from the ""bank desk"" (cost now $25) which was very slow because everything done by the teller had to be checked by the person watching him. Only one of the six passport desks was open (although there were a lot of staff around watching the queue) for the rudimentary non checking stamping of the passport followed by two more staff (independently) checking it had been stamped. Baggage arrived quite quickly. Upon departure all our bags were X-rayed on entry to the terminal (queue 1) then we queued (progressing very slowly) at the only two desks open to check-in (queue 2). Then we queued (3) to go through passport control passing through clouds of cigarette smoke from those watching the queue. Airside facilities (cafe food etc) nothing has changed including the erratic quality of the free WIFI and the attempts of the toilet attendant to get a tip of £1 or €1 for use of the free toilet.

These are not visas in the traditional sense but a tourist tax of $15. Immigration simply involves having your passport stamped (there seemed to be no checks) and this was done speedily. Baggage delivery was very quick on a fast moving belt and you are soon outside of the terminal building. Departing passengers have to endure a number of queues to get into the terminal but once through check-in is reasonably quick. Luggage weight checks are very thorough and they seem disappointed if your luggage is within limits and recheck it a few times in the hope it gets heavier. Departure forms are completed after check-in air-side there are the usual range of caes (some offering free WiFi which is really great) and things you never knew you wanted. Buses take you to your plane. This would be a good airport by European standards and is an example to others in Egypt of how it can be done. The one thing that annoyed me was that in the Gents Toilets (supposedly free) you were hassled (even whilst occupied!) for a tip by the attendant â€“ he did not get one.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,M Ferguson,United Kingdom,2015-06-18,"Marseille itself is a wonderful, buzzing, cosmopolitan place, but this airport, or possibly just the Easyjet/Ryanair sector of it, lets it down. You enter into a general hall that includes a very nice café area, where you can wait for your flight check in to show. The use of computers and digital displays in this airport is almost non existent. When we noticed our Easyjet check in was open, it was via a wooden or stiff cardboard board above the Easyjet area. We had speedy bag drop which that weekend, might just not have existed (see my Gatwick review). There were two queues. We were second in the speedy queue but you'd not have known it. At least 5 people went though on the other queue before we were called forward. There were two check in desks but our attendant seemed to have a lot of admin before she could start the process. We eventually were called, showed our documents, the tags were put on our luggage. Then we were told to take our luggage through and to the right. This was via a crush barrier, not the sort that you see in the bigger airports but solid fixed steel like a cattle crush! We traversed this maze of a barrier, to arrive at another point where once again our credentials were checked/scanned and our luggage put on a conveyor. We then went into a general holding area, that had a news shop and coffee area, and quite nice seats. But the loos were upstairs. This next floor was obviously an overflow area as there were lots of seats and no one in them. Ladies, these loos were the worst I've been in even on campsites. There were three that I would not even go in. Clearly there is no regular check/cleaning. Gents were apparently good. Down in the general waiting area, we could see a doorway that appeared to lead to passport control and the gates, but signage was minimal. There was no digital departure board. There was a board that showed all current flights, but it didn't seem to be updated as an announcement for the first flight didn't result in any change on the board. Our flight was meant to be 11.20. At 10.40 we decided we'd best move closer to the gates/passport control. We found passport control, through another of the fixed barrier mazes. There were 4 booths, three of them manned.The two guys in the ones immediately facing , simply ignored us. I moved forward, the woman in the other booth told me to wait. There was a digital board facing them and clearly they were able to see flight information which we couldn't.As it was there was chaos at Gatwick, so our flight was delayed, but no-one told us. Eventually at 10.55 we were called forward, and I noticed one of the attendants from the check in desk carrying the Gatwick sign from the desk. She was setting it up at the gate as we approached. Speedy boarding, she said, to the left by the window. Given that one wall is a window, difficult to know where to stand. There was a door in the middle, and one at the far end. Eventually there was an announcement in French and English telling us to move down. It got to 11.15. The luggage was on the tarmac, as was the fuel, and two sets of steps. No plane. Said plane eventually arrived at 11.20 (for said 11.20 flight) There are no loos after passport control. (There is a warning notice) and no seating in the gate area. We were eventually boarded at about 11.55. Unfortunately the first step on front set to the plane was a little high for my arthritic knee, and no attendant there to help.

marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2009-09-02,My third report on MP2 will be my final one as I will never use this appalling shambles of a terminal again - the worst yet. As before my departure was on a Saturday afternoon in August but just four flights were scheduled to leave in the three hours after I arrived. MP2 could not cope. We arrived just over two hours before scheduled departure and had the flight left on time would have spent 1 hour 50 minutes queuing. Among the highlights were 24 minutes waiting to give passport details (after 36 minutes in the check-in desk queue) and being accused of not submitting them online - like everyone else in the queue I had not been asked to. Another half hour waiting for the border police officer to open his booth. The final insult was an extra 20 minutes at the departure gate as they could not let passengers off the incoming aircraft - the terminal door would not open. So we finally boarded the aircraft 2.5 hours after entering the terminal all but ten minutes standing in queues. This place is an utter mess: inefficient chaotic cheap nasty and with uncaring staff I speak and understand enough French to know that it was not just a language barrier; I will accept the security staff who were doing their best. It should be avoided at all costs there are alternatives and I intend to use them.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2008-08-26,Last August I wrote a rather damning review of MP2; this year I used the same terminal at more or less the same time of day and time of year. It has improved a little but there is still room for improvement. The queues are still there but they move more quickly; I timed everything very carefully. Check-in 10 minutes; luggage drop-off 4; security 21; passport control 10; boarding- pass check 9; boarding 8. However you look at it this is still an hour of continual queuing and as we were a little later than planned arriving at the airport it was literally moving from one queue to the next. The environment has not improved though I did feel the staff were more helpful and friendly than last time and generally it was not quite as awful. However the final episode illustrated some of the problems of MP2. With everyone on board on time the pilot announced that he could not start engines because there was so much rubbish blowing about on the apron. I was by a window and could see burst rubbish bags from aircraft just left lying around. We waited 15 minutes while some of it was cleared up but it was far from completely clear when we left. The whole place feels very uncared-for and it is obvious that costs have been cut wherever possible; as I said last time I understand the economics of low-cost flying but this seems to be a step too far - to the point where it is counterproductive in terms of efficiency and customer satisfaction.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
marseille-airport,/airport-reviews/marseille-airport,Marseille Airport customer review,Peter Cullen,NA,2007-08-27,I have used Marseille in the past and found it perfectly acceptable. However last week I endured the new terminal 2 (warehouse would be a better description) for low-cost airlines; it is a truly horrible experience. I know that when travelling low-cost it is just that and you get what you pay for but this takes the concept to a whole new (lower) level. They obviously did not waste any money on decorating as it is mainly bare walls pipes concrete floors etc. On the few places they actually put some paint it is the most disgusting mixture of lime green purple and orange you can imagine. You get plenty of time to admire the 'design' of this box as you queue to put your luggage onto a conveyor belt (about 20 minutes and quite what cost it saves is beyond me) and to go through security (about 45 minutes). If this is the future of mass air transport it will surely kill itself it is a totally joyless and annoying experience.

mauritius-airport,/airport-reviews/mauritius-airport,Mauritius Airport customer review,Martin Brown,NA,2005-08-18,Interesting airport. The runway is big enough to take a 747-400 or an A340 but the terminal only has 4 gates. I arrived on 6th August on business and my baggage arrived very quickly and for those who really need a smoke there is a dedicated smoking area in baggage reclaim. The arrivals exit is looks inviting with palm trees etc. The queues at immigration are long but then how many people have just come off of that 747? They try to deal with you as quickly as they can. I was at the back of the queues as was last of off aircraft and was through in 20 minutes. Leaving is a different matter. You go through security before checkin. Security stick a security label on to say they have checked and you can go out and come back if you need that smoke as once inside there is NO SMOKING at all what-so-ever. I was told if we opened the bag we would need to go through security again. My bags have many pockets and the label was only across one? You need to go through security again before going into the main terminal which really doesn't make sense. There are not many shops inside. You can get coffee and food but it isn't cheap. Duty free had the usual array of jewellery alcohol tabacco etc at some good prices and in Euro's as well as Rupee's. I did find on a trip to the toilet that most people went in there for a smoke. The attendant standing outside knows this but ignores it so if you really need a ciggy before the 12 hour or so flight there is an 'opportunity'. That said the terminal was clean and most staff are friendly. Immigration can be stroppy. I had to fill out all of the details on the immigration form again as the carbon copy came out faint.

Deletion of the upstairs observation decks and windows to the food court on Level 1 are a sad move but place no impact on overall operations. Departures staff seem to be kind. International arrivals however are a completely different story. While they have added extra parking spaces for A380 aircraft's the immigration and customs facilities have become smaller and slower. MEL has the worst arrivals experience I have experienced more so than airports like Manila and Dhaka. On my most recent return to Australia it took 2 hours to clear immigration with the queues stretching through to the duty free section. Arrivals staff are rude and impatient hardly a welcoming face for first time foreign visitors. This is before we even get to the building itself which has almost no windows on the lower levels along with low ceiling heights cold lighting and an industrial-feel ambience. There is a real need for extra customs and immigration space (not just extra aircraft gates). The existing building has served us well over the past 40 years but is now outdated and unable to cope with the capacity demands of modern high-capacity aircraft.

Staff were moving non nationals into the nationals line as soon as a booth became free and we had none of the long queues reported elsewhere. We looked back and the line looked reasonably short. Whilst our bags took a long time to come this was because they were some of the last to come off the plane - the carousel was full of bags by the time we got there.

Skybus is expensive you can catch a metlink bus but you need to transfer to a train at Broadmeddows. Take the skybus saves you an hour of stress trying to figure out where to go and it takes you straight to Southern Cross Station. Its so easy to walk from terminal to terminal since they're all part of the same building save Terminal 4 which is Tiger Airways and separate from the other three terminals.,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,Simon Smith,NA,2009-02-07,I flew out of Melbourne on a Qantas domestic flight. The airport works OK with little queue for check in or security but it looks in need of modernisation. My main issue was that the food and drink options airside were awful. There are lots of different outlets all with different branding but they all sell the same products for the same prices. I bought a sandwich which was stale a chocolate muffin which tasted more of banana and a coffee which was cold - and this cost nearly $20.

Check in is quick (quicker with no bags - check in online the night before) stroll through security and a short walk onto the plane.

melbourne-avalon-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-avalon-airport,Melbourne Avalon Airport customer review,Andrew Wright,NA,2005-06-08,Avalon airport's facilities consist of a coffee shop/snackbar (muffins and slices) newsagent/mixed goods and a bar that serves hot food (which just looked like expensive but ordinary meat pies to me). There are three internet terminals ($2 for 15 minutes) and a plasma TV in the eating area. That's more than was available at some Australian regional airports but much less than your average capital city terminal. Access to planes is via the tarmac. The main problem was hanging around for 45 minutes due to Sunbus' far too early connecting coach from Melbourne. As a transit stop it's okay. If your time is valuable Tullamarine is probably a better option unless you are driving yourself from the Geelong area.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Furthermore, the arrivals area and some places in the departures area smellues. On the plus side, the terminal is clean and people tend to be friendly. Going through security is not a hassle either. Terminal 2 is far better in terms of space, but it is smaller. Bad smells are less of a problem here, but be careful as Aeromexico ground staff are not the best service oriented people.

Mex is really a story of two different airports. As others have said T2 is great; ultra modern with plenty of space shops natural light and aircon that's at the right temperature. T1 on the other hand is dark showing its age and the air con barely works. It took nearly 40 min to clear immigration on arrival but with the amount of flights arriving from Europe most evenings this is to be expected. Security at both terminals was very fast. The most frustrating thing is having to clear customs in Mexico City and then haul my luggage over to T2. Signage for the Sky train is useless in T1 in fact signage overall is poor in T1.

The airport manages to operate efficiently despite the very large number of passengers and operations which seem to have the airport operating at full capacity.

The airport is very linear which means there is considerable walking from one place to another and luggage trolleys are few and far between. The aisles to get to the security scanners are about 75m long and snake backwards and forwards 6 times before your get to them – you are not allowed to walk up the side even if there is no queue. Once airside you then start an even longer trek going up and down stairs and escalators to get to the gates. If you are travelling out of the Schengen Area you then walk even further to get to a shed with no facilities other than a few smelly toilets and an inaudible / incomprehensible tannoy system. We were bussed to our aircraft and this process took 30 minutes from getting onto the bus to getting to the aircraft because the coach just sat there waiting.

Terminal J still in the process of being finished so fewer choices for dining and shopping than in some other areas (you can get to Terminal H without exiting security).

Luggage is normally delivered within 15 minutes from arrival and one can be in the centre of Milan in 15/20 minutes provided there is no traffic. I also like the fact that the parking area is next to the terminal and one can be in the check-in counter minutes after parking. Its downside is the lack of amenities the cramped spaces and the fact that on international flights you are whisked to the plane in a bus which is too small and always packed.

Recently went to Terminal 2 for the first time: arrival not bad though getting on a bus when the terminal building was about 20 metres from the front of the aircraft is a bit frustrating. Departing was considerably worse: security was quick though that was where the efficiency ended. Not enough seats and limited food facilities. Worse followed though: we knew the flight was delayed by '45 minutes' (not the airport's fault it was foggy). We were then called to the gate about 30 minutes before 'departure' by a message on the screens ; after about 20 minutes we were told that we were at the wrong gate (and treated as if it was our fault) so we all went to the right gate where we stood for another 30 minutes before the aircraft arrived. We were then cleared to stand for a further 20 minutes before being allowed to board the aircraft it eventually left the stand 90 minutes after the scheduled time. I am not complaining about the delay bad weather in January is a hazard of flying but the airport must have known it was going to be much more than 45 minutes late a couple of hours in advance why did they not inform us? Also why did they have 100 people just standing around for well over an hour again they must have known - we could have shared the sparse seating.

The airport also is a reflection of the largest airline serving it: Alitalia. Despite the airport being less than 10 years old it is already showing a tired interior - dingy terminals chaos at the security checks between the terminals and the bussing to the majority of the aircraft is a disgrace. I along with many others do not understand why the Italian gov't selected such a poor architectural design for this airport... They want to develop this airport further as an important hub but how can they if they didn't build enough gates??? It's not appealling and in the hot summer months the bus services are unbearable. Airport personnel are also lacking in manners and do not know what organisation is....they show up late at the gates ignore passengers seeking information etc. etc. The list goes on and on. With regards to shops and catering - it's alright though very overpriced. And the lack of seating is a disgrace too.

milwaukee-airport,/airport-reviews/milwaukee-airport,Milwaukee Airport customer review,M Keenan,NA,2010-02-19,I’ve flown through a few times and found it works very well. Baggage has always arrived very quickly and rental cars are close to the terminal. On one occasion I was able to get off the plane get my baggage rent a car and get checked in at an airport hotel all within thirty minutes. Outbound Milwaukee is similarly straightforward - I experienced minimal line-ups to check in and only a few minutes wait for security. The departure areas are nothing special but there's plenty of comfortable seating while you wait and reasonable concessions to purchase food drinks or reading material. MKE gains some points in my book by also including a small museum that deals with the history of the airport and aviation in Milwaukee a nice touch that other airports should consider. MKE is further proof that it's far less stressful and time consuming to fly in and out of medium sized airports than mega airports.,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

We did not expect much and were not disappointed. the airport has no air con so was extremely hot something not helped by the many broken ceiling fans. Check in and customs pretty good although of course there is not the volume of passengers. Duty free shops charge the highest prices on the planet but that is true at Nairobi as well. The price of food and drink is at Heathrow levels which seems excessive considering Kenya is a low wage economy. Tusker beer costs more at the airport than in our 5* hotel.

montreal-trudeau-airport,/airport-reviews/montreal-trudeau-airport,Montréal Airport customer review,E Berman,United States,2015-01-14,Flying from Cancun to Boston through Montreal-Trudeau. First of all any connection from one country to the US still requires going through Canadian customs and then going through security again and then US customs. So the process of transferring here is very time consuming. Secondly the airport makes the transfer process as vague and difficult as possible. We encountered a lot of difficulty in figuring out how to make the transfer in terms of either a) getting no information from posted signs about how to proceed and b) getting scolding contradictory information from airport staff about how to proceed through the airport from one flight to another. We were told by Information Services (we called for assistance in the baggage claim area) that we absolutely had to pick up our bags to go through customs then told by Air Canada baggage services that our bags had been sent on directly to Boston and we should proceed without them - then yelled at by the customs officer for not having our luggage with us. Clearly the airport staff in general needs to be far better trained in terms of providing assistance to travelers making connections through this airport. In all if you are making connections from abroad to the US I would not recommend this airport as a point of transfer due to the issues of time lack of clarity as to how to proceed and rudeness of staff.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

I was only connecting here from Easyjet to domestic and from domestic to Easyjet. I had given myself 3 hours to do this in each direction but could have easily done it with less. Obviously had to recheck in on to the domestic flight but that was quick and simple and easy to find. Security was quick but the departure hall for domestic flights was very crowded so it's probably best to wait in the public area until nearer the flight. It only took me 30 minutes from leaving the Easyjet flight to go through immigration check-in and clear security. On the return trip it was just as efficient with no lines anywhere.

moscow-domodedovo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-domodedovo-airport,Moscow Domodedovo Airport customer review,A West,United Kingdom,2013-10-16,Is there an airport in the world that needs a new terminal more urgently. Domodedovo is over crowded which I think is where all its problems begin. After we passed through the understaffed and poorly organised passport control we found the baggage carousel empty not because they were slow unloading the plane but because they needed it for another flight so they'd dumped the London bags in a corner at the other end of the reclamation hall. Departing was an exercise in queuing even though I had mastered the Russian art of queue barging by the end of my trip. After the security and passport checks which felt very much like a legacy of the Soviet era we needed refreshments and while the extortionate prices couldn't put us off the lack of anywhere to sit nearly did. More waiting areas are needed to get people out of the cafe areas. Toilets were dirty and crowded furtive smokers lurked in the cubicles. Somebody had set a paper towel bin alight presumably with a discard cigarette and a cleaning lady was left to put it out by scooping handfuls of water from the taps. Our queue for the gate was in the middle of a narrow and busy corridor right next to the smouldering toilets. Staff were as friendly and helpful as I've found anywhere but don't expect much English spoken.

Memories of past experiences with post-soviet airports are all too clear. They've made the effort its evident but its still no where near the standards of 'world hubs'. If there's one thing that's hit me over the years at this airport its the sheer over-crowding probably because everyone's moved from Sheremtyevo. Anyway they still have the annoying scheme of scanning the baggage before you even enter the building. Im all up for security but surely this is crossing the line. Its a job weaving your way through the terminal with heavy baggage endless numbers of people explainable by the fact we were travelling in the winter season back to London. No electronic check-in scheme so there was a long queue. Surprisingly clean airport still with the aroma of cigarettes but the interior looks modern enough. Immigration very swift security was average. Busy busy busy is all I can say afterwards. There's the lack of those wide open walking areas or rest areas with huge ceilings that you get in 5-star airports in Asia. We found it hard to find anywhere to eat although when we did it was ridiculously expensive! Lack of seats duty-free shops also very expensive. There's no doubt that Moscow has made great strides since the Soviet and Post-soviet era but its still miles off the 5-star spectrum.

I found immigration to be efficient and the officers polite. For my departure from Moscow do be aware that you will go through security before entering the check in area once through check in is fast with a second security and passport check after that.

To access the terminal you and your baggage have to go through security scanners which slows things up. The terminal is completely overcrowded which makes moving around with cases challenging. Check in was ok but passport control customs and security were very slow. The officials only seem to speak Russian which can be a problem if something goes wrong. I forgot to remove my wrist watch before going through the scanner. Once you get to the departure areas we could only find two small places to get food and drink and they are very expensive. Two cheese and ham croissants a small cappuccino and a small beer came to over £27. The whole departure area was overcrowded with far too few seats for the number of passengers. The gate areas are enclosed. Our gate area had seats for about 50 people. We were due to board a 747 so about 350 people needed to stand.

Baggage appeared almost instantly after walking into reclaim. You still have to fight your way past importuning taxi drivers - go to the official taxi desk at the wall facing you as you emerge into arrivals and book a taxi into town. You will then be escorted outside to your assigned driver. On return leg check-in very smooth. Security a tad silly at times - two people stationed just 3 metres apart both checking passports and boarding cards - but otherwise fairly standard.

Arrival was quick and I was through immigration customs et al. within half an hour. Limited exchange facilities--one bank with several locations and exchange rates that are slightly less favorable than intown. Getting to the Pavaletsky-bound train means going into the domestic terminal a lengthy walk with many signs although a couple are a little confusing as to direction. The train leaves every 30 or 60 minutes depending on time of day. On New Years (a big holiday in Russia) it was running to Pavaletsky but not to the airports. For departure I arrived early (3+ hours) because it was a holiday (New Years) and new procedures were rumored to be in place for US flights (turned out not to be the case). The train from Pavaletsky was not running in the am - taxi was R1500 (after an initial ""offer"" of R2000) - a hair-raising but uneventful ride. Note that the limited food/shopping options and non-existent seating on the ground floor of the departure terminal are just part of the story--seating and food/shopping are on the second floor. Passport control and security screening were uneventful and reasonably efficient. The departure areas are filled with upscale stores and the usual duty free stuff. Expect to pay 50-100% more for food and drink than you would in the city. Most airports seem to have stopped this kind of nonsense.

Then there is the passport control. Only two clerks serving for about 150 passengers. Plus the queue is horrendous. You start lining up and then a whole rush of people start coming and start pushing in. Passport control isn't put in a proper place. It's at a weird angle so the queue goes all over the place. Speaking of all over the place- the baggage area is nearly the same. We had to wait for around 15 minutes for our baggage.

Forget the comments about it being excellent by ""Russian"" standards - it compares very well with other airports. First experience was arriving from BKK on Thai Airways - plenty of staff available at immigration and no hassle (all complete and through to baggage claim within five minutes of joining the queue). Baggage took 30 minutes then out into the concourse. It was much less crowded than Don Muang and much better laid out. After changing some money and escaping the taxi touts I got the express train to Paveletsky - highly recommended even if some grizzle about the lack of air-conditioning. Make sure that you walk all the way to the front of the train so that you have less distance to walk when you reach the city. Next use was arriving domestically from St Petersburg - no problems and baggage waiting when we got to the conveyor. Stayed overnight at Airport Hotel (noisy and overpriced for what it provides) then back to the airport for an early flight to Kazan. Security - only 5 minutes. I returned 10 days later - no problems again. Last time was when flying back to BKK - check-in only took 15 minutes despite a full load including a big tour group of Thais and easy progress through Customs and Security. Then came the only drama I had at this airport - there is no currency exchange facility airside! Helpful security staff sympathised with my predicament (I had lots of roubles still in my pocket) but wouldn't let me back into the main concourse to return to the bank.

The airport seemed relatively modern but still lags far behind other hubs I've flown through like Frankfurt and Heathrow (which isn't saying much). Transit times seem to vary depending on time of day and which terminal you land in. Terminals D, E, and F all form an interconnected transit area. On our first stop over in Moscow we arrived at Terminal F and found ourselves funneled through a tiny transfer area that had one attendant serving multiple arriving flights. While we we arrived near the front of the line, I could see some people easily waiting 40+ minutes to pass through transit passport control and security. On the way back, we landed in Terminal D and things seemed to be better staffed and far less busy. My main complaint with the airport is the absolute lack of space. All three terminals are packed with very expensive duty free stores, squeezing out room for seating, food options, and bathrooms. The toilets at the airport were probably the dirtiest I have seen in any airport, and are stained with cigarette ash marks. In terminal D the duty free shops leave so little room in the corridors that it is a struggle to pass between crowds of people queuing for their flight.

Arrived late evening on Aeroflot flight from Helsinki via pier in Termanal D. Reasonable walk to Passport Control which is now all electronic no need to complete Landing Card data already captured and available as part of Visa Application Process. Minimal Queuing before heading down escalators to Baggage Claim. Short Wait for bags then past Customs and out into Arrivals Hall. Difficult to find official taxi's which are very expensive. Return Check in is after initial bag scanning. Check-in OK as was Security. Domestic Departures are separate to International Departures. Choice of 2 eating options and various shops some of which not fully open early in the morning. Free WiFi which was pretty good. Boarding started just prior to departure time but was done quite quickly. Terminal has been upgraded or something recently so things in reasonable condition flat screen monitors with departure information on as well as TV News screens reasonably available.

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,Roman Stepantsev,Russian Federation,2012-06-07,Lounges sometimes are packed both in terminals D and F with no tables available especially in the morning on workdays or late in the evening in the weekends. Airport staff is the same as many years ago nothing is changing. Taxi service is like in the 3rd world. They should have established a normal taxi service outside the door. The major problem of Sheremetyevo is transportation. From 5 passenger terminals and 1 cargo the road to Moscow is going though a 1-line overpass which is linking to a 3 line bridge of the one of the most busiest highways to St Petersburg so in most cases people are spending a long time just to leave the airport. This is outrageous. I've not seen it elsewhere in the world so that 6 terminals would be serviced by 1-line overpass. Waiting in a traffic jam next to the airport for an hour on Saturday night after a 2weeks' vacation is crossing everything out the very few positive things.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,R Shapurko,Canada,2011-10-31,I've flown to and from Moscow Sheremetyevo about 6 times over the past 3 years. I've been to what I believe are all of their major terminals (B D F E) with the exception of C. On a flight JFK-Paris via Moscow the transfer was seamless. We ended up arriving about an hour later than expected with just over an hour left for the transfer. There were no line-ups anywhere and as we'd already received the boarding pass at the Aeroflot desk at JFK we were directed straight to our gate with a quick passport check). The staff were polite and gave us clear directions. D and E are the recently constructed terminals - clean modern and open with clear signage and info screens. That might seem obvious but many airports that I've been to lack these basic necessities. B and F are the old soviet-era terminals that have recently been refurbished. They are pretty good and a clear logical layout. The number of stores is a little limited. There are some good Russian fast food stand there though (like Kroshka- Kartoshka which sells baked potatoes). Unfortunately most of the eateries in all terminals are quite expensive but if you take a minute to look around terminals have budget cafes (like the Kroshka Kartoshka). Customer service has improved by a lot and staff polite and for the most part will try to help you. Aeroexpress takes you to Moscow city centre and easy to locate from terminals F C and D (a walkway connects the train station with the terminals). There is also a shuttle from the other terminals that takes you to the aeroexpress train station. I'd highly recommend the train over taxi or other options. It is cheaper and much faster.,NA,NA,NA,9,5,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2011-05-09,"My last week arrival at SVO was a horror story about what they call ""transit between terminals"". This needs to be explained here to fellow travelers who need to get to from or via this place safely and on time. The airport now consists of the three buildings. The first building consists of the terminals DEF and Aeroexpress train station. All these form a single building. They are connected between themselves both land side and airside. Terminals B and C are around 5 km from this place are close to each other with no connection between buildings. The gentleman whose report below tells that he was charged by taxi driver a horrible sum of money for the ride between D and F doesn't tell that in fact he had been driven between the two doors of the same building. The different story is the rest of the airport. Aeroflot now has own and codeshared flights operating from terminals C D E F. The terminals B and C are distant and not connected anyhow to the main D/E/F/Rail building. There is no organized transportation for transit passengers to and from B or C. It is your own risk to get to and from there. The only landside options are city bus light shuttle bus and taxi. City bus can be very crowded and cost 1USD light bus is infrequent and costs 2 usd and taxi are the horrible scam after which you will be lucky just to be overcharged. The standard taxi rate between main D/e/f/rail building and buildings C or B is usd 20. Don't pay more! Ask your friends to pick you up. If you go on connecting codeshared flight sold by Aeroflot and arriving in terminal C you're still not eligible for any free airside transportation between terminals just because it doesn't exist. Don't believe if they tell you it does. When Aeroflot tell you that they are responsible for your ""transportation"" only between terminals D/E/F it means that you don't actually leave the building and you ""transport"" yourself by walk. The only exception to the rule is airside ""train to plane"" service which carries passengers arriving to the airport by train. You can clear security at terminal E and then you are transported airside to the terminals C and B for free. Then after disembarkation from the bus you go landside and then again clear security for your departing flight at terminal B or C. The service is confusing infrequent and only works one way. Only actually departing passengers with tickets documents and boarding passes can go. No opposite direction! SVO is the only airport in the world that doesn't carry passengers between terminals.",NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2011-03-04,Yesterday I used SVO for arrival and departure. Terminal F inbound terminal C outbound. SVO is hit and miss place. Terminal F is an outdated and strangely laid out facility. However it didn;t took more than 15 minutes to pass immigration and then to collect bags that had already been on the belt. Then arrivals hall with usual taxi scam. Then easy to find train station with nice food facilities and free wifi coverage. The only minus is unclear sugnage. Walks are reasonably long. Outbound arrived to the airport by train coming to /terminal E. Transfer to terminal C was done by intercity type coach running every 30 minutes around the whole airport including its most remote places. Absence of tunnels under runways located between terminals E/D/F on one side and B/C on another side makes this ride 25 minutes long so should you need to arrive by train and to leave from terminals B or C allow some 60 extra minutes for this transfer. At terminal C security search was a breeze check in was done online immigration lines long but managed to catch my plane as the terminal is really small. Again free wifi but airside facilities are very poor with nothing to do uninspiring duty free and overpriced food options of very average quality. Staff unsmiling but not rude nothing really unpleasant. This airport is ok when you know what to do and where to go. For first time visitors it must be unbearable and very confusing.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

On our flight from Bangkok to Amsterdam we changed flights at Sheremetyevo. There is practically no information for transfer passengers. The monitors only informed about coming flights for the next 30 minutes and had information on them which was two hours old! Eventually we were supposed to change terminals from F (where we arrived) to E (where we would depart). The terminals are connected with a corridor but there is no signposting at all! The only information we were given is that we need to go to the 3rd floor where Terminal E would be but we had no idea that Terminal F was on the 2nd floor because it is not told anywhere! Apart from bad information and signposting the lack of English does not make it any easier for non-Russian passengers.

moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,/airport-reviews/moscow-sheremetyevo-airport,Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport customer review,Peter Goldsbury,Japan,2010-11-24,My arrival and departure form this airport was a surreal experience which is why this review is so complementary. On arrival from Tokyo Narita the plane was not parked at a gate. As we left the plane I saw someone waiting with a board with my name on it and I was ushered into a car. We drove in silence around the airport arrived at some unmarked gates and I was led into a hotel lounge and told to sit down and relax. There was a bar and food was also available. An immigration officer requested my passport and later came over and returned it to me. My luggage tag was requested and eventually luggage appeared. Friends who were meeting me appeared and we drove into Moscow. This lounge was full of people and I was told that there were four such VIP lounges in the airport. The return trip was equally surreal. Mercedes is the preferred transportation vehicle and we duly arrived at the double doors. This time there was a short walk to the hotel lounge. My e-ticket was somewhere in my luggage but it was never requested. I was told that with this way of passing through the airport one did not need a ticket. A little while later another vehicle took me to the gate. A stern official gave me my boarding pass and wished me a good flight - and I found that had been upgraded. So I found Sheremetyevo a wonderful airport but this clearly depends on the type of invitation you receive to enter Russia.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

At least the AeroExpress from the city is a big plus but despite what is advertised the free bus transfer works only one way - it's provided by the airport so travels inside the security perimeter to the domestic terminals. Of course when you arrive on a domestic flight you end up outside the terminal and therefore outside the secure area so you have to get the marshrutki shuttle (60 roubles) back to the AeroExpress terminal. Security and check-in for my first flight was very quck and easy and I thought that perhaps things had improved in the last four years. That impression was very quickly ruined by my second visit - baggage took 40 minutes to arrive causing me to miss check-in for my connecting flight. AviaNova staff moved mountains to get me on the plane but it meant going through security 3 times with all the rigmarole of shoes off and on even though the security staff had already seen me go through the next scanner 10 metres away and then out of their own secure zone! At least there is now no smoking in the ""No Smoking"" area of the departure lounge.

This airport is a real shambles. We arrived at around 7:30pm local time to check into our flight. Staff are impatient and have no idea what they are really doing. The whole airport looks more like a cave and I look forward to when the new terminal will open. Passport control is the next marathon. Warning - block your ears when the officer stamps your passport. His/ her aim is too scare you with the loud bang on the passport. After passing control we had some time to look about in the airport. This is boring. Seriously half of the shops are not even open and cafes sell food at rip-off prices. After a while our flight was boarding. Security check is a pain. There is one x-ray for two gates and while our flight was boarding another flight was boarding in the other gate so this meant queues. Big ones. So big that we nearly missed our flight. So when we board our flight is cancelled because a dodgy Ilyushin can't get it's engines to work properly. This meant that everyone had to get off and wait till another plane was available. The airport gave us coupons to buy food with but in the whole of the airport two only two cafes/restaurants we're open. So we had to wait till the plane fed us. Staff didn't tell us anything at all so we used newspapers laid them on the floor and went to sleep.3 hours later the grumpy staff finally announced that there was a plane available and everyone boarded.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

New terminal D built by Aeroflot for itself and SkyTeam partners is a great step forward compared to the old terminals of Sheremetyevo. Almost every part of my experience was above the average expectations. However there were some disappointing problems. At the time of my trip terminal navigation signs were somewhat a mess - handmade and quite unclear. Very few cafes or restaurants were actually opened. There seemed to exist no WCs at the general admission areas (check-in zone on the 3rd floor and arrivals waiting area on the 1st floor) - instead one had to spend well some minutes to find its destination on the ""technical"" 2nd floor. Boarding area for domestic flights was clearly too small for the given number of passengers but OK for 1 hour waiting time. But the most horrible part of all the journey involving Sheremetyevo airport was a transfer from terminal D to terminal F (formerly known as 2). We had to wait for the bus over 40 minutes because the first ones were fully packed by passengers behaving like they were fighting for their very lives. To summarise I have to admit that terminal D is a decent long-expected improvement but SVO and Aeroflot have to do more to reach the level of similar-sized airports like Prague Oslo or Santiago.",NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The terminal building is simply stunning both from the outside and inside. The ceiling and columns are mind blowing. BA Silver status enabled sofa check-in whereby all paperwork is carried out whilst seated away from the crowds on a quiet sofa. This then led to a separate business class security check (the staff assisted us so we could keep the children asleep) and immigration. Upon entering the duty free area it is like any of the top airports in the world with an impressive variety of shops restaurants bars boutiques and bars - all neatly laid out. The signage and announcements are very clear and precise - it sounds like they hired the same lady who announces in Heathrow T5. What set the airport apart was the stunning Indian art work - great to see India showcasing indigenous art and culture and adding a personal touch when compared to the many bland and functional airports around the world. The GVK lounge is shared and has more than enough comfy seats a wide variety of local and imported alcohol as well as Indian and international food.

The security staff outside the airport are not strong enough to dissuade people from photographing or smoking (especially the ""foreigners""). Went through an extremely slow security check only to find myself stuck in a never ending customs/immigration lineup. Even after having over 30 immigration counters (half of them were unmanned) the number of counters as well as the efficiency of customs official is not sufficient to handle the out-flowing crowd. Most of the people in crowd were in verge of missing their flight. The airport authorities must be already aware of the backlog created due to all international flights departing at almost same time before the commissioning this airport - yet unable to fix this flaw. I almost made it to the departure gate half an hour before flight only to find another security checkup before boarding the plane. The flight got delayed by an hour. There is only one washroom in a large expanse of departure gates. And out of the only two toilets only one is WC. Compare that to Schiphol Amsterdam that has washrooms every 30 m.

Having arrived at and departed from Mumbai's international and domestic terminals several times over the past two decades I can honestly say that the new Terminal 2 represents a quantum leap in (for the most part) vastly improving the passenger experience. This includes the new elevated access ramp to the terminal from the Western Express Highway. The terminal building itself is an architectural wonder. There is lots of glass all owing expansive views of the airport. Spacious seating / waiting areas with clear flight boarding announcement. Slightly secluded seating areas with relaxing arm chairs and modular sofa type seating configurations. Numerous bistros and coffee shops in a shopping mall type of a layout. Interesting and original retail outlets. As this was the first day of operations several stores were not yet open or had goods displayed but were not available for shopping. Nevertheless the store managers invited us to have a look around. Likewise the duty free shops were still stocking up with only a few items for sale. Washrooms were very clean and well distributed throughout the terminal. One aspect that could be improved is the still cumbersome process of passport and visa checks for outbound passengers which seems to be largely bureaucratic and unnecessary. There was a long snaking line for this checkpoint before proceeding to the airside retail food and gate area which was tiresome and resulted in us feeling a bit too exhausted to fully explore the various stores and eateries.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,Colin Lusty,Australia,2011-10-10,Arrived in Mumbai recently from Bangkok on my way to Ahmedabad immigration was quick as was luggage off the belt. Went through customs without any hassel however that's when everything went bad. Went to the transfer area to get to the domestic terminal (was flying on with Air India) waited 45 minutes for the bus it was filthy and already full. Arrived at the domestic terminal went to find the Air India check in desks only to find them deserted. I found an Air India office where a very helpful gentleman told me that my particular flight departed from the International terminal. The man actually came with me as the security people did not want to let me re-transfer. Got on the dirty crowded bus again after a security check-then on to the International Terminal. Eventually checked in and being a domestic flight was able to by-pass Immigration and customs but not security so I had my 5th security check of the day. Got to the gate and they called the flight and guess what? we were put on a bus where we were taken to a plane at the domestic airport-what an absolute debacle!,NA,NA,NA,3,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It took 10 mins from aircraft to exit upon arrival as immigration was efficient with lots of open counters and the customs are much more relaxed than in previous years. Even at LHR T5 ten mins from aircraft to exit is impossible. On the return check-in took 2 mins immigration was again fast and efficient and security quick. The shops are certainly overpriced. The Galleries Lounge was comfortable.

Airport was impressive and more than I expected from the reputation! The flight was scheduled for 4am which reflects the lack of queues but airport was clean retail areas were spacious and there were fantastic recliner seating areas at each boarding gate and coffee shops nearby. The duty free area seemed similar to that at Dubai Terminal 3 and it seems the airport are trying to improve their image. I also liked that there were highly visible emergency defibrillators located at regular intervals throughout the airport. Other airports would do well to follow suit. Staff were lively polite and helpful. Have to mention one of the police/security guys at the front of the airport who went out in the monsoon rain to fetch our dimwit of a cab driver who had got lost (don't ask me how a taxi driver gets lost at an airport complex...). Really did appreciate that personal touch and not something that I would expect in Europe/US regions. I can't comment on what the airport is like when it's busy (I note concerns of other reviewers) but based on what I saw during its quiet period I would be happy to fly through here again.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0
mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,S Taynton,Kazakhstan,2009-12-04,Arrival into Mumbai was fine went through to baggage claim fairly easy. However leaving is another matter. Very long lines at immigration took over 90 minutes from the beginning of the queue to the chap on the desk. Security after that is a nightmare taking forever to go through. After that there is not much in the way of duty free shops and the ones that are there are very expensive. There are a few bars which are not overly expensive but they give good service and are a happy retreat from the crowds.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,D Gill,United Kingdom,2009-11-11,It took me at least half an hour to get from the start of the terminal building to my entrance. This was due to the unorganised volume of people and traffic allowed to congregate outside. Armed guards only allow passengers inside the terminal building. Once you have made it through all the people to get inside you have to get your luggage scanned and security taped before check-in will take it. They tell most people this after queuing at the check-in desk (not useful). The international departure concourse for the most part looked like it is falling apart despite renovation (though the internal departure concourse in another terminal was newly designed and looked good). Immigration is painfully slow and immigration staff seem to think everyone is a suspect. Security is a joke as their methods are inconsistent. One guy will pat one passenger while the guy next to him doesn't bother with his passenger. Queues are the longest I've ever seen at security and this was at 11.00 at night. They changed the gate of my flight without any announcement only finding it by chance.

I also think the 'nap caps' for sleep are a great idea although there are not enough of them.

Didn't have an airbridge so onto a bus it was. Small delay waiting for the bus - but the journey was quick. No queue at passport control. Hand luggage only so I didn't have to wait. Lots of people queuing at all the car rental desks and I had to wait 30 minutes. Hertz were running out of cars and we were lucky to get one despite pre-booking. Exit from the airport is great and we were on the autobahn and away. Return next day for flight at 21.45. Checked in online and had a mobile boarding pass. The central area (landside) has a superb BierGarten - so we spent an hour or so there. The food was excellent the beer was cold and superb value for money. No queue at passport control and security very efficient. 5 - 10 minute walk to the gate H40 for an on time departure.

This takes time and if you bought anything bigger than 100ml on the plane or at the previous airport you can say goodbye to it. I don't know if this is the same if you arrive from an other European airport but be careful with this.

Signage over visas could be clearer once inside the terminal (to better distinguish between the pre-arranged and visa on arrival queues) but immigration is largely quick and easy compared to most international airports once you sort out which visa queue you need to be in. My suitcase was off the carousel at baggage claim before I'd even finished my duty free shopping. While small the duty free shop at arrivals does have some unusual alcohol options (such as Jordanian arak) that make it worth a visit. There are some taxi touts at the exit but they're easily ignored. So no it's not the most modern or largest capital city airport in the world (or even the region) but given that Muscat is hardly the busiest of airports it's entirely functional.

muscat-seeb-airport,/airport-reviews/muscat-seeb-airport,Muscat Seeb Airport customer review,Peter Bedson,Oman,2010-10-30,"A nice efficient little airport - much smaller than others in the region until the new building is completed. A very important piece of information is that the check in counters close an hour before take-off and I mean really close - the systems all shut down and there is no way onto the flight. This stops the check in staff getting bullied by late comers but means you need to be there in good time. The immigration queue looks long but generally moves reasonably quickly - you need to buy your visa at the Travelex bureau before you join the queue if you don't have one already. It is now 20 OMR each but kids seem to be only 10 (though I wouldn't bet on it) and if you have a visa for some but not all of the GCC states it is free. You can get a multiple entry visa but that seems to be at the whim of the Colonel on duty. There is a reasonable small duty free on arrival just after immigration and before what is generally the worlds fastest ever baggage reclaim (unless you are unlucky or travelling on BA for some weird reason when there can be a wait). The only ground transportation option is taxis - if you go to the hut directly outside arrivals you are guaranteed a reasonable price - about 7 OMR into town - touts (of which there are plenty hanging about but as with everything here they are not insistent) may cost you less or more (taxis don't have meters) and there is clearly a multi-tier pricing system in operation with westerners paying the most! The car parks are directly across from the terminal and are cheap with the exception of the ""executive"" car park which has permanent shade and a huge price to boot - the long stay is cheaper and only about 50m further away. Departures is pretty painless and border control and security are both generally very quick although it can get busy late at night; there is rather limited shopping airside but some nice coffee shops. The airline lounges are OK but nothing to write home about. Be aware that all the gates are bus gates and they close the flights very early - up to 40 minutes before departure - to herd you onto the busses.

Passport is simple no forms to be completed and then into Baggage Reclaim. Bags were already waiting then through the scanner at Customs for the bags and into Arrivals.

Arrived for check-in at 12pm about 2.5 hours prior to departure. My return flight was on a 80-90% full Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800. For such a small capacity plane the line seemed huge. Nadi seems to separate its check in desks by airline and flight. So Virgin Australia had about 9 desks - 3 each for the Sydney Melbourne and Brisbane flights. As the Melbourne and Brisbane flights had not started check in this meant that only 3 desks for VA were open while the check in staff at the other desks had a nice chat. The line barely seemed to move at all - the same people stayed at some one of the desks for over an hour! I ended up getting through check in 90 minutes prior to departure: that's an hour wait for a small plane. Virgin Australia generally closes check in 90 minutes prior to departure but when I turned around the line was still very large. This is totally unacceptable. Getting through customs is fairly straight forward. Then you arrive in a large room with boarding gates off to the sides. There seem to be a lot of people in a small space.

The two main problems are having to queue outside to get past the first security check and having to queue twice more for a long check-in and two more security scans at the gate. It really needs a layout change - so you can be scanned just once on entering the secure passenger only area. Duty free shops well they sell the same as elsewhere in the world just without hi power arc lighting and glossy shelves. I agree the main problem is the lack of seating and the fact it feels a bit cramped. I've always managed to get a seat and try to arrive not too early but with enough time to get through all the checks.

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,J Moore,NA,2009-09-14,It is interesting reading the comments of passengers passing through Jomo Kennatta airport the most talked of item is the lack of seating which is true the story I heard was that the chairs were removed after the attack on Nairobi with bombs so all the chairs were removed so that nothing could be left there. I have been visiting Kenya since 1970 and in that time the only thing that has vastly improved at both Nairobi and Mombasa airports is the toilets they were for years truly a no go area at times needing far more than flip flops to even approach but now someone has really sorted that problem out and I have found the loos' to be better than most of the public ones in the UK and I would like to congratulate them on that also the shops are very modern but seats would be better appreciated. The airport is supposed to be being upgraded with another floor being added but this seems to be taking a long time. The best tip I would give to anyone who knows they will need to spend more than 3 hours at JK is to sign up for priority pass this will give you access to the lounges at airports across the world including Kenya where you will have at least a comfortable place to sit and drinks and food are included so when you think how much you can fork out for food and drink at an airport this doesn't seem like an extravagant option. Lounges in 'modern' countries are of a high standard with food to match but places like Kenya are not quite on a par sandwiches being the most common item for eats but they usually have at least one pc with internet connection and toilets with no queues and you can come and go as you please.

nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,André Krummacher,NA,2008-09-18,I use JKIA at least twice a month. Not a very pleasant airport - as I am a frequent flyer I usually head directly to the lounge as there is not much to do. There are a number of duty free shops but they all offer more or less the same (they all belong to the same 3 companies). It needs to be noted that alcohol is quite cheap in those shops though. There is no proper restaurant only 3 cafeterias offering snacks. The best place to eat is probably Java House at Gate 14 which has quite good food. The biggest problem as highlighted by so many others is seating. For such a big airport there is absolutely insufficient seating. Also boarding gates much too small to seat people boarding big planes (i.e. with more than 120 seats).,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
nairobi-airport,/airport-reviews/nairobi-airport,Nairobi Airport customer review,D Shah,NA,2008-09-08,Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is in dire need of a face-lift. As I approached the airport staff upon disembarking from the plane the lights along the corridor were glum and a sombre mood existed in terms of passenger variety especially with the lack of proper seating signs and most importantly modesty and flare with which airports are supposed to define a country. Security is quite good but the luggage conveyors need to be quickly fed and this suggests to me that there is a boardroom feud amongst luggage handlers or something similar as to which a huge air of discontent lies with this airport's workers. To my knowledge this airport generates more than 2.5million passengers annually and it has a vital geographic location which serves African routes very well.

No airport signs or verbal warnings from shopkeepers alert passengers to this.

Good selection of shops and places to eat although no English language newspapers were left for sale. Places to eat had decent food at reasonable prices for an airport. Some excellent seating areas with leather sofas and lamps - more like a hotel lobby than an airport.

I include in the positive those individuals who check passengers prior to boarding. I recently traveled with a delicate gift which I requested to be hand checked. The supervisor came to me and said that it had to go through the x-ray machine but he would stay right by it to make sure it got through without being knocked around. He stuck to his word and helped me take it off the track making sure I got all my other items. Being welcomed back into your own country is a real plus.

At least they're kept pretty clean. The staff at EWR has always left something to be desired - probably the least helpful ""help"" staff of any airport I've traveled through. The redirection between security checkpoints is just somewhat worse than totally arbitrary --while theoretically they adjust based on what checkpoint has the shortest line by the time you get to what was the shortest line it is by then the longest line and half the staff has just gone on break. What really grates for me though is the AirTrain. AirTrain JFK is quick comfortable and efficient. AirTrain Newark is like some sort of bad joke.

newark-airport,/airport-reviews/newark-airport,Newark Airport customer review,G Burns,NA,2009-07-21,Have used Newark two or three times a year most recently DUB-EWR-DTW on Continental. The airport has some positives - the monorail (Air Tran) fairly fast and easy. (There’s also a inter-terminal bus through the ugly underbelly of the airport – fast but hot little seating difficult for people with even minor mobility problems.) But echoing some of the other posts arriving internationally then connecting domestically is a zoo. Passengers have to do the work of baggage handlers in taking their bags after clearing customs into a snake line to a transfer point for rechecking onto domestic connections. There are not enough airport workers nor enough space nor enough explanatory signs for this transfer; passengers are confused and herded like cattle. There’s no indication that it’s occurred to the airport authorities that international arrivals involves some people who don’t speak English. Even well intentioned airport workers – clearly not trained to deal with international passengers - end up barking orders that even English speakers have trouble hearing and understanding. One is expected (again without any clear explanatory signs) to deposit one’s bags in one of the jumbled piles of luggage. It’s such a picture of chaos that no reasonable person would think that those bags will end up checked onto the appropriate destination. Thus the crowding gets worse as passengers are understandably hesitant to separate from their bags. TSA in Newark can be unbelievably slow. First why can’t the whole transfer from an international flight to a domestic connection be in a secure area so that passengers don’t have to clear security again? In any case my TSA line literally cleared no more than about one passenger a minute; some people surely missed their flights.

newcastle-airport,/airport-reviews/newcastle-airport,Newcastle Airport customer review,Ron West,NA,2007-05-21,"The terminal has now been renovated meaning that prices have gone up for instance I saved $6 on a tank of petrol by re-fuelling my mid size rental car 10 km before I got to the airport - both airport service stations were charging maximum price presumably on the assumption that customers had nowhere else to go. There's a Hungry Jack's burger outlet which provides standard fast food fare - probably the best food value in the airport because their prices are the same as any other Hungry Jack's outlet and not inflated by the airport location. The ""Insomnia"" coffee bar was charging between $3.50 and $5 for a long black coffee - not cheap in my opinion. There's a water fountain right next to the entrance to the toilets so most people would probably pay $3 to a vendor for a bottle but to be fair - there is a water fountain. The check in desks only specify the airline and don't have details of flights. So it's possible to wait 20 minutes in line only to be told ""We're not checking in that flight yet come back at 4.40 pm"" (but that's after no effort has previously been made to communicate this information to people in the line). The airline makes a lot of fuss about its free wireless hotspots but I haven't tried it so can't attest to its speed or quality.

LBA flights are godsend for Northerners trying to get to Cornwall Scilly Isles etc. Usually a tiny airport like this is an antidote to the usual experience - refreshing 100% relaxation enjoy the views. Well that's not quite the case here. There are two major irritations. Security is the most zealous I've encountered anywhere bar none. Been here twice both times called in to have main suitcase rifled through. A lot of elderly holidaymakers who are not used to taking off shoes belts and so on - this can create very slow moving lines at security - answer why not PUT UP SOME SIGNS to advise them of this while we all fester in the queue? Once they finished with me then they go through my 4 year old's bag of toys vaguely peering at them shaking them etc. how depressing. Second problem is the compulsory £5 departure tax paid for via some hastily re-jigged car par ticket machines. Again security don't let you through without your voucher but so many pax fail to realise this till it's too late - heaven knows this must produce some conflict with beered-up travellers in the height of summer! Because there are so few check-in desks they only open check-in 45 mins before departure time so DON'T go arriving early or you'll have to sit with your luggage which can get awkward given lack of space landside. Well there you go don't mean to moan this airport provides a great little service.

Just seems like lots of wasted space. The airport is a good location if you are going to that area of Southern California. I've used this airport several times and it is usually fairly quiet but this last time and the security mess left me unsure about what all was going on.,NA,NA,NA,5,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
ontario-airport,/airport-reviews/ontario-airport,Ontario Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2013-03-19,Generally uncrowded. As noted not close to much of LA but we were visiting family in the Ontario area. Once outside the terminal confusing signage as to which of the islands in the airport road one need to go to for the consolidated rental car facility's shuttle van and if you pick the wrong one it's almost impossible to get from one island to the other with a cart so I had to go back to the terminal first (I'd imagine it'd be the same for a wheelchair). The shuttle was crowded and driver offered no help in loading bags (other passengers helped). We've always run into a very small variety of rental cars at this airport (even Burbank is better). But all in all at least less crowded and easier to use than LAX.,NA,NA,NA,6,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
ontario-airport,/airport-reviews/ontario-airport,Ontario Airport customer review,S Koenig,United States,2012-05-27,A relatively quiet airport - there's even been talk of consolidating operations in its two main terminals into just one - and easy to access. Rental car facilities are consolidated in one location which is good (eg easy to shop among companies) but it does require use of a shuttle bus that can get crowded. There are no eating facilities outside of security and the choice inside security is pretty limited. No airline clubs at all. Lines for security were average.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1
ontario-airport,/airport-reviews/ontario-airport,Ontario Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2010-07-15,Rather quiet airport especially when compared with other area airports such as LAX and to a lesser extent Orange County. I quickly turned in our rental car and took the shuttle back to the terminal where I'd left my wife with our bags. We checked in quickly even at Southwest Airlines. Curbside check-in is readily available. Security lines were short and moved quickly.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,Ian Smith,United Kingdom,2014-02-17,We flew into MCO from Glasgow via Newark so avoided going through Immigration and once our bags arrived we picked up our hire car and were away from the airport within 40 minutes. The return journey was a bit different. The queues at the United check-in desks were large but we were processed through quite quickly the TSA security checks were extremely busy slow and pretty disorganised. Our flight for Newark was at Gate 47 and when we were called into our respective boarding lines a flight at gate 48 disembarked its passengers who then tried to barge their way through our lines to get to the Air Train resulting in a bit of a shambles not well organised at all with departing and arriving passengers in the one area at the one time.,NA,NA,NA,6,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

This airport is becoming unbearable. We flew in from Manchester UK Sunday 3rd March 2013. We were the 2nd flight to reach Customs and Immigration. Both flights Jumbo's. Followed by another flight being British Airways. Probably a total of at least 1400 people to get process by just 10 Officers. This Airport does not even put into consideration or even care that these passengers have encountered a 9 hour flight and a time difference of 5 hours and many passengers flying with young children. We did not get processed until we had been in line for 2 hours. Somehow this airport thinks that level of queuing is acceptable! They need to now accept that it is switching people like us off.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,S Campbell,United Kingdom,2012-02-21,We flew to Manchester from Orlando International. When we tried to reach our gate lines for security were 4 to 5 wide then merged very slowly into 1 line. People that choose either of the outer lines appeared to jump into the middle of the line as it merged. All in all the simple bag and clothing checks were over 1 hour on the day we flew. The whole process was a disaster we could see that Homeland Security people were trying their best but appeared overwhelmed by the situation.

orlando-airport,/airport-reviews/orlando-airport,Orlando Airport customer review,G McGowan,United States,2010-08-26,Orlando International is very similar in layout to Tampa in that it has a landside terminal with several airsides that are connected by overhead trams with one exception: whereas in Tampa security is on the airside after exiting the trams in Orlando it is landside before boarding. Still open lines were ample and even color coded for beginners intermediates and experts. I was in the expert line and cleared security in under 10 minutes. The main terminal is stocked with shops restaurants and even a Hyatt hotel. On the airside there was a Burger King Nathan's Hot Dogs Outback Steakhouse Starbucks a deli and a couple of snack bars however there was not adequate seating at the restaurants themselves. There are coffee tables and chairs in the center atrium of the airside however they are all bolted to the floor. So if you plan to eat before you fly I would advise arriving at the airport early enough to check out the dining options pre-security. I noticed restrooms were inadequate particularly when multiple flights were arriving and they were rather dirty. When arriving at MCO remember that baggage claim is on level 2 and ground transportation (rental car & Disney shuttles and taxis) are on level 1. Long term parking at the airport can be paid by Sunpass however it is expensive. There is ample off-airport parking nearby for as little as $4-5 a day so shop around. Just allow an extra 30-45 minutes depending on distance.,NA,NA,NA,4,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Open lots of light glass stone and wood used in making the terminal. There is only 1 terminal which is divided in two (domestic/international) wings. Very easy to navigate. The airport looks a bit small especially after security. The main building and check in facilities are pretty good. Nice to see that almost everybody uses the automatic check in machines this most be something which the Norwegians are good at. I even could use my mobile fingertip or card when boarding the plane at the gate very high tech.

oslo-airport,/airport-reviews/oslo-airport,Oslo Airport customer review,Scott Wilson,NA,2005-10-24,Perfectly nice airport in terms of aesthetics and layout but I do have one gripe- the SAS lounge (for international flights) was overheated and had virtually no food on a Sunday evening. Now I know it was quiet but pasta salad that looked like it had been lying out for hours and a couple of pieces of fruit is absolutely pathetic. I have been in Star Alliance airline lounges in many cities in Europe USA Asia and Australasia and while the lounge had pleasant amenities what is wrong with providing some decent food? Take a leaf from Air New Zealand's domestic koru club lounges- a selection of fruit fresh salads meat cake and even hot food - all for passengers flying no longer than say 1.5 hours or so. The Heathrow London Lounge has more food as well.

oslo-airport,/airport-reviews/oslo-airport,Oslo Airport customer review,Martin Brown,NA,2005-08-21,To be honest they could have laid out the airport a little better. Checkin desks were at the other end of the airport from the railway station from which most people arrive and no seperate desks for Club Europe on BA. This is a no smoking airport so if you want one you have to go back out through security. I agree that the BA Terraces are a little hard to find but WOW that's what I call relaxing with a fountain in the middle and help yourself to a large selection of drinks - again no smoking in here. Aside from that nothing really to set it apart from the rest it can just be a pain to get around sometimes - especially if your gate is right at the other end of the airport and you have to go through immigration it will take at least 15 minutes.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
oslo-airport,/airport-reviews/oslo-airport,Oslo Airport customer review,J O'Brien,NA,2002-08-12,OSL is possibily the best airport I have been in. The place is very well organised. One major fault with OSL is the lack of quality restaraunts or cafes. They only appear to sell Hot Dogs or Slices of not very nice pizza. The check ins are very fast - except for those belonging to SAS where you will have to stand in line for a long time. But Oslo does operate a clever self service check in that will tag your bags all the way to your final destination. Connecting flights are a dream at Oslo - pity Heathrow or Gatwick were not like them.

ottawa-airport,/airport-reviews/ottawa-airport,Ottawa Airport customer review,Alasdair Brooks,United Kingdom,2012-02-01,I transited through Ottawa while travelling from London to Washington - a slightly unorthodox way of flying that route but there was an excellent deal on Air Canada! I found the airport to be clean efficient and easy to use. I had to go through Canadian immigration before going through US immigration in Canada (it's fairly standard of course to have US immigration desks in major Canadian airports). In both cases processing was quick and easy - the fastest US immigration queue I've ever had at any airport and certainly much much faster than I would have faced at Washington Dulles! I do wish that the food options were a little better airside for travellers to the US but they were functional. I did find the language politics in the airport entertaining but then I've lived in Brussels and have past experience of capital cities that try to balance two languages; an ability to speak French might help if you're addressed in that language first (which happened to me a couple of times) but I doubt monoglot English speakers would have a real problem.,NA,NA,NA,7,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

Vast areas are deserted and many of the outlets are closed. That all made for comparatively painless transits on a long weekend break. We still had long walks as easyJet flights were assigned to the far most end of area C but there were no queues at all for security. The only hold-up was at passport control on arrival: the control booth was beside our arrival gate and although there were two officers on duty they had to share one passport reader between them so it took 20 minutes or so for the passengers on our flight to be processed.,NA,NA,NA,8,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

palma-airport,/airport-reviews/palma-airport,Palma de Majorca Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,NA,2008-09-11,"Much of what I said last year still applies to Palma in some cases even more so. My wife and I were on our own this time and travelling with hand luggage only yet both transits took approximately an hour. The chief problem on arrival was the passage through passport control: we joined a queue that stretched halfway along a main bridge/concourse and shuffled forwards slowly only to discover that the other equally large queue to our left had to filter into our queue at the end as there was only one man checking passports! Had he actually been doing any more than merely glancing at them it would have taken even longer still. Given the cursory nature of the check I did wonder what was the point of any check at all. (There was none at all on our departure in contrast to our experience last year.) The hold-up on the return journey was through security where the queues stretched back from a double and very long set of ""chicanes"" into the main concourse. Again it proved the case that the twin queues filtered into one (because of building alterations going on?) so transit through security took over half an hour. Security is still fairly strict with watches having to be removed but there are plenty of staff who seemed both efficient and pleasant. Even so transit at the height of the season (this was September) must be a nightmare. The metal detectors through which one has to pass also seem to go off fairly frequently: I set it off and the only possible reason was my spectacles which have never been a problem before. These delays apart Palma still seems to function fairly well: plenty of seats in the gate areas loads of shops etc (if you want them) though they don't seem particularly cheap and loos at regular intervals. You do have to walk long distances though and watch out for the electric ""buggies"" used to transport the less mobile. It was noticeable that there were frequent ""last calls"" for missing passengers so anyone departing from Palma needs to be aware of how long it can take from check-in to departure gate. Also if you do need to check in and have luggage the desks are on one floor and departures are on the floor above but the indoor route from the car park accesses the upper floor with limited lift availability to the floor below.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I checked with the person collecting him that he would be taken to the gate - 04 and was assured he would. As it happened we walked to the gate only to find that he wasn't there. I brought this to the attention of the clerks at the gate desk and was told ""he will be here"". They called the flight everyone started getting on the bus - and he still hadn't arrived. Then we saw him staggering down a flight of stairs totally unaware of where he was going and sit in the nearest available seat (at the opposite end of the hall). I informed the despatcher at the gate desk and she said ""but buggies can't travel down stairs""!! My answer isn't repeatable but needless to say the lack of care aforded to elderly or disabled left me absolutely staggered.

When we finally found the auto-check in machines they seemed to be very unreliable frequently freezing. Progress after Check In was similarly chaotic with further long queues for Baggage Drop off. Altogether took more than 2 hours from arrival at the airport to arrival at Security and having left Paris more than 4 hours before the flight (advice of Airport Shuttle service) we had 5 minutes at the Gate (altered at last minute) before we were directed by surly and unhelpful AF staff on to the bus that took us to the plane.

Since I was flying Air France I was only using Terminal 2 (E & F) but I had absolutely no trouble at all queues were fine signage was fine and facilities very acceptable - the multiple plug outlets for electronic devices certainly help if you have a long wait (just a shame that you only get 30 minutes free wifi). There seemed to be plentiful English-speaking staff but they were always polite towards my efforts to speak (decent but not perfect) French and happy when I made the effort to do so.

All personnel I have met through these years have been polite friendly and English-spoken as opposed to what many reviews here claim. But the airport itself has been big confusing and for a long time now a building-site. So to be fair to the airport and its constructors: This time (Oct 26 and Nov 11) all went smooth. Outbound: Easy shuttle from 2G to 2F. And: 2F is fine. Lots of light modern lots of space. Homebound: I had a 1h and 15min connection and was quite nervous from 2E to 2G in such a short time? Believe it or not: it took 25 minutes! Arrived at 08.25 am on a full AF B747. I was politely guided by an English speaking agent who followed me to a special arrival-security-check for passengers heading for 2G which had no line. Then to a shuttle-bus taking me to 2G in 4 minutes where I passed through passport control in 5 seconds and I was at the waiting area of terminal 2G with time for coffee and croissant.,NA,NA,NA,8,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Why they even attempt to check-in 500+ passengers in a such a tiny space for each of the various daily A380 flights is beyond me - this airport was not designed to handle this many passengers particularly not any A380 flights. Transit desks are non-existent (as are general signs) and why they thought passengers would want to go underground through tunnels to get to those weird pods where the planes actually are is beyond me. The pods are also tiny and cannot fit all the departing passengers on large flights. If you are transiting through CDG make sure you collect your onward boarding pass before you arrive at CDG because it is incredibly difficult to get one when you land (you have to clear security and check-in again). It's clear that because no Star Alliance airlines hub there that no one cares about anything in Terminal 1 but its such a shame such a beautiful city has such a horrible airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
paris-cdg-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-cdg-airport,Paris CDG Airport customer review,A Snelling,United States,2013-08-04,I travel frequently in Europe and I absolutely avoid changing planes at CDG due to the messes described by the other reviewers here. Those comments are absolutely true. This time I was vacationing in France so I figured that just arriving and departing from CDG could not be that bad right? Wrong. Arriving at Terminal 1 proved to be an absolute disaster. The facilities are operating at a multiple of their capacities with too few restrooms for example. The baggage area was clearly too small for even one or two arriving planes; people crowding around while waiting for their luggage created a jam where no one could get in or out or around. There was just not enough square footage for everyone and it is probably a dangerous situation. Even getting through the final customs check to embrace your loved ones was a crowded bottleneck involving a pushing/shoving battle just to somehow get through the maddening crowd. The parking and layout of the rest of the airport is confusing and illogical but we figured it out. Departing from Terminal 1 is even worse. Check in is okay but once you go through the first boarding pass check (ticketed passengers only) you take the escalator upstairs to see the real problem. You will stand in line for a minimum of one hour to get through the passport control. There were only two windows open for all departing passengers and those two officials took their time! I was up there two hours before my departure time and I nearly missed the plane. I have never just walked on a plane and had them shut the door but this is what happened. Everyone was in the same boat. The boarding announcements started while we were still in this non-moving line and everyone got very nervous. To run to the gate while they make the final boarding announcement and then realize you still need to go through security. It is all very unsettling. I would advise anyone who is using Terminal 1 to be upstairs three hours before your departure time. Perhaps this way you will be able to have a coffee before your flight but that is doubtful based on how things run upstairs.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

We had our questions answered about what to do and where to go to check in as the signage is not very clear. Once we checked our bags made it through security and found our gate it was all fine. Orly is not a modern airport and definitely has a 1970's feel about it but the bottom line was that it worked for us.

Our flight landed on time into CDG but apparently due to a few inches of snow everything at the airport was already backed up or not operating. We were warned before exiting the aircraft luggage handlers were very slow. With 4 hours before our connecting flight was scheduled to leave I mistakenly thought this would be plenty of time for our bags to reach the next flight. The connecting flight was inevitably delayed. The gate on our connecting flight was then moved to another terminal. We had to exit the terminal we were in and go through another security line in the re-assigned terminal with hundreds of other passengers.

paris-orly-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-orly-airport,Paris Orly Airport customer review,Paul Van Alsten,NA,2010-01-30,"I often use ""Orly-Ouest"" terminal for French domestic flights and my experience is quite mixed depending on which boarding halls I use. Hall 1 is mainly used for medium-sized destinations (with turboprop and Fokker aircraft) and is my preferred one - security checks are usually quick boarding area is bright with sufficient seating areas. Hall 2 is dedicated to LaNavette shuttle flights to Bordeaux Toulouse Marseille and Nice - at peak hours waiting time at security can be very long and the boarding area is cramped. Furthermore as LaNavette flights run every hour or even every 30 minutes it can become confusing and difficult to locate the right boarding gate! Hall 3 uses only departure gate 30 for domestic flights - no need to rush through security as tha gate has only toilets and no other facilities. Hall 4 is used rather for tourist destinations with larger aircraft (A320/A321 to Biarritz Toulon and Corsica) - the boarding area gets crowded rather rapidly and the small bar has rip-off prices. ORY is much closer to downtown Paris than CDG but is unfortunately missing a fast and reliable train connection. Avoid the Air France coaches and the OrlyVal train which charge rip-off prices - around €10 one-way. The OrlyBus shuttle is cheaper but is always overcrowded. My preferred alternative is to use the RER C suburb train: first catch a shuttle bus from the airport to the train station ""Pont de Rungis - Aeroport Orly""; from there a RER train run every 15-30 minutes to downtown Paris. The whole trip costs €680 one-way and lasts around 45 mins.",NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Once airside there is plentiful seating and I found the ambience quite peaceful. I do agree though that the signage could be better some gates are underneath the main area and it is not clear until you are close to the escalator.

paris-orly-airport,/airport-reviews/paris-orly-airport,Paris Orly Airport customer review,Dave Jaros,NA,2007-03-24,Used this airport for first time - arrival on South Terminal the very end next to reconstruction site (Hall G). This is pretty old fashion airport so do not expect jetways fontains or wifi hotspots but fairly enough for easy transport means and connections. Swift immigration no checked baggage so headed for the Orlyval train in 10 mins after landing. The only point is one (!) counter for train tickets - fairly too few to manage todays traffic at the peak times (there are another two ticket machines accepting banknotes or credit cards as well). Departing on Thursday mid-evening easy navigation to the check-in though you have to slalom between some queues sometimes. Two counters for an 737 flight just okay staff friendly and working fast. Reaching the departure hall is a matter of walking steps up and down (due to the reconstruction) first you can reach understaffed passport control (3 out of 8 counters open) security just before the respective hall (was forced to remove my belt on the other side nobody cared the liquids in my x-rayed bag). This may be a stuck point so beware you slower movers and take some 30 mins to reach the G hall. Tried to buy some drink before security to take with but shops did not offer the security pack (I wonder if they would when purchasing a bottle of wine or scotch?). Airside there was just one small snack bar and one delights shop there. A lack of seating for a full plane pax load waiting at the gate. A bit chaotic gate staff changed by PA the gate number their english was from terrible (rather a nose sounds than words) to non-existent (only French announcement for passengers to another international destinations). Considering sometimes crowded RER train to the city (ok it was a peak time with many commuters) but easy access by the Orlyval than I would not hesitate to choose this place for short routes and transfer.

The main comment I have however refers to the state of the chairs in the Air France business lounge - most of them are filthy! I am amazed that Air France has not addressed this - it gave a very bad impression on an otherwise nice lounge. One other comment - if you are going from Paris CDG to Orly at 8.00 am in the morning by the Air France bus be prepared for a very very crawl in traffic! The morning I took the bus it took almost 2 and 1/2 hours to get to Orly. Hence passengers going to Orly at this hour of the morning should look at perhaps the train option!

Terrible layout of the airport so illogical it's absurd. I was going from Stockholm to Delhi via CDG. Due to my flight got cancelled I had to spend the night in France. That of course had nothing to do with the airport. I had no clue which way I took from the Air France customer desk to the bus which was going to take me to the hotel. And even then while waiting for the bus who took a good 40 minutes to arrive I still didn't know if I was in the right place. I work in an airport so I have a pretty good understanding how things work at airports and can manage my way pretty well everywhere I've been. Except from CDG. Sadly I will have to travel via CDG once more since AF gave me a 500 euro voucher due to the delay I experienced. The staff in the airport staff was pretty friendly and helpful towards me so I have no complaints there.

Only a food court selling overpriced food of poor quality and small portions. The only reason I ate there was I had an Air France voucher due to a missed connection.

The so-called architecture of this airport is an insult to those passengers that have to use this disgrace of a labyrinth that should be demolished and rebuilt from scratch. The tiny and crowded walkways the redundant direction displays contradicting each other the feeling of being buried alive in a nuclear shelter even the lack of shops! Staff was outrageous at best witnessed several members of check-in the staff snapping at confused Asian tourists. Once you get through the security controls be ready to stand in line for up to 20 minutes for a bottle of overpriced water at the single bar. Need to use the restroom?

penang-airport,/airport-reviews/penang-airport,Penang Airport customer review,N Werner,NA,2010-04-26,Penang airport is very straight-forward with everything being on one floor for departures. You first get your baggage scanned before checking in. There are many check-in counters however there really aren't that many people for all of the counters to be used. Check-in is usually pretty quick and there is a McDonald's and some ATM's etc before you go through security. Security (and immigration for international departures) are pretty quick and efficient. Once you are in the departure area there are a few sad shops and one snack bar. The terminal offers a nice view of the tarmac. Don't bother to arrive too early for your flight. Usually 60-90 minutes is more than enough. Penang is your typical regional airport and is perfect for the traffic it handles.

penang-airport,/airport-reviews/penang-airport,Penang Airport customer review,Xuess Wee,NA,2005-04-20,When the aircraft touched down on the airport my first impression was that the airport was very OLD. There is only one runway and one small terminal to cater to international and domestic flights. Once the aircraft is docked at the terminal the passengers used the aerobridge (all flights regardless of international and domestic) to enter the terminal. The terminal is split into two sections which are the international and domestic sections. The state of the restrooms are very appalling. There are some small cafeteria and duty-free shops when one moves along the terminal but most of the items sold there are not too appealing. If you wish to purchase some items found in Penang only the airport is a good place to buy as they are stocked up with many authentic Malaysian goodies. The third level is where the airline lounges are. As I flew SIA and MAS in first and business class before I got the chance to use the lounges. The MAS lounge is beautiful and one should try it. It is situated looking towards the runway so you can see the different aircrafts when landing or take- off. The SIA lounge is a little dark and quiet but is still a good place to rest. On my return flight check-in was average. The staff were not grumpy but also not outstanding. There is only a small area to check-in. Regardless of the state of the terminal I still liked the airport a lot. It has the same magical feeling as when in the city of Penang.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

perth-airport,/airport-reviews/perth-airport,Perth Airport customer review,M Burgess,New Zealand,2015-04-16,What a fiasco. No easy public transport connections - took us two hours from just outside CBD to Int'l using train/public bus/inter airport bus. Qantas check-in not open - hunted for immigration forms from other airline counters to fill out in advance. The hunt for public conveniences involved a long walk to the other side of Arrivals. When we spotted a desk being opened we were informed to return in half an hour and go upstairs to buy a coffee in the meantime. As we had business class tickets we hardly wanted to buy a coffee when we could get one in the Qantas Lounge. To kill time we humped our suitcases up the escalators and back to visit Duty-Free. Why paper immigration forms are needed to be completed is a mystery with electronic passports and e-visitor visas? At Security one of us had to get 'double' scanned on the passport they emptied our bags unravelled our umbrella - OK a forgotten water bottle is easy to miss we needed it to keep going during the 'wait' for check-in to open - and then left us to re-pack everything. The electric toothbrush was nearly confiscated due to them thinking it was a screwdriver. Inadvertently I left my mini screwdriver in my glasses case to tighten my loose glasses screws not acceptable apparently and had to wave goodbye to it. When we eventually reached the Lounge for that long awaited cup of coffee was heaving with alternative airline pax and nearly all the seats gone!

To make matters worse last time I was there about 30 minutes after clearing immigration and security a loud siren rang through the terminal telling us to evacuate.

The cafeteria style layout is unsuitable and it is very hard to rest with the bright lighting and persistent noise level. The flight gates and air-bridges are straight out of the cafeteria without separate waiting areas. Moreover airline staff make very loud boarding announcements. which reverberate round the whole hall. Many of these involve passengers who have failed to show up for boarding. How they could get lost or bewildered in such a small space is beyond comprehension. It is hard to understand why passengers can't just read the electronic boards themselves.

TSA - are they providing a service or do they think they run the show.

philadelphia-airport,/airport-reviews/philadelphia-airport,Philadelphia Airport customer review,R King,NA,2009-11-12,Very poor airport. You can arrive 2 hours before your flight and still not make it to your plane. I think much of the problem is US Air which chronically understaffs its check-in areas. The TSA screening stations are also understaffed and move very slowly. At PHL flight information for airlines other than USAir are not posted on the information monitors! My recent flight using AA an example. Flight information is often not posted at the gate check in desks the gate information on the monitors is often incorrect or not updated. Not nearly enough seats for people to sit on while waiting for flights. Other problems with PHL - poor signage within the airport poor signage as to how to enter and exit the airport and get to the parking lots and generally disorganized drop-off and pickup areas.

All because the TSA officers were checking re- checking re-re-checking (ad nauseum) people for the slightest infractions; for things like going through their machine with (gasp) a $5 bill in their pocket. No coins just a slip of paper. There was an elderly couple in front of me who got re-checked by the scanner three times because they had little bits of paper in various pockets. This was going on in every single lineup not just mine and it wasn't because something unusual had happened on the worldwide scene that day. Near as I could tell the TSA was just doing it for kicks.

It was comforting to see the UN security team right outside. The building was well air conditioned which was great. The ticketing area was easily accessible. We found that there was a ton of security checks not sure why as it seemed to be for baggage mostly. We had our ID's checked 4 times and our bags screened twice. We were told at the ticket area that once inside there were no rest rooms. That was not completely true. There is a rest room area inside TSA but before the final jetBlue secure gate area baggage screening. Also the signs for the duty free shop inside could have been better/higher to see. Overall it was not horrible but just a little cramped in feeling and the double check of the bags while offering a feeling of security sent red flags up as to why they were doing that.

Bit of a shock on arrival but should be fabulous when finished. Befitting a gorgeous island such as Rarotonga. Previously RAR didn't separate Arrivals and departures - bit of a problem for the once weekly flight to/from LA. No airbridges in the new terminal planned from the renderings I could see. So still a bit of a problem to/ from aircraft when a tropical downpour arrives as it want to do. Reason being this is such a tiny aerodrome with short runway of approx 2300m ( just enough for a 777). Accordingly turnaround and parking area for aircraft precludes a fixed airbridge. New departure area will still have the outside garden area so you can have one last look over the airfield to the beautiful mountain peaks before boarding. On another note duty free no longer the stupendous bargain it once was. Still pretty good compared to many big airports around the world.

Saw almost no signage for arriving international passengers on where to go for connections to domestic flights.

Once you leave the customs area do not go to the first taxi booths but rather to the booths to the left in the main hall: they offer fixed cheap rates to the city centre. ATMs are in the mezzanine and only one of them could accept my European bank card. I was disappointed in the return leg. Arrived early at the airport; no problem in the passport or security control areas.

Well connected to public and road transport and easy to find your way around. We arrived too early for check-in so spent some time in the floor above the desks in T3. This area is roomy and spacious with good seating and several shops and cafes of high quality. Clean toilets which had been recently refurbished and the time passed quickly. No queuing for check-in and security was managed efficiently with a minimal wait. Passed straight through one of the automated gates for EU passports again with no delay. After T3 passport control there are many more shops to pass the time and good eating facilities (although avoid Venchi with it's exceptionally rude staff) not many seats though although you will find some near the 'H' gates at the far end and again in the 'G' area once you have transitioned via people mover. If your flight leaves from the 'G' gates it is a good idea to take the people mover about an hour before departure as there is more seating there and additional shops to explore.

The ugly and dirty terminals don't bother me so much but what amazes me is the sheer level of incompetence in the management of the passenger flow. Boarding a flight in Rome and immigration queues are controlled by the crowds there is no guidance and no one from the airlines helping it is a kind of first come first served or who pushes more gets in first. I was yesterday in the immigration queues with about 100 people and even though there were supposed to be EU and non EU queues people were moving in and out in between them jumping shoving pushing trying to get information there was no staff present no appropriate signage and to add insult to injury the passport control only spoke Italian. Boarding the flight was similar no delay announcement staff could not be bothered to answer questions or help no family priority no upgrades possible as staff would not talk. I love Rome and I would like to get back there but I think this airport needs some actual professional management. Unbelievable as it may sounds it is probably the worst airport I have been in Europe and I have travelled rather deep into Eastern Europe.

We checked in with Alitalia 1.5 hours before our flight to London which was scheduled for 21.15. We thought this was reasonable timing not having been warned by our travel advisor or Alitalia about the 'normal' horrendous queuing problems at FCO. We got to Immigration control 45 minutes before our flight departure time. There were hundreds (no exaggeration) of people there trying to get through the non- EEC gates (my wife is American so we thought we had to go that way). Only two lines were open. The crowd was getting restless and eventually two more gates were opened where the Immigration officials merely looked at the cover of our passports and waved us through. By this time we had missed our flight by no more than a few minutes. We eventually made our way back to Alitalia ticketing (no easy task going the 'wrong' way through the airport). We had to pay 420 euros for a flight to a different London airport (London City) the following morning. To add the final insult there were no hotel vacancies so we had to spend the night on the departure lounge floor. No fun as we are both 70 years old!

It really pains me to see how low things have sunk and it is certainly true that in the third world it is possible to find much better airports. There are however two positive things: the transport links to Rome both by train and bus are decent also the four terminals are all interconnected so it is a fairly easy airport to connect compared with say Heathrow or CDG. The positives end here. This is basically a monster that has grown out of proportion architecturally ugly dirty dingy. The security lines as others have pointed out are totally unacceptable and I have witnessed borderline ugly scenes between stressed passengers and stressed security officers. The VIP lounges are pathetic the toilets dirty and smelly and the general atmosphere one of confusion and mayhem luggage delivery takes ages and the staff are tense and defensive.

san-francisco-airport,/airport-reviews/san-francisco-airport,San Francisco Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2010-12-19,Arrival on a domestic flight was a big confusing especially finding how to get to the monorail to get to the consolidated rental car facility. From the baggage claim area you need to take an escalator or elevator up a couple of floors cross a walkway over the main airport road then find your way to the monorail (and decipher the confusing signs to know what direction you need to go). Don't try it with lots of bags unless you have a cart (and know in advance how to lock the wheels so it doesn't roll down the monorail car).

Luckily we arrived before the Virgin and UA flight from LHR as there would have been huge lines otherwise at immigration. I raced to immigration and was attended to immediately. The immigration officer was extremely rude and did not have a good knowledge of English. She asked also very detailed questions about what sights I will visit during my stay in SF and I had to talk about 5 minutes about attractions I want to visit. I found this a bit ridiculous but I guess that's normal nowadays if you enter the US. Luggage took quite a while as it was a full 747 but afterwards I got through customs within seconds where a very friendly customs officer took my form. From there the BART station was a short stroll away and it is very cheap and quick to get in to town (USD 8.10). Departed on Southwest at T1 and found the experience not bad. Took the BART to the airport and then the SkyTrain to Terminal 1. Check-in was very quick and security was also quite efficient and fast. Facilities are so-so with a few places to eat and one or two newspaper shops. Terminal was quite crowded as some planes where delayed due to the weather.

Airside services are ok for the Caribbean but there is little available space for seating in the waiting lounges. Clearing US customs here is easy as it is mostly small planes feeding in passengers.

Airport at least apart from T3 is older - not the best facilities. Poor selection of eateries especially once you pass security. Connecting from an international to domestic flight you really need to find your own way to the transit counter (not easy to find). As with all Brazilian airports when connecting from domestic to international even if your bags are transferred you need to leave the security area and check-in with your international airline. Contrary to what one earlier review states there are lots of ATMs in the airport. Signs in English and attendants speaking English are not as common as they should be but they are definitely present. There is Wi-Fi it appears you need to register and pay for it. I didn't try. No problems in Immigration baggage pick-up or customs. The fact that the airline I used in T2 (Delta) is apparently not among those international airlines moving to T3 saddens me. I used T1 for Gol domestic flights.

Immigration and security a joke half the counters are open even when the lines cross the entire airport - twice. If you're taking heavy carryons bear in mind there's stairs and the escalators might be shut for maintenance (there's no elevator). I remember once that my flight changed gates and the screens still showed up the old one so had to drag my bags all over the place to find it. The screens at the new gate were off and the airline personnel were chatting behind a glass door: not speaking the language I could only hope I was at the right place. The whole place was dark and dingy even smelled bad. There's cigarette butts and smell in the bathrooms.

It is fairly small and not very busy so check-in luggage handling passport checks etc. tend to work quickly and effectively. I have only encountered helpful and friendly staff in all areas. One criticism is that there is no public transport to the airport except taxis - and you should agree the price before you get in.

seattle-airport,/airport-reviews/seattle-airport,Seattle Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2014-07-20,It may reduce congestion but I still don't like the fact that shuttle buses and taxis leave you out in the parking structure across from the terminals and you must go up one floor by elevator then cross a skybridge then descend again. Easy enough if you are without luggage or have just hand luggage but if you are using a cart ($5 of course) it can take a while. Other than that the airport will large is relatively easy to navigate and clean. In most cases it's as quick to walk as to take the airport trains unless you're going to Terminal S (satellite terminal) used by some but not all Delta flights. Decent array of eateries in the airport. To get to the consolidated rental car terminal you must take a shuttle bus (definitely too far to walk). Can be a bit of a hassle if you have several bags but on our last visit there were many airport personnel assisting people with their bags onto the bus.,NA,NA,NA,7,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1
seattle-airport,/airport-reviews/seattle-airport,Seattle Airport customer review,S Koenig,Brazil,2013-11-18,In general a modern clean comfortable airport. My biggest complaint is the fact that to get from the baggage claim area to the courtesy buses for hotels etc. (except for the shuttle bus to the consolidated rental car facility) or from the courtesy buses to the check-in area you have to go up an elevator or escalators cross a sky bridge then descend another elevator. The shuttles stop on the third level of the parking structure. No big deal unless you have lots of bags. If you're departing and are staying at an airport hotel you can ask the hotel to call the Port Authority for permission to drop you off at the curb at the arrivals level (note: permission must be asked maybe half an hour in advance and the permission applies only to those on the request so if others are on the bus they first go to the regular drop-off area and then the bus circles again to drop you off). The area for the courtesy buses is for a variety of such shuttles: those for both parking lots (public and commercial) and hotels. While there are signs showing where each type of bus stops (in 2-3 locations) they tend to group together (with those for commercial parking lots seemingly especially numerous) and you have to be alert and while standing on the curb may have to flag down the shuttle you want especially if it's for a hotel.

The proximity of the light rail station allowing quick and inexpensive access to downtown Seattle is a definite plus (it is located at the far end of the northern parking garage - best to ask for directions). Getting to the airport terminal to check-in can be confusing. Hotel and other courtesy vans let out passengers not next to the terminal but across the access road next to the parking garage. I saw no crosswalks across that road. To get to the main terminal you need to get to one of the elevators in the parking garages to take you to a skywalk (bridge) over the access road to the terminal then find a second elevator to go up to the departures level. We almost rented one of the baggage carts in the parking garage but were glad we used a skycap due to the confusing route to our check-in counter. There seemed to be a dearth of rest rooms in the check-in areas.

Terminal 2 on the other hand follows the trend in new airport design in that it is a huge shopping outlet that happens to have planes arriving and departing. Hongqaio is a multiple transport terminal having planes trains and buses all operating from the complex. Recently arrived from Qingdao and connected to a bus to the city of Sheng Ze in Jiangsu province. It is a really long walk from the arrival gate via the baggage carousel to the bus in fact it is quite a hike with limited travelators however one can stop for refreshment at one of dozens of food outlets along the way one can have Starbucks Costa KFC Ramen Noodles in fact anything that appeals to tastes to both locals or expats. Signage is good so no danger of getting lost. Shanghai Hongqaio is easily accessible from downtown by taxi or line 10 or line 2 of the subway for the budget conscious traveller-there is also a Railway station if you need to connect to a High Speed train. Terminal 2 ticks all the boxes of a modern airport large amounts of retail outlets food everywhere for all tastes sky high prices  plenty of seats lots of announcements in Chinese followed by English long distances to gates although you can hire a golf buggy for 10yuan about $1.70.

Could not blame CZ airplane was there crew was there etc. After boarding on time we were asked to deplane and go back to the waiting hall. Just sit and wait - no announcements then suddenly I saw that my gate was boarding again without any notice or announcement. As many other reviewers say there is nothing to do in PVG - no decent food and far too expensive.

Changing back from the Metro was much easier. Departure was just as easy once I found the correct row of counters for my flight check-in. Again no delay at Immigration and Security was also a breeze. A couple of small negative points - there is a lack of big clocks in logical places and I couldn't find any cold water drinking fountains - there are plenty of outlets for water but they all appear to be warm or hot water only.

Security do not care about liquids (opposite to Thailand) so you may bring your own as much as needed. Nice but pricey (compared to local market) souvenir shop also not cheap cafe with good variety of snacks.

There are no land bridges so you make use of the tarmac alighting and boarding your planes. Customs were cleared quickly and efficiently though the officers may looked stern. Hoards of taxis gathered outside the main door so be warned. Airport has a small waiting area with some shops and a cafeteria so it can get pretty crowded if there are many flights flying off.

The check in agent was friendly and the airport police stationed at the entrance of the departure hall was friendly too, it made me feel really welcomed. Being an aviation enthusiast, I decided to do some plane spotting airside. I headed down to Terminal 3, hoping to photograph a Qatar Airways A350. I set up my tripod, and start taking a few shots of it. A tourist was intrigued by my camera and tripod, hence we both started chatting. As the tourist left for his flight, a fellow police officer, I saw who was watching me the whole time, walked up to me and told me off that I could not spot there. He warned me rudely that my camera could be confiscated and I could be jailed. I asked him the reason why, and he told me he was not sure but still insisted I leave that place immediately. That ruined my mood in the departure hall. I headed back to Terminal 1 as there was not much at Terminal 3. Since Changi does not offer plane spotters like me to openly go into gates and spot planes, I decided to take photos of the screens at each gate. In the process, several gate officers rudely shouted at me not to take the contents inside the gate and I felt terrified each time they do. I gave up on plane spotting in the airside, sitting near my departure gate waiting for my gate to open. Being a passenger and a Singaporean departing out of my home airport, I was extremely disappointed with the service of the Airport police. Instead, I felt they could have done better by not being so harsh. Despite all that, I still believe that Changi Airport is a brilliant airport, with excellent wifi service and signs helping passengers to get to their gate smoothly.",Departure Only,12-06-2015,FamilyLeisure,6,4,5,4,NA,5,4,5,NA,1

Small queue at immigration, bags waiting on the belt. No waiting for a taxi. For the first time in many years however there was a customs inspection via xray. But thru in less than a minute. Some pax were being searched. T3 early morning departure involved a short wait in a SQ check in queue but straight thru emigration. Excellent but quite expensive food choices, free and fast wifi, very clean rest rooms, plenty of flight info boards, travelators to the more distant gates, no hassles at gate security, comfortable seating in gate lounges. boarding well organized. T2 late afternoon departure fine as well with no hold up checking in or at emigration. Less food choices than T3 and terminal is showing its age a little. But it is still clean and spacious. gate security and gate lounges fine. free wifi. T2 mid afternoon arrival involved a full on security check in the concourse. It was a little chaotic. Instructions prior to putting hand luggage on the belt and pax walking thru the scanner were contradicted by the personnel on the 'other side' which involved many pax having to go back and repeat the process. If they are going to do this they need to get their act together. Ipads are not lap tops! Again no queue at immigration and a short wait for bags.

singapore-changi-airport,/airport-reviews/singapore-changi-airport,Singapore Changi Airport customer review,P Metcalf,Australia,2014-10-13,This airport was confusing as it displayed the best and worst of what an airport can be all in one! Arrived Terminal 2 toilets clean but mostly squat toilets! There was 1 western toilet in each block which was always full as no-one wanted to use the squat toilets I found this problem throughout the airport which was very surprising as I've traveled extensively in Asia and never seen this at an airport before. Passport control took over an hour by which time the baggage was left on carousel but no airline sign was on there so we had to ask. Airport looks great very impressive until we noticed the lack of basic seating. Most restaurants closed about 10pm so it was too late for us. They had 24 hour food courts which were great only problem is they didn't accept card. The cash machines nearby would only let us draw out 100SGD so didn't want to be left with all that money for a cheap meal. The airport lacked signposts and was hard to navigate we walked around to different terminals and others were having the same problem. They had wifi but it was different in each area so you had to request a code and find the information desk each time! Very inconvenient as sms codes didn't work. Had lots of problems speaking to staff in English which was surprising for a country where its the official language. I was very disappointed in this airport its like they are in a race to build more gimmicky things and are too concerned by the look of the airport to overlook basic things like restaurants accepting credit cards lack of seating and toilets fast passport control!

My first impression on arriving in T3 was that it looked dated and rather tired with truly nauseous carpet combinations including adjacent sections of grossly mismatched patterns. Not so good if you're jet lagged and headachy. Signage and transfers pretty good but considerable variation between quality and facilities at each terminal. Some distances daunting and getting from say T2 to T1 confirming transfer and obtaining boarding cards shopping and chilling out in airline lounge in 2 hour window feels like work. Six hours based in shared lounge in T2 not so great international flag carriers' own lounges being far superior. Duty free shopping appears to vary considerably from T3 (extensive) to T1 (basic) so serious shopping requires planning and time. Superbly maintained planting in T2 very pleasant and access to exterior (weather permitting) good. Helpful staff though combination of design and lighting tends to make them invisible in what at first glance appears to be deserted transfer desks. Still a very good airport to be in for a long transit but architectural style decor and lighting now very dated (basically airport as warehouse + garden) in comparison with new signature designer airports in HK etc. In particular isolation from daylight and world outside becomes claustrophobic after a few hours when added to lengthy long haul flight just to get to Changi.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,0

There was an info desk staffed by someone time warped from the Communist era; though I was the only customer she was very obvious about the fact that she wanted to get rid of me as quickly as possible. Be sure to look up information about finding the correct ""OK Taxi"" service to get into town; the taxi desk agent was gruff but effective.

On the outbound flight back to Gatwick the security was slack (a fellow flier was allowed to take bottled water in) and security staff rude in both directions at passport control. The prices were astronomical in the airport (£4 for a can of beer which I didn't purchase) and £5 for two half filled cold cups of coffee with huffy and eye rolling service from a snotty woman in the cafe booth. Seriously not what was needed after a days travelling and the prospect of further travelling to come. The airport was clean and although small appeared spacious. Overall the airport was okay but let down by the staff who are in need of training in customer service regardless of what language they or the travellers speak.

split-airport,/airport-reviews/split-airport,Split Airport customer review,Leslie Cadwallader,NA,2006-07-23,Split Airport on a Saturday in mid-summer is obviously a different experience than reported by your previous correspondent. It is simply overstretched by the sheer volume of flights. Arriving wasn't too bad though we did have to queue for several minutes to get out of the baggage reclaim into the arrivals hall. Departing was awful. We had to queue to get into the terminal building itself and then join any check- in queue once we were inside as the only airline which seems to have a separate designated check-in desk is Easyjet. For all the others it is a free-for-all. It took us about 45 minutes to reach the head of our particular queue then we had to fight our way back through the queue behind us and across the hall to access Security and Departures. Security itself was fairly swift and efficient but upstairs in the Departures lounge itself there was more congestion with queues for everything including the loos (it took our daughter 20 minutes at least to pay a visit!). We were lucky: we managed to find two seats for the three of us to share while we waited for our flight to be called. From what we could see the airport itself could be as congenial as your other correspondent suggested but it is not really equipped for Saturday summer schedules.

The airport is not good at all. Even coming in and out with public buses (frequent and reliable service) is trouble because all buses have to queue at a single gate which serves as parking entrance and general terminal access altogether. Strange queues at entrances to terminals with security search done with no idea of what line management is. Check in desks in two terminals are located before (Terminal 1) and after Customs (Terminal 2) which makes confusing departure procedures even more painful. Secondary security search is done before passport control at Terminal 1 and after passport control at Terminal 2. Confusing again. The security search procedure is deliberately inefficient with lack of manned lanes. Passport control didn't delay me these times so I was lucky both going in and out.

The unfamiliarity is intimidating but in fact it is well organised once you get used to the system. The system is back to front: the key lesson is that you cannot do anything until your flight is called. You pass through passport screening and security checks before being allowed into the departures hall and then go direct to the check-in desks where you will be processed immediately. There are only 6/8 desks which means a queue - but you don't have to walk far and the queues are always moving. Russian border controls have a bad reputation so the feeling of disorientation adds to a feeling of nervousness.

As a father of 4 and a Stockholm resident Arlanda succeeds at most things (cleanliness security shopping play areas) but fails dismally at food and beverage pricing. On the plus side for children there are two play areas. Now where Arlanda fails is that it's almost impossible to get children's food either for eating or take-on- board at a decent price. My benchmark for this has always been Boots in the UK where there have £3.99 meal deal (air side) giving you a 500ml drink a double/triple sandwich and a sweet snack. In Arlanda it would be impossible to do this for less than £12 or SEK120. With 4 children and the no liquids rule at security the cost of feeding my children is about 10% of the cost of a budget flight for each of us.

On arrival we were bussed to the terminal (probably because Germanwings wont pay for an airbridge). Passport control wasn't the quickest but acceptable and our bags were delivered promptly. We then used the rail service to get into Stuttgart which was excellent. On our return the check-in staff at the Germanwings desk were most pleasant and efficient.

stuttgart-airport,/airport-reviews/stuttgart-airport,Stuttgart Airport customer review,G Calafiore,NA,2009-01-16,For its size and traffic it handles STR Echterdingen does its job with laudable efficiency. The terminal building is impressive and always clean with abundant natural light. This is due to the fact that it is split into 5 levels but the bulk of the main terminal area is under one roof. Check-in is uniformly speedy and the staff are polite and efficient. Queues at security are manageable and the move from landside to airside is always smooth. The facility itself is compact and easy to navigate. The Red Baron Cafe landside is the best option for dining as it offers the best choice airside slightly limited but adequate for an airport of its size. A bus ride to your aircraft on stand-off bay is almost guaranteed but STR does this day in-day out so they do it well and everything is efficiently co-ordinated. Connections to the city are readily available via the S-Bahn on the underground level. The black and yellow checked Expresso bus is a good option to get to nearby Reutlingen and surrounds and Expresso tickets are also valid for the Reutligen bus network. Luggage delivery is swift but beware trolleys are not free. If you need change for one there is a change machine just near the baggage services counter on which you will find a sign: 'Kein Kleingeld - Keine Information' 'No change No information' a nice comical touch.

I used it twice but only for arrivals as I departed from KLIA. Arrival is pretty smooth as the plane quickly reaches the gate and you can deplane and walk to the terminal as it is so close. I saw that they have a lot of FireFly umbrellas standing by should it rain. Bags arrive within 5-10 minutes after arrival and for domestic flights you are out in 15min with bags and perhaps 5-10 minutes without. There is a taxi stand where you can buy your coupon and there is a fixed price depending on where you go. Since KL taxi drivers are notorious for not switching on the meter this solution is the best. They renovated Subang airport and it is very modern and nice to use. Subang is very close to downtown and unless you arrive during rush hour you can be anywhere in KL within 15-40 minutes.

We were on the back row of a B777 and still only had to wait 45 mins at immigration. Staff were polite and friendly. Bags were waiting once we got through. Car hire is available immediately as you step outside the airport. The only downside is on the return they charge $5 per trolley (non-refundable) in the hire car drop off area. I took a walk into the terminal over the road picked up three trolleys and saved ourselves Â£15!! Check in areas are spacious and there are enough shops / restaurants to keep you entertained for a couple of hours. The gates are located in remote terminal buildings each one having it's own security screening which minimises the queue to get through security.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
tampa-airport,/airport-reviews/tampa-airport,Tampa Airport customer review,R Maccuswell,United States,2012-12-13,First time using Tampa. I have to say I really like the layout. Main terminal is 3 levels. lower baggage and transport 2nd is ticketing and 3rd is loads of shops eating establishments etc. Marriot connects via a walkway with shops. Trains take you out to 5 different terminals. Once you get to terminal each terminal has its own individual security so not very crowded and went smoothly. Also plenty in each terminal as well.

It has to rank as probably the best airport I have used in the US.

Our plane arrived in TAS at around 0345am from BKK the shuttle took us to the wrong building with what looked like a Transit building full of people lying on the floor. The people did not know what to do with us and we asked to be taken to the arrivals - a bus came in and took us to the right building. Got in the building - the Visa on Arrival person charged us more than what we should have paid for our visas (no receipts) and instead of the double entry which was on my LOI he put in single entry. I made him correct it. But he forgot to sign it which spelt trouble when I got back to Tashkent from Almaty. Nightmare did not stop there. 6 immigration booths in a 30 square meter area and with loads of people jostling around. Uzbeks don't know how to queue! Got pass it. And even when you are in the Green Zone everything should be declared including your iphone camera etc. This involves two back to back pages of customs declaration and 1.5 hours queue at the customs.

They now have more passport control personnel and actually have luggage carts though you need to fight for one. Do not entertain any ideas of ground staff honouring priority luggage tags or any priority boarding from elite members. Departing passengers keep an eye out for last minute gate changes. Double check luggage to make sure staff have tagged the destination correctly. This past trip I caught that they had indicated my bags be sent to SOF instead of SFO.

Check-in was slow but went fine and they took my bag. Note that you have to fill out the exit form before checking in. Then you present the exit form at customs along with your entry form.

Progress was slow but sure through immigration to bag pick up to customs. From getting off plane to exiting airport was about 45 minutes. Immigration queues divided into Uzbek citizens and all others. Interestingly it was the Uzbek queue that moved really slowly! Departed to LHR on September 14th on HY 201. Checking in going through immigration customs security and flight security was reasonably swift though the stone faced attitude of all the airport officials is clearly a hangover from when Uzbekistan was part of the USSR - sad as Uzbeks are generally warm friendly people. The small bar also operated with Soviet grimness serves no Uzbek beer nor anything to eat.

Make sure your are among the first off the plane and run do not walk to the passport control line. Make sure you have TWO copies of the customs form filled out completely. Then make sure you prevent people from cutting in front of you in the x-ray line after baggage claim. Still you may be delayed as the staff seem to wave locals on in front of you. Departure was crazy - gates are vaguely marked and flights are announced via a monitor. When the flight is announced you are herded into a cramped hallway with people from at least 3 other flights all waiting to board a bus. It was a pity since we could see our plane less than 300 yards away! We had to wait in the cramped hallway as airport staff screamed flight numbers and destinations and people squeezed past others to the bus.

I never understand why one has to take the stairs up one floor only to take them right back down again - this is the case in Tashkent transit lounge. You get bussed there when your plane lands - one bus to arrivals and one bus to transit. First of all there are no signs when you get upstairs. People do not understand where they should go so they typically just stop there. To be let into the actual lounge the passport gets examined (in my case - Swedish passport - very thoroughly) and boarding card stamped twice (another stamp is added on the way out later on). There are no seats to talk about. They cram about 600 people in the lounge and there are about 50 seats somewhere. Very uncomfortable at that. Loudspeaker calls are unintelligible. The airport staff runs around shouting the next departure. Do not fall asleep you will not be awakened to catch your flight. That said if you're late you will still be hauled away to the plane just as long as it's still on the ground. The lounge is supposedly non-smoking however not all are able to read English and obviously ignore or do not understand the non-smoking sign and chug happily away like steam engines. Staff is not unfriendly - but not very friendly either. Maybe one shouldn't expect smiles in the middle of the night / early morning.",NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
tashkent-airport,/airport-reviews/tashkent-airport,Tashkent Airport customer review,K Fridlington,United Kingdom,2009-11-05,It does take time to get into the country especially if a large tour group gets to the immigration check first. Local people get a kind of priority however the officials seem to be looking at reasons to stop as many as they can. Anyway remember to complete your arrival card fully and complete every section. The first control point examines your passport and visa you collect luggage and then go through a second check where they examine and stamp your arrival card. Leaving the country is similar again you need to complete another card to present to the security at passport control who ask about money. Again I was expecting the worse however we had no issues or problems it helps to smile and be polite. After the passport check there are very limited facilities the duty free shops only take euros dollars or UK pounds the prices are very expensive and the choices are limited.

All bags X-ray'd before you enter the terminal. There was one queue for my flight and only one person checking everyone in but she was fantastically efficient and once at the head of the queue the process must have taken only 30 seconds. Amazingly people behind me were thrusting their tickets at her whilst she was dealing with me. Airside departure lounge was full and despite a lot of seats very few free. There seemed to be about 6 flight leaving at the same time as mine. The lounge reminded me of a 1970's bus depot. Plenty of shops around to get souvenirs and snacks although I didn't use them. It is a small affair and all gates are in the one area. Toilets were grim with long queues. Go before you arrive! Flight information screens toggled between English and farsi but the English version stayed on screen about 5% of the time. It seemed I was the only European person there. Suddenly the screen above the departure door flashed up for my flight. Bus to the plane for an on time departure. On the return journey bus journey back to the terminal and baggage re- claim was very fast. I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of landing. Some taxi offices in the arrivals building. Overall Mehrabad is a place to catch a domestic flight no more no less. A long delay would be a nightmare here.

Another 50min wait after Asian group they took another 20 European pax after me as their flight was scheduled earlier. After another 50min wait there in a same line I finally got in. My hand luggage was x-rayed again. They called more staff and I was questioned again why I was in Israel at which hotel. A lady took my passport and boarding cards and started to call authorities. Then I was escorted with all my things back to terminal hall for inspection. All my things including underwear and so on were put on the table for scan with those big blue ""tooth brushes"" and they even x-rayed my training short. Staff at this point were calm and polite.

Then I was escorted away from hall leaving my cameras and some valuables almost unattended. In a room they searched all kind of possible weapons from my body. I heard behind the curtains when some woman was upset when they told her to take her bra off. They scanned my belt shoes iPhone. Then staff was frustrated and said that everything is ok that I can wear my clothes. Then back to the huge hall where I saw my clothes and valuables unattended at the table.

Firstly, its a long way out of the city. We used a fixed price taxi, which cost 15 Euro, but it will easily be 25 to 30 Euros from the city centre. On arrival we were met with a Departure Board, that only showed a handful of flights. We had to dodge lines to eventually find where we needed to check in. I am just thankful we arrived early. We stood for 30 minutes on what was a short line of people (clerk was simply slow), to find that we could only weigh the luggage and get the tags and that we had to drop off the suitcases at another part of the airport. No signs anywhere to show you where drop off was. The Terminal is small, and lines so long, we had to fight to through lines of people to find the bag drop. Once there, we had another 40 minute wait and a line that snaked around half the airport, just to drop off the bag. Crazy! Next another 30 minute queue to go through security. Rude staff and poor organisation sum up this experience. As we were flying to a non Schengen country, we had to use a small lounge on the other side of passport control, which was so full we had to stand. The toilets were disgusting and the only shop was a coffee bar, whose young employee was on a go slow. To reach the aircraft you have to use stairs and buses.

With some great connections to mainland Mexico and a couple of new discount airlines using the airport it is a great alternative to SAN. Only annoying bit is the lack of any decent food and beverage once you're through security. Over priced and average.

Security procedures are not explained in English. Check-in machines work only in japanese so I couldn't use them and went to check in desk. Desks are specialised by directions and it is not explained where to check in for which city. After you are checked in for the flight you have to go to another desk to check in your bag. Another queue but like everything there moving fast. Staff speak very limited English so listen carefully and don't shy to ask again if you need to be at the right place. Security control is not efficient but is well staffed (overstaffed I would say) so there are lots of available desks on duty. Boarding is a funny procedure when they form two queues (priority and normal) that are of equal length but boarding begins simultaneously for both line and looks like entering subway station during peak hours. They board 747 within 6-8 minutes. Food facilities are plentiful landside but spreaded chaotically throughout the terminals. Airside there is almost nowhere to eat. Deplaining in Japan is like evacuation exercise. You're off the plane with your bag in the train to the city probaly within 15 minutes. Bus services to the city and Narita are very convenient but are not easy to find and everything stops around 930 pm.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
tokyo-haneda-airport,/airport-reviews/tokyo-haneda-airport,Tokyo Haneda Airport customer review,Matthew Lubeck,NA,2007-02-19,Fly to Haneda every other week and have mixed feelings. Both terminals feel like architectural relics of the 80s bubble era but the airport does operate efficiently. Only in Japan do they successfully and calmly board fully booked 747s beginning a mere 15 minutes before departure. I can usually go from plane to city-bound train in under 10 minutes. Wish they had non-stop train service to Shinagawa and Shinjuku to make travel time better from airport. Also shopping is located sporadically throughout the terminal - some near ground transport some by check-in and a few inside the security area - its impossible to shop systematically in the terminals.

All looked pretty much as you would expect from an airport until Immigration where the queue seemed to be of Disneyland proportions snaking off into the distance out of site to re-enter the main Immigration Hall Again. Time spent queuing was more than 60 minutes before being processed into the country. To be fair the staff did their best to manage the queue and did eventually open more Passport Gates but it did make for a great first impression. That said Baggage Reclaim was very quick as all the bags had been delivered and had carefully been put into rows by the original Carousel. There was a final inspection at Customs before formally entering the country.

The last occasion was for a JAL flight to Europe and I stayed at the Hotel Nikko Narita the night before and obtained my boarding pass to save time. But I had to join a long line to check in my suitcase which was so frustrating. You cooperate with the airline / airport to make everything smoother but the airline / airport never seems to cooperate with the passenger. You are encouraged to go to the gate as quickly as possible since one never knows how long the lines will be for immigration but there is nothing at the gate beyond a makeshift snack bar.

Surprised to find out that this is a new terminal. Every transit passenger has to go up one floor through an escalator fall in line with all the other transit passengers in a low ceiling room that quickly becomes too warm go through security check then go back downstairs on another escalator to the boarding gate areas not your favorite thing to do after an 11-hour flight. The terminal has several shops and food establishments. Tokyo to Manila boarding was disorganized most probably because many transit passengers were already very tired airline is using a Boeing 747-400 on their Manila flight that was a full flight. Manila to San Francisco flight with a transit in the same terminal same security check procedure. The terminal's men's restroom was clean. Signs inside the terminal were adequate.

Very efficient immigration very quick baggage service very helpful security staff. The airport doesnt look overcrowded I would even say the opposite: it's very calm and tranquil place. Very unusual for the airport of such a scale and passenger volume. Railway station is underground and easy to reach. Some security procedures may seem strange. For example arriving to the airport by bus or taxi you're stopped by the road police at the check point before the airport and asked for documents so don't put it to baggage which is not with you in the cabin of the bus. Otherwise you're asked to find you bag in the hold and present your passport which is actually checked not very thoroughly (mine was taken and looked at upside down). Some minuses of this airport: after 9pm nothing works there. No food outlets no cafes no bars are open. Buildings become deserted and even information desks are empty. However special telephones for information service are available and calls are responded. Terminal 1 layout is very confusing and not clearly mapped and signposted. I've spent good 20 minutes trying to find post office. Toilets landside were not clean and even more I noticed some insects there. Very unpleasant and strange for this airport. Airside food and duty free facilities are limited I found a single coffee outlet open and noon after security. It was overcrowded. All in all a good airport. Functional and comfortable.

Just joking of course but in such a train country as Japan I am constantly puzzled at why they haven't improved the service yet. They should take inspiration from Shanghai's maglev. Furthermore a small warning: you should have your passport ready in the train going to the airport because ridiculously you can't even exit the subway without it even though you'll need to produce it another 3 times before you fasten your seatbelt. Another point the airport suffers from a constant reek of tobacco. I always had had this impression of Japan being high-tech enough that they could at least build a sealed low pressure room for smokers if banning smoking really isn't on the agenda there yet. But alas one continues to hope. Last note actually the entire design (proportions use of space aesthetics lighting air quality and architecture) of both terminals belongs to a bygone era. One can hardly count the number of better airports in East Asia at the moment (including 3 right in Japan.) I will vouch though that at least the staff are good at Narita.

If you catch a cab to the airport be prepared to pay for a two-way journey as cabbies are not guaranteed a return fare back into town. There's no point turning up early for your flight.

toronto-pearson-airport,/airport-reviews/toronto-pearson-airport,Toronto Pearson Airport customer review,D Routledge,Canada,2015-06-30,"A logistical nightmare. First we checked in using the awesome virtual checkin machines. This went great. It was quick and easy to do. Then we had to try and find the place to check our bags. Well that was a different story. We asked the lady who was supervising the check in machines and she just sort of pointed in a random direction and said ""over there"". Well over there turned out to be an area a quarter of a mile down the corridor which we found more by accident than because the signage was helpful. When we arrived in this area they were filtering people through by their flight times. The area was way too small to hold the number of people who were coming through. There was a lot of yelling and pushing by the staff. They kept announcing the flight times they were taking and when no one was coming to the front the only person who was filtering people through would wander away to yell the info to the end of the line. 90% of the time no one there was waiting for that time. So the line up just kept getting bigger and bigger. They managed to create a bottleneck that was just ridiculous. We waited in this area for over an hour and 20 minutes before they would let us check our bags and go through to customs. We arrived at the airport as instructed 3 hours before flight time. This should have given us enough time to check in, grab breakfast and relax before boarding. Instead we had to rush just to make our plane. I'm still not sure why they were filtering people through this remote area. When we finally got let through we had to walk back to basically where we started, another quarter mile. For anyone with mobility issues this would be cruel. When we got to the next area there was nobody there but there were about 500 hundred of us that got let through at the same time because almost everyone in the holding area was waiting for an 8:45 flight. So again we had a bottleneck that took forever to get through. When we finally finished we barely made the boarding of our flight. We were unable to grab food.

We missed our connecting flight to Tokyo (thanks to the inept staff of Air Canada) and had to spend the night in a hotel. The Air Canada customer service rep told us to go to ground level S-5 and a shuttle would pick us up. She also said it was a long walk to get there (true very true). We asked her how to get there and she said to follow the signs. What signs? We had to move against the flow of people to leave the secure area. We had to ask security how to go through screening in the opposite direction to leave they were not sympathetic to our dilemma at all. We asked no less than 3 airport staff for directions to ground floor S-5 and never got a coherent answer. The airport is the most confusing unorganized airport we have ever been in. Directional signage is woefully inadequate and confusing. The staff are poorly trained and not customer friendly. The food choices are scant at best. On our return trip through Toronto to Boston we found the airport dirty mush trash on the floors and in the restrooms. We waited at gate F55 which was drab with very little seating. The air quality was so bad that my wife and I went for a long walk in search of some air that didn't reek of jet exhaust. We really have nothing positive to say about our visit there.

In the last month I've flown through Pearson from LHR MUC and IST and without fail I'm amazed at our archaic customs process and the ridiculously long wait for baggage. I'm a Canadian citizen. I'm pleased they have a separate queue for Canadian Residents now however Canada is the only country I've been to (out of 47) that is the most onerous and frustrating to enter. The Canadian Residents line is always the longest the three flights I took also required us to use the automated machines that promote ""faster entry home"" - the kiosks were slow couldn't read my passport and the organisation was a mess. You then still have to join another queue and give your printout (a waste of more paper and tax dollars as it's a scanned copy of the form you just filled out) to an officer who may or may not ask you questions. You then join another queue to show more officers your printout - and then once you get your luggage (which even for Priority can take ages - I waited 50 minutes for my bag from IST - easily wait an average of 40 minutes) you have to queue yet again to give your printed form to another customs agent. If the airport isn't busy it's not so much of an issue but these times are rare particularly when you arrive from European flight - most arrive in the early evening and you then have thousands of people trying to get through. It's terrible and makes no sense - can't we at least get rid of one of those checkpoints? And Pearson/GTAA whomever please fix the ridiculously long wait times for luggage.

Fine 100 plus folks do this only to find another lineup waiting to drop bags on a belt that seemingly did not work. Slow slow slow! With 45 mins to spare I go out of this area to find that I must go upstairs and clear security again. Next big lineup about 300 people lined up to clear security in a queue that did not move.

Departure was a surprise in that they have fast check-in for Ryan Air even if you have not paid for it - you go to the usual type of check-in machine do the business and then drop your bag off at a fast baggage drop.

The sit-down-with-a-menu outlets are always very crowded at peak times. Toronto temperatures had reached 15 degrees one day but they obviously had the heaters on because it felt about 35 going through security and in the Duty Free area.

Only real criticism is lack of seats at the gates - I was on a full A320 flight to Brisbane and there were only seats for about 100 passengers. There is also no segregation of incoming and outgoing passengers - the former have to weave their way through those people waiting to board. Passengers seated in the rear half of the cabin were requested to go down stairs across the tarmac then up stairs to the rear door of the aircraft.

In many respects it reminded me of Pisa Aeroporto before it got too big. On arrival I was nearly the victim of a potential scam. Unlicensed taxi drivers gather around the door to the arrivals hall. They spot your name on a card being held by a genuine tour company. As you come into the arrivals hall they call out your name and when you acknowledge them they claim to be your pre booked taxi. Fortunately I noticed my name on a card being held by representatives from the genuine company I had booked with. For departing flights eat before you set out for the airport. At check-in there is just one very small snack bar and shop (Panini and water just over EUR 4.00) and not a great deal of seating. Everything was clean and new but facilities are extremely minimal with only vending machines for refreshments after security. Waiting in the gate area the seating is insufficient to cope with the number of passengers. I thought it was also very warm but probably not so for your average Sicilian!

Surprisingly shops and restaurants are present after immigration check and were not bad given the size of the airport. Excellent wifi and sufficient car parking space. The airport is located near some large shopping malls like Jekta that's something I really like. Domestic arrival: OSL-TOS - As it was a domestic flight there was no need for us to go through immigration. Really quick to get to the terminal and our baggage came fast too. Domestic departure: TOS-ARN - Available SAS counters were really limited. Long queues in the afternoon as there were quite a number of SAS and Wideroe flights departing that afternoon.

Quite cumbersome here. Security check was fast though. International departure: TOS-LYR - This is the only international route at TOS and gate 20 has been designated for this route. Only two counters so long queue for passport control. Quite poorly controlled. International arrival: LYR-TOS - Same problem. Only two counters again so long queue for passport control.

A case in point was the security screening – I have some metal in my leg that occasionally triggers the metal detector and it happened while going through security at Tuscon. The TSA person that dealt with me went through the standard procedure for dealing with this sort of thing (this wasn’t the first time for me) but they also managed to be human about it in stark contrast to what I’ve encountered at some other airports where the TSA person I was dealing with might as well have been a robot. I would agree that the dining options at Tuscon aren’t the greatest but I was still able to get something satisfying to eat. We even had some entertainment courtesy of the Arizona Air National Guard (also at Tuscon airport) who were doing training flights in their F-16s and treated us to an impromptu airshow.

Overall it is still amongst the best in terms of comfort courtesy and looks. For the first time I flew out late at night (Dec 9th at 1.15 am) and I was very disappointed to see pretty much all the restaurants closed even around 11 pm. Ones that were open had little selection. I understand that there aren't many flights departing at night but still. Also they had problems with bridge retracting that caused a 90 minute delay in departure (Chine Airlines to TPE). Upon arrival around 6 pm two or three big jets landed and the immigration lines were horrendous. That whole area seems to be a bit too small already. Having said that the staff kept things organized and in order fairly well. Apart from the above things I think YVR is a pleasure each time.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

I paced it last time and from the Air Canada Jazz gate to the customs and immigration line was 1000+ meters/almost 2/3 mile. So if you're on a tight turn or are infirm or not able to walk long distances just the walk is an issue. Then when you get through the inbound customs it's another couple hundred meters to check-in/security outbound. And the idea that they have a huge international departure concourse but you cannot get into it without entering Canada first is ridiculous. if you can avoid this airport do so unless you need the hassle and exercise.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

With reasonable space available to browse a number of outlets it soon became clear that the area was becoming very crowded and it appeared evident that passengers were having to queue for passport inspection in lines so long that they extended out to the retail area. Then followed a long wait with several anxious passengers worried about missing their departing flights. Once through passport control we were directed to Gates 21-26 where passengers were sat on the floor or left to stand because of overcrowding and lack of space. In order to try to clear space at Gate 21, passengers were boarded, in no particular order and by one member of staff checking boarding passes manually, onto a waiting bus to be taken to the aircraft. In very hot conditions and with no aircon, we were left for over 15 mins on the bus. Then after a slow drive to the plane the driver got out and again left the passengers on the hot bus before getting clearance to board.

With only cabin bags we were quickly through into the concourse where ticket machines have sprung up for onward journeys either by coach or waterbus and the internal Venice waterbuses too. Very convenient to use but don't bother pre-ordering your tickets online. The discount is minimal you get a code number to punch into the machine for your ticket it doesn't recognise it and you have to go searching for the ticket counter.

The covered parking lot is very expensive so you might want to consider the uncovered ones. Check-in is all done by the SAVE personnel (it's the managing company of the airport) not the airlines so they tend to be rather strict with the weight allowances. In many cases I have experienced long lines at check-in and I believe that the check-in area is rather small and can get congested very quickly. Security has improved a lot recently (they have re-designed the check points) and it has become a lot faster. The shopping area is well presented and with a fairly wide choice of boutiques considering the size of the airport. Perhaps it is lacking of chairs. The upper floor also features a smoking room which perhaps is not kept super tidy. The Marco Polo Lounge is OK but not the best of the lounges: access is the same as every other lounge (scanning of the boarding pass) the food offerings are not particularly thrilling (most of the time some cold pizzas some stale sandwiches and some broken up cookies) beverages selection is rather wide instead and it is self service; there is complimentary wifi in the lounge even though the signage indicates that you have to pay; the upkeep of the lounge is OK.

My father and I waited a tedious 30 minutes in the queue for a 5 minute flight to Vancouver. We had several trays of stuff and a man thought I dropped a SD card and when he took it up from one of my trays and asked me all the security people turned to me, glaring for no reason. The four trays blocked the traffic of baggages coming through the X-ray machine so out of respect I put them all onto one tray and moved away, and a security personnel said kindly to place it on a table. However as I was worried that we'd miss our flight as the security was taking forever to screen my father I was talking in a loud voice as he was across the room and all the security were busy looking at me and it just took forever. If you are flying from YVR to Victoria I highly recommend not using YYJ, as the security is appalling.

I wasn't overly happy with the airport before its extension but at least it had a ""soul"". When the airport management announced 10 years ago that a new terminal and a new concourse would finally be built I was really ""thrilled"" because it meant that Vienna Airport would catch up with other hubs worldwide. I hoped that all the knowledge about airport design would be taken into consideration leading to a state of the art aviation facility. The result is a mess! The architectural design (black and white) makes it a very dull place. You need to go one level down to reach the restrooms hard for people with slightly reduced mobility. The flooring of the concourse couldn't be less beautiful (linoleum) signage is horrible - what do people with impaired vision do? Food has become very expensive. On the positive side security was fast building is very clean. The new train station is very nice it is now very easy to reach the terminal. Unfortunately they do not display local trains (route S7) going to Vienna which are very cheap.

The overhead screens indicated which carousel our bags would appear on but they never did. After some head scratching we found our cases in a pile with about 20 others in a corner of the arrivals hall. Both were damaged but we had no idea where this had occured as we had passed through several airports during the day. One redeeming factor was the information/tourist office in the arrivals area where the staff were excellent and seemed genuinely pleased to welcome guests to their city. They gave good information regarding the options for travel to the city centre and in view of the damaged luggage we took a taxi at 28 Euros and travelled in a spotless Mercedes estate taking less than 30 mins to our hotel. We returned on the CAT train which is non stop in 16 mins from the central Wien Mitte station but is a bit pricey although better than the S Bann if travelling with a lot of luggage at busy times. We had none of the problems with checking in or passing through security that have been highlighted by others but that may have been due to the early afternoon flight we had rather than a peak time departure. However security is carried out at the gate so it is a good idea to get to the gate in good time rather than hang about in the departure area shops.

The building is very small and displays a bizarre mixture of typical drab Soviet facilities and shiny renovated areas that you could almost call Scandinavian. Arriving at about 5 a.m on a red-eye flight I was greeted by a pack of stray dogs roaming the street outside the terminal but then I was able to wait for the first bus into town while having an excellent cappuccino in the new cafe inside the arrival area with plenty of seats and cheerful service from the very friendly staff. Immigration is the same as everywhere else in Russia even though this was the only place where I was asked to produce a copy of my invitation and health insurance. On an afternoon visit the departure sector which is located on the same level as the arrivals was almost deserted. Services on offer are scarce: one exchange office with ridiculously short opening times one Atm one cafe a couple of windows selling airline tickets and providing general information in Russian exclusively. Everywhere around the airport there are obvious signs of big renovation works going on I'm really curious to see what comes out of it in the future.

Arrivals is limited with a single baggage carousel. Check over your baggage before leaving the airport as your baggage tag will be taken from you and checked against your luggage as you leave the building. Departures has a rather casual feel to Security checks - not convinced how thorough they actually are. Only a single departure lounge witha small snack bar vending machines and a newspaper stand.

I have to say that the airport has greatly improved over the last few years. Unlike some of Europe's bigger hubs, immigration, customs, and baggage claim goes fairly quickly. The airport has a new rail link to the city center, and public transit options from the airport are well marked. The departure hall has been expanded considerably. The additional check in and security facilities seem to have reduced overcrowding. We got from the train station to airside in less than 15 minutes. There are a wider selection of shops and a new small food court. The airport even had a kids play area and a rest lounge for transit passengers. The only major cons I noticed was that the restroom facilities seemed too small and the airport could use fewer duty free stores and more food options.

Terminal itself is really grey and very outdated. Departures is worse. Left on a Friday afternoon and it felt like all of Poland was trying to escape to the West. No seating anywhere. Shops were full and it was more because there is nothing else to do. As a business class passenger I was given access to the business class lounge (used by *ALL* airlines) only to find a small cramped room with even fewer seats. Plenty of drinks yes but other catering was miserable. Also no good ventilation thus making it seem like a sauna.

I use the airport once or twice a year and in the last decade I've never had to wait more than 40 minutes at immigration and more usually only 10-20 minutes (I'm not a US citizen and have to use the 'long' queues). Security seems to have streamlined their process and in the last 5 years I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for security at departure. My suitcase is often waiting for me at the baggage carousel. Immigration and customs staff have clearly been taking some customer training and have become much friendlier over the last decade. I like the train between terminals. I even like the mobile lounges that take you from your terminal to immigration on arrival if flying internationally. My only real quibble is that duty free shopping options remain poor. I suppose it helps that by now I know to time my arrival time to avoid peak arrivals and departures where possible and I know how to work with some of Dulles' quirks to reduce (though almost never eliminate) my queuing time but compared to some of the other major East Coast international airports I really don't see much grounds for complaint in terms of either queuing times and facilities.

We declared currency we were carrying into the country and the whole process took about 40 minutes! On the return journey things were much better but it was a 9am flight.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,Rich Jenkins,NA,2010-01-08,IAD tends to be a miserable experience but it provides almost all the international options in the DC area and it should get better. Immigration/customs formalities are relatively efficient although it's still necessary to use the people mover (often crowded) to reach the immigration area. The ambiance and dining/shopping options vary by concourse. The United commuter concourse is the worst. The main C/D concourse (used by United for mailine flights) has gotten better over time. Departure security has gotten more efficient and there is now a second security area on the lower level near baggage claim along with the new security mezzanine. I recommend the lower level location as it is still lightly used. The new train system will connect to the smaller infield terminals before opening to the C/D. The opening of the train has been delayed but should occur early this year. Getting to the airport remains a hassle - the 5A bus to Rosslyn and L'Enfant Metro stations remains the cheapest option but is poorly promoted although information can be found on the DC Metro website. The buses to West Falls Church are the next best option; there used to be service to DC but it was not used enough to be profitable. Staying near Dulles means being carbound and having limited dining options. Service within the airport tends toward the indifferent.

The airport could do with internal modernisation and redecoration as it seems stuck in the 70s. Also if you go through security and expect to see a departure lounge you're going to be disappointed. You need to take the moon buggy to your departure pier where there is a proper range of shops.

You are very close to the aircraft (including the runway) so it does not feel claustrophobic. My only gripe would be the totally constant announcements of both arriving and departing traffic needed because the information on the boards was unreliable. No airbidges so you walk to the planes but this did make for speedy boarding. We had prearranged transport so I cannot comment on local transportation but it does have a train station which is rarity in Indonesia!,NA,NA,NA,8,5,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Departure is very chaotic and confusing. If leaving on business class on a domestic flight you should go through the international departures entrance but there is nothing to tell you this. Once inside there is very little indication of where to go to check in or to board and the monitors providing information about the flights are only in Russian.

On the way in those passengers in the know bunched up at the door of the aircraft and ran for the entrance hall. Those (like me) who hadn't a clue about what was coming walked normally and were confronted with chaos. I know the Russians are paranoid about security but this was ridiculous took over 3 hours to clear a 737 load; fortunately we were the only aircraft on the ground at the time. The fire truck took about 5 minutes just to start lucky (there were no fires). The baggage hall was interesting all baggage arrived on a tip-truck which backed up to a slide (and you guessed it) up-ended the tray and baggage into the room (no carousel). Customs Hall is something else one over eager passenger put his head around the door before he was called; flashing lights and sirens erupted. You didn't need to speak Russian to get the gist of what he was told. Fortunately I had a Company courier waiting for me outside with a name board. On the way out similar system. this time however the flight was delayed due to heavy snow. No information given by staff no flight info boards all passengers JUST WAITED. In my case it was about 8 hours; this must be a fairly common occurrence in January as the same courier was with me and refused to leave until the aircaft was actually on the ground (most impressed). Food was available for purchase at a cafeteria acceptable (by Russian standards) but certainly not flash the stairs leading up to it were a bit scary their condition screaming for maintenance (won't happen).

At best a very lacklustre boring experience. Poor appearance - very basic like they slapped it together from left-over concrete - reminded me of bad 70's architecture - grey walls punctuated by orange; terrible washrooms (men's for some reason are one floor up and you have to take the stairs) - they look dingy and appear unclean. Very few stores - duty free is overpriced with a limited selection staff are OK but they almost project a wary apologetic attitude - understandable considering what they have to work with. Rather abrupt and terse staff at passport/security checkpoint. One cafe with somewhat reasonable prices but still expensive coffee and pastries. Unfortunately this area (E gates) is all we got to see hope it is not representative of the rest of the airport.

manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,/airport-reviews/manila-ninoy-aquino-airport,Manila Airport customer review,Steve Grumman,Philippines,2014-09-01,I departed Manila on August 12 via Terminal 1. The airport is undergoing renovation at this time. The air conditioning is not working so the interior of the terminal ranges from uncomfortably warm to hot. The fact that baggage is scanned at the entrance doors causes crowding and some confusion. I queried one of the immigration inspectors about how long it is expected to take for the air conditioning to be repaired and he advised not until next year. He also advised that the heat has impacted immigration's scanners and that they are out of order most of the time. This means that immigration officers need to enter a person's details manually thus slowing down the process in the heat. The terminal is either shabby or bound up in construction and the check-in area appears dark and crowded. Interestingly the duty free shops appear to be rehabilitated well ahead of passenger service areas. There are few seats on the departure floor although there are some restaurants and lounges one level above. These are not very appealing however. The men's room on the departure floor and after immigration and security has been refurbished but I observed that some of the toilets were out of order. I was given access to an airline lounge which is normally a treat. But the heat made my 1 hour stay uncomfortable. The holding lounge for passengers was likewise hot and crowded obviously not built to accommodate wide-body aircraft. The only relief from the heat was obtained on boarding my aircraft.

Far pricier then comparative well-ordered parking at both Stansted and Gatwick. At the tin shed terminal long lines of people shuffling around in a seventh circle of hell.

DIA's downsides are its location vulnerability of passenger and crew access during snow or ice storms (which sometimes close the access road and regularly make it hazardous) security (Hint: there is a generally less used security post to Concourse A that I use even when flying from a different concourse - access over the direct access bridge past the changing art exhibit is very pleasant - then transfer to another concourse if needed) and lack of a walking or people- mover alternative to the trains in accessing Concourses B and C as is available in ATL for example. Somewhat better direct international connectivity would be nice. DIA's upsides are its architecture relative spaciousness airport art the very pleasant bridge and changing art exhibition space between the terminal and Concourse A (leading to that third less- utilized though smaller security checkpoint) runway design passenger-handling capacity (except for extreme travelling periods) and a couple of food and beverage outlets. The personal greeting by Denver's mayor as you arrive in the train at the terminal is a nice touch.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Then our plane was delayed due to weather conditions causing us to miss our connection to Atlanta. There was mass confusion as hundreds of passengers tried to find an agent to help with rechecking baggage and finding a connection. The agent that we were finally able to access seemed totally incompetent spending countless minutes on the phone instead of the computer. He finally informed us that we would have to spend the night in NYC to catch a 6.20am flight. We later discovered that we had already been automatically rescheduled to a new flight that was to leave at 8.15pm - information that the Delta agent should have given to us. We can't believe how an agent for Delta could be so totally out-of-the-information loop resulting in our two families incurring over $200 each of overnight costs and having to move all our luggage with two small children to an area hotel. This is not the first time we've had trouble at JFK Airport; all in our travel group have concluded that we will never travel again through JFK unless there is no alternative.

tehran-mehrabad-airport,/airport-reviews/tehran-mehrabad-airport,Tehran Mehrabad Airport customer review,Michael Moxley,NA,2004-01-18,Mehrabad airport is an old and small airport that shows its age. The tarmac is worn out and inside terminal 2 is very dark and boring . Duty free shops are expensive and there's not a good eatery at the gates. Also I noticed security was taken easier than other airports given that I walked through the metal detector and it beeped but nobody apparently cared. I also noticed that their body search was very basic. On another occasion upon return I walked into the Homa class lounge without having proper authority and no one seemed to care. In the lounge although nice looking there was nothing special. All in all it's a tolerable airport but far from being a world class gateway.

I have routinely bought an airline ticket thinking that it was a great price only to find out that the airport fees add another 80% to the ticket. Buffalo Intl is an ok airport its quite small but it gets the job done. One problem with this airport is the paltry number of flights that leave the airport.

VV does not appear to check bags through to final destination so had to pick up bags and recheck in KBP. Terminal B is not impressive. The domestic baggage belt is tiny so it will be a scrum to get your bag. The entire terminal has only 2 jet bridges so there's an excellent chance you'll be riding a bus to the terminal and plane (the NYC flight does use a gate due to the extra security). I had a 2.5 hour layover and when my bag finally arrived I discovered I couldn't check in yet. There were a few places to eat in the arrivals area and a couple other shops. I joined the others staring at the departure board waiting for the check in counter to be posted. BT has its own check in staff so you won't be lined up with VV. Passport control was fairly quick and so was security. After you past security in the international half of the terminal there are 3 duty free shops (2 were closed) and about 3 cafes. That's it for shopping so you won't be picking up any last minute souvenirs. There's also no place to change money so if you don't spend all your hyrvnia in duty free or at the expensive (by Ukraine standards) cafes you are out of luck.,NA,NA,NA,4,4,3,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,A Ilersic,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,The Stansted experience is truly awful and has been for a long time now. Unfortunately I've had to use this airport on a weekly basis for the last 4/5 years. I will not be using it again after Christmas. I would much rather the inconvenience of travelling further and will now use Birmingham Airport after trying it in September and October (it is paradise in comparison with Stansted). The queues at departure are considerable. The space provided to shops at the airport in comparison to waiting areas / seats says all you need to know about the commitment to customer care. Queuing systems are hit and miss at departure gates - mainly miss. Gate numbers are frequently released with only a short time to go with the warning final call. Infrequent travellers are often seen running as if their lives depended on it. Arrival is much worse. There has been plenty of times when I've been held on a plane after it has parked for 10-30 minutes only to be told that we are waiting on ground staff to open the doors. When they decide to let us in we then have a middle distance race to get to passport control. Sometimes we have the privilege of queuing down two corridors even before we get upstairs to the main area. This process can take between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours in my experience. The border control and the ground staff blame each other. Last night border control also blamed the airlines for landing at the same time. I wonder who allows this to happen? The ground staff seem to take great delight in being rude/sarcastic or unhelpful - sometimes all three. Stansted management just don't seem to care. They know what a misery it is. They can see people. They can listen to people. Many travellers are infrequent so many will go away thinking they were just unlucky. Nothing could be further from the truth. The airport is wholly incapable of dealing with the capacity it has committed to. I left my watch one day at security. I reclaimed it the next day after being charged £20 for admin fees. Stansted may say that they tender the issue of lost property out to a third party but it is they who make the decision and no doubt are paid handsomely by the aforementioned third party. Stansted beats Ryanair for its contempt of its customers. I cannot pay it a higher insult than that.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

tel-aviv-airport,/airport-reviews/tel-aviv-airport,Tel Aviv Airport customer review,Bari Tarmon,United States,2015-03-04,I know I am biased. But I have a good reason to be so: I'm Israeli. I am also old enough to have experienced the old airport terminal which was archaic and chaotic. Thus I feel that Terminal 3 is just superb. I have passed through the airport 6 times since 2005 and have actually enjoyed my visit. Having an Israeli passport is a major game changer. I have never had to stand at the long luggage screening line and have breezed through every security check and processing station. The main aspect I feel is so important especially before a long flight is the sense of serenity and relative quiet. I understand the frustration of foreigners who encounter long waits and seemingly unnecessarily long security checks but that is the nature of being in the Middle East. I feel (selfishly) that this is the one airport in the world that I can feel like a king. I too am asked seemingly odd questions but I believe in profiling as it has proved to work. BG airport isn't the only hyper security airport. I witnessed an incident at Frankfurt airport where a young couple was escorted from the waiting area (having already passed through security) to a side area which was not private and was interrogated and searched in full view of all. It must have been humiliating. This is our present reality. BG airport is clean mostly well signed efficient (except for occasional labor strikes or slowdowns) and at least to me relaxing and pleasant.

We arrived at JFK from Rome (FCO) via Delta and I was surprised. Everything went smoothly from passport control retrieving our luggage and re-checking to going through security again. Employees were helpful and courteous. However given the layout of the airport and the heavy volume of passengers this airport handles things do have the potential to go south in a second. Additionally NYC was not my destination so I did not have to rent a car or take a taxi to Manhattan. Had I done these things maybe my review would be a bit different. I will say the layout of the airport needs to be updated and the food choices could be improved. However we waited for our connecting flight in another part of terminal 4 (I believe Delta gate 23) There were a few decent places to grab a bite to eat or grab a beer.

The gate for international transit passengers to proceed from domestic flights to the international terminal was locked.

When our flight was called for final boarding I started to move forward asking people in front of us for permission to pass. I became very irate as my flight had been announced 'ready for departure' but still no call for us by name to come forward for boarding. We eventually cleared passport control where a very rude/ignorant official stamped our passports. We were running to the gate when an airport official asked us if we were on the Barcelona flight? He got on his walkie talkie and said 'don't take the bags off I have the passengers with me' then reopened the departure gate to let us through. We got on the flight.

Clean airy large windows restaurants not crowded things move fairly smoothly and staff is friendly. Taking off and landing offers spectacular views of Washington since the airport is located very near downtown d.c. There is even a metro station directly at the airport so there is no need for a taxi if you don't want to spend $20 for a ride. The one setback is that DCA is served only by regional U.S. carriers and Air Canada. If you travel long haul to D.C and have to switch planes try to switch to a flight into DCA - it is way better than flying to dull Dulles International Airport (IAD) about a one hour drive out of town.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The return journey a week later was satisfactory as well there is some impressive new investment in the combined car rental facility and connecting shuttle train.

However I must say it's probably the worst airport I've been to when it comes to departing. I arrived at 9:30am to check-in; probably fifty people were waiting in line to check in - but apparently the check-in for Air Berlin doesn't open until 1000? I wanted to sit and read while waiting for my flight but learned that security for my gate wasn't supposed to open till 11:00AM - actually employees arrived at 1100 to get ready; it didn't actually open till 1120. So I had about two hours before going through security and could find neither a place to sit down nor good food options. Once I made it passed security I encountered a relatively tiny somewhat dirty waiting area and a tiny little food stand. At most airports you have many food/drink options beyond security; this is not the case at Tegel. I guess my review doesn't matter much as this airport will be closing within the year.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

As we approached customs, there was one person yelling for Americans to line up on the left and non Americans on the right. No signs were posted. It then took us almost two hours to stand in long lines to reach three different stages for re-entry into the U.S. After being in line for 45 minutes, we showed our passports to a machine that printed out our pictures and answers to the ""declarations"" form we had completed with paper/pen on our flight. Then we had to show our passports and declarations form to a live person after lining up for another 20-30 minutes. We were then released to the baggage area and then had to stand in another 10-15 minute line to show our form again before getting out to the street or other terminals. The airport was understaffed and the staff were uniformly rude or simply disinterested. As we tried to make our connecting flight to Dayton, OH, we were directed to get the shuttle bus to terminal F. The staff member pointed us down the hallway. We soon discovered he had pointed the wrong way and we had to return and go another direction to get to the street. At terminal F, the TSA folks who checked our liquids and carry ons, etc. could not have been ruder or more indifferent. Fortunately our connecting flight was 45 minutes late.

Today I had to endure snaking along a dingy claustrophobic shopping corridor overwhelmed by the perfumes and horrible glittery floor all designed to force you alongside every shop like prodded cattle. On top of that some idiot has decided to show gate number directions on the TV screens just after Pret a Manger (even though they're on the wall on big signs) instead of the useful live gate number information that was there before requiring a walk back into the overcrowded main area to find a screen that shows it.

In short if you begin or end your trip in KC it's probably the single best airport in the country. Curbside to gate in 25 feet - an amazing and efficient design. However this is accomplished by every gate area being in it's own sterile security area just off curbside which poses the aforementioned headache for connecting passengers. KC for whatever reasons has never been good as a hub for airlines (recall back to Braniff 1 and 2 Eastern US Airways and the lowly and now defunct Vanguard Airlines) so most likely you're just an origin/destination passenger. The renovation has made it more up-to-date better services and better aesthestic design. It still suffers from no services even restrooms in the gate areas though. Security can be odd - I was once told that I could wear my tennis shoes through the detector but then pulled aside for complete pat-down because I did wear my tennis shoes (by the same guy who told me I could wear them an then pulled me aside for the same reason)- where's the logic?

There's still no bus to Rouen Dieppe or anywhere bar Paris. Seating is inadequate and even with the new extension + pre-printed boarding cards the check-in queues are a nightmare. Rows with Ryanair over baggage are never- ending and it's not uncommon to see passengers in tears. I've started to use CDG in preference - getting there is cheaper than parking at Beauvais for any trip of more than a few days' duration and Aer Lingus is a far more restful option than Ryanair.

It lacked enough seating landside to cope with two seriously delayed flights but there were reasonable facilities otherwise: indeed the best restaurant offered an excellent breakfast buffet for â‚¬11. Airside once again there was insufficient seating (the airport is designed as a shopping mall with optional access to aeroplanes in the currently fashionable style). The seating shortage was particularly unreasonable at the departure gates where people know they need to assemble en masse if they're flying with an airline that offers no seat allocations.

So you could walk out of the airport to a tram and pay about 2 dollars for a ride into the city. You can still get to the tram but it's an awkward walk. You have to walk about 15 minutes to reach it. Also the kantor/currency exchange was outside of security so after we had gone through passport control I couldn't exchange money. So hopefully they'll fix that. There was free internet near a cafe but couldn't easily find power. So most people had to run off of battery.

How can an international airport be so inefficient when it comes to security checks? Poor management of tax refund verification prior to entering the secured area. The requirement is for passengers who want to claim tax refunds to first obtain their boarding pass and check-in their luggage before proceeding to get the tax refund slips verified. While this information is stated at the tax refund counter who would have seen the signs when there is always queue blocking the tax refund area. I was not the only one to have queued up reached the counter after 10mins and told to get my boarding pass and luggage check first. Apparently common sense is lacking here in putting up clear signs and information to inform passengers about tax refund procedure. The GREEN movement in Korea is worth commending but the stuffiness and the stale air in most parts of the airport are not welcomed. They should reconsider giving passengers a more comfortable experience by easing their strict temperature control. Insufficient basic facilities such as seating area or power points in the transit area. Except for the gates I don't believe I find any seats or power points in the shopping area or restaurant area of the airport. It is not a big problem but I would think that wouldn't it be better to just provide such basic facilities for those who are on long transits so that they wouldn't have to be stuck at the gate area just to get a seat or just to plug in their laptops/handphones.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,4,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I have to admit that i think that was one of the shortest walks I've taken from the gate to get to my luggage. It took about 3 mins tops to get from the gate. I didn't have to wait too long for the luggage to arrive - it took about 10-15 mins. But I guess not alot of others would get this since only flights from Canada don't have to go through customs at Term D. Upon leaving things went by pretty smooth. The check-in area is massive and the ACJ counter is at the very end. Going through security was a breeze. The only knock i had against DFW is alot of shops weren't open at the time - they should have waited at least another week before opening Term D since alot of the shops and stores weren't open yet. I'm sure by now Term D is up and running at 100%. It didn't turn out as bad as everyone said it would be.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I was connecting from a flight arriving at Terminal 3 to a domestic departure from Terminal 5. The bus transfer between the terminals was pain free and just involved a lot of walking. It was the Border controls and security that had me quite ashamed of what for some people is the only view they get of the UK. I moved through the EU passport border quite quickly but witnessed a large queue for the International passport border trapped with a very rude member of staff not explaining why they were there all of them getting visibly upset and all this staff member would do is tell them to be quiet and wait with no clear view of what they were waiting for. The border agency staff seemed stressed which isn't reassuring. Moving onto security well this was a shambles the staff were not explaining what some passengers should do and then being very rude if they went through the scanners with a belt on the bag scanners were incredibly slow with large build up of people waiting for the bag to come through the other side all the time the staff just seemed to stand there and do nothing looking incredibly bored like it was some kind of torture to be there.

Only a few gift shops and a couple of food outlets before going through immigration and then a few more gift shops and only a couple of food outlets after going through immigration.

Especially if you're flying with Omanair, they have a specific area just for that airline with many counters open for it. The only thing is, I just absolutely am disgusted with some of the staff where they would constantly question whether I need a visa to UAE with my passport and then question me back on ""are you sure?"" and ""really?"". 2 weeks ago, the guy at the check in counter said ""how do you know you don't need visa? When was the last time you were at UAE?"" (if he had properly check my passport that he was holding, he would have noticed that I have at least 10 UAE stamps in my passport, one which was dated 2 weeks before that). 2) Not many shops to be honest. Not the sort of airport you want to be at for more than 3 hours. 3) Did not like the other gate for low costs airlines such as Rotana or flydubai. That place is packed and crowded and super unorganised. I have honestly paid more to fly with Omanair just to avoid boarding through that gate. 4) Arrival at the airport is ok at times. Sometimes its super crowded, sometimes it's excellent. The immigration counter could do with some more counters during the busy time cause I remember when it took over an hour just for the queue. 5) Taxi from the airport to your destination is absolutely expensive. Where I am staying at, is only 10 minutes drive, yet it costs OMR8 (and same price to where another place that is 30 minutes is). 6) When the airport is full, it really is full. The cars are unorganised and everyone looked lost. I know they are building a new airport to support the high amount of tourists coming into the country, so I really am looking forward to that.",Arrival and Departure,14-06-2015,Solo Leisure,6,2,2,2,NA,3,1,3,NA,0

Sadly it is often the most convenient for European visits. £2 for a Taxi drop off too far from the departures building. Then you have to pay for a trolley both going and upon your return. I dread what our overseas visitors think about that. Â£2 for the legally specified sized plastic bags to hold the regulation sized toothpastes / cosmetics face creams etc or else you will not be travelling. Then the chaos of the departure shopping mall. Minimum seating impossible departure signage almost invisible by neon screaming at you to come in and buy buy buy. Not a clock to be seen anywhere. Returning causes more anxiety it is not unusual for your baggage to take over an hour to appear on the carrousel shabby and miserable. To get a taxi for onward travel requires a pre arranged booking which is dodgy because you need to take into account the delayed baggage problem and heaven help you if it is raining and usually it does because you have the long trek to find the cab and again pay for a trolley and the £2 to release the cab from the car park.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The immigration officer was condescending but as a frequent traveler to Europe I am used to it unfortunately as there are many rude ones at any port of entrance airport in the US. Security was a complete mess and equally unprepared for (and uninterested in) the many flights that were coming in from abroad.

Parking is relatively easy and can be cheap if you take advantage of the various offers available either through Holiday Extras or even from the airport website itself. On each occasion passage through Security has been swift and painless with staff efficient and polite even when one of us has been selected for extra scrutiny. Retail and food outlets do not interest us so we sit at the easyJet end of the building until our flight is called. I would agree however with some of the comments posted about the hold-ups to pass through passport control on returning to the UK - the immigration area is small and quickly becomes congested when 2 flights arrive in quick succession. It is particularly bad when one queue coming down the stairs has to merge with another queue entering at ground level.

Taking the cake is this dreadful Suvarnabhumi Airport which stretches over a vast distance and has many areas without the walking machines. The distances are simply too long for many senior travellors and after more than a kilometre you arrive at the long queues at immigration and afterwards have to fight through crowds and up and down escalators to arrive at taxi lines.

The second time around this airport made my life a living hell. I had been traveling for almost 30 hours and when I landed here I was greeted by a long immigration line. Took almost an hour and a half to clear immigration all the while putting up with the extremely rude and seemingly arrogant staff. You get treated like vermin here.

Even for no reason... the mob getting in the front door resembled a rugby scrum but once inside there were no big crowds and thus no reason to push and shove rather than just wait in line - it's just the way they've always done it. I had the chance to leave via the new International Terminal that opened this month and was pleasantly surprised. Air- conditioned spacious ceilings numerous clean restrooms water/snacks for sale plenty of seats in the departure lounge actual flat-screen TVs showing when flights are (scheduled) to take off. It is dare I say closer to what other international airports are like than it has ever been.

If you love frequent body searches numerous x-ray machines and hand searches of your luggage then this airport is for you. Don't forget to make sure that at the security check desk they have remembered to stamp your luggage tags otherwise you will be forbidden from boarding your aircraft. Exchange your rupees before you get to the airport because the exchange booth is slow the rates very poor for exchange. In many ways the airport mirrors the city. On arrival line up to arrange a pre- paid taxi before you leave the arrivals area but be careful because they try and scam you by giving incorrect change and hoping that you won't notice.

Melbourne airport is usually quite clean though I've noticed that the floors would definitely benefit from more mopping/sweeping and the seats/tables could have been cleaned some more giving the airport a 'dirt in the corners' kind of vibe. Bathrooms are usually well maintained. Duty-free is pretty good with great views through huge windows and a few food options one or two of which are almost always open. Nothing seems terribly overpriced however waiting 5 minutes for someone to get a drink from a fridge proves service can be a little slow.

All of this has drastically changed for the worse since the new security hall has been introduced. I have used it six times now and have had awful experiences on each occasion - massive queues slow process for tray loading staff being rather sharp with customers (probably because they are stressed too). The old security system was never really that bad but this new investment just isn't working. I was told yesterday that management have underestimated the staffing requirements and are actively recruiting. I am not convinced that this will solve all the issues. The actual operational process at the machines is where I believe the greatest hold ups are being caused. To top it all I was selected ""randomly"" yesterday when I went through the x-ray door. Historically this would have meant being quickly frisk- searched. However you now have to queue to go through a body scanner. This resulted in a further delay waiting to queue for the scanner. Not impressed. I am now beginning to consider driving to Glasgow Airport or using the train as there is no real sign of this improving. If it's like this in the quieter winter months I fear that it is going to be utterly unbearable in the summer holiday season.

On departure: lengthy security checks the agent at check-in didn't know a word of English - a superior had to step-in. Seating is scarce around the terminal. The food court area is like a bazaar hard to make your way through. The smoking terrace - overcrowded as well is a nice addition and well taken care of so I would put that as a plus. Walking times to gates very long gates number changing at last minute. As the previous commentator objected you must have a Turkish SIM card in order to access the wireless internet - in an airport that tries to position itself as a global transit hub - mind boggling to say the least.

Was told by security I needed to have printed boarding pass without any explanation as to why no such requirement was listed anywhere. The line for ""web check in"" seemed to simply be another check in line, which was moving slower than the normal check in line. When I asked for clarification from the manager the only explanations he could offer was 1? it was a budget airline so I was getting budget service and 2? they had over 200 flights to manage so I suppose I should just be patient. The delay was bad enough but the responses from SATS reps made it far worse. Hope it was just an off day for Changi.",Arrival and Departure,05-07-2015,Solo Leisure,3,1,5,4,NA,4,NA,5,NA,1

Generally it's not bad although we were locked into arrivals by mistake on one occasion. It's like a smaller version of Liverpool airport and suffers from the same atmosphere. Signs warning the approaching motorist of dire consequences should they not comply with a list of regulations serve as a welcome. Then one is charged to use the drop-off zone even though a few yards away you can park for free for 15 minutes. The 15-minute rule both here and in the drop-off zone adds a little extra inconvenience to the experience as it makes it difficult to be met by a partner with a car (they may be obliged to drive around the airport for a while if your plane is late). Then we are regaled inside the terminal by loud warnings about wheel-clamping. With about a dozen customers inside this seems less than helpful to the ambience.,NA,NA,NA,5,5,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

I agree that past the security gates at TBIT there needs to be more food options as you can't bring water/sodas through security so are stuck with what's available. I usually have a 10 hour layover between my east coast US flight and my overnight flight to Australia use the airline lounge in terminal 5 and then wander over to TBIT to check in and enjoy a Pinks turkey dog before going through security to the gates. There are charging stations and plugs around the terminal so tablets ipods and other gadgets are ready to go for the long flight wherever you go. Bring a good novel or use wifi and watch movies etc on your tablet. It's not up to the airport to provide you entertainment. As for the queues at customs when I passed through in October there were close to 1000 people from two full flights and I spent a total of 15 minutes waiting to clear as more booths were opening up alleviating the congestion.

Only a mere 29 minutes elapsed from engine shutdown on my inbound flight from Canada to my arrival at the gate for my onward flight to Sweden. This included waiting and processing time at both Immigration and security screening, and I walked at a normal pace at all points in between. Schengen-to-International connection on my return to Canada was equally efficient, and quicker with no security screening being required.

Domestic first - generally quick check in (except morning/afternoon peak) reasonable food options and not too far to walk to the aircraft gates. Same rating as most of others both here and overseas. International - outbound first. Given they have spent a fortune every dollar has been worth it the one exception being long queues to get through both security and customs that we did not have at either LAX nor JFK nor SIN. International inbound - in a word hopeless. I'm comparing to similar size airports around the world Be prepared to 'greeted' by bland walkways with no windows and signage that seems to be 30 years old. Not even a welcome to Melbourne sign and a bit of greenery would not go astray. If another flight arrives at the same time you'll wait an hour to get through customs/passport control.

Their staff were exceptional. It would be easy to criticise when things go wrong as they did before. But when the entire process was so efficient so smooth and seemed tailored to getting the job done one knows its working even though one is not so sure. The staff knew there were problems and went 200% of the way to remedying them. 30/31 December 2010. Due to adverse weather conditions my flight was delayed and if it could go wrong it seemed to go wrong. After all it was a severe winter in Europe DUB-AMS was delayed and I missed my connection to Kuala Lumpur. The right hand did not seem to know what the left was doing. To be honest I'd say I was unlucky in terms of how 'tight' my connections were and my own advice would be to allow 2 hours minimum in any Airport to allow for contingencies.

We arrived early as airlines suggest. Went smoothly through U.S. Customs and security and had a nice leisurely breakfast before going to the gate for boarding. Thinking to do the same this year we arrived early only to run into utter chaos orchestrated either by Air Canada or the U.S. Customs. Welcome to the Cattle Pen at Pearson! For some reason early arrival has to be punished by putting passengers in a holding area from which you are released with insufficient time to catch your plane! Air Canada personnel were frantically pulling people out of the security lines to try and get them to the planes all of which had to delay departure because of missing passengers which they knew to be somewhere out there in the chaos. No time to shop no time to eat. Stores and restaurants must be losing heavily. There are a finite number of passengers to process. Letting early arrivals go through early helps the process!

I eventually asked a member of staff what Billi meant and was told I had to leave the building to go to another terminal outside. On arriving here I found an enormous queue/crush out of the narrow doors onto the street and had no choice but to join. It was an hour before I and my 2 small children got to the desk to check in where I discovered I had to take my bags and put them onto a conveor belt myself (via another 10 min queue) to go to the plane. Then i joined a 15-20 minute queue to get through security followed by a rush to passport control. On arriving at passport control we were pushed to the side as there was no more room in the departure area due to delayed earlier flights so we waited 20 minutes. Eventually we were ushered through passport control and arrived into a hall area with seating for 10 people tops!

cebu-airport,/airport-reviews/cebu-airport,Cebu Airport customer review,Corey Shreffler,NA,2005-09-12,"Mactan-Cebu International Airport (CEB) is a much better entry point to the Philippines than Ninoy Aquino (unless your final destination is Manila of course). However despite the fact that Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines there is nothing overly impressive about its airport. I arrived at CEB on a domestic flight and was quite surprised how desolate the terminal was. This was in stark contrast to what was waiting just outside. For a flight of 60 or so people it seemed like the whole city of Cebu was waiting to greet us in the ""welcoming area"". I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only Cacuasian around but never once felt threatened by the smiling faces of Filipinos. I was immediately greeted by a sonata of sales pitches as taxi reps competed for my business. I gently waved them off since I was waiting to meet my friend. They were persistent but not obnoxious. The availability of transportation is not a problem at CEB but you will need to learn the art of negotiation to avoid being charged unfairly. Thankfully my friend is quite skilled in these matters and we never had to pay an elevated fare. A few weeks later I left from the international terminal at CEB for a flight to HKG. I don't remember much about my actual impressions of this terminal since I was contemplating a heartbreaking goodbye to my friend. However I do remember that the security line was not long at all and the entire process of getting my boarding pass and clearing customs took about 15 minutes max. The airport workers were quite friendly except of course for the customs official. CEB is a utilitarian airport and nothing more. It helps you get around the Philippines and S.E. Asia but luxurious it is not. It does however have a much more friendly feel than NAIA and Manila's domestic terminal.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
boston-logan-airport,/airport-reviews/boston-logan-airport,Boston Logan Airport customer review,Jim Kenney,NA,2006-09-08,"Used Terminal E for BOS-CDG-BOS. The terminal's interior upgrading is almost complete. Food quality is good. If you have time go to Houlihans if not plenty of other locations to choose. Shopping was alright but not much in the way of books except outside security. Boarding was slightly chaotic since we used gate 6 which looks as if it were placed arbitrarily. A note here terminal E gates with the exception of Northwest (the only permanant carrier there) are not leased to the airlines hence the lack of airline signage. Also the ground employees are not employees of the carrier. They are local employees assigned to carriers. I encountered a Lufthansa ground crewmember who told me she actually works for GlobeGround. She spoke German as do I but when I asked her if fluent German was a requirement she replied ""you don't even have to be fluent in English"". Kinda unsettling. Flight departed on time the return went alright however Customs still has not staffed the arrivals hall fully. While I realize this is not JFK it is no excuse to understaff the immigration hall. Especially when 4 flights arrive at the same time. Other than that it went well. The Airport Subway Station has come a long way and is very nice. Take it if you are trying to get downtown.

gdansk-airport,/airport-reviews/gdansk-airport,Gdansk Airport customer review,P McWilliam,NA,2010-08-18,A very small regional type airport trying unsuccessfully to perform the role of an international airport. On arrival there is a very small check in area totally inadequate when more than one flight is being checked in at the same time as happens every Sunday morning when Wizz air flights to London Luton and Liverpool are being checked in together along with a flight to somewhere in Scandinavia. Having checked in you must then go upstairs and join the Queue to pass through Security. Once again this is totally inadequate there is only one body scanner for everyone to pass through and because the security people insist on you removing your belt and shoes this can take an age when more than one flight is leaving at the same time from the 2 gates beyond ! Once through Security you will find yourself in a small departure area again totally inadequate for the amount of people waiting there to go onto 2 different flights. In the Winter it is at best unbearable. In the Summer it's horrendous as the sun penetrates the glass and the temperature exceeds 40 degrees with no air!

jakarta-airport,/airport-reviews/jakarta-airport,Jakarta Airport customer review,T Adams,United States,2013-08-01,The airport has made great strides in the past 5 or 6 years to get passengers processed quickly and efficiently. However with the exception of the new domestic terminal this airport is very old with poor air-conditioning. Check in process for the international terminal is easy. Plenty of room. Only passengers actually flying are allowed at the check in area. The next step of going through immigration is much quicker than before as more immigration counters and agents have been added. However beware the immigration officers at this airport are very rude disrespectful and overall have an arrogant attitude to all. Once through immigration the process to get to your gate is easy with plenty of shops and restrooms and dining. It's just that the building is old dated and not enough AC. On inbound flights the process of passing through immigration for foreigners has improved dramatically and I now consider it one of the fastest airports that I know of to pass through immigration. However where Soekarno-Hatta airport fails is in the baggage claim customs and parking. Baggage claim facilities are ancient slow and crowded. Once you claim your baggage you must than have all your baggage go through an x-ray machine. This is ok except there is only one queue and one x-ray machine which means standing in what resembles a queue with many people jumping in front. Once you finally exit the baggage claim area you will be barraged by scores of locals trying to provide you with transportation to Jakarta. Overall for foreigners the immigration process is very good.,NA,NA,NA,5,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,1

My usual route is MME-AMS-MRS and return (KLM - rather wobbly Fokkers on both legs but generally personable crews and reasonable timekeeping) which means I get to use Hall 4 at MRS undeniably pleasanter than Hall 1 or the new low-cost terminal MP2 (although one of my daughters used this in December and thought it perfectly adequate). Check-in staff at MRS are always pleasant the waiting area by the gates is light and airy and (since changing from Europcar to Avis) I have found the collection and return of hire cars to be quick and hassle-free.

After 2 hours being jostled and funnelled we found ourselves at the entrance of the immigration hall only to see a massive queue and a further 2 hour wait. The information was non-existent airport officials not to be seen anywhere. A lot of time was being wasted once we got to the immigrations desks (which because of the financial mess were only staffed 30%) and a significant improvement to the queue could have been made by just a few seconds of greater efficiency at the booths. Complaints after the event have been met by platitudes and a total failure to understand the health and safety implications of the airport's inaction. Told that they'd brought in extra staff (no sign of any) and were handing out bottles of water (we saw none). The general view of my party (2 of whom are over 70) was that this was the worst airport experience. After 40 trips I will never come here again. This is a true shame on America and has done more damage to Miami's reputation than they seem to realise.

For my flight departing to Australia from the new concourse A curiously enough there was yet another carry-on baggage check immediately before boarding the aircraft but this checkpoint was fully staffed and caused a delay of only a few minutes. Another good find at Airport City just 10 mins from Incheon terminal via their free mini-bus shuttle is Hotel Sky that provides overnight accommodation at a most reasonable price. The standby rate is 50000won (less than US$40) but only when booked by staff at the Korean Tourist Office stand which is very hard to find tucked away in the terminal building near exit F and to the right of the donut stand.

I flew out on a Saturday morning which seems to be a busy day for the airport because the departure lounge was very busy. There is a single set of lavatories for which a long queue had built up and one small café which was also struggling to cope with a long queue. Incidentally this is the only place where you may buy bottles of water or soft drinks as the only shops are two large duty free outlets.It was possible to find a seat and large windows overlooking the runway and apron provided a welcome distraction when waiting to board.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Terminal 1 is a consequence of the French politicians' love for ""contemporary"" - obsolete architecture and completely atrocious for passengers. Terminal 2 ABCD are too small badly designed no air- con and in all Paris airports the common point is the huge queue at passport control where you are lucky if 2 cops are there to control 3 or 4 long-haul flights ! which is a disgrace compared even to some Middle-East countries. Other common points are dirtiness and lack of toilets lack of moving sidewalks. This time flew from 2F which is slightly better more modern more space more available seats. Nevertheless was shocked to discover there is no lift to take you to departure level so manage with your suitcase in escalators - and no air- conditioning in the waiting rooms which is an issue because although in this one the ceilings are very high the architect has put windows everywhere.. A last word of advice for foreign travellers if your ticket read 2G be aware that this is a (bad) joke this is a totally different terminal and you need a 15 mn bus shuttle to go there after having left your rental car at 2 E/F.

Have 4 hours to kill but not too many food options available and we ended up in McDonald's as this seems the most familiar choice. As an Asian would prefer to have Asian food available at the Airport but there seems no choice for this except for a sushi place which is very crowded at that time. The place looks like a mess due to the renovation and we have to walk quite far via a narrow and dark corridor to a more decent area for transit (the Holland Boulevard) to do some last minute duty free shopping. Hopefully the renovation will make Schiphol one of the world's best again.

brisbane-airport,/airport-reviews/brisbane-airport,Brisbane Airport customer review,R Bayliss,Australia,2012-10-09,Being a BNE local I use domestic frequently. Always a stress-free easy check-in security staff friendly enough pretty basic shopping/eating/drinking airside but decent enough if you're only waiting half an hour for a flight. Usually I catch the Airtrain which now running times have been extended is very convenient if travelling alone. Cheaper and easier to get a cab if there's 2 or more though. International is nothing special Again easy check-in clean friendly staff but for shopping/dining one would expect a bit more to impress o/s visitors. Last flight in a few weeks ago has been better than last year. Customs staff are much friendlier and it was much quicker. However baggage claim area is in desperate need of an update has the feel of a 90's office with cheap carpet and fluoro lighting. BNE has massive potential to serve as int'l gateway to Aus for Asia especially with the shabby state of SYD and MEL just needs that extra Wow! factor that all Aussie airports seem to lack. My advice?

The cleaning machines were strangely comforting and while the airport doesn't have too many overnight dwellers it could do with a snack/coffee bar that is open all night. Everything else was fine it could just use either a lounge (I had heard of one but I think this was just airside) or some double layer entry points (to limit heat loss) or some heating just for the few months that Macau may need it. Perhaps the airport could work with some of the nearby hotels/casinos to accommodate transit passengers - that would make for a more memorable night than just freezing on an airport seat!

After all the stinging criticism of the Departures Immigration problems when I departed 2 weeks ago I discovered these have been partly solved with more staff and the introduction of a snake queue system. So having seen that this works why is it that the management of this airport still insist on no snake system at Arrivals? Worst of all last night was the almost complete absence of public taxis at 01.00 am. The queue for these snaked right back into the building. Trying then to get back up to Arrivals level to take one of the notoriously expensive Airport Limousine Taxis I discovered that despite an abundance of escalators and moving walkways you can not get back up! Either they are deliberately switched off or there is a guard on duty who will not permit you to access them! There are also lifts but even these will not permit access to the Arrivals level!

The baggage is often available as soon as you arrive after a short walk from the plane. Quite often I've been outside the airport within ten minutes of the flight touching down. On departures the security queue and process can be a little tedious if there are a few flights departing at about the same time and there's only the minimum of facilities in the departure lounge (although there is free wi-fi). The car park is a bit more expensive than it should be; if you're away for a weekend it seems very pricey (currently the first day costs £11.50 but £3.50 thereafter).

melbourne-airport,/airport-reviews/melbourne-airport,Melbourne Airport customer review,Adrian Jenkins,New Zealand,2012-08-30,On a trip from Auckland to Perth on Qantas in July with my 75 year old parents we chose to transit through Melbourne rather than Sydney as we thought it would be easier not to have to use a shuttle bus to change terminals. Unfortunately our experience of Melbourne Airport was pretty poor. On the positive side of things our baggage arrived on the conveyor belt promptly. However we were way over at Conveyor Belt 5 even though there were closer Conveyor Belts available. Exiting into the arrivals hall we followed the signs for Qantas domestic transfers. We quickly discovered that the travelator up to the Domestic departures level was not functioning and there was no marked alternative. In the end my father had to push our loaded trolley up this conveyor belt. Once we got up to Qantas departures there was no indication for where International Transfer passengers should go. Having finally sorted that out we went through security and struck the most rude abrupt security staff ever. They showed absolutely no patience for those people who take a little longer to get through security. We then had a long walk to our gate.

mumbai-airport,/airport-reviews/mumbai-airport,Mumbai Airport customer review,S Jellin,United States,2010-12-12,BOM is a disaster even in it's newer state. First problem is the lack of signs and communication for international transit passengers. You follow one sign that basically takes right outside the building where you stand and swelter in the Mumbai heat waiting to be allowed in. Secondly once you're in there are no seats in which to rest while waiting for your flight check-in desk to open. Then they have this great rule that even if you have a multiple entry visa and are travelling on the same itinerary you need to go to a special immigration office and wait while they take the longest photocopies in the world of your documentation. Then after they separate men and women in security; they put these bizzare tags on your hand luggage and stamp them. They are secured with but a string which makes they easily lost. And god help you if you are connecting to the domestic terminal in short order. The process has to be the most inefficient and uncoordinated thing I have ever seen in an international airport. Also be prepared. You will go through no less than 4-5 security screenings; no matter what you're doing in the airport. And they don't move at any other speed than slow in BOM. In terms of cleanliness I was surprised by how clean the restrooms were in the international terminal however the domestic terminal is revolting. There was even a well- fed rat that ran across the terminal floor as we sat and languished for hours with nothing to do waiting for our flight.

tromso-airport,/airport-reviews/tromso-airport,Tromso Airport customer review,B Vincent,NA,2009-02-16,Tromsø is a small but bright and comfortable airport - although the gate numbers go up to about 26 only the last 6 of these are proper airbridges. You can catch a local bus from town for 25kr unless it is a Sunday morning - then you can get the Flybussen for 55kr. Before security there is not much of interest - a few shops the 7-11 has similar price and range to stores in town. After security there is a Narvesen with almost identical food and prices to the 7-11 downstairs. There are also several other food outlets which are all very expensive. Toilets are clean enough but as far as I could tell there are only about 6 individual toilets so there can be a queue. When I visited in 2007 there were internet terminals costing 2kr per minute which I think it the most expensive I have ever seen; on my last visit in November 2008 these terminals were gone replaced by WiFi with a minimum charge of 59kr. Before signing up you have to acknowledge that it is an insecure network then pass all your credit card details including the security code over the network!

accra-kotoka-airport,/airport-reviews/accra-kotoka-airport,Accra Kotoka Airport customer review,Hans Gross,Switzerland,2013-12-23,This time it took 2 hours instead of the usual half hour for landing and immigration. The huge delay was caused first by a 'parking problem' for the aircraft second by the malfunction of 2 of the 3 luggage conveyor belts. For the return embarkation Emirates with its 300-seater had set the check-in period to from 12.30 am (instead of the usual 3.30 pm) until 5.30 pm which did not prevent a delay again of 1 hour for the take-off at 8 pm. The main annoyances of this airport have persisted over the last 10 years: Passengers may enter soaked with sweat and cannot have a shower (I go to the Landing restaurant and try to wipe myself in the toilet room). The sweating continues in the departure hall which is only half air-conditioned. Announcements can barely be understood as there is a cacophony stemming from the sound of TV's and the voices of passengers. It also remains amusing to count the number of passenger controls and checks: there are 4 by the airline and about 6 by other airport staff.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,J Rooney,United Kingdom,2011-04-03,This is a budget airport and is 50 miles away from London. Transport to and from the airport is quite easy - you can get the half-hourly coach from London Victoria bus station or the train from a wide number of stations. The pre security check in halls are big and very airy and a large number of food/drink outlets. The toilets that I used were clean and security was quick though this was at 5:30am. Also security were very helpful when I lost my boarding pass and reassured me that I would still be able to fly and they did seem very professional. Once through the security airside not as bright or airy but quite big with enough seats. The pre security bit needs more seating for passengers and in the early hours it was quite cold. I didn't like the fact that they charge for the plastic bags at security when other London airports had them for free. The gate areas need more seating and more staff cohesion - someone repeatedly opening and closing the doors to a freezing airstrip at 7 in the morning when everyone is tired is not good. The airport website indicates that the coffee shop is closed but just to be on the safe side I'd go to one of the Costa or Nero stands or wait until you are airside.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

paphos-airport,/airport-reviews/paphos-airport,Paphos Airport customer review,S Harrison,NA,2007-08-16,I'd heard that PFO on a Wednesday is a form of hell-on-earth. Seeing however is believing and it appears all that I'd been told was true. We arrived early enough for our flight to DSA such that check in queues were minimal and we managed to get airside fairly soon after our arrival. Departure lounge a joke. Inadequate number of seats meant people sitting on any usable surface - floor tables everything. Each time a flight was called people scrambled for the seats vacated by those who had gone to board. I was fortunate to secure two for my elderly grandparents who were travelling with us - how can they be expected to stand? Things got worse when departures board screen broke down so no- one had any info on gates or boarding times. When I asked an attendant she just shrugged and said to 'listen extra hard'. However it was evident by the number of final calls for individual passengers that this was causing problems. Finally our flight was called and we were put in a holding area to catch a bus to the plane. At first it seemed we would only be there a few moments but in the end we were there for about half an hour with no AC and not enough seats to go around. Given that this is Cyprus's second international airport it is nothing short of a disaster.

geneva-airport,/airport-reviews/geneva-airport,Geneva Airport customer review,Jack O'Brien,NA,2007-05-07,I am a frequent traveller to Geneva Airport. I was dissapointed with the lack of organisation that went into baggage collection. Those of you who have been there will know that there are 7 or 8 baggage collection carousels and most of them are in use at the one time. If you take skis or snowboards away with you there is a total lack of organisation when you try to reclaim these items at the airport. There is always a rugby scrum/free for all when you try an collect your items. Most of the items after being taken off the aircraft are just left on the floor in the middle of the room with the carousels in (which is not very big as it is) and with the floor space being taken up by skis and snowboards there is never any room to move. There is also a significant absence of baggage trolleys available and usually these are not available for quite some time after you leave the plane which causes a lot of frustration and inconvenience especially for those who take small children away with them. When flying out fromt he airport on the return journey I found the experience slightly more pleasant than when I was arriving. Although i would say that a little more thought could have gone in to naming and numbering of the gates. There is a very complicated system of numbers and letters which results in a very large hike round the airport just to find the correct gate. Apart fromt this lack of organisation the airport has lots of duty free shops selling a range of items and plenty of bars and restaurants. I would describe the overall service provided as fair.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There is absolutely no need for their behaviour. I boarded my plane and went on holiday. On the return journey coming through Malaga I paid particular attention to their manner of dealing with their customers. They behaved beautifully. No one was shouted at or humiliated.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Geoffrey McNab,United Kingdom,2009-05-31,Not having travelled via Luton for some time I was pleasantly surprised at the improvements. It is worth noting the Â£12.50 single rail fare from St. Pancras station in London is valid on either the First Capital Trains (slower) or the East Midland Trains (faster) which depart from the same level as the Eurostar trains. I took an East Midlands train which went non-stop to Luton Parkway where I stepped onto a shuttle bus and was stepping into the airport departures area a mere thirty minutes after leaving St. Pancras! With hand luggage only I already had my Easyjet boarding pass printed and therefore avoided the queues at check-in where the desks do not open until two hours before the flight. A tip for travelers is the M&S Food to Go situated close to the arrivals area if you want to eat well at prices lower than the various food outlets. All round the airport are machines encouraging you to buy a Priority Security pass for Â£3. Perhaps at a very busy period this might be worth it but when I went up to security there were only four people in front of me and I was through the first check in a flash. There were several scanners in use and the only two people in front of me for the one I was directed to and I was soon through the system. Airside seems a great improvement on the old airport as I remember it. I suspect at busy times there would not be enough seating but on this occasion I had no problems finding a seat in between walking about and exploring the shops. The departure screens are rather small and I suspect some people with visual impairment might find them difficult to read. Like other airports passengers are requested to wait in the lounge and only go to the gate when the number appears on the screen. Be warned the walk from the departure lounge to Gate Fifteen is quite a hike! All in all it was a surprisingly pleasant passage through the airport and I would certainly consider using Luton again.,NA,NA,NA,4,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

It's big impressive and airy but there are still irritating niggles. On arrival we needed to go up to departures level to access our bus but couldn't find any way to do so apart from squeezing through barriers. We then unknowingly walked past the bus point because the signage was not displayed for passengers emerging from the terminal. We were glad that our car hire collection point was off-site as the area outside the airport was very congested. On our return we found Security somewhat disorganised. There was something of a melee to secure trays and at our security gate one harassed female agent seemed to be trying to do everything: call passengers through check the detector and frisk selected individuals whilst at the same time trying to call to a colleague to come and help. We found it very difficult to hear announcements made at the gates. This time we were departing from Area C and our flight to Liverpool was announced early: all we heard was something about Liverpool so we followed others who started moving to join a queue.

calgary-airport,/airport-reviews/calgary-airport,Calgary Airport customer review,S Katt,Canada,2014-07-17,While the US-Transborder areas are atrocious for food options and lounges the airport as a whole is not bad. Checking in is easy (usually) and is made easier if you are elite security has long queues through the transborder checkpoint but this is resolved by using the NEXUS lane (if you have one) (it is a great investment) and that brings me to Customs and Immigration. The CBSA hall is quite a trek from your arrival gate but it isn't as bad as LHR T2. Once at the checkpoint the officers are polite and if you have NEXUS you can be out of customs in 2 mins. Going through US CBP on the way to the US takes a bit longer though agents are generally polite and expedient. Back to NEXUS (there's a theme forming here). If you apply and get accepted you also get Global Entry benefits for US CBP so if you have it US CBP is also 2 mins. Sorry for skipping around here but the gate area for domestic flights (Concourses A and D) is big enough to find something to eat and somewhere to eat it and also has Lounges if you are so inclined. Transborder; (Concourse C) Is another story. It has very limited food options due to the opening and closing of gates for transborder traffic (if you've travelled through YYC you know what I mean) restrooms are few and far between and there is only one (paid entry) lounge which is nice for getting to the airport early but it is really not worth it. I guess a suitable end to this review is Baggage and well the few times I have checked a bag at YYC it has been about a 5-15 min wait domestically and 30-45 mins for international arrivals.

Late arriving connection flights are a standard issue in today's travel world but to find no transit facility and an hour-long immigration queue when you only have an hour left to departure following the delay is beyond frustration. Why does an airport that has so many transit passengers not provide a transit facility. Many people on our incoming flight from Grenada/Tobago missed their connections and we only caught ours due to persistent nagging of the Information Desk staff one of whom was charming the other disinterested and the goodwill of Virgin Atlantic possibly enhanced by the fact that we had checked in online from Grenada in the morning. I will recommend to everyone I meet that they do not travel to/via Barbados in future. I can understand congestion and extenuating circumstances but the complete lack of interest from the majority of staff was incomprehensible and totally adverse to tourist relations.

The infrastructure is excellent, the hallways vast, the planes on time. Everything runs with great efficiency. But Seoul destroys the experience with a nightmarish transfer desk. Even in the early hours of the morning there are hundreds and hundreds of travellers crowded into a vast coral of zig zagging lanes that go up to another security gate. There is no special line for frequent travelers, business class, the elderly or small children. Everyone is throw into the cauldron and it is dreadful. This kind of senseless blockade increases consumer anxiety as they try desperately to make a connecting gate. They took all my luggage apart and made me repack for no good reason.

Seoul Incheon is a really big airport and I finally understood why it wins so many awards. You don't need to leave Incheon to experience the culture of South Korea as the airport has many cultural centers. The airport also has many areas for relaxing too with many sleeping chairs and complimentary showers along with saunas. Aviation enthusiasts can spot departing and arriving planes from both runways located at either end of the terminal. The only drawback is that the satellite terminal that houses all international airlines is inaccessible to passengers who do not have departing flights there however the retail stores are the same as the contact pier that houses Korean Air and Asiana Airlines.

luxor-airport,/airport-reviews/luxor-airport,Luxor Airport customer review,J Catherall,NA,2008-06-20,"When we arrived at Luxor airport & got off the coach all I can say was what appeared like a pack of wolves were waiting to 'help' with bags. Now I'm a 6ft 17.5 stone bloke so am well capable but even despite this I ended up almost having to wrestle my bag away from a very eager 'helper' who all the time was whispering under his breath ""drink please"" interspersed with ""something"". It appeared as if there was a supervisor or someone that they didn't want to hear their 'requests' - if so - they were spectacularly unsuccessful in stamping out this sort of over-aggressive 'help'. Having managed to wrestle free of the initial wave of 'helpers' & get inside the building once again there was another 'helper' to lift bags onto the x-ray belt. This time however as he didn't have any English phrases apparently the 'helper' was saying something in Egyptian (again whispering) while showing me an Egyptian 10 Pound note folded in the palm of his hand as a 'prompt.' Having now managed to get through these 2 levels of 'assistance' there was of course another 'helper' at the other end of the x-ray machine who was equally 'helpful' in taking the bag off the belt & similarly looking for money! Next up was the check-in desk itself & yes - you have guessed it - there was yet another 'helper' at the head of the queue to again lift the bag onto the check-in conveyor. There is a sign on display at the desk stating that all baggage 'assistance' was free of charge but this was clearly not having any effect on the various 'helpers' that have to be negotiated/overcome. Finally - naturally there is the customary 'help' in the toilets where even though I am at 46 yrs of age well capable of washing & drying my hands I was presented with some toilet paper with the by now customary demand for money.

centrair-nagoya-airport,/airport-reviews/centrair-nagoya-airport,Centrair Nagoya Airport customer review,Leigh Wighton,NA,2006-08-13,The new Centrair airport is a vast improvement on the old Komaki airport which had all the charm of a bus-stop. However it's newness seems to be the only thing it has over the previous airport. It's design is almost exactly the same as Komaki's. The check-in and arrival areas are not that much bigger than Komaki's except there is a small shopping area and foodcourt upstairs. The shops in this area tend to be mostly high-end brand name vendors and the foodcourt is so small you can hardly ever get a seat there. In fact seating seems to be an issue in centrair. In the check-in area also there really aren't that many places to sit down and wait. This is different when you proceed through passport control and enter the departure area. It's huge and spacious. A lot of room here which is nice but it's also very empty. There are very few places to get food drinks or duty-free shopping. I had the over-all impression that perhaps the departure area of centrair is a bit too big. I was there during the christmas/new-year period yet there were hardly any flights leaving. Overall centrair is a good clean and spacious(on the departure side) airport. No problems with check-in arrival and baggage claim. It still feels a bit utilitarian though. Despite being new it's only a slight improvement. After using Komaki several times I was looking forward to a new and improved Nagoya airport. Centrair is an improvement but not much of one I'm afraid. I've never used Kansai yet but all the airports I've used in Japan to date tend to be no more than a place to check-in and simply just wait for your flight. Nothing more nothing less.

The bags were sealed before we had even paid for the rum so there was no chance to put the receipt inside assuming that is the ticket they were referring to.

I have been in and out of this airport at least 25 times since it opened in 1974. I can remember when terminal 1 (the oldest) was state of the art. It was never intended to handle the number of passengers now shoved thru it. The entire facility has been gradually going downhill for at least 15 years, but my most recent transit will be my last. From now on, I'll fly to London and take the train. June 6, I arrived via TGV station in terminal 2. Theoretically, I could have arrived early enough to have plenty of time to catch my flight, if only UA were still in terminal 2. It is not, and the queues in terminal one are unbelievably long. I knew I wanted to get to the Ibis hotel near terminal three. The signage in terminal 2 is woefully inadequate. I finally asked the SNCF information people where the shuttle was. I figured chaos would ensue when I learned that United had moved into terminal 1, so I rode the shuttle around to scope it out. I found a United information employee. She told me that I ""only needed"" to get to the airport 2.5 hours early. Fortunately, I did not believe her. I then backtracked from terminal 1 two stops to terminal 3. Again signage was lacking. I finally went outside, and saw the sign for the Ibis. June 7. Snaked my way back to terminal 3, then shuttle train to terminal 1. I arrived 4 hours early, along with at least 150 others for my flight. There are no facilities: No water, no bathrooms, no food, no chairs. Just an endless line from which everyone on my flight was eventually separated and put into a second line, unmoving, and standing, so the 5 agents assigned to tourist class could process the 200 or more souls on the flight before mine. The only water was at the Starbucks, 7€ a bottle. We all stood in line for 3 hours, just to check in and drop bags. Quick march to customs and immigration. I seem to remember a tangle of moving sidewalks. There were 300 people in line, and I think 7 open windows, but 4 were for EU passport holders. Some UA personnel took pity on us and started handing out bottled water. Quick march to security, where there were only about 50 people in line ahead of me. There were only two lines. By the time I was screened, my plane technically had already left. Very quick march to the gate. More standing. No chairs. United divides us into several boarding groups, depending on how much you paid, but once you get to the gate, everyone in bucket class waits together, mostly standing.

The information provided and signs to follow are ludicrous. I have never yet twigged despite multiple attempts in the past 3 years.

If Emirates business passenger you can get your boarding card from their lounge but impossible to find airline lounges. On arrival from abroad and business passenger walk past the customs and immigration signs immediately afterwards there are the CIP gates which you should use saving lots of queues and time. If making a domestic flight be wary of the people who ask where you are going prior to security.

I noticed on my last trip in that some passengers appeared to be unaware of the requirement and had to be corralled back to get their bags checked.

I flew in through this airport (NAIA-1) in late April from LAX via ICN on Asiana Airlines. I arrived at around 10.45pm. Lines were an unorganized mess! People were just trying to push through to get to immigration (especially the foreign passport line). It took me about 45 minutes to pass through. Once I got in the immigration officer didn't even bother to talk to me or ask me how long my stay was he just took my passport and stamped it. Baggage claim took forever. I had to wait 30-40 minutes to get my luggage. Apparently this terminal doesn't have enough baggage carousels to handle all the traffic! Flying out was a similar experience. Arrived at the airport at 9.30 for a 12.30pm departure. Getting inside the terminal was a big confusing mess. There were several lines that seems to lead nowhere outside the loading zone. Once you get in you go through an unnecessary baggage scanning process that could have been done elsewhere. After check-in you'll have to pay the travel tax terminal fees and go through immigration. All of these were done in different locations! It's really inefficient. Then you go through another security layer. Restaurants inside the terminal were not good.

We arrived on a South African Airways flight from Johannesburg in the afternoon. We were funnelled into immigration and customs area which has no air conditioning in this hot and humid city. Foreigners gathered around the glass booths where officials came out took your passport and visa payment then disappeared inside. The process took about an hour meanwhile our luggage had been taken off the conveyer belt and put aside unguarded in a hallway. When you exit the terminal you are hounded by taxi drivers asking outrageous prices. When we arrived to fly out our Precision Air flight had broken down in Zanzibar and was delayed. However they gave few details on when it was expected to resume. It was a very uncaring attitude by the check-in staff. We were delayed 3 hours and were caught off guard by the sudden (and muffled) announcement that it was now boarding. The departure lounge has some stores but they are limited.

london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,Yotsanan Areemitr,United Kingdom,2013-07-30,Recently used Gatwick to travel to Bangkok via Dubai with Emirates and I have to say I couldn't believe how nice it was compared to horrible old Heathrow! Check-in was straightforward and the North terminal wasn't crowded at all. There was ample space and it was very clean! Its also well sign-posted - I had to use the shuttle to get from the South to the North terminal and I haven't used Gatwick in a long time so was a little anxious about where everything was but turns out everything was dead simple to find! Security was security and staff weren't that friendly but I wasn't there for more than 5 minutes so no worries there. Departure lounge is a little disappointing as it didn't have as many shops and restaurants as I had anticipated but as an airport that offers mainly European routes you can't really expect it to be like Heathrow. Though saying that I think they are planning on adding more shops and restaurants. Departure gate took forever to appear on screen but once it was there it was a fairly short walk to it from the departure lounge and then after 10 mins at gate we were told to board the plane which was brilliant as I wanted to just sit back and relax. On the way back to Gatwick - passport queues were horrendous but they were moving steadily rather than being a complete stand still so was through in about half an hour. Overall very happy with the experience at Gatwick and would definitely recommend it! Wish it'd fly to more destinations outside Europe though as I'd much prefer it to Heathrow!,NA,NA,NA,8,3,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Firstly living in Norwich it’s just a Taxi ride and with check in on most flights even international are only a 1hour and last check in 25mins what a saving on time. (Compared to a 2-3 hours drive and 3 hour check in) It is a lovely small airport but with all the usual facilities (bars food halls shopping car hire money exchange). The staff always seems to be very friendly helpful and flexible but then you can where passengers numbers are on smaller size. It also has a fairly high security outlook as they having taking photo’s at customs for years. Having KLM flying to Amsterdam 5 times a day we can get flights anywhere to the world anytime. They now have also got two new low cost airlines now starting domestic and international flights.

Also the shuttle buses to the rental cars are a severe time- drain. The terminals are small enough that there should only be one pick-up point per terminal to speed things up (rather than 2 per terminal).

The airport lounges are OK too if you are frequent flyer. However the airport is not equipped for all weather flights apparently the runway is too short so delays or cancellations due to weather (a little bit of fog) occur as happened the only 2 times I visited and I understand this is not infrequent. A taxi driver who took me to a hotel (which I paid for myself) told me that when delays occur all the local hotels are full so I had to find a hotel way out of Aberdeen. The positive side for taxi drivers is that the one who took me said he'd had a passenger who was so desperate to get to Heathrow he paid Â£1000 (yes one thousand GBP) to get there. They staff at BA with whom I'd flown are unable to cope with queues very long at desks. Its more like a third world airport in that respect.

There is not enough waiting room. Boarding is actually a two stage process where there is not enough space to queue and not enough room while you wait to walk to your plane. The airport completely lacks any useful concept of how to handle a significant amount of people. I'm not talking of a minor capacity issue during peak times. I'm talking about 20 seats for 200 people who have to wait hours! In addition to these fundamental issues the airport is dirty everywhere. It's ugly.

(2) Security can be very time-consuming, especially and oddly on weekend mornings. Allow plenty of time. (3) While the UK is (still) in the EU, it is not a Schengen country. This means you will have to go through Immigration in the country of your end destination. Give yourself plenty of time in Terminal 5, and enjoy it.

We were 6th in the queue and it took us 45 minutes to get checked in, then we moved to another queue to put our cases through and then another queue to go through security. In total it took us 1 hour 35 mins to get through to the departure lounge. Then we had to check in at the gate. Not sure why as we then had to sit down for another hour. I thought (maybe) that we would then get through the departure gate quicker but no we had to queue again and check in again before going through. Not sure of the purpose of the double check-in?

The domestic terminal although a well designed building can be stretched for capacity at peak times. QANTAS check in although automated still lacks enough staff at peak times with the queue winding out the doors. Security checks are very quick and thorough with polite staff. A travelator on the Qantas pier like on the Virgin one is a must. Baggage collection is fairly quick (unlike Melbourne). The International terminal is again stretched at peak times both departing and arriving. Again QANTAS check in is inadequate where even Club check in takes far to long. Security is again fast and efficient but Customs both inbound and outbound seem to be stretched to the limit of their capabilities even with all counters and personel working. Transport to and from BNE is it's biggest downfall. Very farsighted in developing a rail link but let down by poor frequency the Airtrain even though very heavily marketed is not an attractive option for frequent travellers. I have used the service many times and it is fast reliable comfortable and not too expensive when compared to comparable services in other countries. The only problem is that it ceases operation far to early in the evening for when I'm returning. If you don't make it easy for people to use it they won't!

I avoid coming to India as much as possible just because of the experience at the airport coming back. The security staff think that the airport is a prison and not a service. The first time I assumed since my airline allowed me to have my boarding pass on my phone/email that I could print it out at the check in or service counters. This is a big mistake as some people have already said. Armed guards will not allow you into the airport without this piece of paper. You can print in an office next to the airport if you have cash. Second time I learned that even with a printed boarding pass it is not enough. If you have no luggage (just hand luggage) you still need to queue for another boarding pass. Both situations could have been avoided by clear communication at time of checking in or at the airport. Leave plenty of time for queuing. You will queue to get into the airport to get your boarding pass to get through passport check to get through security military-style to get through security airline-style oh and there is one final check at the gate of the plane. On Friday I saw somebody refused past that check because there laptop bag had a security tag but no security stamp. I'm not opposed to queuing but the hostility is incredible and the process is slow. I have a lasting memory of seeing 3 booths out of 10 occupied with long queues. One of these the guy was having a nap with his legs on the desk.

The spa has now closed for at least 4 months no opening date given. In addition on the last 3 domestic flights into Helsinki I have experienced poor luggage delivery times and the luggage service desk was worse than useless statements like 'your luggage is back there I think' 'my colleague should know but he is not here today' annoy and frustrate and a lack of tannoy communication shows an immaturity and lack of service skills.

glasgow-prestwick-airport,/airport-reviews/glasgow-prestwick-airport,Glasgow Prestwick Airport customer review,N Fotheringill,NA,2004-06-10,Prestwick is my 'local' airport and I use it more than any other. The terminal building was built in the sixties and remained chronically underused for many years. Government interference stated that all of Scotland's transatlantic flights should land at Prestwick and not surprisingly few airlines took them up on the offer. This restriction was removed in the early nineties and it seemed as though Prestwick might be closed for ever. However with new owners touting for buisness Ryanair entered the scene and the airport has not looked back. Plenty of money has been spent in making the airport a viable alternative to the much more handily placed Glasgow International. Firstly a rail station was built on site giving passengers two trains to central Glasgow per hour. Car parks were expanded whilst internally a number of changes were made. Overall though the terminal is showing its age and such things as check-in have a distinctly low-tech feel to them. However the staff are courteous and the queues move quickly. Groundside catering has improved lately though the grandly named 'Graceland' bar (Prestwick is the only place in Britain where Elvis Presley is known to have set foot) has gone. Airside is an odd experience. You a channeled through the duty free shop (everything except booze and tobacco available to all passengers) to the waiting area which is below the level of the aircraft stands. It can get a bit crowded in here and very messy if a number of flights are scheduled at the same time. As most flights are with Ryanair the rush for unreserved seating leads to long queues through the one door that leads to the aircraft gates. Ryanair are supposed to have a priority system for boarding but no one pays the slightest bit of notice to it. Once through the door you walk to the appropriate gate underground emerging up the stairs on the tarmac for a short walk to the aircraft. On your return another walk brings you to the bagage reclaim which can be either very quick indeed or annoyingly slow depending on your luck. The worst part of the experience is paying the car parking fees which are huge. Book in advance if you can or better still use the train. Overall though Prestwick is not a bad airport to use and access will be much better next year when the road to Glasgow is upgraded to motorway standard.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I can only agree with most of them. When I passed through the airport was not so busy (31st December) and still security was slow and inefficient. The most unimpressive factor were the pay machines in several places for ""Fast Track"" security. There were machines before you go through security as you go in to the hall and just before the lines in case when you arrive you are horrified by the queues and can then pay the extra UK Stg 3 for the fast line. I think that extra optional charge for security is shocking. In my opinion that just encourages inefficiency in the main queue so they can make more money. What will they do if everyone pays the Stg 3? Quickly add more security lanes?",NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
oslo-airport,/airport-reviews/oslo-airport,Oslo Airport customer review,Hans Nederpel,Netherlands,2014-08-18,My usual hub for travelling business or private. I like the departure hall it is spacious and the swing of the Airport has become very crowded during peak season resulting in lack of seats insufficient amount of restrooms and long queues everywhere. It is also very likely to get in serious trouble when you have a transfer from an incoming international to a domestic flight. Travelers are subject to redundant procedures like collecting your luggage from the carousel then going through customs and go through the check in procedure again in the departure hall in a long queue together with new and other transit passengers while you already have your boarding pass and your luggage is correctly labelled. Finally you have to go through security again. Like authorities usually act many years too late it seems there is now a decision to abandon these crazy procedures in 2015. In my case last year I had to wait a long time for my luggage then had to run to the departure hall and look for an understanding staff member to assist in bypassing the queue for check in. That way I was just in time to catch my connecting flight. This year I was not so lucky when the luggage handling system was down due to a thunderstorm for the rest of the day. I finally arrived in the departure hall with my luggage where thousands of people were waiting not knowing what to do. The announcements by the pubic address system were only an apology for the inconvenience which was of no use at all instead of giving a clear explanation about the workaround implemented. To give instructions for dropping the luggage for your departing flight the staff member who could yell most loudly was selected. Of course these messages were missed by many people. Finally I ended up for hours in a queue of hundreds of people in front of the service desk to get my missed flight rescheduled and was lucky to reach my destination the same day and got possession of my luggage 4 days later. Definitely an airport to avoid during peak season when you have a connection to make. Hopefully things get better in 2015.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,T Whittington,Netherlands,2013-12-31,I don't like Dubai Airport too much. During a stop-over you are trying to kill time perhaps score a bite in one of the overcrowded food places. Often these places are full with litter as the staff cannot keep pace with the plethora of visitors. In general too few places to sit kill time and even for airport standards over priced. And besides shopping for ostentatious items there's very little quality in terms of entertainment to be found at that airport. But it gets even worse when you enter Dubai.

Then a long walk through endless stairways escalators walkways and more escalators etc. to security. Security screening was very busy as there were a lot of passengers during the morning rush hour at FRA. Then more walking escalators down to a long tunnel followed by more escalators staircases etc. Then one has to struggle to find one's gate hoping that while navigating the above the airline has not changed the gate. I've seen worst than FRA but I've also seen better.

Both the International and Domestic terminals are messy. Not clean and I am sure many wouldn't like to use the rest rooms. There are not too many options in the terminal for restaurants or bars or shopping.

klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,/airport-reviews/klia-kuala-lumpur-airport,KLIA Kuala Lumpur Airport customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,2014-10-28,"Flew recently with Malaysian from Bangkok to Kinabalu and back via Kuala Lumpur. The waiting times for both connections were quite bad with 9 hours on my way there and the same on my return. I have always had good or above average experiences with KLIA1 however my flights were always during the day. My last connection was with the same airline from Bangkok to Sydney and all went well without a hitch. My loudest criticism and a shame to KLIA's managers is the lack of support for ""real late night"" travelers. I arrived to KUL from Kota Kinabalu 2.20am (flight to Bangkok 9.10am) and was completely relaxed even if I found information regarding transportation non existent for anyone landing after 1.30am! Sama Sama express in the airside has more or less acceptable rates for a 6 hours nap but showed no availability online. Checking the reception I discover that the place is half empty and many rooms are vacant but requested the walk in rate close to a 100USD for 5 hours instead of the 50-60 online average. The other Sama hotel outside in the public zone requests a laughable high rate. This all was of no problem as KLIA2 (Low cost terminal) has been rebuild with a huge mall adjacent and the Kliaexpress train stops there and has 2 very reasonably priced hotels. However sadly last train service is midnight or 00.30. Kuala Lumpur airport around 2am and after is a sad sight. Many passengers sleeping where they can on the floor or benches. A gang (cannot think of a better name) of taxi drivers who ask 50 ringits (16USD) for the short drive to the other terminal. No shuttle bus to KLIA2 until 6.30 and all information simply pushed me towards the taxi drivers. Why is KLIA1 so inattentive and dismissive of passengers after midnight? If they offer their services to airlines landing that time then they have the responsibility of offering a shuttle to KLIA2 as many wanted to go there either to catch a flight or use hotel services. I felt total disregards as well as ambivalence towards me and many of my fellow passengers who were in the same situation. Otherwise clean food venues alright and prices manageable.",NA,NA,NA,2,5,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

There is a general shortage of restaurants and bars and seating is limited at those available. Shopping is also limited and expensive.

As a US Citizen with a US resident husband I was able to go through the same line and now they have this bad system where residents have to go in the same line with visitors. Talk about inefficiency. This airport needs a better Operations Management Chief and these government employees that are being paid with our taxpayer dollars need to be put to work.

Eating outlets are poor with the most sullen staff even when you are friendly to them and speak Italian. The coffee tasted disgusting. They must be very unhappy in their work. Wait times for luggage to come through are unbelievable even when it is quiet it can take an hour for the first cases to appear. This airport has no sense of pride. Queues at check in are very long they just can't cope with more than two flights! Worst of all are the cattle buses - they call you to the gate then squeeze you into the shuttle leaving a packed bus in sweltering heat for 15 or more minutes before one of the many drivers just standing about deigns to drive it.

There are no car rental staff to greet you on arrival we had to park our car in a different companies bay and go to the desk in the arrivals - totally chaotic. Ultimately this led to us missing our flight despite having arrived 90 minutes before departure. Facilities for passengers travelling with young children are limited; the self-service cafeteria on the 1st floor has a small pay area for kids; access to wi-fi (needed to re-book flights) is only possible if you already had pre-paid access there are fixed coin-operated internet terminals in the main concourse but these are pretty useless. To cap it all having taken the lift with our pushchair trolley loaded with bags 2 children the lift was broken when we wanted to go back to the ground floor - only option stairs - not a good experience!

buffalo-airport,/airport-reviews/buffalo-airport,Buffalo Airport customer review,Martin Keenan,NA,2007-02-09,Like some of the other reviewers here I'm a Canadian that uses BUF as an alternative to Toronto Pearson International. The reason is simple - - for flights within the United States it's vastly cheaper to fly from Buffalo -- On one occasion recently I was able to make a flight out of Buffalo for literally half what it would have cost from Toronto (all taxes included). Two significant reasons why Buffalo is cheaper -- Firstly Pearson charges possibly the highest landing fees in the world and second the United States TSA charges higher security fees for trans-border versus U.S. domestic flights. One review of Buffalo Airport complained about it being hard to fly anywhere direct from Buffalo but I suspect that most airports are like that these days. With one connection you can get to most places from Buffalo. My one issue with the airport is that it was designed in the pre-9/11 era and nearly all the airport facilities (stores restaurants etc.) are in the secure area so there isn't much to do for people waiting for arriving flights.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

After the entry I should have shown my ticket although flying ticketless. I explained them that now most flights are ticketless hence the control unnecessary. At check-in I got a boarding card indicating that I should go to the gate (an uncomfortable place) at 21h30 although the flight was to be at 23h30. At 22h30 I was able to hear an announcement telling to go to the gate 2 (the visual information system did not work). There was a long queu already waiting so I went back to the hall. The next message heard was that another flight announced for gate 2 was redirected to gate 1. So a flock of people walked away and I went to the gate once more without having to wait for the entry control. I was asked for the ticket and the same dialogue began as before. They said I could not fly unless I would show a ticket. In order to show what they meant they order another passenger to show 'a ticket'. It was a flight confirmation on a shabby piece of fax paper. I had left the confirmation in the checked-in baggage but due to a lucky incident I found a preliminary confirmation in my handbag which was accepted. At departure time passengers were still coming in with up to 3 handbags and gigantic suit cases and the flight took with 1 hour of delay. Apparently they had been accepted although too late.

islamabad-airport,/airport-reviews/islamabad-airport,Islamabad Airport customer review,N Lazaredes,NA,2005-11-30,This is one of the most irritating airports I have ever been for a capital city gateway. Arrivals on an emirates flight from Dubai was efficient albeit using buses to the terminal followed by a slow sometimes torturous process of being checked through immigration. Each passenger seemed to take 3 minutes to process and there were over 100 people. The bag conveyer was extremely slow to progress to our bags so we had to endure the double irritation of waiting with the passengers from the flight which arrived after us until they had collected all of theirs. All of this at 2.30am. Customs was a matter of loading bags through ancient x-ray machines but we were waved through to the green channel. Outside was bedlam but with people to greet us we felt better for having survived the enduring entry process inside the airport. On Departures first comes the security check as soon as you enter. These guys don't have much of a sense of humour. Then you are allowed to check in. After this you through 2 security checkpoints before you reach the transit lounge. Expect these checks to be intensive. The departure lounge is barren - a lonely shop sits in a corner calling itself duty free but has all sorts of odd bits and pieces inside that it looks like more of a quaint village shop or a stall at a school fete. Passengers are expected to sit for two hours in this dismal hall but at least there is a tea and sandwich lady who comes around to sell you something to eat and drink. After this stint in the Islamabad isolation cell passengers are herded once again onto badly air conditioned buses for the trip to the plane. You certainly know that you are alive again once you are on board - it was a different world.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

This situation continued over the several hours we eventually spent queuing at check-in over the next 20 hours. No organisation skills at all. Also as might be expected in Switzerland all food and shop prices were astronomically high (and it's not because you're paying for quality - €20 for a cheeseburger meal at Burger King for example!).

Another wait on tarmac as we had to allow passengers boarding another flight to cross in front of our exit pathway. Huge queue at a standstill before we could even enter terminal which then moved at snails pace through overcrowded duty free shop area before reaching customs area which offers only 3 electronic booths for e-entry. A cavernous arrivals hall awaited filled totally with passengers attempting to retrieve luggage from the carousal and then join a line? Hard to tell really as there was absolutely no direction given by airport staff or airport signage. Customs officers appeared calm and we exited quickly once we reached the aforementioned exit point.

We arrived close to the entry point of the terminal but were taken by bus (1 min ride) to be offloaded in a complete chaos in between the suitcases that were loaded onto the luggage belts. The terminal building is very old and low ceilings. Only good thing was the proximity of the buses to Milan Centre right outside the Arrivals. Departure was even worse. We were 2.5 hours before departure of our flight. Again the building is old very low poor maintained and does not seems to have air-conditioning (it was 28 degrees outside). Queues for luggage drop were huge. Luckily (as a result?) the queue for security was short. Funny thing is the maze you need to go through to reach security - they do not allow shortcuts even when there is no queue. The departure lounge is just terrible. Downstairs you feel like sitting in a basement upstairs is slightly better. There is a huge shortage of seating there are plenty of shops but only limited catering.

Flight out was fine using night before check in although £6 for parking a mere 30 mins to drop off the cases is laughable. Return was appalling.

Having been in London for 3 years I was shocked but the lack of forethought that had gone into the redesign of the area. Signs did not give accurate indications of where to stand particularly when there were crowds doors opens into queues the microchip scanning only works 50 percent of the time and seemed to have been designed by someone who assumed only 4 or 5 people would be using the service at one time. Staff couldn't care less that the scanning area was ineffective and that people were wandering around looking for assistance when the automatic machine wouldn't allow them to pass through. After queuing for the auto machines I was told the queue for assistance I then had to join wouldn't take long. Having seen the people in the standard queue who exited the plane with me leave the customs area I then had to stay for another 15 minutes. When I got to the front of the queue there was no apology or explanation for the delay or malfunction of the equipment in fact the woman was chatting to the other woman next to her about her weekend. Se was rude and when I didn't utter a word when my passport was handed back she commented to her friend that I wasn't very happy in a sarcastic tone. Out in the baggage collection the same issue with snaking queues and lack of movement was evident. The entire design seemed to be based on creating collisions with no forethought to the fact that people had to push huge trolleys throw queues of people with huge trolleys.

The facilities have changed little since soviet times and are just too small. In arrivals there was only one luggage-belt. Some thugs monopolized the trollies and demanded money from foreigners who wanted to use them. Unruly taxi drivers even pushed their way into the arrivals hall looking for prey (foreigners). Departure was even worse. The departure hall is much bigger and supposedly better organized but still we had a very unpleasant time there. First of all most flights seem to leave very early in the morning (around 5 AM) which is already inconvenient. Secondly the check-in of several flights at the same time causes a lot of confusion. Staff works extremely slow and broad shouldered types simply push their way up the lines while people behind you gladly try to push you aside. The guards in the hall are uninterested in this and do not take any action at all. After receiving our boarding pass we had to go upstairs. In spite of the sign ""passengers only"" the stairs were blocked by people saying goodbye to their loved ones. There were only 2 desks for foreign passports. Even here some unpleasant types tried to push themselves in front. People from western countries were treated politely but my wife who has a Moldovan passport and a valid residence permit for the Netherlands experienced real trouble. An extremely unfriendly female official grabbed her passport and without any explanation went into some office rudely ordering my wife to follow her. I went after her and found some officer holding my wife's passport. I demanded an explanation as well as their names and registration numbers. One good thing about Georgia's rose revolution is the fact that officials are in fact required to identify themselves when asked and that it is also possible to make a complaint against them. Luckily this helped without even looking into the passport he gave it back saying that there was "" no problem"" . I am sure that without this intervention they might have detained my wife for hours. I am deeply disappointed that officials at this airport show a smiling face to westerners while at the same time they apparently take pleasure in harrassing people from poor countries. After this intermezzo we had to go to the metal detector. There was only one working so again a huge queue had formed. This detector did not work at all - it went off for almost everybody but not for me even though I was carrying a pocket knife with me! Finally we had reached the "" departure lounge""  an extremely small area with a bar and one sad "" tax free shop"". I am a smoker myself but the fumes exhausted by visitors of the bar were even too much for me. There seemed to be no toilet at all however when looking really well (a small corridor behind the bar) you could find it. Even though Georgia produces wonderful souvenirs there was nothing except cigarettes and some alcoholic drinks in the taxfree sold by some unfriendly women spending their time chatting to each other and taking cigarette-breaks. There were 2 "" exit gates"" (not indicated by numbers). Departures were announced in unclear english (no monitors). Travellers had to walk down to ground level were busses were waiting to take them to the planes. Since these busses stand next to each other and several take-offs take place almost simultaneously this leads to confusion when people get into the wrong bus. We were really glad to have the ordeal behind us. A terrible place unworthy of this beautiful country!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Surprisingly the airport terminals were shut! The cityside has no passenger facilities - no toilets no food outlets no phone booths and no security. For a crowd of 300 about to catch the first few flights there were just 4 security guards. Terminals opened at 3am. This 'new' airport has just two outdated X-ray machines for baggage screening. Horrible queues. Airside area is equally pathetic with horrible loos. No clarity on boarding gates as there were no announcements the screens spent an unusually long time displaying information in Tamil. Additionally the design highlight of the new terminal an in-terminal garden is hardly viewable for dust on the glass curtain walls.

guadalajara-airport,/airport-reviews/guadalajara-airport,Guadalajara Airport customer review,Kwong Chang,NA,2005-08-18,"I used GDL back in January 2005 during my first trip into Mexico. I flew Mexicana Airlines and upon landing you are taken from the plane to the airport via a shuttle bus. The shuttle bus drops you off on the first level where you are immediately routed to the customs area. There are the typical long lines and wait as you are processed through customs. I was a little intimidated at first because my Spanish is lacking but the customs officer was efficient and spoke English. After you are processed you go to the ""stoplight"". There is an area where you are literally presented with a small red/green stop light sort of device and are instructed by the security personnel to press a button on the device. If it lights up green you are free to go. If it lights up red you are required to undergo further baggage search. My friend who is from Guadalajara told me about this before I went down there but seeing it really gave me a good chuckle. He also gave me a tip; give the button a good firm and long press. Usually nervous individuals will press the button quickly and so it is more likely light up red. This entire customs and ""stop-light"" area is probably no bigger than the average high school gym. Outside in the terminal lobby area there are plenty of kiosks and shops. There is also a ""taxi booth"" where you pay for your cab ride and someone will come out to help you hail a cab. Departing GDL I was very surprised and pleased with the abundance of space comfort and amenities in the international departures area. You can get anything from souveniers to CD's to clothes to food.

Start one level up from the lowest arrivals level. Go as far as you can to the southern end of Terminal 2 in the general direction of the Domestic Terminal. Walk past the bookstore on the right and around the 7-11. At the start of the long elevated ""tube"" that leads to the Domestic Terminal you'll see it on the right. It's clearly signed. If you find yourself looking at parked cars instead of the ""tube"" you are in the right spot but on the wrong level. The place is used mostly by Thai airport workers plus a few savvy travelers. It serves a wide range of Thai food so some (though not all) of the food is spice. It uses a coupon system in increments of 5 baht. Buy coupons before you choose your food drink etc. You can eat very well for 30-35 baht. And it really is delicious. A wonderful place if you just arrived and you need a meal before heading for town or if you are catching a no-frills flight that doesn't serve food.

Our transfer picked us up from hotel at 09.45 for a 20 minute trip to airport. Thereafter we queued at Easyjet drop off baggage for 40 minutes! Next queue was more than a joke with only 1 person checking passports for two queues for entry to the security area. Feeling relieved we could then board the up escalators we then had to join a further queue which snaked around the security hall - unbelievable. Finally getting through to the departure lounge there was yet another queue - yes another passport check. Once we got through this there was no time to queue up to buy a bottle of much needed water or go to the loo. Throughout this time we observed a number of elderly people in distress or receiving medical attention presumably due to the heat and inability to stand for long periods in queues. Having read some of the previous reviews this situation has existed for some time. Do the Madeiran authorities not realise the problems; they need to take action now to address these issues.

While capable of handling major airlines and large jets it somehow feels very relaxed by comparison to say HK Bangkok and Singapore. However the terminals are smart clean and I don't have too many complaints. Some suggestions. Some of the eateries in the food court could also have a presence airside. Like Singapore and its wonderful but more expensive sister airport Songshan (in Taipei itself) it makes use of interesting themes in some of the terminals alcoves about aviation in Taiwan nature of Taiwan relax zones etc which are a nice touch. Ironically it's Songshan that is connected by metro and not as yet Taoyuan - it seems to be taking an eternity to finish the metro link and the high speed rail is miles away and costs a fortune! That and the excruciatingly slow immigration are really the only two problems. When it's finished the metro will be a nice alternative to viewing an industrial wasteland (as seen from the bus in and out of the airport).

On route to Vancouver there was no connecting flight on same day so airline put me up at Miramar Golf Country Club Hotel in Taipei (very nice! also gives you a chance to see a bit of Taipei as it's about 30mins shuttle from airport). Actually thought I'd be put up in the Transit Hotel (located inside Terminal 2) but for some reason was not. Miramar was so lovely that I'm definitely not complaining. Wasn't so lucky on the way back (7 hour stopover in Taipei) Tried to get into the China Airlines lounge but was informed it's only for Business and First Class - and they won't even let you pay to try it. My hopes of getting a shower were quickly diminishing. Was directed to the Transit Hotel up an elevator past this ""dragons in the clouds"" wall display. Honestly just follow the signs to the transit hotel there are plenty. If you get lost just ask someone their english isn't always good but they understand ""transit hotel"" and will happily point you in the right direction. The transit hotel charges US$10 for a shower which also gives you the use of their lounge for 2 hours (where you can help yourself to some coffee or tea or jump on the internet for free). The shower facilities are minimal with a small locker made available for your stuff a towel shower cap toothbrush and toothpaste provided. There are about 6 shower cubicles and a sauna (which costs marginally extra) in this one room with shower gel and ""conditioning shampoo"" (not the best quality by a long shot but it will suffice) provided. For US$36 you can have the use of a hotel room for 3 hours (US$12 for every hour over that). Another thing worth mentioning is that CKS has no ATMs inside the terminal you actually have to go out past security if you want to find one (which isn't really worth it). And Subway doesn't do EFTPOS (nor do they take coins!) So make sure you have at least US$20 cash on you (in notes preferably) and eat first before you spend your last $10 on a shower.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Security was good but when I finally got airside I realised that as many airlines had moved to the new terminal 1 most of the shops and restaurants had closed down airside.

Arriving on Jetstar from Sydney we had to negotiate the stairs (no airbridges) then literally battle our way between two 30m lines of passengers, with hand baggage, waiting to board flights. The gap between the lines was about half a metre and my small wheeled back-pack was hitting the bags of the waiting passengers. What a totally ludicrous situation! Surely the designers of the upgrade could foresee such a situation and keep arriving passengers separated from those queued to board. Departure 5 days later at 0700 was much more comfortable experience through gate 3 at the other end of the airport. With an increasing number of international flights arriving at OOL, well-travelled passengers must wonder about the backwardness of Australia when they step into this terminal.

International and domestic flights now operate out of the same terminal in Kolkata a large ""L"" shaped terminal with plenty of airbridges and much more space more customs immigration check in etc. Departure procedures were efficient with the exception of the separate requirement for baggage screening prior to check in (they don't have in-line screening). The number of food and beverage offerings is somewhat limited in this relatively new terminal although I understand more outlets will be introduced. If you are travelling business class the Port Lounge (International section) is somewhat small but it has a nice buffet and a variety of beverages.

When one did arrive he spent ten minutes arguing with a woman who was worried about missing her flight. He eventually let her through but then disappeared. I continued to struggle through the queue but my luggage was delayed and checked. I advised operator that I was in danger of missing my flight and asked if they could check it more quickly (in hindsight probably not a good move as this did not speed up the process). Once I had come through security had to get through everyone milling around the shops to get to gate 57 - a crazy system of going up and down escalators. I felt sorry for those who had to use the lifts. I missed my boarding time there was no one to assist with exit from the departure lounge. In fact several people missed their plane (not all same flight as mine) and when I eventually did find staff they were discussing how the system was crazy and that they did not have enough people in the right places.

Essentially you have a couple of small duty free stores a souvenir store and couple of other stores that nobody would even blink an eye at so I try to get to the airport no longer than 2 hours before a flight to reduce the time I have to sit around twiddling my thumbs. They don't even give free wifi to waiting patrons. It wasn't long ago you had to pay for a luggage trolley. Thankfully these are now free as they should be. To top it all off they still haven't installed aerobridges at the airport which means using a stairwell to board and this makes boarding with young children a huge hassle.

On the last occasion airport staff were not even letting people into the area as there were too many people there and they were holding them back in the corridors. There is no assistance for older travellers who have to stand and wait I did mention this once to the passport control as there was a very old lady in front of us they said if they asked they would have been sent to the front of the queue but many are visiting.

No custom forms to fill out only a short immigration form.

Her connection was 75 minutes from a Lufthansa flight to another Lufthansa flight. She missed her connection and ended up having to pay for another ticket and an overnight stay in Frankfurt as there is only one flight a day to Doha. On arrival at Frankfurt the plane was met by a bus which took 15 minutes from landing to her reaching the terminal. Then had to join a deep queue to pass through security. Repeatedly asked to be fast tracked as her connection time was quite tight but was ignored. She finally got through security and made her way as fast as possible to her departure gate in terminal B only to find that her plane had departed. She had to pay for a new ticket and would need to pay for a night in a hotel. To make things worse her bags hadn't made the Birmingham flight and were following on and on their advise waited a further 2 hours for her bags only then to be told they had gone via Dubai and would be waiting for her! No attempt was made by Lufthansa nor the security people at the airport to help my daughter catch her plane.

I have only used it 2 or 3 times as a terminal or originating airport but I have used it 2 or 3 dozen times for connections. The negative is that it can take a very long time to get from one gate to another which can be very difficult if you have a short connection. However if your time is sufficient it is a good airport with good facilities. The KLM Lounge is fabulous after its most recent upgrade. But the general facilities are also good as there are several shopping and food options available to occupy your time. The coffee shops are especially good. This airport is configured such that security checks are performed at each gate on a flight-by-flight basis. The process is reasonably efficient. The immigration checks can get backed up but things usually move at a reasonable pace and the staff are polite and fairly efficient. Signage in the airport is relatively good and flight boards are not too difficult to find. The personnel at the transfer desks are relatively helpful if information is required.

sofia-airport,/airport-reviews/sofia-airport,Sofia Airport customer review,Nakasone Yasuhiro,NA,2005-11-06,"Sofia Airport is easily one of the worst airports I have used. Avoid planes arriving during the day especially in the early afternoon as there are 7 or 8 planes landing at the same time resulting in chaos and traveller misery. Before arrival: Prepare for small planes full of people who carry all their baggage onboard. If you get on the plane late there won't be place in the overhead compartments for your stuff. If possible ask the flight attendant for a seat close to the exit. If you don't fly business and are on a plane with an aft door get a seat near the aft door. The locals flying on the plane spontaneously burst in applause on touch-down; it beats me why given what awaits you after landing. Arrival: Getting off the plane: Passengers are required to get off the plane and board a bus to the terminal building. Bring an umbrella and water-proof shoes in case of bad weather because the buses stop away from the plane and the terminal building; and jumping over large pools of water is how you get to the bus/terminal. Try to get on the second bus because it stops in front of the passport control booths that work better. Passport control: Sit on the right side of the bus near the door and be ready to run for the passport control booth. Avoid control booths after #3 (my experience is they tend to work slower than #1 to #3 and that the queues there are even less ordered than those in the first three. Boot #1 is the crew priority booth and if several planes land at the same time you may wait a long time before the crews get checked. Booths are numbered 1 to maybe 8 the last four or five seem always closed numbers run from right to left. Queuing is quite chaotic so be prepared to be pushed especially by the locals to have people get in the line in front of you etc. etc. Be prepared that the passport control official may go out of the booth at any time for a cup of coffee or a cigarette and that he/she isn't answerable polite or anything. Except for crews there are no priority lines; flying business into or outside of Sofia is generally quite pointless as there is almost no difference in the way business passengers are treated by the staff. Don't expect announcements of any kind. You're supposed to know what you're doing anyway right? The luggage: there is random wait for the luggage. In bad weather the bags come in wet and dirty. I have not had problems with lost baggage so I can't comment on that. The customs: Very convenient. At night there are usually one or two sleepy people there who try to ignore the passengers. During the day there are more people but I have never been asked for anything. The arrival hall: Another nightmare. Usually full of people who seem to have little or no buisness there and get in the way of the folks with bags. Since the arrival hall is small it is over quickly. Ignore the people who come to you and in broken English offer you a taxi ride. Fare to the city: go to the counter of OK Supertrans taxi in the right corner of the arrival hall and have someone to get a cab for you and come with you to the car. Once I was refused a booked ride by one of the drivers because my bags were ""too big"". The fare is (Nov. 2005) around 25 eurocents a kilometer; a fare to the city center is about 6-8 leva. Before departure: again avoid daytime flights. Early morning flights are early but arrival check-in security passport control and boarding are a breeze. Arrive about one hour before boarding and double the time if you travel daytime. A traffic jam develops around 2:30pm because of all the people who come to the airport to greet arriving passengers and that you may wait for up to 15-20 minutes on the last kilometre of the road to the airport. Check-in: there is no advantage in flying business on check-in. There is a serious advantage in early arrival. The people on the check-in speak some English but are generally grumpy and unhelpful. Make sure you've got the seating you asked for because the planes are usually crowded. Security control: this is a nightmare about as bad as the passport control on the way in. There are two checkpoints and no matter how many people are queued up usually only one is in operation. The queue usually goes halfway into the departure hall in front of the check-in counters - undoubtedly very convenient for everyone. Prepare for a long wait here during daytime. Passport control: usually easy the bottleneck is the security check. Boarding: board the bus last and stand on the right side. Getting on the plane: Try to get first in order to avoid full compartments.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Where is the short term car-park as I tried to return to the drop off zone and of course the barrier only operates one way. On my return to the exit and by this time extremely annoyed the barrier suddenly opened and I was free. Its bad enough having to pay to drop people off but to feel imprisoned is something else.

The queues started outside the building when I was leaving yesterday. You have to go through security before you can even check in! I had plenty of time though and stood in line for an hour inching forward whilst people joined their friends in front of me a real case of one step forward two steps back. The sun was beating down through a glass roof and everyone was dripping with sweat. People told me of having had to wait outside in the winter in the snow! When I reached the security woman she growled something in Russian to me and refused to let me through. Lesson 1. You are only allowed into the airport if your gate has been announced. So I went back to the end of the queue and started again immediately the gate for my flight was announced. Another long session of queuing and I eventually made it through security the rest of the procedure was relatively easy for me but I bet they could screw things up elsewhere at this airport if they put their minds to it.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,N Emorinem,NA,2008-11-05,Good to read some positive reviews here but my advice is to prepare for the worst if you ever have the misfortune to go through MIA in transit. Having read some reviews here I changed my return flight to a later one as it seemed that 2 hours would not be enough to go through immigration & customs. New arrangements provided for 4.5 hours. Well I'm glad I did. After a 15 minute run from the plane I joined a queue at immigration at 5.45pm and was finally granted permission to enter the USA at 7.30pm. Some people in my queue and those adjacent were pulled for questioning by officials after queuing already for an hour or more. Guess they didn't make their connections. The baggage bit was hopeless - despite being told that I would have to collect my bag and go through customs to clear it and recheck it it wasn't on the carousel (no signs telling you what carousel to go to - you just have to wander up and down and hope you can spot your flight). Piles of bags everywhere - some of them were from flights which had landed several hours earlier. The concept of customer service is clearly non-existent in staff at this airport: to get help I had to break up conversations between staff who would have quote happily chatted indefinitely looking at pictures on their mobile phones flirting with each other etc. if I hadn't forced my way into their conversation. Turns out that despite what my Air Jamaica people were told in JA my bag was checked through already (apparently) though the staff at my departure gate denied this. I did have to check in again at Departures and eventually arrived at my gate at 9pm for a 9.30 flight. Concourse E - dismal place rubbish facilities (hot dogs and a tiny Pizza Hut concession - and that's about it). My bag did reappear in London. I dislike Heathrow and UK airports in general but it seemed like a paradise of good signage helpful staff and logical transit arrangements by comparison. If I can avoid it I will never go to MIA again nor will I book flights requiring a transit at a US airport - nearly missed my connection on the way out at JFK because of a 50 minute wait for baggage and being misadvised about transfer of luggage to next flight from different terminal.

I was lucky though to force myself to a table where it was possible to stand and eat.

In fifty years of flying on five continents I have never seen such a sight. Upon deplaning we were greeted by extremely rude staff who practically shoved US citizens into a fast lane. Non-residents and aliens were shoved into an interminable mob of waiting people. The immigration hall itself worked tolerably for US citizens (I got through in about 20 min despite the immigration officer not believing that my passport and I were the same person: I had to show him my drivers license). The poor people in the other group were jam-packed like sardines with those in the upstairs holding pen trickling down the escalator into the immigration hall. My heart went out to these people. How can we expect tourism if we treat them like this? No toilets no water no care for babies and the disabled. An absolute disgrace. The customs official with whom I spoke said that they had complained many times that terminal 1 was too small for the load. My city of origin for this trip was Mumbai India.

I flew out of this airport recently and you have the same chaos at the x-ray machines just to get into the check-in area. There is even less seating than before in this area before you check in and you see people all over sitting on the floor waiting for the check-in counter to open. After check-in you have another x-ray machine with staff who really couldn't care. All the seating is still the same cold uninviting metal chairs.

sharm-el-sheikh-airport,/airport-reviews/sharm-el-sheikh-airport,Sharm El Sheikh Airport customer review,Kevin Maslin,NA,2007-04-19,First impressions were fairly promising. We were directed (by our travel rep) to a kiosk with NO queue to purchase our visas ($15 each) as we intended travelling outside the Sinai Peninsula. After that things got a little tedious as we then had to join an enormous queue for passport control. During the wait I nipped to the loo and encountered my first Egyptian eagerly holding out his hand for a tip (for simply turning on the hand drier for me as it happens!). Once through passport control picking up the bags from the carousel was fairly painless. We ignored the trolley attendants as we'd previously been made aware of the charge. On the way back we were stopped by a 'jobsworth' airport policeman on passing through the first scanning machine who confiscated the razor blades from my toiletries bag. Quite what he thought I could possibly do with these stowed in the hold of the plane remains a mystery. Check in was reasonably quick and having a few hours to kill we headed for passport control (no problem) and the duty free shops etc. Here I was faced with the one and only total rip off I had encountered during the whole of our stay in Sharm El Sheikh. £1.80 for a can of coke £1.50 for a tube of sweets £4.50 for a Kit Kat - surely some mistake! Alas no. They certainly capitalize on their 'captive audience' status here. I complained very loudly to two of the shopkeepers that at least Dick Turpin had the decency to wear a mask but it cut no ice with them. The lesson here is take your own snacks through in your hand luggage. Drinks are a litte more dodgy as liquids over 100ml are meant to be a no-no but I did see one person take a bottle of water from her hand luggage on the plane which was not purchased at the airport departure facilities so it is possible I guess. One plus point is that tobacco and spirits are exceedingly cheap here (200 B&H £9 1L malt whisky around £12). All in all we found this airport to be reasonably clean and tidy with a large seating area for departures. Signage can be confusing however and long waits for arrivals are certainly possible. I guess it took us about 1.5hrs to get through but I think there were only 3 plan loads of people to process. Multiply accordingly for more arrivals!,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Threats were made to confused people who were just trying to work out the 5 wide queues people could not find 'the end of the queue. I myself was threatened to be sent to the end of the line (which would have added another hour to my already 2 hour wait in the queue) because I insisted on these security men not breaking me up with my sons. I felt like a Jew in a Nazi line up for the 'train' to a bad place. This was disgusting to say the least. If it does not get you in one area it will get you in the other.

leeds-bradford-airport,/airport-reviews/leeds-bradford-airport,Leeds Bradford Airport customer review,Stephen Degnan,United Kingdom,2011-05-23,A small over utilised airport with poor customer service and amenities - in the 6 months I've been unlucky enough to use it it's getting worse. As pointed out - it's a long walk from any short stay through check in and security. This has recently been made worse. In the event someone wants to drop you off at the airport - they will now pay £2 for the pleasure (unless you use a distant car park). There's little space in the check in areas (except the separate Jet 2 portacabin) leading to mixed queues of passengers arriving at the airport some waiting to check in and some waiting to go through security. There is one person handling security for 'standard' passengers - which is the majority of them. when I leave in the morning - it takes approximately 15 minutes to clear the passport check and another 10 to get through security. Jet 2 and others have scheduled flights which converge between 0730 and 1100 leading to a couple of thousand people (no exaggeration) attempting to get past one person. Of course if you're willing to stump up another £3 you can 'fast track' - with another dedicated member of staff waiting to check your boarding pass. Airside facilities are dire and over utilised. No choice but to wander through shop to move from security to the gates - carefully laid out to ensure it's impossible for more than a couple of people to pass through without bumping into each other. Awaiting you is insufficient seating and the usual dreadful airport chain cafes. Staff are surly on the whole and gate announcements are tardy and inaccurate. Looking to board at gate 9 for Southampton. That's fine - as long as you wait for an entire group heading for Belfast to board first.

I have gotten stuck at DFW for hours at a time because of cancelled flights on several occasions and there is no better place to be. In Terminal D there are ample restaurants both fast food and real food which are quick and good. There is lots of shopping and things to do while making time.

lahore-airport,/airport-reviews/lahore-airport,Lahore Airport customer review,B Khan,Germany,2014-07-06,Travelling through Lahore airport is nothing short of a massive hassle and money drainer. Every man woman and dog is after a tip for anything from discussing the cricket to putting a tag on your bag to even making eye contact. Surely they employees of the airport get paid and should not be able to harass passengers for money! To make life more difficult there are at least 3 security check points during check in where your bags get scanned and often opened and inspected. Also be aware of the random departure tax that you are hit with during check-in. For some reason it is not included in the ticket pricing and all counters insist that you pay. Make sure you have rupees or the staff will offer to exchange your foreign currency and at least in my case keep around 30% of the moneys for themselves. And yes they also demanded a tip for this service. I would avoid this airport if possible.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,1,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

If Ryanair and Transavia flights depart at the same time you are jampacked in a kind of shed. If there aren’t any delays or cancellations and no coinciding flights it's bearable but otherwise? To go to Venice is relatively easy there are direct buses and the railway station of Treviso is only 10 min by bus (nr 6 in front of the entrance). Take care however that the ride in the reverse direction takes much longer (30 min) as the bus makes a circular tour. I went to Triest and that’s 2.5 hrs by train (Amsterdam has no direct connections to Triest though I heard later that travelling via Munich is convenient). Security scanners apparently were tuned up.

The G and C terminals are very long but there is a walkway where you can transfer from one side to the other. I really enjoyed the observation deck at the D concourse and the view was excellent. The C concourse tram is very helpful especially for the elderly. Waiting areas tend to be crowded in the C concourse but D E F and G were just fine. Great restaurants also.

Landed at terminal 5 after flying in from Chicago. Long wait for buses before we could get off the plane. Queues at passport control - how is it that the electronic machines for automatically reading passports take so long to work if they work so no one wants to use them? Once I'd collected baggage the real fun started. My options to get to Croydon are train Paddington then underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (complicated and train is expensive) underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (slow and engineering work meant no circle or district line services to Victoria) or bus direct from Heathrow to Croydon (1.5 hours but direct and cheap). How to get to central bus station? Signage in Terminal 5 is confusing and unhelpful. Man on info desk in Term 5 gave me incorrect info. Finally establish I need to get a train from Term 5 to Term 2/3 and train only runs every 15 minutes. Is this a 3rd world airport in the middle of the night? No its London Heathrow middle of day on Bank Holiday weekend. Why is there no free regular shuttle like the one between North and South Terminals in Gatwick? After an overnight flight the whole experience of landing at Term 5 was frustrating stressful and unpleasant. Lesson learned - wherever possible I'll avoid this airport in future.

Despite the fact that there are only two daily nonstop flights from KL and Singapore KP deem it too late to offer a service late at night when the Air Asia flight from Singapore arrives at 2300. If you are not going to offer goods for pax on these services one has to wonder why they bother to have an outlet there in the first place? But customer service has never been a strong point with KP.

Security lines were a bit long though and good luck finding someone who speaks English if your Spanish isn't very good.

lima-airport,/airport-reviews/lima-airport,Lima Airport customer review,A Hilbun,NA,2004-08-26,While LIM does leave something to be desired over the past four years the improvements have been dramatic. I was surprised in just a year how much progress has been made on construction of the new concourse. I will however miss deplaning on the tarmac since passengers exit from the front and the rear of the plane which is much faster. The terminal also has been dramatically improved. I remember the good old bad days when there was only one place to eat or drink up on the mezzanine level and a Dunkin Donuts on the main level. Now there is a whole assortment of dining and shopping options up on the mezzanine. One temporary problem though that the powers-that-be at the airport should have thought of in Aug. 2004 there were no working elevators or escalators between the main floor and the mezzanine. Which meant that for a good part of our layover while waiting for our domestic flight to Trujillo my wife and I had to eat in shifts - one of us had to stay with the large checked luggage on the main floor while the other ate in one of the mezzanine restaurants. I imagine this would also make the mezzanine inaccessible to the handicapped. Also there is a surprising lack of seating on the main floor. The smell that someone complained about is diesel fuel which is used as a cleaning solvent in Peru. The hotel will be a welcome addition. Most of the time our flights to Lima arrive very late and require an overnight stay since there are no more domestic departures that day. We usually book a hotel room in advance in Miraflores (30-45 minutes away) but getting there late at night then getting back to the airport the next day can be a real headache. LIM does have a lot of shortcomings but it's not as if they're not expending a lot of effort to try to make it as nice a facility as in more developed parts of the world.

antalya-airport,/airport-reviews/antalya-airport,Antalya Airport customer review,L Bradley,United Kingdom,2013-10-15,This was one of the most distressing experiences I have had at an airport. I was travelling to Manchester from Antalya along with hundreds of other people. Some people were travelling to different countries such as Holland Russia Germany. There simply is no queuing system. Everybody chooses anywhere where they can have their luggage and passports and tickets scanned. It doesn't matter where you are travelling to or what time you just pick your own check in point. This may sound ideal but believe me it isn't. If your flight it due in an hours time from check in then you will be very lucky to get on your flight. After checking In you then are scanned. Then you have to have your passport checked again. Believe me this was so traumatic!!! All nationalities were pushing and squeezing to get their passports checked. There were thousands of people some who only had ten minutes to get on their plane before take off. There must have been only 3 or 4 people to check all these thousands of people's passports. Travellers were becoming irate distressed and someone with a weak heart could easily have collapsed. There needs to be a much better system. I will never use this airport until I hear the system has improved. Somebody could have been very seriously hurt or even worse. Children were crying people were shouting at each other and the workers checking the passports were extremely stressed out.

Two tips; if you are traveling to the UK (usually gate 12) wait until you are that end of the pier and then do your shopping prices are lower than in the 'duty-free' shop in the main concourse.

split-airport,/airport-reviews/split-airport,Split Airport customer review,Heather Southworth,NA,2007-09-10,Arrived around 11am at Split from Manchester. Airport not too busy only about 4 other aircraft on the tarmac. Very swift passage through the building and out to the awaiting coaches. Return journey. Told by rep that airport very busy on a Saturday in high summer with up to 100 flights! Told that this is only a problem during high summer- hence why Split Airport is still relatively small. Had a stroke of luck though when our tour rep rang ahead and informed us that the outside check-ins had been opened just for us! Walked straight off the coach and to the three/four little desks that are positioned outside under canopies. Baggage checked in and x-rayed here and put straight onto a luggage cart you cannot get better than that! I admit we were lucky as inside the terminal there were large queues for checking in- but surely in high summer queues are to be expected. Security relatively swift much quicker than the 30-45 minutes of queues in Manchester which Was a nightmare. Departure lounge small and only two small cafes and a couple of duty frees which were extremely busy. Staff in airport were friendly enough toilets were kept clean and tidy certainly alot cleaner than the ones at Manchester. Had to be bused out to the plane which was only a short distance away (had walked to terminal from aircraft on arrival) but the airport was a lot busier than when we had arrived.

The development has done two things: (a) it has combined the security checkpoints from international domestic and T2; and (b) it has shifted back the checkpoint so that many shops which were landside are now airside. At first glance this has worked - security took less than five minutes (at 5pm) and if one does have to queue there is far more room to do so.

Macquarie have turned the car park into a a narrow maze to maximise car park spots and have the nerve to charge every person that arrives through the car park. There is no dedicated pick up spot. This makes the car park a total mess to negotiate especially during the peak hours. In addition if one tries to leave the car park within the '3 mins' to avoid paying the 'car park tax' this is virtually impossible as you have to battle it out with tens of other drivers waiting in line who are trying to do exactly the same thing.

We parked in long stay having pre booked through another company and the shuttle to the terminal was waiting for us (lucky).

Only a small duty free on the other side and only 1 cafe. not much to do. There are no tv screens or monitors for the flights.

Immigration - for an airport that has maybe 7-8 international flights leaving in a span of 3 hours in the early morning there are four immigration queues.

Then the fun started at passport control no fast track just EU or non EU lines but all merged into one seething mass of people. Horrible scrum which was terrifying for kids and resulted in 1.5 hours to get passport stamped. Crowd approached mob mentality at times and absolutely no crowd control from customs or security. Only a handful of customs staff on duty and complete lack of care attitude. We arrived at the airport 2 hours and 45 minutes before departure and just made flight. I have no doubt many desperate travellers missed their flight. No time to shop visit lounge or complete tax free process. Tragic for all the shops and food outlets at the airport which were deserted as passengers had to run after clearing passport control to make their flight.

If passengers arrived consistently early as advised followed the instructions about liquids emptied their pockets properly and basically followed the rules (all of which are well publicised) then the process would be much simpler and easier for all. And next time you are waiting in the queue just think its all for your safety. Outbound security is there to identify possible threats to the airport and your flight. Would you rather they skipped through things. If they are taking time to scrutinise an x-ray then its because there is something they are not sure about.

A queue stretching around the departure lounge and back again for security checks and the reason one person at the control desk.

durhamtees-valley-airport,/airport-reviews/durhamtees-valley-airport,Durham/tees Valley Airport customer review,Leo Enticknap,NA,2006-05-12,Finding this airport can be confusing because it recently changed its name from Teesside to Durham/Tees Valley. Signs on the main feeder roads (i.e. the A19 A66 and A1M) have not all been updated so look out for either. There is a free bus to and from Darlington rail station but it takes a while and is only hourly outside peak times. At the time of writing (12 May 2006) a new terminal building is under construction. The temporary entrance is on the west side of the existing terminal and again is not well signposted. This airport's major strength is that because there are only one or two flights coming and going at any time there are never any massive queues. You'll get through security and (for incoming international passengers) customs and immigration a lot quicker than at NCL or LBA. The long-term car park is significantly cheaper too. There are self-service check in machines for BMI flights to Heathrow and desks for all other flights. If you want something to eat before your flight I suggest getting it at the pub or café BEFORE going through security as the only airside food outlet does pretty grim reheated sandwiches and not much else. Ditto for newspapers/books/magazines - there is a W.H. Smith in the check-in area but not the departure lounge (but it does have a bar and a duty free shop). If there's nothing in it price-wise I would always fly from MME in preference to LBA or NCL because it's a very quick airport to get in and out of; but the facilities are more limited.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The second change is to install screens showing passengers which gates they need to go to for their connecting flights as soon as they exit Customs or at least a sign informing passengers that they will need to go back airside to find this information.

atlanta-hartsfield-airport,/airport-reviews/atlanta-hartsfield-airport,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,Amanda Farrell,United States,2015-07-06,"This airport was very frustrating! It is, in no way, wheelchair or stroller friendly. I was traveling with my infant son and I had him in a stroller. I departed from Atlanta and then later arrived in Atlanta. When I was departing I noticed the gates are very crowded and tight and no matter where you try to park a stroller or wheelchair you are going to be blocking a walkway or other seats. Also the bathrooms are very tight and constricted. This became very difficult upon my arrival back to Atlanta when the bathroom was busy and crowded. There is no changing station. So you have to use a counter which is not safe for infants as there is no way to strap my child down. Also the handicapped stalls are barely big enough to fit my stroller let alone myself in there with it. The elevators are not clearly marked and I had to walk around in circles looking for them. Not to mention they are small and barely big enough for one person and a stroller/wheelchair. There was a line of about 5 wheelchairs and 5 families with stollers waiting to use the only 2 available elevators. They need to update their airport in order to accomedate their customers.

nassau-airport,/airport-reviews/nassau-airport,Nassau Airport customer review,R Phillips,NA,2009-06-26,First off Nassau Airport is not on the same level as airports in the US or Europe. That should be news enough for people expecting a 5-Star Airport. The recent growth on New Providence and at Paradise Island (i.e. Atlantis Cable Beach etc.) is almost a world away from Lynden Pindling International Airport. My experience last week seems to be better than some of the good folks who have come before me but by no means is NAS a 5-Star Airport and the unexpected should be expected Inbound pax deplane and enter the Bahamian Customs facility. I arrived at about 2:30 and most of the lanes were open. Next comes the bag claim. Word of caution- try not to check any luggage. This will only slow you down and bag handling at NAS is disastrous. A Customs officer will ask you about the contents of your bags and most of the time will let you through without any checks. Taxis and Car Hire is outside of the bag area. Departures: I flew out on USAirways at around noon. If you are flying to the USA from NAS arrive at least 3 hrs early. Flights within the Bahamas Caribbean and to Canada & the UK leave from another terminal and usually need 2-3 hours lead time. USAirways opened their check-in desks at 9 so my group was checked in first. 3 hours may seem excessive for a Caribbean airport but it really helps here. After check-in you walk around and behind the check-in desks to the first security checkpoint. This has a metal detector and the whole works so be prepared to do everything you would at TSA/CATSA. Next comes US Customs & Border Protection Preclearance where a US (not Bahamian) officer checks your documents. Make sure to fill out the proper forms before you arrive at the airport. Not filling out the forms until the last second will only delay you further. After CBP you proceed up an escalator to a SECOND security facility. This also has a metal detector and more stringent security checks. My laptop was checked for explosives and had to be taken out of its TSA-approved case (not recognized in the Bahamas). The reasoning behind 2 checkpoints is hard to fathom but is probably to create a few more jobs for Bahamians. After all 3 of these checks you finally enter the departure lounge. Thanks to new ownership by Vancouver Airport Group (who is responsible for YVR Gatwick and the new Montego Bay Airport terminal) there are new shops such as Dunkin' Donuts Hard Rock Cafe (Souvenirs Only no food!) and Harley-Davidson. Prices are extremely high ($2.50 for a candy bar) so buy only if you need to. Also sit near your airline's boarding door. The jetways are still several hundred feet away but each airline has one set of double-doors where they conduct boarding. The PA is impossible to hear thanks to the massive echo in the building but you should be fine if you pay attention and sit near your gate. Finally at the jetway security personnel conduct random hand checks of luggage. They seem to pick the first person who walks towards the door so mix yourself in the pack to lessen the chance of being stopped. All in all NAS is changing. Vancouver Airport Group will steer the airport in the right direction down the road but it can't be fixed overnight. Just remember: get the earliest flight possible to your destination to avoid the 11am-2pm security rush for 1pm-4pm departures and get there 3 hours early (or more if desired). It takes 30-45 minutes to reach the airport from Atlantis/Downtown Nassau so plan for that too. This should help to make your departure from Nassau a bit less stressful. As many others have said NAS is below expectations for the capital and toruism hub of the Bahamas. A week spent in the luxury of the Atlantis seems lightyears away from the old hot Nassau Airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Several of the doors did not shut loo seats were missing and most extraordinary of all only one out of about six or seven taps was working. Having finished queuing for a tap I then had to queue 25 minutes to get through security. (My recent experiences at Heathrow 3 have been queuing times of less than 10 minutes.) There were unmanned x-ray machines and apparently unoccupied staff and those staff who were on duty seemed exceptionally poorly trained in knowing how to cope with pushchairs. They need a dedicated queue for pushchairs wheelchair users and other mobility impaired people and late boarders so that the regular queues are not repeatedly held up by someone rushing through at the last minute or by some poor parent trying to wrestle with babies bags toys coats pushchairs and plastic bags of liquids whilst also having to sample pots and bottles of babyfood!,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

We arrived at the gate with only 10 or 15 minutes to spare - no time to visit the BA lounge - there isn't one in the ""C"" section anyway. Would suggest premium class passengers allow a bare minimum of 2 hours of connection - heaven only knows how much time economy passengers should allow - probably at least 3 or 4 hours.

Once in the departure lounge same story really. The airport is in need of a new building and some better staffing. and Easyjet need to up their game as far as check-in and boarding let's have seat booking please instead of the race to the gate/bus/plane etc. Also why does the bus for the car hire not take you to directly outside the Terminal building instead of having to walk across the roads.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

That wasn't the worst thing airport staff seem not bother managing the tour groups the small groups or individual travelers. There were bunches of individual travelers trying to cut the line with the reason that their flight was boarding. We were almost late for boarding our flight. We finally had to ask the Officer to help us with the queue when we had only 10 minutes left before boarding time but the Officers didn't bother to do anything.

If you are unlucky enough to use the domestic end and your flight goes from gate 19 (a to e) then you have a 20 minute walk. No travelators no help. Also if you go on a Monday morning you are highly likely to be queuing all round the airport just to get through security.

The main impression this airport gives is that passengers are the least important people. Passengers have to walk the length of a football pitch with baggage from the so called drop off carpark (and get charged £2 for the privilege). Much bigger airports have not stopped passengers being dropped off outside the entrance. Add this to the longest waiting queues at passport control and for baggage. Where have all the seats in the check-in area gone? Not everyone wants to go straight through but there are only about half a dozen seats in the whole area.

lima-airport,/airport-reviews/lima-airport,Lima Airport customer review,Hernán Saldaña,NA,2005-05-05,I agree that while most people think US$28+ is a bit expensive most of the airports allow companies to include that tax in the value of the air tickets so you don't notice it. It would be a good idea for the people in LAP to allow such thing. That way you could pay the tax with your credit card along with the ticket and earn some miles. Now regarding the terminal one of the things that I regret is that the jetways are solid. I would have prefer ones with glass walls like some of the ones that they have in GRU. It is quite spectacular that way. I also agree that deplaning in the tarmac was quite faster but what can we say - it is the pace of progress. Last time I was there in February 2005 and there still was some work to do. I am looking forward to my next trip to Lima to check the finished work. At least of this stage.

You definitely get the feeling of being in a third world country from the moment you arrive. But the facilities at the airport has improved the last years.

delhi-airport,/airport-reviews/delhi-airport,Delhi Airport customer review,S Datta,United Kingdom,2010-11-11,The arrivals experience was smooth - a long walk from the gate to the immigration area but there were many travelators made it quite painless. The height of the ceilings and general sense of space is wonderful. Immigration was smooth: took less than a couple of minutes between arriving and getting through. I had no checked luggage so cannot comment on the wait time for luggage - which I've heard can be very long. Once outside there was no wait for a radio cab which got me home in less than 25 minutes was prepaid and smooth. I ended up spending quite a bit of time in Departures on the way out because I got there a bit early and passport control/security was quick. Entry smooth; the outside area feels very open and spacious people seeing you off can hang out for some time if they like. Inside once past security there is a pretty good range of shops including a couple of boutiques stocking Indian designers a bookstore or two decent duty free a good restaurant (branch of the Smokehouse Grill in South Delhi I think) several coffee places and a very nice food court on the upper level. Again it all feels very spacious and unhurried and relaxing. The wifi access was one problem: it requires you to have an Indian cellphone number for an activation code to be sent to - not a great idea for international travellers! The gate area has these chaise longue to lie down on. Not much else to do at the gate areas though. I hope they add a few shops eating places and so on over time (Having said that it feels wonderfully uncluttered for an airport a rarity these days!),NA,NA,NA,4,5,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

Also you can pay a daily fee and get in. Very worthwhile if you have a 5-6 hour (or more) layover. International arrival there is OK no long delays but customs takes themselves very seriously and seems to operate on the premise if they're not inspecting someone's bags they're not doing their jobs.

rio-de-janeiro-airport,/airport-reviews/rio-de-janeiro-airport,Rio De Janeiro Airport customer review,N Nacion,United Arab Emirates,2013-12-31,I just came from GIG airport yesterday and my expectation of the airport of a country who is hosting the World Cup and joined the Expo 2020 as finalist was not met at all. Outside the check-in area of Terminal 2 it seems to look like a domestic airport. Upon entering one can feel the humidity right away. Air-conditioning is not good especially with lots of people inside and the temperature outside. There is no wifi in the check-in area which makes it difficult for us who are waiting for long hours. They said there is wifi in the boarding area but still we are not able to connect. There is only a few selection of food/restaurants in the terminal and it takes ages to be served. Inside the boarding area there is only one cafe that serves very limited food item. Shops for souvenirs and other items are very less also inside the terminal. Toilets in the check-in area is quite tolerable compared to the ones in the boarding area. The toilet in the boarding area is very disgusting and I did not even dare to use the cubicles and just waited for the boarding to use the plane's toilet. I thought also that being inside the airport terminal is safe already but there are beggars everywhere asking for money which makes it quite scary for foreigners who have heard different stories about the city's safety. They ought to improve the security of the airport first and also do something about the comforts of the travellers especially the tourists who bring money to the country. If they want to remain a tourist destination better to spend money also in improving the airport facilities. The airport is like the face also of one's country.,NA,NA,NA,1,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
providence-airport,/airport-reviews/providence-airport,Providence Airport customer review,Michael Wiggins,United States,2012-06-26,"(June 27 2012) As a frequent user of the Providence T.F. Green airport (PVD) I will say that the airport is a true four star facility. While it still is a small airport by most standards it has a surprising number of plusses that as has been said by others to be a reasonable alternative to Boston Logan (BOS) but only if you are flying within the US (no international arrivals or departures except to Toronto). Upon entry into the departures area the ticket stands are almost all within the same distance from the entry doors to the terminal. You don't have to hike a mile to get to Southwest and 10 feet to American like many other airports do. TSA security is also right there so one doesn't have to hike for that either. The TSA crew does their job well but they get backed up during the 6-8 AM rush. After TSA the main passageway is quite wide and is always clean. It is set up so when you leave TSA you are located dead centre in the passageway (equidistant to either end of the terminal) so there's not as much walking to do. There are plenty of concessions. Signage is good. The seats at the gates are what I would rate as not bad not terrific. Upon arrival the walk to the baggage claim is good with a ""detour"" that keeps the arriving passengers to not have to deal with departing passengers. Waiting for your luggage is longish sometimes but good overall. There's even a Starbucks in the baggage claim area! There is now a connecting passageway that takes you to a train station that is served by the MBTA (important: weekdays only! With any luck this will change in the future.) (AMTRAK for some reason won't stop there.) where you can get to downtown Providence Boston and most points in between. Next to the train station is a new parking garage. We're supposed to get a lengthened main runway in the near future but with today's economy that may get put on the back burner. And by the way: the locals would have you know that PVD is located in Warwick RI not Providence!",NA,NA,NA,9,4,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

Most of the time yours is the only large aeroplane and you are met at the door to the airport by friendly customs officers (most sporting superb Gallic moustaches!). You can see your luggage being loaded onto the carousel (very efficient) and the exit from the airport is less than 5 metres from the luggage hall.

Meanwhile passengers for other destinations were queuing as described though I spotted that new sheltered seating had been provided outside since I was last there. I dread to think what it could have been like had the visitor numbers not been so visibly down since my last visit. The local taverna owners all commented on it. I've come to expect to be patient waiting for luggage on the way into Corfu but much worse are the queues for departures when you're tired and a bit fed up at the thought of going home at all! The worst part of the trip was the flight home on the most uncomfortable plane I've ever been in.

It has plenty of personality and artwork so instagramers and the like can be happy - if you could upload the pics (more on that later). Staff have improved over the years but I still find them to be inept in a lot of ways. Mercifully the asking for tips phenomenon has largely abated but occasionally you will find the odd greedy man/woman prodding you in hushed tones for a tip. Food court is good - albeit a bit overpriced - Asian Indian junk food pub grub. Its pretty much covered. Toilets were clean and functional and toilet staff have always been polite. My only gripe so far and in the recent months has been the constant stagnating immigration queues at departures. It seems like they do not have additional staff to service the peak hours overload which is disappointing. My senior citizen parents however were quickly ushered to a different queue when we requested quick assistance. WiFi is an issue and for the life of me I couldn't get it work on my cellphone. A working sim is required for registration and with the security concerns India faces I guess I understand. Its frustrating nonetheless. I didn't encounter any mosquitoes like some other passengers complaining on the forums or any ""musty smell"". Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this airport for travel.

On return the corridor from the gate to the security/passport area is so narrow its a joke. That said everything is on one level and walking distances are short.

I was surprised to hear a security marshaller shouting at straggling passengers doing the 'loop' waiting for their queue - 'I'm not shouting at you but' and then making a remark that he didn't want the system to descend into chaos! Security staff working hard at 5 am but doing so speedily and with a pleasant attitude. Shopping area is still dire but the food/waiting area is dark has no consistent flooring and has the feeling of being in a pen of doomed cattle waiting for the abattoir as they crowd to watch the screen to find out where their gate might be albeit in an hour's time. More importantly this is the first week of the Car Rental Village where all the previous 'on airport' companies (Hertz Avis Budget Europcar and Enterprise) are now in an area away from the airport requiring a shuttle bus trip of about 10 mins. These buses run approx every 10 mins except between 1 am and 4 am (or so I was told). This 'village' concept is becoming a regular feature of airport planning but means you have to allow even more time for your trip from the airport and returning your hire car to the airport (prior to check- in/bag drop/security/retail therapy) which is unwelcome at the best of times even more so with a 06H00 departure.

Corridors and distances are long with twists and turns very bad signage rail links and passages through duty free areas all through which one must traverse to reach your connecting gate. And this doesn't even count the fact that at some point in between these 'roadblocks' one will need to pass through immigration and security once again. My most recent connection was on October 14th arriving at CDG from Nice in order to connect to Chicago. I was met by an unimaginably long line for immigration which took nearly one hour to pass through. I had only 45 minutes to connect to my flight as my inbound from Nice was delayed. There is absolutely no attempt made to ascertain who has a crucially short connection. Its literally everyone for themselves and you are met only with a shrug form the queue monitors. I ended up running to catch the flight and the only reason I made it was because the plane was being held for connections. In short if you are making a connection forget about CDG unless you have hours to do so. If you are originating from there its better but one still must get there especially early.

After queuing for over an hour at immigration (something which I am unfortunately used to at UAE airports) it then took a further hour to get our first bag and it appears our final bag was the very last bag off the plane. On the way out flying from YYZ to Vegas and having no previous experience of US Customs or Pearson airport we arrived only 2.5 hours before departure. Staff member unhelpful as we didn't know that we had to or how to use the baggage tag printing machines.

We eventually cleared US Border Control 5 minutes before boarding. I'm sure the airport and the systems run very smoothly if you're used to them or if there was someone to explain them but as we had never seen an airport operating like this or been to the US with the pre-clearance before it was incredibly stressful.

The crass lack of management response to the mounting issues and complaints indicates the attitude to the public and services they are responsible for.

denver-airport,/airport-reviews/denver-airport,Denver Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,NA,2008-06-29,Main problems at DEN are security waits at peak hours (often 30 minutes or more since they funnel everybody through two checkpoints which are often understaffed) the large distances between terminals and the distance from the city itself. The positives are the relatively friendly staff good express bus service to the city center available right outside the terminal doors free WiFi in the terminals and ability to withstand winter weather (I've flown through three times during light/moderate snow and no problems with delays). I wouldn't want to try and make a connecting flight here especially if there's less than 90 minutes between flights but it's an OK airport if you're starting and ending your trip there.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

I usually fly Air France and Skyteam and therefore enjoy very decent airport facilities (Terminals 2E 2F and 2G). I also fly BA and Easyjet quite often and their Terminals (2A and 2B) have also very much improved in the last years. However I flew Lufthansa last week and therefore used Terminal 1: what a disappointment! Everything is too small (check-in rooms terminals etc.) and orientation is a nightmare! Now I understand why some people hate CDG. This terminal simply ought to be fully re-built. I actually think CDG shouldn't be rated as a single airport but as 2 different ones as T1 and T2 are so discrepant. So my final grade is 7/10 as an average of: 4/10 for Terminal 1 (STAR ALLIANCE) 7/10 for Terminals 2A 2B 2C and 2D (ONEWORLD + EASYJET + EMIRATES) 10/10 for Terminals 2E 2F 2G and S3 & S4 (SKYTEAM).,NA,NA,NA,7,4,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

With just 5 gates it seems to be a bit undersized for a city of 160000. However speaking from an architectural perspective it has more character than most airports I have flown through and is very clean besides. There is virtually no chance of getting lost owing to the small size and simple layout. The security checkpoint is neither intimidating nor cumbersome but the agents are thorough and will search your bags if needed. CHA recently added a daily direct flight to Dallas/Fort Worth and will soon follow up with direct service to Houston and Orlando. Other cities with direct service to and from CHA include: Atlanta Chicago Charlotte Washington (DC) Cincinnati and Memphis.

addis-ababa-airport,/airport-reviews/addis-ababa-airport,Addis Ababa Airport customer review,Matt Sudders,NA,2003-07-17,Addis Ababa has a shiny new beautiful terminal building. Unfortunately it has also adopted the flexible space concept similar to London Stansted which means that and area has thin cardboard dividing walls. Thus the Business lounge is a box in the middle of all the noise. In addition the facilities had not (mid may) fully opened meaning that there were no money exchange desks open prior to the evening departure of the international flights. The one thing they really need to sort out is the visa office. You have to pay a fee upon arrival which can only be paid in Ethiopian currency (which they only tell you when you finally reach the window). They then keep your passport - send you to another snail queue for the bank before returning and rejoining afresh the visa snail pace queue. All in all over 2 hrs at midnight.

This may seem very inconvenient for Newyorkers used to La Guardia airoport but it isn't so bad if compared with JFK. The airport is small and efficient. There are little or no delays on the ground. This field is used primarily by Southwest as its gateway to New York. Southwest partner ATA is another visitor while some legacy carriers only offer regional service to their respective hubs or focus cities. For those passengers who don't like turboprops be advised that Piedmont Airlines operates from this field with DHC8s for Us Airways express while Colgate uses tiny Beechcrafts on flights for Usair express and Continental (I find those tiny planes charming but many passengers complain).

Hopefully the Melbourne terminal will improve as Melbourne gets its promised new bus station in Spencer Street. Advise get there early to locate the bus! As I drive the Melbourne Geelong Freeway almost daily I can understand the Sunbus tedious margin of of arriving early in case of congestion.

As we taxied to a stop the pilot said all those with immediate connecting flights would find an orange envelope on the wall when we got to the end of the airbridge just wave this as we went through the airport and we be rushed through. I have to say it all worked like clockwork. As we approached immigration a lady directed us into a short queue of about ten people. (The main queue snaked around for several hundred yards). We were through in about ten minutes and although our luggage with the red labels came after numerous ones without we found the new bag drop counter and jumped on the train to the next terminal. Our flight boarded whilst luggage was still turning up on the tarmac but when we arrived at New Orleans. The success of this was due to having both flights booked by BA so they were responsible for getting us to the final destination.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,G Leadbetter,United Kingdom,2014-06-03,My colleagues and I regularly use most UK airports through our business. Our general consensus is the Bristol is possibly the UK's worst airport. Here's why: The airport's poor design (requiring buses for many boardings) leads to overcrowding in departures worsened by the amount of space used up by the disproportionate duty free shops. Facilities are no way near up to demand with constant queues for the toilets and the Soho Coffee outlet. Example: 15 minutes to get to the from of the queue on 3rd June 2014. The use of Cobus buses for boarding is fine for a Spanish holiday airport but in the UK it's no good. Example: on 6th May 2014 it took me 35 minutes from going through the gate to boarding EZY401 - mostly spent stood on a packed Cobus bus. With 5 minutes in steady rain after getting off the bus.

sydney-airport,/airport-reviews/sydney-airport,Sydney Airport customer review,Harold Ketterer,United States,2012-10-30,Our trip of a lifetime started on 26-Sep and included two weeks in New Zealand followed by two weeks in Australia. We departed very early in the morning on 26-Oct from Cairns airport on a Jetstar flight to Sydney where we connected to a Qantas flight to Dallas/Fort Worth. Arriving in Sydney airport we knew we had to find our way to T1 the international terminal. It was difficult to find signs directing us to the international terminal but managed to see ones that indicated there was a train. Carrying our luggage we followed these signs and found ourselves at a train station where we saw we had to have a ticket to board. Imagine our confusion and dismay when we arrived there to find queues of people waiting to purchase tickets. Never have I been confronted by such a difficult confusing and unfriendly method to find conveyance from one terminal to another in an airport. With assistance from a train agent in the area we were able to purchase tickets and wrestle our bags through the gates and get to T1. The sad thing is that we departed Australia with negative feelings based on this experience.,NA,NA,NA,1,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The worst aspect are the unacceptable queues and waiting times at passport control by far the worst I have witnessed at any airport so far. This coupled with the average unpleasant attitude of the border agency officials the last one experienced only yesterday have made me decide on using other airports as a first choice. Stansted is the nearest in terms of distance and travel time to my home but the time saved with this is now overridden by the waiting transfer and wasted time on other aspects the main one being passport control.

Extremely long walking distances on arrival through empty corridors. Border guards meet you halfway but the check is only selective (I saw them checking people's passports and got mine out but was just waved through). Immigration officer was polite but extremely thorough wanted to know everything including why I live in Norway as a Russian citizen. Needing a visa to essentially everywhere makes one used to dealing with immigration but frankly this was the most thorough interrogation I've ever had. The whole immigration/customs thing is strangely organized (you fill in a card that the immigration officer checks and then you give it to the customs people). Didn't have any luggage so can't comment. Nothing special on arrival (pretty much a cramped room with a convenience shop) and no ATM would take my card (also brushed away rather rudely by the person in the currency exchange booth who barked they only dealt with cash - well why do they have a PIN pad sticking out then??) so had to the take the bus which you can pay for with the card. Departure was smooth printed out my boarding pass (on a computer with a really slow printer attached not a proper terminal) and into security which was reasonably fast but slightly chaotic (one officer instructed me to take metal objects off and then another told me to have my ""stuff"" on me). Once inside clean and tidy but nothing much of interest a few bland shops and sandwich/pizza places (again had problems with my card!). Boarding OK but they could do with a screen that is higher up or a better microphone: boarding is by row but everyone was trying to get closer to hear what they were saying so it was quite a scrum.

I never experienced any issues through security and immigration staff are wonderful. The food places located in the terminal are usually very busy with a lack of seats and there are lines for food. The currency exchange booth is generally busy. The baggage return is hot and cold. When I returned from Egypt we waited over an hour for the bags to be distributed.

Two charges of £92 for allegedly exceeding the maximum stay in the empty drop off zone for a couple of minutes is by any standards draconian and confirms all the stories one hears about this 'cowboy' industry. Make no mistake these are not fines but charges levied by a third-party without any provision of supporting evidence. All professional advice is to simply ignore such demands and let the demander pursue their case through the civil legal system - if they feel lucky! Most precedents demonstrate they will fail.

Check-in is mainly down to the airlines but certainly for BA the queuing has all but gone for United - not so much. Security never seems to take more than 5 to 10 minutes - same for immigration.

sunshine-coast-airport,/airport-reviews/sunshine-coast-airport,Sunshine Coast Airport customer review,C Tudehope,Australia,2010-06-17,The airport is a charming little place up on the Sunshine Coast. There are only about 10 flights a day going to Sydney and Melbourne. It has recently been upgraded and expanded the gate area is much bigger and has food outlets and toilets. It opens up on to the runway and provides nice views. It's an easy airport to handle as it isn't too big to get lost in but isn't so small so as to feel cramped. The butterfly sanctuary between check-in and security (which must be walked through as it is on the pathway) is a lovely touch and provides a unique atmosphere. The ground staff are very friendly. If heading up to the Sunshine Coast it is often cheaper and quicker to fly direct rather than to Brisbane and by far it is an easier airport to use!,NA,NA,NA,5,5,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

We did Meet & Greet car parking which I would definitely recommend. Security looked quite chaotic at first but moved through very quickly. The new duty free shopping and restaurant/bar areas are much improved and I think the new layout gives a better flow, do any shopping you want to do, then find a seat. The only people who complain are those who stress about securing a seat first then end up going backwards through the shopping area, which there's absolutely no benefit in doing. It did get quite busy with a slight lack of space in departures but I'm concious of the fact that a large area of the terminal is currently blocked off for refurbishment. Passport Control was far better than I expected at about 10 minutes queuing time and this was at 18.30 with still a fair few flights coming in. There's also lots of large signs and flight information screens about which can only be a good thing.

Security can be very very slow if there are a few flights departing at around the same time (Christmas-time is usually a nightmare). It's then that you realise that queue-forming is not high on the agenda in this neck of the woods. The moral then becomes -""if you can't beat them....."". The toilets are poor. Not very clean and the toilet paper supplied (if at all) resembles rolled-up tree bark! Just what you need before a 6 hour flight - NOT!. Never any soap or anything to dry your hands on either. Duty Free is basic but some things are cheap compared to Europe. The coffee shops are also basic and I have been charged exorbitant amounts for soft drinks - I now question each charge before I buy anything!

kuwait-airport,/airport-reviews/kuwait-airport,Kuwait Airport customer review,Mark Stableford,Kuwait,2015-07-10,"This has to be one of the worst, most confusing and incompetent airports on the planet.  Departing, there is not one single check-in hall, but four - each at completely different ends and corners of the airport. You can only get into two of them from the outside, while the other two are burrowed deep inside where you would not expect them, each of them again at different ends of the airport. It is completely confusing and time consuming to find where to check in, involving walking in and out the building (bearing in mind its 50c outside) and across large distances through what looks like a refugee camp. It takes many visits and missed flights to eventually get some idea of the layout and check in process. If you do manage to check in, you then have to encounter a myriad of incompetent, slow and lazy barriers from security through immigration. If your boarding pass is printed on a piece of paper instead of cardboard, you will be sent back to do your check-in all over again. On arriving in the country you can spend hours trying to get through immigration along with teaming masses of other poor souls (South East Asian migrant labour) with people running between queues as one is closed whilst her majesty there takes a phone call, wanders off to the toilet, or just simply closes up her booth having lost interest. You can end up at the back end of a queue again many times doing this. The airport completely lacks any signage or common sense. Asking for help or information is a pointless waste of time. Nobody knows, or nobody cares (unless you are lucky enough to find an Indian or Philippino member of staff), but then they are almost always completely powerless to help. Its also filthy. Unfortunately it sums up almost Kuwait infrastructure and management.  What a contrast to places like Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

The airport's access to downtown is very efficient and convenient but lacks enough foreign language staff to help foreigners in need. Centrair's top floor is divided into a Japanese and Western areas. the Japanese side sells local foods and products. The Western side has a wide variety of restaurants ranging from French to Korean. Shops range from last minute to luxury. One of its great options is a Japanese Hot Spring bath - but the wait time is close to 1.5 hours. The departure area is very clean and relaxing but lacks small shops or cafes for getting that last minute thing. The DFS is all luxury goods and lacks local products. Luckily it has nice big windows to watch planes come and go and enjoy the view of the bay. The departure area has multiple internet connection tables but require users to be members of certain providers. Several locations are wireless and free for everyone. Transfering between International and Domestic is a simple walk after going through customs.

manchester-airport,/airport-reviews/manchester-airport,Manchester Airport customer review,R Mendoza,United States,2013-01-30,From the States I prefer to clear immigration at Manchester rather than at my other choice Heathrow. The main reason is because the immigration officials at Manchester have been-so far-quite professional and better yet unbelievably civil and friendly. They beat out not only Heathrow officials but Newcastle and from what I read even John Lennon's. Heathrow officials either seem to be the old school dragons of the past who delight in interrogating foreigners or the new type of lazy unprofessional types who care only about their coffee breaks. Though I would rate the T3 departures lounge at Manchester as being fair in comparison to Heathrow's T5 which is far nicer I'd still put up with T3 just for the immigration officials. Security is relatively quick and painless though it seems as though in November 2012 they were doing some sort of audit and many 'random' passengers were selected for shoe and body scans. Those were ok except if one were in a hurry to catch one's flight it was time to panic. Also one's baggage went through a separate line to be scanned oftentimes being scanned quicker than its owners' shoes and bodies because the latter's officials just took forever and worse had 4 of them to scan one passenger (why who knows). Thus keeping track of one's baggage was a lesson in patience and agility.,NA,NA,NA,8,3,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,1

victoria-intl-airport,/airport-reviews/victoria-intl-airport,Victoria Intl Airport customer review,Harun Rathore,NA,2006-09-07,I flew over for a one-day trip from Vancouver on 30 August 2006. Most of the things stated in previous comments are true. But at least one has changed radically after the latest terror threats. In contrast to YVR there is only one security control for all flights (domestic flights to Canada and international flights to Seattle and Salt Lake City). The first oddity was that a security officer awaited me in front of the controls just to find out whether I wanted to go to the USA or to remain in Canada. As I was merely going to return to YVR I was told that I could keep my shoes on whereas all passengers travelling to Seattle had to take them off to have them x-rayed. (What if I smuggled in something for someone I was to meet in the departure lounge who was heading for the USA?) The second oddity was that the security officers checked my hand luggage by hand after screening and found two sealed one-portion packages of marmalade which I had taken from my hotel's breakfast room earlier that morning. The officer took them out and threw them away. If they had really been so dangerous I wonder why the staff in Vancouver had not already thrown them away on my way out.

So how does Toronto Pearson compared to them? I would say Toronto Pearson is not quite in the same class as them but they are slowly catching up. The elite airports offer a wide range of shops services and restaurants so you actually forget you are at an airport. Toronto Pearson looks somewhat barren but they are constantly adding new shops services and restaurants so the difference is becoming less noticeable. I often hear about complaints of Toronto Pearson being too large (long walking distance). Although this is a fair comment this can be said about any other major airport in the world. If you have mobility challenges please ask for assistance and staff will transport you to your gate. For others please make use of the moving walkway. My biggest issue with Toronto Pearson is the ""wait"" for checked-in luggage - it's slow! There is no need to rush off the plane to get to the luggage belt.

It is so embarrassing to me as a US Citizen how utterly disorganized JFK is after taking flights into and out of Gatwick and CDG in France. We arrived and found our way to the kiosks and knew what to do (but many others struggled and didn't get any help) because we have travelled a few times internationally in the past two years. Then we waited on a fairly long line but it did move and the Customs officer was very welcoming to us and explained the ""receipt and kiosk"" was going to be the way of the future. We left to get our luggage which we found quickly and then went to exit to our ground transportation through the agriculture department. There were lanes set up for people to exit but nobody was in the lanes. When we walked into the lane to exit other passengers started screaming that ""there was a line to exit."" When I looked back there was a line circling in and around the three carousels - must've been a half mile long. I moved on to ask if we had gone to the wrong location to exit. Then suddenly a woman appeared and screamed ""Wait! Okay go there (pointing to the lanes to exit)"" the lanes filled up and people were allowed to go. The officers were relaxed and said ""Welcome back"" so I have no idea why so many people thought they had to wait out by the baggage claim. Clearly there was no communication or direction given. When we finally got out to be picked up there were no police officers to direct traffic and people were parked in lanes and not moving for 20-30 minutes so no one behind could get in.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,C Mark,United Kingdom,2014-06-25,"12.30pm June 20th. On arriving and without warning we were held in the corridor downstairs from passport control for over an hour then once upstairs in passport control we waited another 45 minutes to clear passport control. While in the corridor there were no announcements for over 25 minutes. When a passenger announcement was made it simply said ""It is necessary to hold passengers at this time. Thank you The UK Boarder Agency"". No explanation was given for the delay or how long we would be held there. As more and more flights arrived and disembarked into the terminal the queue went all the way back into the lower arrivals gates. After shuffling the length of the queue to use the toilet - some 150meters back - I alerted airport workers that the queue was dangerously close to reaching the bottom of the down escalator near the gates. A quick thinking worker used the emergency shut-off switch to avoiding passengers from piling on top of those in the queue at the bottom of the escalator. The workers were until then unaware of the queue or closing of the Passport Control. Ryanair workers were equally unaware and or unconcerned and said this happened regularly. The Boarder Agency staff member who cleared me blamed Ryanair for landing it's flights all at once. Passenger safety and the reputation of the airport and the airlines that use it are at stake. Yet in all this time there were no explanations announcements or apologies of any kind from anyone involved. Not the UK Boarder Agency Ryanair nor MAG (Manchester Airport Group). Clearly there is little or no communication or co-operation between them and no responsibility for passengers in these incidents. However it is Manchester Airport Group who operate the airport and have the responsibility for passengers while in the airport - They could have at least made an announcement to explain what had happened and to apologise for the delay howsoever caused. Maybe it will take an injury or a passenger revolt before it is taken seriously. As Ryanair have never valued ""passenger experience"" - so we expect little responsibility from them. The UK Boarder Agency is essentially unaccountable to anyone and would never own up to any responsibility. The experience of being held for the better part of 2 hours is not one paying passengers expect these days. It cannot be beyond the wit of the airport to manage these situations better.

The arrival was fast there are enough signs to navigate through the airport ATMs are located in arrival and departure areas and restrooms are near the gates. After a 5 minute walk we reached the luggage belt and collected our bags just a few minutes later. We took a taxi to our hotel which are stopping right in front of the terminal. On our way back for the return flight we took one of the Shuttle busses which is much cheaper and also quite fast. The bag drop for the return flight was very easy and it was possible to drop them in self service or at a counter. Even if there were lots of flights at this time the following security check was fast. Only shortage in the check-in area: there are not a lot of shops but a restaurant with a nice view on the apron. The security area was modern and had lots of shops of different kinds free wifi was available and a lot of power outlets.

The U.S. customs at YYZ (Toronto) is an absolute nightmare. Being herded like cattle into one room not knowing what was going on since we'd not experienced this when previously flying to the U.S. We were only allowed to go through 45 mins prior to our flight time after being at the airport at least 2 hours in advance. No incentive to arrive early. No option to have a leisurely cup of coffee a bite to eat or grab a magazine and feel relaxed. During this 45 minute period we still had to deposit luggage go through security use the self serve kiosk (some of which were non operational) and then passport control. A secondary inspection was required for us and we were pulled aside. Well as you can imagine we definitely weren't going anywhere! Thanks to the Air Canada flight being delayed being pushed through security and running to the gate we managed to make our flight. Not an experience we'd like to repeat. Travelling in today's climate is difficult enough without placing unnecessary obstacles in the way.

Staff was friendly and helpful and offered a free replacement immediately. Left at T1 via Cathay. Staff was knowledgeable and helpful and checked our bags through final destination. Note that immigration is the first check point which runs pretty smoothly and you can bring your bottle of water through immigration since security is not until you get to your gate before your flight (which is nice in my opinion) but this also means you need to plan extra time at the gate for security checks. We tried to get connected to the free wifi but it asked for local phone number or registration at the information counter (which was quite a hassle compared to Hong Kong or Japan where we transit); but as other reviewers have mentioned there are several free internet stations in the terminal that you could use just not so convenient if you just want to use your smartphone to get connected for a few minutes.

On the positive side it's one of the fastest airports to get through on both departure and arrival it's clean the layout is very easy to understand and navigate and it has a free rest are with lots and lots of plugs and free unlimited wi-fi. The facilities especially restaurants in the passenger area are very poor and expensive even as the selection and prices are above standard before the security checkpoints: a bizarre choice on part of whoever designed the airport. There are no trains (yet - I'm told they're building the tracks) but the taxis at the airport are clean fast and cheap and there are a lot of them (it costs about 20 EUR to get to downtown Prague and it takes about 40 minutes). There is one thing that just boggles the mind which is that Czech Airlines flights make people get off the plane on arrival squeeze all the passengers onto a single bus and drive them to arrivals.

With the hours wait then on the bus to bus park walk to the metro which was 1 mile away then change twice to get to our hotel. It took us 3 hours to get to our hotel after landing at Beauvais. On our return journey we waited just over an hour for the shuttle and were told by the hotel that as the shuttle company are obviously unreliable we will book you a taxi so that you will catch your flight. Just as we were waiting on a taxi the shuttle arrived at the hotel entrance. We cancelled the taxi as we had paid up front for the shuttle. The driver never even apologised and got us to airport 1 hour before the flight but it was a hair raising experience as he broke the speed limit most of the journey.

It is a smallish regional airport with a few places to eat. The bathroom facilities are abundant and clean while gate areas are somewhat outdated and a little shopworn. The airport is divided into two main departure/arrival wings; previously each had its own TSA screening area. Recent renovations resulted in consolidation to a single TSA screening area with capacity to manage both gate wings. Because I was not aware of the renovations, I took my usual path to my assigned gate only to find that I had to backtrack to the TSA area and then back out to the gate. Perhaps further renovations (and/or improvements in signage) could result in more a more direct and efficient pathway to TSA. Once through the mostly efficient TSA process, the walk to the gate was fairly quick and straightforward. TSA lines can be long (but not like LAX, DCA, etc.) during peak periods so be prepared. Parking is adjacent to the terminal with very reasonable rates. I've left my car there for a few days at a time without concern. While sometimes flights are less expensive out of nearby cities (Rochester, Buffalo, Albany for example) I choose to fly out of Syracuse because it is so accessible.

It has been recently expanded and a new arrivals hall should be opening shortly. Arrivals are straightforward both Schengen and non-Schengen. There are two belts for luggage and then you are straight out to the arrivals hall. Car rental desks are opposite where you come out and there are a couple of cash machines as well as a bar and a few shops. At the bar you pay at the cash register then take the receipt to the bar. Apart from the car rentals there are taxis just outside arrivals although these are pricey (about 20 Euro to the centre of town). It's about 12km to Alghero. Another option is to turn right and cross the parking lot. About 100 metres away are bus stops with orange buses running to Alghero and other buses heading to Sassari and Cagliari. Buy tickets for the Alghero buses at the souvenir shop (about 70 cents) in the terminal. If this is closed ride the bus anyway. The driver will sometimes stop for you to buy tickets sometimes not. Departures is equally straightforward at the other end of the terminal from arrivals. Note though that there is absolutely nothing to do airside so don't go through too soon. Non-Schengen international flights (e.g. to the UK) all leave from gate 1 and you have to queue for passport checks before you are allowed in to the gate area.

Ironically in the weeks before this visit Chicago was being promoted as a welcoming tourist destination in commercials on UK TV networks. I fully understand that the Mayor's tourism dept. does not control the activities of Dept. of Homeland Security or airline employees and while I can respect that immigration procedures are very necessary for the security of US borders it is completely ridiculous to use resources to promote the city in overseas TV markets but then not adequately resource immigration procedures to facilitate those visits.

belgrade-airport,/airport-reviews/belgrade-airport,Belgrade Airport customer review,Dejan Markovic,NA,2003-12-08,Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is undergoing heavy expansion and reconstruction works which are scheduled to be finished by May 2004. Because of this the International Terminal has been closed and all passengers have been re-routed to the Domestic Terminal which was 'adapted' to handle International traffic. This was done in a less than perfect way which makes the airport look really bad. First off all the Domestic terminal was built in the early 60s and has never undergone works to 'update it'. It is much smaller than the International counterpart (built in the early 80s) which expands on three floors. Hopefully when the airport re-opens in late spring thing will go much smoother. In the meantime airport officilas should display some 'Sorry for the inconvenience' and explanation signs.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,J Binns,New Zealand,2013-05-05,Dubai is a massive airport and it takes a long time to get from one end to the other. The airport is very crowded with bodies lying everywhere in the main passageways. More seating areas are needed away from the main passageways. Toilets and showers are inadequate for the volume of passengers using the airport. When in transit the security procedure after getting off your plane is frustrating and can be very time-consuming after a long and tiring flight. It always seems difficult to find trolleys for carrying hand baggage. For transit passengers the trolleys need to be located after the security check. Many of my friends in New Zealand avoid Dubai preferring to fly via Singapore (Changi Airport) which seems to be spotlessly clean well organised and with friendly and helpful assistants.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
hyderabad-airport,/airport-reviews/hyderabad-airport,Hyderabad Airport customer review,Praveen Babu,NA,2007-02-26,I've flown through Hyderabad dozens of times over my life the old Begumpet terminal. The airport itself is acceptable by Indian standards. There are plenty of baggage boys to take care of you though. The carts are free but may not be in the best quality. The domestic terminal is much better than the international its been renovated and has shiny marble all over. Mosquitos are an issue in both terminals. Air conditioning is bad and there is a humidty problem in both terminals. What's odd with this airport is that certain halls and sections are air conditioned while others are not. For example immigrations is not airconditioned domestic departures is. Some sections of the airport are clean while others are not. Overall an inconsistent airport. In general this airport is not up to international standards. Fortunately facilities are being upgraded in 2008 in the form of a brand new airport in the city outskirts unfortunately it appears the same staff will be managing that airport as well.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
yerevan-airport,/airport-reviews/yerevan-airport,Yerevan Airport customer review,A Maserejian,NA,2005-10-24,Arrived at Zvartnots International for the first time in September of 2005 at 5am - no direct connect hall linking airline to terminal upon descending aircraft steps was surrounded by what looked like army soldiers and was told photography was forbidden. At first impression found airport a very unique shape however structure was in terrible shape with crumbling walls and bare lighting. The control tower looked extremely outdated with apparent water stains at top of structure as seen though it's distinct bubble plastic windows. Airport and passport Staff seemed to be very laid back and unwilling to help. Baggage claim was small with very outdated equipent not very organized in handling transfer of bags to owners furthermore complicated by the mass of youngsters hired as ' skycaps'. I was given a ticket once all my bags we're found and told to pay $7US at a baggage check-out 'counter' managed by a rude teenager in order to recieve a stamp allowing me to exit airport. My experience out of Armenia at 3:30am was just as chaotic mass chaos at departure drop off  no unloading zone causing cars to back up or side swipe you as you try to get your bags from a vehicle to actual terminal. Once inside there we're no lines seen anywhere just mass crowds of people pushing and shoving through check- in lines. Security check in was unorganized - outdated scanning equipment and a staff that seemed to lack standard airport screening procedures. Again there was no line or order through this procedure either it was basically push and shove your way in to security line or miss your flight kind of a situation. Once behind the security check point and at actual departure gate I was directed to walk down a few level of steps to tarmac level that led me to an old waiting lobby to catch a bus to the aircraft. No security officials we're noted at this location but for two baggage handlers standing outside having a cigarette a few hundred feet away from other airliners refueling. I noticed a Lufthansa airbus that had a covered hall linking it to actual aircraft and it was the only exsiting one noticed. Once bus arrived to my actual Armavia aircraft people just rushed out and pushed their way up the stairs having to show boarding pass to three Armavia Airline official's that simply stood at second level of aircraft stairs with blank looks on their faces not attempting to assist in facilitating passengers with children elderly or women boarding. Overall Zvartonts International needs allot of improvement and I did notice the construction expansion and feel that it's on it's way to imnprovement. Armenia was an amazing experience and the staff at this airport do not reflect the warmth and freindliness the Republic of Armenia offers to it's many visitors. I would definately go through Zvartnots on my next trip without any hesitation hoping it will have transformed and matured to an international class service facility.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

beijing-capital-airport,/airport-reviews/beijing-capital-airport,Beijing Capital Airport customer review,Jason Martin,United States,2015-07-01,"Recently arrived and departed through Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3, and it was not a good experience. To point out the only positive, I am sure everyone agrees the architecture and terminal structure is very modern and nice. Other than that there are no positives. I arrived from Hong Kong and waited over an hour in the immigration line. There were only three passport control agents for hundreds of passengers. While waiting in line there were Chinese Security guards yelling at passengers in Chinese, leaving Non-Chinese speaking passengers very confused. After you clear immigration you take a train to the main terminal. Going through baggage claim was a hassle and customs checks everyone's bags. I waited over 45 minutes in a taxi line. Then the fun started. On departures, do not use a mobile boarding pass. You have to scan your boarding pass in order to go on the the train. Then you arrive at the satellite terminal and wait in a long line to go through passport control. After they check your boarding pass and passport, you have to wait in another long line for another official to check your boarding pass and passport and to go through security. The space is really small and people were pushing. I was flying Business Class and had to beg the Security Official to let me use the fast track lane, while people were cutting it with no explanation. Once they check your boarding pass and passport again, they make you take out iPads. I went to the Air China Business Class Lounge, and needed to use Wifi (which you would expect they would have at the lounge) - they have a machine where you have to scan your passport and it gives you a number. The WiFi didn't even work, so it was a waste of time. IF you are going to the US they search for liquids right by the boarding gate and will take away your water (will make you depend on the rations by the flight attendants), even through they had several checkpoints before hand. All in all, this is a very disorganized and a passenger unfriendly airport. I will not be traveling back to Beijing anytime soon because going throughout this airport was extremely stressful.",Arrival and Departure,01-06-2015,Solo Leisure,1,1,3,1,NA,1,1,1,NA,0
luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,Peter Valentine,United Kingdom,2012-07-01,Have used Luton many many times since 1960 but the latest experience means I'll never fly from there again. First of all there was the apparently permanent difficulty of reaching the airport due to the ludicrous layout of the approach roads and the appalling drop-off facility for which a charge is now made. After clearing check-in with Easy-Jet passing through security was a complete nightmare. The queue was down the non-working escalators and into the main concourse. Of course in the interests of profiteering it was possible to buy a 'fast-track' through security for an unacceptable price. The Departure Lounge had a lack of seats which meant standing around until the departure gate was announced after which a 10 to 15 minute walk was necessary with no moving walkways to assist the elderly or those with young children. At the departure gate no seating was available at all. On returning 4 days later arrival at 22.10 hours the wait at Immigration/Passport Control was in excess of 15 minutes. Pick-up was again chaotic and had to be paid for. So now Luton Airport want to increase from 10m passengers per annum to over 18m. Well with the currently unacceptable standards they will be lucky if their passenger totals don't drop right back. Without exception it can be said that Luton is the worst airport purporting to be of 'International' standard I have ever encountered.,NA,NA,NA,1,1,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

The transportation to the airport is OK. taxis are cheap and in case you have only 1 luggage the train is OK even though the ""City Terminal"" at Makkasan is still non functional after being opened for more than 3-4 years. No check-in in the city just a large vast empty terminal to catch the train. Departure passport control and check is usually good and fast. Arrivals is always a pain an its really hit and miss. My last Arrival took me only 20 minutes but the Moscow flight 55 minutes. Officers are still too gloomy and treat arrivals like cattle.

I have used the long-term parking in lots 3 and 4 and found them to be fairly convenient for short trips. You have to wait for the bus but it comes pretty often. My only complaint is about the security. In terminal A the security checkpoints are so overcrowded (and they have two of them!) so it takes time to get through them. Terminal C seemed less so.

On arrival we were disembarked pretty quickly and efficiently and from there allowed through immigration controls just as happily. The only gripe on arrival was that (it might have been due to the work) the car rental offices were scattered to the 4 winds with no real signage to point you in the right direction so the relevant one was hard to find. The return journey was the same really. Descent queue times and friendly and efficient staff. There were 2 little niggles though. First the staff in some of the eating places could have been nicer. Their card machine wasn't working but they made no effort to tell people instead letting everyone queue and put in hot food orders only telling them after that they couldn't pay. That was just one cafe potentially having a bad day though. The other problem was that the gate we were directed to required going through a further security check point. Although it didn't make clear that you were going in the right direction. A large bunch of people then gathered at this point as no one wanted to go through in case it was the wrong gate (no signs at this point) and there would be difficulty getting back.

It was supposed to be renovated for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and a few weeks before the tournament the airport was in utter chaos. It seemed as if I was in a construction sight. I came back during the World Cup and things improved a little giving it a more pleasant atmosphere. I am Brazilian so the language is not a problem but I spoke with some people that passed through the airport and they complained how few people spoke English. The airport does not receive many international flights. Only flights are to Buenos Aires-Argentina Miami-USA Lisboa-Portugal and Panama City-Panama and only a few of those are daily. Most of the times I arrived to this airport were on domestic flights but in July I came from the USA using a Copa Airlines flight from Panama City. I was puzzled as to why the plane did not parked directly at the gate since it arrived early in the morning and there were many finger gates with no planes parked whatsoever. Immigration officials were not friendly and showed little professionalism the lady that checked my passport had one earphone on and was chewing gum with her mouth open. The luggage carrousel is a complete mess as the area is very cramped and small. Customs was the only positive as once I had my luggage I went through it quickly. This airport has very bad air conditioning and in the summer it can be horribly hot inside and having to wait to board with very little seating can be a hassle. It is really far from downtown Belo Horizonte but the roads are good and I recommend taking the ""Conexão Aeroporto"" buses that take you straight to the center of the city for a rate of R$ 21 (around 10 dollars). This option is very advantageous because taking a cab directly from the airport is ridiculously expensive. Have seen worse airports but this one is one that I am certainly not very fond of.

Once you're finished clearing customs visitors are subjected to lines in a cramped dingy hallway prior to being re-screened by the ever faithful TSA. After clearing security you are once again subjected to dimly lit low ceiling hallways manned by 2 to 3 US Airways employees at each turn informing you to stay to the right and don't you forget it!

DIA has a huge variety of gift shops book stores restaurants and coffee houses though the restaurants do tend to be kind of generic. If you are planning on connecting from an international flight to a domestic flight I would recommend keeping at least a two-hour gap as customs in Denver can be a little slow but you should be able to get out in about an hour. Domestic arrival into Denver is easy as baggage generally comes quickly RTD skyride buses get you into the city for about $10. Thankfully due to the recent surge by Southwest DIA isn't dominated by United Airlines but flying out of Denver is still a little more expensive than other US airports. The architecture is stunning and the airport looks new despite being nearly 13 years old!

In front of visa counter I saw crowds of passengers applying for visa (fortunately I did not need a visa) so if you are flying with a wide-body aircraft and you need a visa it pays to disembark as early as possible so you could proceed to visa counter quickly. The taxi stand outside arrival hall claimed to offer 'govt-regulated' fares to different parts of the city but the list could be ignored as it is pricey. Bargain with drivers. There was an exchange shop at the far end of the arrival hall which offered a relatively better exchange rate - Very similar to the rate in city so if one needs to buy some TZS that's a better option.

There are no rail connections. Bus connections are quite frequent and there is always bus connection with your flight (at least when flying Croatia Airlines - Croatian national carrier). Bus price is app. 35$. At the entrance to the airport there is policeman standing and controlling the traffic which is something I'm not used to. Short car park is charged at app. 1 $ per hour (March 2003). Airport itself serves domestic and international flights. It's not a big airport so do not expect a lot. There are few check-in desks. Politeness of staff depends on the people working but normally they are quite OK. Never have experienced rudeness. Airport interior reflects the period in which it was built. Some renovations were done but it's far from modern. When flying on domestic routes there is only one small waiting room which is not separated from the rest of the airport. After passing security control gates are next thing. No any shop no nothing. Directly to the gates. Passengers are always transported to the planes by busses. International departures are not much better. There is duty free whose variety of products can't be compared to other western or even central European. There is restaurant on the airport with rather expensive and quite non edible food. There is one carousel for domestic arrivals which is once again not separated from the hall for non- passengers. The room can be full of smoke as there is one bar near to it and smoking is allowed. International arrivals are catastrophic (or at least they were when flying there). Passport control officers are in small ""cabins"" and their attitude is one saying ""What the hell do you do here?"". Really rude (an this isn't just one of the officer all of them are like that).

There are lots of car rental offices on the airport won't comment decor of those (""great"" chairs in from of each one from before the WWII).

The checkin area reminded me of the old days with cardboard flight destination signs and this was an area that could be easily changed for the better. The lines crossed each other to the destinations and did cause some friction between customers. The car parking was an experience but again was satisfactory. I do not understand why the local bus companies especially those going to Leamington. Stratford do not call in. On returning the baggage was certainly a LOT better than Birmingham so a plus there. In the departure lounge there was a good choice of food and drink at great prices - no rip off here. Also a small point . The newspapers were out and available from about 0500.

The result was 2.5 hours to clear immigration and missing my connecting flight last of the night from Houston. I had to pay for my own hotel and wait on standby for a flight the next day.

Also when people like me asked other staff for help and we could see we would miss our flights we were completely ignored if not treated with disdain. Dozens of us missed flights and TSA staff acted as if we were nuisance for asking for help. I have a choice of hubs and now will avoid Houston.

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,M Oda,Japan,2011-09-28,I use this airport mainly to connect from United's Int'l flights to its domestic flights. Although connecting passengers are to use separate Immigration and Customs at C concourse the situation is even worse in comparison with Chicago-O'Hare or Los Angeles where you have to move from one terminal to another. In my past two trips this year both of which involved Int'l to Dom transfer on UA there were 90 mins between arrival and departure. This was much longer than the minimum connection time published by United. On both occasions I did not have enough time (my first occasion I made the connecting flight 5 minutes prior to its departure time and the second time I was able to make a connection because the outgoing flight was delayed for 2 hours). There are too few immigration officers to handle passengers during the peak time (around 3-5pm) in which a number of 777s and 747s arrive almost every 5 minutes. What made it even worse was the train to connect terminals. If you were connecting to flights (esp. UA Express or Continental) leaving from A concourse you have to walk to the middle of C concourse go down the stairs backward wait for a train then once you have reached the concourses A/B you have to go all the way up to cross a bridge to go to the gate areas. This would normally take at least 25-30 mins compared to the time when there was a mobile lounge operating between C and A.

If you follow the visitor signs it doesn't work as you're supposed to follow the American stream. The American stream is only labelled as citizen and residents.

In the last year though things have started going backwards. The customer service has gone down visibly people wise. Staff experience seems to be an issue. Also now you get hassle checking in your bags. After the luggage has been weighed you have to take it to a different location within the airport to drop off. Arrivals screens don't display flight numbers there are no longer direct flights to almost anywhere outside of Greece and when you arrive you don't know where to pick up your luggage from as the screens above the conveyor belts don't work.

Went up to the security area to be held up for all of 5 mins which for Manchester was extremely good. We passed through with no hassle at all and was even told by staff to have a good flight/holiday which again we found very good for Manchester (which is not the norm). We found our gate after going through dutyfree shop. At 9.35am the plane pulled onto the stand (214) and we had to wait for all the passengers/baggage to be taken off before we could board at 10am we started to board our Onur Air flight to Dalaman we were all on by 10.15am and we pushed back.

There are two terminals and the airport authority frequently changes which departures leave from which terminal. It is not easy to get from one terminal to another - an infrequent shuttle bus is provided for this purpose. Entering Terminal 1 from Terminal 2 requires dragging your carry-on bags up a flight of stairs (no elevator provided) and the departure lounges and business class lounge in this terminal are uncomfortable even if you can find a seat. Terminal 2 is only slightly better - but the bottleneck through security is ridiculously inefficient - full of pushing and shoving and cutting in line. The departure gates in Terminal 2 are slightly better than in Terminal 1 as is the business class lounge. That being said the food at both lounges is terrible and the seating uncomfortable.

It is one of the few airports offering the opportunity to do tax free shopping on arrival. Both arriving and leaving was a breeze (as we were still within Schengen area). Staff friendly and competent and in arrivals a lot of useful information material on Iceland and Reykjavik is available. When leaving we spent some time in a very pleasant atrium-like space where all shops and eateries are concentrated. I must say that with the devaluation of the kronur price levels were friendly for visitors from euro-countries so we did some shopping. Quality of the shops in our opinion was really good. Keep in mind that many Icelandic shops offer the possibility to get a refund of VAT (almost 25%!) . Ask for the special coupon when making a purchase. If the sum exceeds 5000 kr you must get it stamped by customs first. After this you will get the refund from the landsbanki office in the departures area. You can choose between a cash refund in kronur or a refund in euro/GBP/USD to your credit card (which may take some time). The only problem with the airport is transport to Reykjavik. Most visitors who are not being picked up will depend on the Flybuss. Even though this was adequate for us it got really full and was not too comfortable.

Terminal A (the larger and newer of the 2 terminals) has been remodeled to add more windows and light and the dark filthy carpeting has been replaced. They still haven't bothered to install moving walkways despite the very long distances between the terminal entrance/exit and the farthest gates however and the narrow corridors and lack of floor space cause major crowding problems during peak times. Food and beverage options are very basic with overpriced and bad food. Terminal B is set for a major renovation. They will finally add jetways and build a new facility that brings it into the 21st Century.

Yesterday I queued for 1.5 hours to get through immigration. It was impossible to find where the queue started and which queue led to which counter there was hardly any staff to maintain the order. Security staff are poor mannered and sometimes can be very offensive. Once passing through security things started to get better: the food selection was good and plenty of cafes and shops.

Secondly be very careful about using credit cards in the parking payment machines in the airport. I used my credit card to pay for 15 mins parking which should have cost 3 pounds when the credit card bill arrived the machine had charged me over 300 pounds! This apparently was due to a fault on the machine but it took several months and threats of going to the press to recover it all. Despite these minor flaws Doncaster Sheffield airport is a pleasant under-used provincial airport which although a little isolated is a pleasant change from the crowds of Heathrow or Gatwick.,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

For years Air NZ flew into Terminal 2 which whilst dowdy and lacking services at least had a relatively quick US Customs clearance time. I often bring candy back from NZ and so check yes to the relevant question on the Customs Declaration. TBIT has an electronic 'triage' system - the queue for which took 10-15 mins. Because I checked yes on one question I was sent to the queue manually checking incoming passengers who needed palm prints or eye scans. This line took over 30mins to navigate whereas those with all ""No"" checked sailed through. Needless to say bags were on the carrousel once through those two lines only to be greeted by a 3rd queue for another almost 30mins to hand over the Customs printout and clear the terminal! I only just made my connecting flight. The rule of thumb should be to allow 3 hours all up for a domestic connection if arriving at TBIT.

My bag took forever to arrive which was annoying as I had been in Business Class. Departure was horrible again hijacked by a porter but this time it helped to speed me through what passed for security. Was identified by a Qatar Airways employee who escorted me to business lounge. Porter at this stage demanded £50 if I wanted to see my bag again. I gave him my last 200PK and told him he was welcome to my dirty laundry. Qatar Airways staff was very annoyed but said he could do nothing about it. When departure came was escorted past queues of people and was deposited at my seat. Great service. In future would not use porter but remember to go to kiosk to pay 500PK as departure tax.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,C Nightingale,Hong Kong,2013-12-23,I recently booked an international flight from Hong Kong to Boston and had to move from one terminal to another at LAX. The most frustrating problem at LAX was the poor signage. Once I made it through immigration and customs I had to ask several airport staff for directions to the next terminal because there were no signs at all. Once out on the street I continued to ask strangers for directions. Coming back I was very worried about making my connection and the problem seemed more frustrating. You'd think 'Tom Bradley' would be signed outside the other terminals for those people who are traveling internationally. When I finally found it and checked in there were no obvious signs to the gates. I followed one sign upstairs but it led to restaurants with no other signs to gates. Another sign saying 'Gates' led to the side of the restaurants but no more gate signs. Finally I asked an airport employee who said the entrances the signs were supposed to lead to were not actually operational. She was very helpful and took me to a tiny entrance somewhere else that led to the gates. LAX please get some signs.

It took me almost two hours to slug through security and customs at DTW after arriving on time on a scheduled flight. DTW personnel (of which there are many but poorly trained) seemed taken by surprise by the arrival of my flight. TSA lines were needlessly long due to severe understaffing. DTW and TSA seem to have conspired to hire many employees to shout instructions to arriving passengers to cram into inadequate screening lines rather than to provide more screening lines. Avoid arriving at DTW from an international airport at all costs: TSA + DTW = totally inadequate to the point of utter incompetence.

dallas-fort-worth-airport,/airport-reviews/dallas-fort-worth-airport,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,Jessica Tijani,NA,2005-03-23,This airport is not as bad as people are saying. The only negative thing I can comment on is the long walk from terminal to terminal. However after 6 hours flight it was a pleasure to be able to stretch our legs and walk around a bit before our next flight. The check-out counter wasn't as bad bearing in mind we had our kids between us. Even my little on wanted to use the toilet as soon as we got to the immigration counter. It wasn't our turn but the staff asked the rest of the family to stay while I took my daughter to the toilets and back. We did have to collect our bags (route was to Orlando) and recheck them so they could be taken to Orlando. As soon as we left immigration there were airport staff waiting for us asking for bags to Orlando. The other negative is that you always have to check the boards to check which terminal you will be connecting. The announcement on our plane from London gave a different terminal when we were coming out but on getting inside airport the boards gave a completely different one. However I think it is a good airport. Yes the security checks is madness but this is the world we live in. I would rather go through this sort of security checks than be killed by some terrorist. In my opinion it is not a bad airport for its size.

There are no terminals as such and so it can be relatively quick to get from check in to departure gate that's if the luggage belts aren't broken. As it stands it's quite a pain free experience but the airport won't be able to cope with many more flights.

bristol-airport,/airport-reviews/bristol-airport,Bristol Airport customer review,A Finn,United Kingdom,2014-09-10,I'm a regular user. Quick access from city centre by regular frequent bus. A bit over-priced at £11 return for a 20 minutes journey each way but cheaper than cabs. The on-airport cab service costs about £28 one way to the city which is £8 more than other minicab companies. The airport is generally efficient and quick to get through because it is small. Security usually copes but can get congested at peak times. If you forget a plastic bag for your liquids don't buy one as they will give you one. Three things that ought to change: they ought not to charge people dropping off and picking up and staying for less than 10 minutes - it just annoys people and they spend the money they earn from it employing security staff in trucks to drive around trying to stop people dropping off and picking up outside the designated area. They ought to provide a tap somewhere after security so you can refill your water bottle - they only provide hot water in the toilets. Both these things are obviously about earning a few more quid but they are mean spirited and undermine customer goodwill and that is just bad for business.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,Andrew Stevenson,United Kingdom,2013-10-10,This review relates to the Emirates / Qantas Terminal 3. This consists of two separate concourses Aâand B connected by an underground train. Despite the massive expansion at Dubai Airport there are still insufficient gates at the terminal at peak hours meaning that some flights park on stand necessitating a long bus transfer to the terminal. Security checks on transiting passengers can be slow. The terminal itself is basically a huge shopping mall with airbridges attached but is otherwise modern clean and attractive. The terminal is very busy but despite what others have said I found plentiful seating although there are insufficient toilets. The individual concourses are easy to navigate but transfers between the concourses require a descent underground via a series of escalators to reach the train that shuttles between the terminals where rather brusque staff bark orders and organize you into queues. Same in reverse when you disembark the train at the other end. Once you reach your departure gate there is at least free wi-fi available albeit only with a moderate strength signal. If you're lucky enough as a transit passenger for your flights to arrive and depart from airbridges within the same concourse then it can be a quick and painless transfer but if you get caught up with bus transfers from remote stands and having to travel between concourses then what might otherwise be a comfortable 2 hour connection becomes a nerve wracking experience.,NA,NA,NA,7,3,4,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Check-in is always easy but bag drop for FlyBe can be a nightmare due to the small number of desks allowed. Security can also be very busy and a real pain at peak times but the duty free is of good quality. My major gripe however is with the pick up/drop off. You can only drop off at the front of the terminal. On my last arrival a very rude employee (of Meteor Carparks) told me to ""move"" as the area was for drop offs only. His manner was close to being verbally abusive. When I pointed out to him that I could not contact the driver regarding this he told me the driver would get a fine. There were no signs indicating this to the driver or anywhere that I could see so I think he was making it up.

Bus to transfer from plane to Terminal 1 passed through passport/customs/ baggage hall very efficiently and picked up a taxi outside without a long wait (not even 5 mins).

Check in was amazingly quick - no queues at all also passed through passport and security check with no queues. There were ample places to buy food and drinks at reasonable prices. Our gate number was displayed early and there were plenty of places to sit and wait plus watch TV.

The main terminal building is relatively new and is small without being too small. Check in is very efficient as is baggage reclaim staff are very friendly and since there are not many flights operating from the island the departure lounge is never busy. The only downside is that you cannot access the departure gates until your flight is available for boarding which can mean a very rushed visit to duty free ! The gate areas are not big enough to cope with a 150 seat B737 and are a little bit run down but as you are not spending a great deal of time there it's not a major issue. It is worth flying in by jet aircraft if you get a chance ( for example BMI Baby services from mainland UK airports such as Manchester / East Midlans ) as the scenic approach followed by the short runway make for a rather entertaining landing !,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

colombo-airport,/airport-reviews/colombo-airport,Colombo Airport customer review,Gyan Fernando,Sri Lanka,2012-11-28,The problem with this airport is that it is well away from Colombo the only road can be very busy and therefore you need to arrive well ahead of time. Getting into the building takes a long time because of the security. The problem here is that non-travellers try to get into the terminal which is not allowed (except with a permit) and so the security guy at the entrance checks your passport and asks for your ticket. With e- tickets there is no need to carry any documentation and so this causes a little bit of unpleasantness. Once past security all baggage is x-rayed which is fair enough but there is only one machine. There is a lot of queue jumping. Once past that hurdle the next one is trying to get to check-in. If you arrived early you will have to hang around until the check-in opens. Once past check-in things do get better. Immigration staff are generally courteous and immigration is painless. Once airside there is one reasonable but overpriced restaurant. Service is slow. If flights get delayed do expect chaos with the lovely but clueless hostesses. It is very easy to get into the wrong area as gate staff are pre-occupied. This is the only International airport in Sri Lanka at the time of writing and therefore I have no choice but to recommend it but with reservations.,NA,NA,NA,4,2,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,1

We had almost 5 hrs transit time so was very relaxed. Luckily both the incoming and outgoing flights were on time. I guess it will be tight if you have a transit time of anything around 1hr since there might be long queue at security controls and the long walk between Terminal D to F. We had to first go to the transit desk and then they guide you to passport control (transit without visa) and then proceed for security. The signs at the terminal are easy to follow and you don't have to ask anyone. Terminals D and E seems to be new and very well maintained. There are lines of duty free shops through the transit. The bad part is that the air conditioner only works in terminal D and E. You go down the stairs to terminal F and the whole terminal has no ac and it was very hot. Terminal F looks like a shopping mall and extremely crowded. So we spent our time in terminal E. Many shops there don't accept Euro / $$ or the exchange rate is extremely unfavourable. We spotted automated teller machines that converted Euro or $$ to Roubles & it had a more favourable exchange rate. The food and drinks here is actually overpriced.

san-jose-airport,/airport-reviews/san-jose-airport,San Jose Airport customer review,C Rodriguez,NA,2006-01-29,SJC has replaced Houston-Hobby (HOU) as my least favorite airport ever. First you should know that the two terminals are very different experiences. Terminal A is the newer cleaner one but is still very small with little to no room for people to wait on arriving flights. Obviously it was designed before 9/11 when you could go to the gate to wait on arriving passengers. Services inside security are limited. Other than that Terminal A is ok. The parking garage is always very close and rates are reasonable. Terminal C is a nightmare in every respect. First they simply refuse to hire enough security screeners. Many times I have been in a security line for 45 minutes because there was only one lane open during peak hours. Given the low amount of traffic at this airport compared to others in the Bay Area this is inexplicable. There is little or no food or drink inside the security area either so plan ahead. The entire terminal is very dirty and sometimes smells strange. They don't even have jetways so you will have to walk out on the tarmac under a tattered canvas cover and up a rollaway stairway to get into your plane. Not a big deal to me but it's kind of ghetto and the old people don't seem to appreciate the climb. The long-term parking area is a long ride on the very slow shuttle bus. Shuttle service is spotty late at night. It's faster and cheaper to park at one of the off-airport parking lots. Signage throughout the airport is unreliable and intermittent. However when driving it's flat-out wrong. Good luck finding your way to 101 the first time you drive out of the airport. If you follow the markings on the pavement you'll be going around the whole airport again. A lot of people in the Bay Area have an irrational fear of large airports and thus seem to favor SJC but nobody can tell me with a straight face that this place is well-run.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Car parking costs are in line with other airports security no issue (I was expecting a long delay for a midweek 06.30 flight but was through in no time at all). I have never found security staff anything other than pleasant and professional. Returning - again no issues through passport control there was a queue all desks were staffed and the queue kept moving. It compares more than favourably with other regional airports across Europe. I'd like to make an observation on other largely negative comments about walking time to gates and irritating charges for trolleys and car pick up. Probably 80% of the airports landing fees revenue is from low cost carriers who are not prepared to pay for frills including moving walkways and air bridges. Even at airports with these facilities the likes of Easyjet and Ryanair end up in a basic terminal and/or one far away from the main entrance and when you get to the gate you can still be bussed to the plane.

I tried to be optimistic but it wasn't easy. In fact I'd say it's hard to imagine how spending a night in an airport could be any worse: the main issue being the music that they insist on playing throughout the terminal the entire night. They don't seem to have grasped or simply don't care that not a single customer wanted the music on because we were all trying to sleep. Now to be fair I didn't experience any queues but I do somewhat feel that might be because my flight was at 6.30am. The staff fall into two categories which I think explains the differences between some of these reviews; some are quite friendly and do their best to help whilst others do honestly look like they are suffering. One thing that surprised me was that there is no information desk literally no qualified staff beyond the departures control - only shop staff. So if you have any questions - tough there's nobody to ask. I am not mistaken here there really is no non-retail staff around the departures lounge. Lack of seating. Club music throughout the night.

bournemouth-airport,/airport-reviews/bournemouth-airport,Bournemouth Airport customer review,James Webb,United Kingdom,2012-04-14,All I wanted to do was drop off a friend - I ended up paying £4 for the privilege of doing so! As you enter the airport there are double red lines everywhere so you cannot just stop and let someone out. No room to turn around once you have entered so you have to go through the car park and pay a minimum of £2.50 - up to an hour is £4! The only other routes into the airport that I am aware of are limited - a bus service that runs only once an hour from Bournemouth (£5) or by taxi. I am amazed that they are legally allowed to get away with this. I left Bournemouth Airport feeling like I had been mugged - I doubt I am the only one.,NA,NA,NA,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
doha-airport,/airport-reviews/doha-airport,Doha Airport customer review,Rob Hurn,United Kingdom,2013-03-08,We had about an hour between flights at Doha (RGN-DOH-LHR). On arrival we spent many minutes cruising round the edge of the airport in a transfer bus eventually got to the transfer gate the fast transfer lanes were closed but no queue at all at normal-speed lanes so no problem. Arrived at departure gate as it was due to open admired once again the confusing way a flight disappears from the gates display screen list as soon as the gate is opened. Our flight was delayed so we hung around for half an hour. They don't make announcements about delays over the PA because it is a 'quiet airport' (no-one told the lady who was using the PA to tell us not to smoke). Suddenly the gate was open we moved forward but great efforts were made to persuade us to sit down again to avoid an unsightly queue but we resolutely kept standing and submitted ourselves to the first of 3 back to back ID checks. Got to the gate itself (check number two) and down an escalator to a tatty ground floor area waiting for access to the transit bus two of which were parked by the doors. The escalator continued to bring more and more people down from upstairs. Still no exit was allowed to the bus. A man struggled through the crowd with a key. It didn't fit the door lock. The escalator had been turned off by now to stop people tripping over each other at the bottom. The man tried the other door. An ironic cheer went up as the door opened. Time for our third ID check and on to the bus which then didn't leave for a few minutes even though it was obvious more the one bus would be needed. We set off on another extended tour of the airport perimeter and arrived at the foot of the aircraft's steps. Naturally only the rear door was available to us Economy class passengers so boarding was slow. All in all not a brilliant experience.

london-heathrow-airport,/airport-reviews/london-heathrow-airport,London Heathrow Airport customer review,J Suzanne,Hong Kong,2013-05-29,Heathrow airport departure security staff are a huge farce. Their behaviour is the most unprofessional I've experienced considering the amount of staff they have. I give their speed of performance a 1/10 and their conduct 1/10. Training needs to be overhauled especially in terms of socialising with other staff members whilst on duty. On my particular occasion after having waited 30 minutes for my bag to be manually inspected the security officer decided to leave his station walk slowly to his colleague manning the metal detector pat him on the shoulder say hello and walk casually back.

I have often stood in that queue for well over an hour and only once less than 30 minutes waiting to board the 13.55 Ryanair in the Cyprus heat that is no joke. There are no seats it has a corrugated tin roof and with all the people under there it becomes more akin to a sauna. There is no understanding of where the priority boarding queue is the staff certainly could not care less if they tried. With all the problems dramatically referred to locally as ""The Crisis"" that Cyprus is going through one would have presumed the least they could do was look after ""their Customers"" who are bringing in that much needed liquid capital. As for the rest of the airport it is quite small although it is fairly quick going through the check in desks and past security. It has enough shops and refreshment areas so not a problem there it is clean and bright toilets are also clean. Security is the usual amalgam of surly jobsworths who think they are doing you a favour by being as moody and miserable as possible but that is hardly unique to this airport.

Once handed in the VOA took only ten mins to process although that was because we were off the plane first and at the front of the queue. Immigration and baggage collection were smooth and we were through the airport in about 45 minutes at the most. Departure was very smooth. Hardly any queue and through immigration and security in minutes. Yes the airport is showing its age with not too much in the way of facilities after immigration.

Anyone who is looking for the facilities you find at major German Airports like HAM or CGN (let alone MUC) is in for a serious disappointment but take SFX for what it is - a former communist airfield smartened up to deal predominantly with low cost airlines - and it really isn't bad at all. Seating is definitely an issue both in the Terminal A lounge area and at the departure gates. Like some of the other reviewers I wouldn't fancy being delayed here. On the other hand I found the security and airline staff friendly and efficient although unfortunately the same cannot be said for the passport control officers who were checking outbound passengers at the entrance to Gate 65 when I departed. For access to central Berlin it's better to use the faster RB/RE trains rather than the S Bahn - the cost is the same but there are far fewer stops and it's only 20 minutes to Alexanderplatz or 30 minutes to the Hbf.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

The terminal is straight forward with a one trip through security screening that allows you complete freedom to stoll around the terminal concourses. This feature is especially appreciated when changing concourses to catch connecting flights. There is a wide selection of food choices. Inside the terminal is the Oregon Marketplace a veritable mini mall offering a wide array of quality shops and travel services. And believe it or not the shops are governed by the airport management so that they are not allowed to charge higher prices than their retail counterparts outside the airport.

That could be a problem with the airline but actually managing the bags at Oslo was hard.

It was hot and noisy and it took my wife and I almost an hour to get 2 seats together. There were very long queues at all the shops and cafes. There were far too many people for this terminal. Finally at boarding the agent held my wife up as she is not a British national. Even though my wife doesn't actually need a visa to visit the UK and even though she does have one the agent insisted on checking by phone thereby holding up the queue of people trying to get on the plane. It was resolved after about 5 minutes but over the years and in many different countries we have never experienced a similar problem.

Eating and shopping options are quite diverse and great everything is indicated very well bus/trains/taxi connections between the airport and Philly are one of the best in America and such things like checking in have become smoother. On the other hand many shortcomings are still present. The staff at PHL appear to be a concoction of the absolute worst mankind has to offer. Customs and immigration officers treat people like animals security staff yell at people for no reason and most staff seem to have a passion for making sarcastic comments and remarks about other people. The airport is still disorganized and some security checks can take forever because instead of making lines staff prefer to make herds.

Arriving back from Faro yesterday I watched the bags being taken off before we disembarked it was raining but the handlers did not bother to use the covers on the baggage trucks and just dumped bags on without any care whatsoever. It took fully 50 minutes for the first bags to arrive on the carousel and my bags was absolutely saturated when I unpacked at home most of the clothing inside was damp or wet. I also had a set of golf clubs that had to be collected from the oversize baggage carousel and these were also dripping with water although thankfully in a hard case. In the 'drop and go' car park there are no sheltered areas so you just get wet if its raining. My taxi driver was not impressed putting my dripping wet luggage into his car!

incheon-airport,/airport-reviews/incheon-airport,Incheon Airport customer review,Richard Mabbitt,Thailand,2012-08-05,I am a frequent business traveller and find this one of the most annoying and inconvenient airports. I just completed a return trip from Bangkok to Ulaanbaatar via Seoul. The return KE flight from ULN arrives at 04.00. . My connecting flight to Bangkok was at 09.35 so I had 5.5 hours at Incheon. The flight from ULN is only 3 hours so I had only about hours sleep and needed some more. The first time I did this trip I went straight to Terminal A from where Thai flights depart. However on arrival at the Asiana Business lounge I found a sign saying that it did not open until 6 am. I decided I would take a hotel room. However there are no transit hotel rooms in Terminal A (only in the Main Concourse) and once you are there you cannot get back to the Main Terminal. I was therefore forced to lie down on a row of to wait for the lounge to open. I do not believe I should have to do this at my age (60) especially when flying Business Class. I decided I would go to the transit hotel in Concourse A to get a few hours sleep. (Even in the Main Concourse the Asiana Lounge does not open until 5 am). However I needed a boarding pass (cannot be issued in ULN) so I asked at an information desk and was told that I get one at Transit Desk C which opened at 5 am. This meant that although I was checking into the transit hotel at 04.15 and was desperate for some sleep I could not go to sleep until I had obtained the boarding pass. At 5 am I went to the Transit Desk but was told that boarding passes for Thai flights could be issued at the Transit Desk F in Terminal A (not the information I was given previously). However if I went to Terminal A for my boarding pass I would not be able to get back to the Transit Hotel – backward trips not allowed for departing passengers. I was therefore forced to take the risk of not getting my boarding pass (and confirmation that luggage had been checked through) until just before the flight. I slept until 08.15 rushed to terminal A at 08.40 and got boarding pass about 50 minutes before flight departure.

Staff at the JR offices spoke good English though I had learned some basic Japanese in preparation. Outbound from NRT there were a fairly decent selection of shops duty-free etc and staff are perfectly courteous (as I had come to expect in Japan in general) and even when there were a number of busy international flights leaving around the same time it doesn't feel packed like AUH or CDG does.

DEPARTURES: In the mornings when conecting from domestic to international terminals the 1st security checkpoint is downright a third world situation. It is organized chaos. Basically whoever squeezes and pushes their way the best will be able to make their flight. Hard to pass people in this situation when they are using trash bags as their carry-on. Hang on tight to the person you are travelling with otherswise you could lose them in the wave of people cramming their way in. Istanbul Security was doing nothing to alleviate the situation. After that it is a very long line through customs to depart the country. I only made it through since some very nice Norwegians allowed my wife and I to cut so we could make our flight into Vienna. It seemed like another 2 or 3 security checkpoints before you finally get to your gate. But you're not done. You will still be crammed on a bus to be taken to your aircraft. Its creepy in here as many Turkish people don't understand that staring at somebody is impolite. In the US it is not tolerated but in Turkey there is nothing you can do. DEPARTING TO ISRAEL OR USA: Extra security on Turkish Airlines. You bags that you have already checked in may be checked back out and you will have to go through each of them with Turkish security before they will place a G.A.S. sticker on your passport. Without that sticker on the back of your passport you won't be leaving. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL: The terminal all in all is not that bad if you get the chance to actually enjoy it. Some really good Duty Free stores and cafes although the prices for even Efes are very overpriced. ARRIVAL: Very simplistic plenty of customs kiosks set up. Visas are available for purchase at the airport right next to the customs. DOMESTIC TERMINAL: Very poor in comparison. Bad lighting not very clean and little to do. Nice bar in the middle but very expensive...but a good place to kill time as the atmosphere in here is better than the rest of the terminal. The Information desk had no information. Flights that were taking off after mine had a gate scheduled but mine did not. The lady who worked there spoke little english and said ""You come back in more time."" Don't expect much in domestic.

Even the tropical fish tank lacked the illustrated number of species. Upon transiting between SIN and SYD with a five and a half hour stopover I paid $25 for an unexciting city tour. At 2000hrs passengers were called to the departure lounge for the 2105 BI flight to SYD. After placing our handcarry through the X-Ray machine transit passengers - about 15 to 20 - all had duty free liqour purchased at airports such as SIN and DXB confiscated. Many passengers repeatedly argued with the airport police and a so- called 'supervisor' to no avail. I spoke later with a senior staff member of Royal Brunei Airlines who claimed he had not heard of dutyfree liqour being confiscated but agreed that it was exempt from the February 2007 introduction at many airports of a '100ml individual one litre total' rule for handcarry liquids aerosols and gels. No RBA staff member offered to assist at Brunei Airport. The airline has since informed me that it is receiving many complaints from passengers and that those affected should write to it whereby claims will be forwarded to its Brunei head office for consideration for compensation. The arrogant Brunei Airport staff claimed that the liquor bottles would be broken : some wags interpreted this to mean the seals would be broken in private parties or that the liqour would be resold on the black market. One English couple lost an expensive bottle of Scotch and as usual many passengers were purchasing liqour as gifts for relatives and friends not for their personal consumption. Presumably this scam occurs with every flight that has transit passengers. It must net such officials a veritable mountain of spirits each year. Avoid this airport should you have purchased duty free liqour elsewhere. I did not observe whether cigarettes or perfumes were similarly confiscated.,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

For some reason coming from Frankfurt on Lufthansa was a completely different story. Just getting to baggage claim took about 20-30 minutes then after reclaiming our bags we had to hand them to this guy who basically snatched the bag and slammed it onto the conveyor belt like it was some kind of pleasure for him.

dubai-airport,/airport-reviews/dubai-airport,Dubai Airport customer review,C Dennington,Australia,2009-09-16,Transiting from the UK back to Australia with Emirates we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed into the terminal. Then escalators up two floors down one floor and then up 3 floors seemed crazy to get into a very busy and packed shopping mall. Dubai Duty Free is no more value than any other duty free. Toilets were small tight overcrowded and disgracefully dirty. Adding to that a lack of seating anywhere near a non-open gate (perhaps 100 seats for an A380 departure). Air conditioning set on freezing did not help either. Not impressed.,NA,NA,NA,2,3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

varna-airport,/airport-reviews/varna-airport,Varna Airport customer review,Jamie Bloom,NA,2008-06-23,Much the same to report as Tony Maddern - I agree with all his comments. Baggage claim is still taking a long time considering the short distance from the aircraft and minimal schedules. Priority baggage tags don't seem to be recognised either. The two baggage carousels are positioned on either side of the walk route to arrivals so if there are a lot of people they end up blocking the path! There is a handy radiation monitor just above the exit from baggage claim - useful if you're about to sit in the sun (I presume it was UV radiation)! A clarification on the taxis - unlike Sofia that have fixed fares the taxis in Varna and particularly those at the airport are allowed to charge by the meter AND the meter can run at whatever rate the driver chooses as long as it's displayed on the window of the taxi. So before getting in any taxi check the rate displayed on side or on the wind screen. 0.29 Level per km seems ok but many taxis at the airport will charge three times that amount per km! Even Costa Sands resorts should only cost 20-35 Leva let alone Varna City. If departing from the airport be aware that there aren't any eating establishments - so if you'll be hungry get something before you get there! Overall not an amazing airport but it much better than many others of it's age! And if there is only one flight departing from your terminal it shouldn't take too long to pass through security.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
singapore-changi-airport,/airport-reviews/singapore-changi-airport,Singapore Changi Airport customer review,Mark Kemper,United States,2015-01-05,This airport is simply the best in the world. Terminal 3 is particularly nice as it is basically a mall with planes but even the older Terminals 1 and 2 are quite lovely. Perhaps the best aspect concerning Changi is that they always seem to be improving. Most Asian airports are a fair bit better than the average US airport but Singapore goes above and beyond. It is right up there with Seoul Bangkok and KL in terms of modernity and quality. I usually fly Delta which uses T1 but I always look forward to those opportunities to fly with Singapore Airlines which uses T3. The plethora of eating options and shops in all three terminals are impressive. While the aesthetic experience at SIN is top-notch the logistics are also good. The walk from the gate to Immigration is generally not too bad. The Immigration area itself is spacious and easy to use. The processing is very quick with the signature efficiency of the Singaporean system the key to the smooth functioning. I have never had to wait long to get through this process. The baggage area is just downstairs from Immigration and again I have never had to wait long for my bags to arrive. I have also had to get carnet documents stamped several times in the Customs area and found this to be efficient as well. When emerging from the secure zone there are ATMs that accept international cards though they are not particularly obvious at first. The taxi area can get rather bogged down at times. In T1 be aware that there are two taxi queues. On my most recent visit one taxi queue was quite busy while the other was wide open. If you find one line rather long try the other as it probably saved ten or fifteen minutes in my case. Taxi fees are very reasonable. I went to Boat Quay and the fare with tip was about $35 SGD or about $26 USD. I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza before and it is a very nice option connected to T3. Being able to walk to the terminal is a big plus. For those who are transiting through there is a rail system between terminals that functions well for those who are using this airport for connections. On departure the processing for both check-in and immigration is fast from my experience. The security areas are all individually situated at the gates. Be aware that there are no services inside many if not all of the gates so don't go through too early. The security is efficient so there is no need to rush through. The boarding process is generally easy and stress free. My major complaint about this airport might have more to do with Delta Airlines than the facility itself. On my recent flight there was no lounge available except for Business Class in spite of the fact that I am a Delta Sky Lounge member. Overall this is one of the best airports in the world. It is actually a pleasure to have a little time here as there are so many things to do making the wait as easy as it could possibly be. The logistics are some of the best in the world and Immigration and Customs are some of the few that function well. If you have an option to use this airport it is a great choice.,NA,NA,NA,10,5,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1

Bus driver was friendly though. Check in area at terminal 3 are very small and any line at Jetblue or Delta will block the door. TSA personnel are disinterested and moved at a snails pace.

Pay for a trolley. 3. Insufficient security staff at busy times. We've waited 45 minutes at times. 4. No water fountains. They want you to pay £1.50 for a bottle of water when you come through to the baggage reclaim area after a flight. 5. The final straw was this morning. We arrived at 5am after a flight from Florida. Our airplane ""parked"" at the furthest gate possible from the baggage reclaim/customers so we had a long walk and most people had young and very tired children. We cleared customers swiftly but then were told that for operational reasons we'd have to wait 30 minutes to receive our baggage. 6.

Bristol compares very favourably and in many cases has far more facilities with many of the other regional airports I've visited in other European countries.

The only thing I would suggest is that at security if you are a woman and you 'beep' through the metal scanner and they have a female officer pat you down I would suggest that there be a little area aside where the women can be checked.

buenos-aires-airport,/airport-reviews/buenos-aires-airport,Buenos Aires Airport customer review,E Dominguez,United States,2013-02-15,It's been almost 2 years since the last time I used this airport and a lot has changed since. My flight - JFK via GIG arrived at gate 2 located in a very dated sector of terminal A. I know this part of the airport is scheduled to undergo improvements it really needs it but it looks like they've already started and some changes can be seen already like the new passport control area with many more passport desks located in the ground floor and brand new carrousels that replaced the very noisy old ones. Even so baggage claims still looks dated. I arrived at noon so passport control took less than 10 minutes. When I got to baggage claim my bags were already on the carrousel. Since every piece of luggage must be screened at customs there was a long line and it took me around 30 minutes to clear customs. The arrivals hall hasn't changed a bit - old and dark not the most welcoming. I got to the airport 4 hours prior to my flight because I was flying with a puppy. The check-in hall of terminal A is modern and very bright. Check-in was pretty quick and they let me check my bags and check the kennel with the puppy later. TAM Airlines personnel were kind and helpful as well as airport's employees. There was no line for security but there was a very long one for passport control - 30 minutes or more. I checked the screens and found out that my flight was already boarding at gate 10. Sadly I had to rush through Ezeiza's lovely free-shop in order to get to the gate on time. Gate 10 is located in a new building that replaces the old terminal B with very nice boarding areas great views of one of the runways and new concessions like Starbucks and Quilmes (Argentina's most famous beer).

The gates in Terminal 5 have no or much too few seats - everyone is standing. The only way to sit is to buy something in a nearby cafe or restaurant and sit there. Also passengers are routed through various shops when going to the gate which needlessly increases walking distances and is quite annoying anyway.

Queued less than five minutes at passport control on arriving but had arrived on a Sunday mid-morning so maybe that explains the short queues. Bags in the terminal within 20 minutes. Only one set of toilets in arrivals and these are hidden in a corner under the stairs. Had to walk through a multi- storey car park then over a bridge to get to the 'airport train station'. Check-in on return journey was ok although some of the ground handling staff who man the check-in desks on behalf of other airlines don't seem to know the rules of the airlines they work for. (bmi baby check-in desk staffed by FlightCare Spain were unaware that bmi baby give 5kg extra luggage for passengers travelling with babies and tried to charge me an excess!) Security checkpoint an absolute nightmare. Around 100 check-in desks in the main hall but only 6 security lanes. It took us 45 minutes to get through security.

The new security arrangements are a retrograde step for passengers with short transit times before flights. 9 times this year I have transited Schiphol Airport from an Air Astana flight from Atyrau to a KLM Cityhopper to Humberside. 8 times I have managed this well within the 50 minute transit time and waited patiently at gate D6. On Friday 31 July 2015 this changed. The Air Astana flight arrived at terminal D on time (which is normal). That's where normality stopped. We had to wait to disembark the aircraft to board a bus which then took us all to Terminal G where we had to negotiate the new security centre. No longer was there to be security at the gate. As a result the normal relaxing stroll from one gate at Terminal D to another turned into a running race for a man of 60. Not only did I arrive at the gate sweaty from my exertions with a pounding heart, I was also emotionally drained for fear of missing my flight on what was my wife's 60th birthday. This was compounded as I heard the last call for me with the threat to remove my baggage (not too much a worry as I only had carry on). I am concerned for the future as with running through Schiphol airport is not a safe activity due to the crowds and I'm not sure that I'll be physically able to do it for much longer. If I do miss my flight, the alternative? An eight hour wait for the next flight if there are seats available!

Once inside you enter an overcrowded area of queues that lasts all the way to the aircraft door. The main departure area inside the airport is about three times too small for the number of people passing through and you end up with vast crowds lurking near the corridor to the gates watching the departure boards. There are tiny areas by the gates themselves with no seating and which (for any pair of gates) is reached down a narrow staircase. Extraordinarily the airport seems to board two aircraft's from adjacent gates at the same time which results in two plane-loads of people queuing up the staircase and back down the corridor which means lots of confused people in the wrong queue pushing in and just lots of general unpleasantness. Getting onto the plane is just a nasty sweaty aggressive experience that I would never want to book-end an otherwise beautiful holiday.,NA,NA,NA,3,2,2,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

The airport was also rather calm and Terminal A has interesting architecture. The only downside was that I had to meet a group in Terminal B which is also where my tour bus dropped me off on my return flight.

luton-airport,/airport-reviews/luton-airport,Luton Airport customer review,S Shepherd-Stubbs,United Kingdom,2013-10-15,Luton drop off zone where it can cost 9.21 pounds per minute. We use this airport for 10 return trips a year on average flying in and out of Spain if we had the opportunity to use a convenient alternative we would not hesitate. On 17th July we went to collect some Spanish friends their flight was delayed by 15 minutes and like a previous reviewer we didn't see the sign that said 15 minutes maximum wait. So we sat in our car for the extra 14 minutes not leaving it once. We then left and went on our way on the 18th July we flew back to Spain. When we returned in September there were two letters waiting one a fixed penalty notice for £80 sent 10 days after the collection and a second legal letter saying the case had been referred. We were not given the option to pay the reduced amount and to cut a very long story short this has now cost £131. Coupled with the rude service from security staff who insist that even with toiletries in a clear bag that their own need to be used this airport and it's staff are probably the worst in the UK and you have to take a deep breath to walk through smokers polluting the entrances and exits.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,R Hopkins,NA,2008-08-01,What can be said that hasn’t already been said? There’s always a worrying wait for the car park bus then a long journey. If you’ve not done it yet allow 40 minutes in case you’ve just missed a bus. Exit signs out of the car-park are inadequate even when it’s an airport you know. Outbound journey was delayed on 29.07 so there was a gate change and inevitable rush to join the new queue not popular with ‘first come first board’ airline passengers. The return journey was also delayed resulting in a half hour wait on the tarmac. If the passengers knew what time the rescheduled landing was it’s a bit worrying that Stansted didn’t and so did not have ground staff available. What if there had been an emergency? It can be no surprise to the airport authorities to find a plane has landed. Just hope it’s not two at once that are late which given that the delays were attributed to air traffic control seems pretty likely. Passport control is an utter insult with a scrum to join the queues while non EU citizens get through with little delay. There are no toilets in the area which is also a disgrace after delays. Avoid the toilets in the baggage area! The ladies’ toilet stank of urine and the cubicles are tiny even for a fairly small adult. Once through passport control without luggage it’s a matter of luck how long it takes to get to your car. Last night (31.7.08) it was a fairly typical one and quarter hours from landing to car longer than it took to drive the 60 miles home. Stansted expand?

Arrival hall quite warm maybe 34 degrees centigrade outside was about 46 degrees immigration is not so fast but working. Toilets are grim you can find shops and exchange services around as well as small shops for some drink or snacks. Internet cafe is available and not so expensive. You have to use special busses or cars to leave the airport terminal. these cars will ask for USD15 and will not take you to the city of Baghdad but to a hot dusty open area where you can take a taxi. departing to Tehran from Baghdad airport was very time consuming due to severe security measures in Baghdad. You have to leave your hotel at least 5 hours before your departure time. Again you have to use special cars or buses and the same rate would be charged. before reaching at terminal you have to pass through 4 security check points where all baggage and passports would be checked. they use dogs for baggage. It was about 50 degrees centigrade and we had to wait under sunlight for 30 minutes for last checkpoint before entering the terminal. Another two x- rays inside terminal before check-in area. Check in was fast passport control was OK and the transit hall was much better than arrival hall enough seats good air conditioned and peaceful place with some shops and restaurants. Due to severe security measures in Iraq and specially in Baghdad you have to take special cars 4 hours before your departure time due to unpredicted delays and interruption which may happen in check points.

I have travelled extensively around Africa and elsewhere and it is by far the worst airport I have ever encountered. The only things he does not mention is the endless queuing for each stage of the mindlessly bureaucratic departure process and the frequent sense of panic as you are separated from your baggage during the numerous security checks. All this is compounded by the fact that most passengers and staff are half asleep and extremely irritable due to the fact that many flights depart between 03.00 and 05.00 in the morning. I am sure that Skytrax does not wish to offend countries and governments by announcing a World's Worst Airport award but I am also sure that it would have a great effect in improving airports such as KRT.

The taxiways are in horrible condition and it felt like we were on a dirt road! After a bus ride to the terminal we were greeted with a dirty and very run down Terminal. The appearance that maintenance is never performed on this structure is obvious. Trash is everywhere (inside and out) the seating rows are going in all different directions and the walkways are filthy with windows you can barely see out of. Maintenance covers were half hanging from their remaining screws dust caked the vents and grunge lined the walls. The baggage claim area wasn't too bad and the wait reasonable. Airport staff/security was very rude. Getting from one Terminal to another or to the train station requires walking a maze of rundown walkways. Signage is adequate. The restrooms are filthy. Staff spend more time gossiping than actually cleaning. Upon departing check in was simple and security lines average. Maps showing the locations of food/shopping are non-existent. You must be willing to walk long distances to find food of any variety. The terminal advertises free internet but we could not get it to work.

london-stansted-airport,/airport-reviews/london-stansted-airport,London Stansted Airport customer review,V Brown,United Kingdom,2013-07-07,I have long been of the opinion that Stansted has no concept of customer care. The whole place seems vaguely grubby staff are frequently rude and security is a nightmare. However dropping off or picking up passengers was always fairly simple. To drop off you drove up to the terminal your passengers got out (under cover) you drove out. To pick up you drove to the pick-up zone your passengers got in you drove out. Not any more. The whole thing has become shambolic. This morning I drove my husband to Stansted with the objective of dropping him off at 5 am for a 6.30 am flight where he had already checked in online but we were allowing at least an hour for him to get through security (see earlier comment about security). Arrived at 5 am discovered you could no longer drive up to the terminal and then took another 10 minutes to get to the so-called drop-off area where we were confronted by vehicles in the parking areas on both sides and also in the central lane which explained why there was a traffic queue trying to get into the drop-off area in the first place. As there was absolutely no chance of parking properly my husband got out and then wended his way through the melee. Fortunately he had no luggage to impede him. If the drop-off zone was properly sign-posted perhaps the log jam in the first lane would not occur but at the same time you cannot blame people for wanting to be as close as possible to what is anyway the far end of the terminal building. This morning was dry and warm so not a problem but in inclement weather with luggage? I wonder whether the designers of this chaos have ever tried it out as paying customers. In my book Stansted has gone from mediocre to completely shambolic.,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,0

Went to use the Gents toilets in he departure lounge and there were so few urinals that a queue had formed! The soap dispenser was empty. The emphasis appears to be on retail and this has little to do with airport efficiency. On return from Copenhagen the airport arrival route is very long leading to a part built Border Control area. The checks are fast enough but could be done away with for European travel surely? Anyone arriving in the UK for the first time should be prepared for a shock if they choose to go by train.

The queues for passport control which have always been terrible are now almost unbearable (this was around midnight as well) people queuing up the steps to the outside doors with a nightmarish post office queuing system.

Returning I was surprised to find that half the seats had gone from the departure lounge and when we were called to our flight we had to walk for what seemed like miles through a seemingly endless maze of corridors and stairs a problem if you have a walking disability.

barcelona-airport,/airport-reviews/barcelona-airport,Barcelona Airport customer review,T Hess,United States,2012-12-07,Terminal 1 is possibly the cleanest and most relaxing international airport I have ever had the pleasure to fly through. The Terminal is open and clean. Announcements are kept to a minimum in the Terminal which contributes to a nice relaxing experience. From deplaning it is a pleasant walk through some nice shopping areas to baggage claim and onward. Speaking of baggage claim the area is large and open which prevents much of the clustering and crowding you will find at other airports. Signage is adequate and there are numerous Information Kiosks should you have a question. Note airport hotels are not marked as well but a simple stop by the Information Kiosk will reveal easy to follow directions. Note: all of my arrivals were from Schegen Countries so I cannot attest to incoming the Customs experience. The range of food selection isn't spectacular but you should be able to find something. Locating the Terminal connection bus was not difficult. Locating the Train station was easy. Be aware that Terminal 2 is like an airport in a third world country and takes about 10 or so minutes to reach by shuttle bus. Departing from Terminal 1 is easy although I do not prefer the separation of Terminal areas because you are then limited to food/shopping choices once you pass through Customs. This is however fairly common so it shouldn't come as a surprise. Finding your check in gate is simple enough (check monitors) and the security screening was a moderate wait. It was a pleasure passing through this airport on a few occasions recently.,NA,NA,NA,10,4,5,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,1
london-gatwick-airport,/airport-reviews/london-gatwick-airport,London Gatwick Airport customer review,S Hopkins,United Kingdom,2014-06-01,Arrived on Monarch flight from Faro airport at 1.15 on Saturday 31st May. Plane could not park at gate as Swissport agents were not ready/available. We had to wait on the plane for a further 45 minutes until the air bridge was connected when we were able to disembark. When we arrived at the baggage hall (where a tiny sign shows the stand that bags are to be picked up from) we were met with hundreds of passengers from earlier flights that had still not got their bags. Our flight briefly appeared on the board that everyone was crowding around but then disappeared never to be seen again. A crate of water was then distributed by Gatwick staff and odd messages were announced over the tanoy regarding the apology of Swissport to be able to deliver our bags. The whole thing was a shambles and a disgrace to Gatwick even if it was not there fault. Gatwick should handle all of these matters and not rely on third party companies who do not employ enough staff to handle the scheduled flights - the flights are not a surprise after all! We were lucky and got our bags after only another hour while flights before ours were still left waiting.

The wait time to get through screening was over an hour for us. There was no priority line and one team of catsa personnel operating one xray machine with I estimated a thousand people lined up waiting. Once through screening arriving domestic passengers end up in a separate line for US pre-clearance with no access to global entry or nexus machines.

If you can tolerate smoke I advise you to wait upstairs for your flight as it's much nicer. Still all of this would be OK and I would have forgiven it all (after all you are on a small island) but the security process was awful. There was one guy running the security line.

I regret to say that judged by the experience of myself and my wife on 2 trips through the airport this year drastic action needs to be taken to even begin the process of 'mission accomplished' - particularly in the areas of effective staffing security procedures reduction of queues staff training and customer relations. On 27 March at 11.50hrs we arrived at bag drop (2hrs before departure) having checked in online and then spent the next hour or so going through the queues at security. The x-ray scanner for some reason detected a problem with my cabin baggage (after 12 mins wait I was told it was my camera and after another 7 mins or so I was finally cleared without explanation or any word of apology). Staffing appeared inadequate and uncaring as to the needs of customers. We had no time for a coffee or to go to the toilet before boarding. On 7 June we had a repeat performance. Having arrived at terminal 1 at 04.45 (2hrs before departure) once again we spent the entire time before boarding waiting in security queues. This time my wife's cabin baggage was chosen for a random check (passed ok) and mine for search again apparently because it contained a piece of soap in a plastic soap box (perfectly allowable). The security officer did not go to the soap straight away but at a snail's pace opened and took out all my various pills and other items before declaring on opening my washbag that it was the soap causing the query. She could not adequately explain why the scanner/scanner operator should find a piece of soap problematic and I said that I did not believe her explanation (she had just reopened my wash bag for the second time!).

santiago-de-chile-airport,/airport-reviews/santiago-de-chile-airport,Santiago De Chile Airport customer review,S Dale Hancock,NA,2006-01-20,Arrived at Santiago after an all-nighter on Delta. Arrivals was very simple – US citizens veered to the left (at least in the terminal we arrived in) just before immigration to pay the $100US reciprocity fee. The booths were clearly marked and the lines went very quickly. They will staple a receipt in your passport good for the life of the passport. Immigration followed also very efficient. We exchanged $100US for Chilean pesos before we left the secure area. A subsequent ATM withdrawl showed we had paid a premium of about 3 ½%. Certainly not a big deal. Next we picked up our bag & exited customs. All luggage including carry-on was x-rayed & you turn the customs declaration form in as you pick up your freshly x-rayed bags. We probably took 20 minutes from the time we left the plane until we were in the free world including making the reciprocity payment passport control money exchange luggage pick-up & customs. Once outside it was a hectic mess. Everybody & their little brother wants you to arrange a taxi through them. We picked an official-looking fellow with a portable radio and agreed upon $25 US to the Marriott. There was no need to have exchanged money at the airport – the cab driver was happy to get the $27US I gave him. The exchange rate at the Marriott appeared to be exactly the same as at the airport. Departing was a little different. My wife went ahead and the bellman put our bag in the “hotel taxi”. I asked how much & was told $40000 (about $80US). I said no way took the bag out of the trunk & said I just wanted a regular taxi & pointed to one on the street. The bellman said it would cost $50000 to the airport. I said no way I’d only paid $12000 when I arrived. A little Spanish between the parties and I was offered the hotel taxi (down-scale limo?) for $16000 (about $32US). Okay. Based on posts here and other places we elected to get to the airport about 3 hours ahead of flight time. Good choice though this will probably not apply to you. We booked our South America itinerary (SCL-ASU-MVD-EZE-GIG) through TAM for $1253 (two tickets) in Miami. We had called 4 times in the previous 3 months to make sure there would be no issues & every time we were told the tickets were electronic & all we had to do was give them the number at the ticket counter. Don’t know why we were suspicious but it was an issue. After 2:45 screwing around with every TAM rep in the building and calling Miami twice we finally got paper tickets issued. TAM doesn’t use e-tickets throughout most of S.A. I was perhaps most perturbed when the TAM manager came down & said it was our fault because the “agency” issued the tickets incorrectly. The “agency” was TAM. He finally understood & I was happy to tell him exactly what I thought of his professionalism. Other than TAM related issues the departure was fine: about 10 minutes to go through a courteous immigration control plenty of duty free shops (though we didn’t have time to even stop for a bathroom break) and it appeared there was plenty of seating. Couldn’t tell about eating places – again because of TAM. Overall a very good airport experience and a rather poor airline experience.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

khartoum-airport,/airport-reviews/khartoum-airport,Khartoum Airport customer review,Abdalla Salih,NA,2005-09-12,I'm a native Sudanese (born and raised in Sudan) who travels a lot around the World. Whenever I visit my beloved Sudan I always feel sad twice. The first time is when I arrive at KRT Arrival Terminal. This terminal was opened in 1986. It was as it is now small with two halls handling maximum of two airplanes at any time. But it was nice clean artfully designed and the staff members seemed to be happy working there. Unfortunately since then nothing has changed improved or fixed (as in some cases); and it's been getting worse and worse every time I see it. The second time I feel sad is when I leave Sudan. Not only because I'm leaving home but because of the waiting battle at KRT Departure Terminal where bureaucracy is at its highest level. This terminal was born more than sixty years ago and never raised. It's still small and always seemed very crowded even with one airplane passengers.

I flew there on 7 August only because I was taking advantage of the promotional fare on Air France's A380. I was apprehensive and right to be so. Although more light reaches the upper level the terminal lower level is gloomy. The walking distances are unbelievable; we took a shuttle train within 2E and still had considerable walks in the same terminal and subsequently from baggage claim to RER station. Baggage arrived at a carousel other than that advertised on the plane's information screen. I did not see any master screen to direct one to the correct carousel. Ticket machines on the cluttered station concourse were difficult to spot but do take 'foreign' credit cards which they used not to (a long time ago).

san-francisco-airport,/airport-reviews/san-francisco-airport,San Francisco Airport customer review,A Lane,United States,2012-12-13,This is my home airport. I will admit I hate to pass through immigration control here and not because of the immigration officials who can be severe at times. It's the customs part of it all where if one declares food even if it's one tiny pack of biscuits it begins a whole chain of distrust. It has happen loads of times where I was only bringing in some pastries and biscuits both in hand and checked luggage where we got treated badly. The agents always feel when one admits to bringing in food-any sort of food-it'll be something illegal thus the chances of having one's luggage searched before exiting is quite certain. That is perhaps the only issue I've got with SFO. Thus I will advise anyone to declare that you're bringing in food of any sort. If it's edible it's considered to be food. Otherwise as stated earlier the SFO immigration officers can be gruff though some are fair. As a US citizen I think I've been quite fortunate as from what I've read from foreign visitors' experiences they have been given the third degree or more. However I think that's typical as visitors to the UK (and other countries). For instance I've been treated quite rudely unfairly and unprofessionally as well by their entry clearance officers. It must be a sign of the travel times. SFO itself I do not care for as for a major international airport it is quite small and lack good dining choices.

The TSA officials are very efficient and courteous and the Aerotrain is also very convenient as well. Coming back is another story even though Dulles has improved. First of all are the ancient plane mates which take you to the international arrivals building but which will be used for the foreseeable future. Second even though the electronic kiosks for U.S. citizens in theory are a good idea they are complicated to use at first and you still have to hand the print out to a border security agent. Third the border security agents are extremely rude even to U.S. citizens. The agent who looked at my passport asked me where I visited which I told him and then he began grill me about why I didn't mention the other country I visited (Turkey where I only changed flights) even though I never left the airport to get my connecting flight! Fourth your luggage is routinely removed from the baggage carousel and placed in a pile without you even knowing. I made a complaint to Dulles Airport's Twitter handle and was told that the airlines are doing this and not the airport but that they would look into it.

Departures opened 4 hours before the flight was due to depart and queuing wasn't too bad.

We are well served by an airport which has better than average international and cross border connections given the size of the city. Air Canada service during check in and boarding is good (especially if you have concierge access). However the key weakness is security twice as many staff as a typical US airport process passengers twice as slowly evidently under the influence of a 1970's style time and motion study. The many comments on the board about disinterested personnel engaged in important personal conversations see it every week. Checking in this morning the security officer demanded that bins be turned lengthways on the way to the scanner (not vertically where you could fit twice as many and move more quickly). The reason - ""it was too noisy"" for the bins to run over the rollers unless they were lengthways.

With just three 'wide bodied' flights leaving within 45 minutes of each other on my recent return transit the departures area was absolutely choked with people. The facilities simply can't cope with too many flights at once. When quieter its fine and comfortable enough.

beauvais-airport,/airport-reviews/beauvais-airport,Beauvais Airport customer review,Anne Simpson,NA,2006-02-26,We were a family of two adults and two kids travelling from Prestwick to Disneyland Paris. As Beauvais airport is about 117kms from Disneyland and relatively expensive for four to get there and back we decided the cheapest way was to hire a car and print out a route planner from the A.A. to make our destination easier to find. Getting there was not a problem and took just over an hour but coming back on the Sunday evening heading in the direction of Paris was a different story. The traffic was heavier and we got lost a few times which might not have happened had we taken a decent map with us. The car was due back at the Hertz Rental by 7pm and as we were running a bit late we decided to wait till we got to Beauvais before topping up the fuel. There was a gas station 2kms from the airport but unfortunately it was closed . As we didn't have the time to start looking about for another we took the car back and was charged 57euros for the half tank of diesel we used. Make sure you top up en route when you find a station otherwise it could end up being a very costly car hire. Otherwise Hertz were very reasonable at £73 for the 3 days hire and we were given a brand new Peugeot which let us get about and discover some good designer outlets very close to the Parks and a big shopping centre at the junction of the A104 9kms from Disneyland. It had a big Carrefour supermarket. We were able to purchase fruit salad cold meat and rolls to do us while in the Parks as what they offer in the Parks is total junk food and very costly. The other good thing with hiring a car is you can then choose a cheaper hotel to stay at a bit further away from the parks and if you have the yearly pass for the parks you can park at the parks for free otherwise it is 8 euros each day you park there. It would probably work out even cheaper to take our own car and drive all the way there but we were limited for time and we did get exceptionally cheap tickets with Ryan Air having booked well in advance. I hope this information will be useful to future travellers with kids and on a limited budget.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

There are two terminals; terminal A serves flights within the Schengen zone terminal B serves those outside. Terminal B takes slightly longer to get through as there are passport inspections before you are allowed to pass through to security.

Both terminals have a decent choice of cafes and restaurants although the best restaurants are before you go through security you'll find them on the food court on level 3.

Once you make it into the actual terminal the queue for the Internet bag drop is ridiculous (and security if you can't use the frequent flyer fast lane). The airside restaurant area was full of drunken rowdy passengers catching the Ryanair flights that seem to account for most of this terminal's traffic. None of the restaurants that I could find had any vegetarian food options and once again there were long queues for every retail outlet in the airside departure area. The toilet I used near the KLM gate was smelly and filthy.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,1,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0
las-vegas-airport,/airport-reviews/las-vegas-airport,Las Vegas Airport customer review,Stuart McLean,United Kingdom,2012-02-13,I flew to Las Vegas from London Gatwick and to San Francisco and back for a day trip. The domestic terminal is excellent. It is very clean has several shops and cafes and plenty of seats at the gates. The TSA officers are also very friendly at that terminal. However the international terminal is very small not as clean as the domestic one and there is not many places to eat at. There was no empty seats at my gate so I sat at another gate among passengers flying to Mexico. The TSA officers at the International terminal are also not as friendly as they are at the domestic one. I also noticed that when a flight to Mexico was boarding the announcements were only made in Spanish not English.

Biggest gripe is the walk from the terminal to the rain Stn. Some of it is under cover whilst the rest is outdoors although part of the route is sort of protected from the elements. Worst still are the lifts in T3 which you need to use. Although big there are only 2 and they seem to stop randomly. Why is there not a clearly signed set of stairs people could use instead especially if they do not have large/heavy items of luggage. On leaving T3 was a noisy horrid shambles full of people with insufficient seating. Might be ok for holiday makers but for those on business as I was it was unacceptable.

I am talking about immigration. Passport control is always in chaos. There are 2 main rush hours in the airport still struggles with very slow passport control officers and less than 50% of the pass-checks open. 55minutes on departure and 45min at arrival is just unacceptable. The marketing of Suvarnabhumi is visible in the Thai media as they are achieving faster service and with a smile. I reckon most of the passport control officers flanked the lessons. All I see at the pass desk is stickers and advertising of who supplied the camera who supplied the air freshener etc. So if I can give passport control any grade lower than zero I would. Otherwise security was better and faster the so-called duty free has lost my attention for the last 6 years so I just go through still nothing of interest close to the gates and the place there looks like a barren desert waiting at gates much better with padded seats giving the place a better look always prepare for long walks at arrival to the passport controls.,NA,NA,NA,3,1,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

The only way to get out of the plane is by stairs. They use one set of stairs per plane. Expect long queues at check in - usually there is only one desk per flight available. Before customs the airport has 1 bar 1 restaurant 2 souvenir shops and small chemist. After customs there is one bar and a duty free store. Prices are decent but the quality at the restaurant requires a Russian stomach in to appreciate the food. Make sure to use the toilet in the plane before landing after landing before customs there is only 1 toilet. The other toilets before customs are dirty and smelly. There is an information desk but they only speak Russian. There are enough taxi's available - choose a registered taxi (with a sign) to avoid being ripped off. There are no other means of transport (bus lines or trains) to leave the airport. The sound installation in the terminal is lousy.

Arrivals (luggage delays aside) is ok getting out is a different story. At first it seems that check in etc is quite quick then you pay your 25cuc airport tax and then move to immigration. This can take hours staff disappear at a moments notice and its anybody's guess how long before they return time and time again this happened even when my passport/visa was being checked. As far as food/drink etc drinks are fine but food is poor and very expensive. Although it claims to be 24hr there is nothing open after 11pm (approx) so if you're delayed stock up. If you have problems with your flight being delayed etc. Dont expect any help you'll have to explain the same thing over and over again better off contacting the airline in your home country. Its worth noting that they have cardphones in the airport but nobody sells the cards there - I checked everywhere. So have a card on hand there are coin phones but pesos only and its very difficult to phone international. Also there is no internet access until after you go through check in/immigration (no wireless either). Basically : Get there 4hrs early double check the queues for check in have your visa immigration forms and 25cuc on hand and get a phone card before going to the airport just in case.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

Beware of the said website because it is hardly ever updated and the info on the shuttle bus service to Brussels is misleading. You CANNOT buy your ticket on the bus in spite of what it says and the place is full of disgruntled passengers hauling their gear back into the airport to buy a ticket. Amazingly this has been going on for at least a year and will continue to do so because this airport clearly follows a strict policy of ignoring all complaints and e-mails. Still the coach is the least bad way of getting to Brussels as the local bus and train schedules are hopelessly mismatched. Another major pain at this airport is the lack of seating and practically nothing to do landside and absolutely nothing to do airside. Boarding is invariably annoying as the hapless staff makes no attempt to control the free-for-all. All you can hope for is that things will change with the new terminal due to open ""in 2007"".

washington-dulles-airport,/airport-reviews/washington-dulles-airport,Washington Dulles Airport customer review,A Smith,United States,2015-01-14,Departing from this airport seemed relatively painless (they even have a shiny train to transport you to the gate area) but arrival is a Kafkaesque nightmare due to immigration queues. After getting off the plane it took 20-30 mins just to reach the immigration area due to the wait for and ride with the antiquated mobile lounge. Then queued for a further 2 hours 15 mins at immigration (non-US citizen) - rows upon rows of unmanned desks no assistance or announcements. The queue got even longer behind me so some people will have waited for over 3 hours. After an 8 hour flight expecting families with young children to stand for so long is completely unacceptable. Then a hunt for bags deposited in a random location in the baggage hall and yet another queue for customs. Virtually every non-US citizen arriving that afternoon with a connecting flight will have missed it it is beyond my comprehension how an airline could profitably offer connecting flights in such an absurd environment. Avoid flying into this airport on an international flight.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

I had to fly last minute and Delta my carrier of choice didn't have any JFK flights available so LGA was the only choice as EWR would be way too far. I arrived at Terminal D at 5AM and the lines on the check-in area were insane! I had already printed my boarding pass at home and had no check-in luggage so I wasn't worried. There were numerous self check-in kiosks and the queue to security was rather short. The agents were friendly and it took less than 5 mins. The gate area was rather cozy far better than DL's JFK Terminals. There were decent amount of shops and restaurants. I returned the same day with US at 8PM the US Terminal was far better. The departure gates looked more cozier and it was cleaner. My only complaint is that it's not accessible by public transportation although numerous buses go to LGA it takes forever to get to the subway stations! It would be nice if the AirTrain comes to LGA.

When I entered the queue for non-EU citizens, there were not many people in front of me. However, the time which elapsed from my entering the queue to the time my Australian passport had eventually been duly stamped was 97mins. For the first hour there were two desks being used to process non-EU passport holders but this eventually went down to 1 counter. No one came and explained the problem nor at any stage apologised for the situation. Many passengers became angry and distressed and a number missed ongoing flight connections. Concerned and outraged at the longest wait I had ever experienced in an immigration queue at any airport in the world in over 45 years of travel, I took the opportunity to speak to a passport control supervisor when finally inside the airport. I received what can only be described as a most inadequate explanation, delivered in a highly supercilious and cavalier manner.

istanbul-ataturk-airport,/airport-reviews/istanbul-ataturk-airport,Istanbul Ataturk Airport customer review,Takaya Ikezawa,NA,2005-05-28,I have used this Ataturk Airport more than a dozen of times in the past and feel OK in general as for its international terminal facilities. However the security check might be too strict. You have to walk through a metal detection gateway while having all of your belongings through X-ray screener to enter the terminal. One day when I proceeded to the security check at the entrance I precautionary took out/off all of metal materials cell phone wallet coins belt rings watch etc. and walked through the gateway but it alarmed. The personnel demanded me to take off my shoes and I tried again; however it alarmed again although only things I put on were a woolen jacket a cotton shirt cotton pants cotton socks and cotton underwear! There are long queues at pasport control on departure most of the time but this can move fast but you will see a long queue once again for metal detection gateway X-ray screening for your cabin baggage and checking your pasport and boarding pass at boarding gates even if you left the airline lounge after sipping a few cups of coffee after you heard the boarding announcement in the lounge. The pasport control on arrival especially at midnight could be a truely nightmare. As you can see in the previous comments passport control personnel are quite slow even though they don't ask you questions such as purpose and duration of your visit. In addition to that when I took a flight from FRA arriving at 2 am I saw a few counters open and arrived passengers filled in front. I could hardly say they were in lines. Most of the people in lines seemed from Russia or eastern Europe. I happened to realize then that Russian women are awfully clueless and mannerless. Once my line moved a bit faster than other lines then some of the women in the line called all of their friends in other lines to come and the line in front of me suddenly got longer than ever since I stood at the end of the queue! And also another woman suddenly muscled her way into the line. I complained but she insisted that she had been there in line! There was no personnel to control those mannerless people. I could go out the terminal almost 2 hours after landed even though I had trouble neither with my luggage nor at custom. Since then I have been trying to avoid arriving at midnight. Domestic terminal is quite poor and seedy. Terribly long queue for entering terminal check-in and security check once again before boarding gates in the peak periods. Many Turkish people jump the line. Nothing fun to kill time both before and after the security check. Especilally the self- service cafe after the security check charges 4 USD for a can of coke.

Really good idea having the Business Class Lounge as a linked series of lounges grouped to the Gates. So we arrived in to the terminal and walked through the general concourse of shops easily found the signs to follow to find the Business Class Lounge which is on the top floor. Once admitted to the Lounge the thing is to go to your Gate Number and use the lounge area there. You can wander all over and sit anywhere you like but it makes sense to park yourself near your departure gate. Boarding then is easy just put down the champagne glass (in my case!) and go through to the lift which takes you down 3 floors to your aircraft door. The lounge is well set out well appointed good shower rooms (for women can't say about the men) and a series of hot and cold food and drink counters throughout. Very comfortable chairs the usual magazines etc (happy to find a locally printed copy of The Australian). I like the concept and the execution of it. At last a lounge big enough to take the volume of passengers going through in comfort. Well decorated.

los-angeles-lax-airport,/airport-reviews/los-angeles-lax-airport,Los Angeles Lax Airport customer review,J Jensen,United States,2011-06-13,While traveling to and from KLIA in Malaysia we went through LAX. I will avoid this airport at all cost in the future. We arrived into LAX for the outbound leg of our trip luckily we had our bags transferred by the airline so we did not have to collect our bags first. We had to go from on of the more distant terminals from the International Terminal. We waited outside for the shuttle but after 15 minutes we gave up and walked. There was a light evening rain but the walkways are not generally covered so by the time we got there we were a bit wet. The one bright spot was passport control was fast and the TSA was friendly. Now for the nightmare of the return trip. Immigration was nearly a 90 minute wait. My wife is a PR of the US and she and I was told to go into the US line. Once there the TSA officer was rude disrespectful to me and my wife and despite the TSA mission statement was completely unprofessional. We then collected our bags and waited for another 45 minutes to get out of customs and it would have been longer if we would have been selected to have our bags screened. Went to Terminal 6 which was a construction zone surprised they didn't issue us hard hats. While I know LAX is in desperate need of terminal updates sitting in a terminal and hearing hammers for 90 minutes before a flight can give you a headache. Avoid LAX use SFO or SEA for your flights to Asia!,NA,NA,NA,1,1,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0

Like many other reviewers I find it a most annoying inconvenient and expensive experience. The ""Duty Free"" shops are very expensive and have obviously swallowed any duty with their greedy pricing: avoid them and buy elsewhere. The airport can be hot and stuffy in certain areas where aircon is inadequate. Airside food outlets are two to three times more expensive than the city e.g. 9baht soda water was 65baht. Better go to family mart outside immigration area where prices are normal. Also note that many flights require a bus ride across the tarmac because of inadequate terminal facilities. Immigration officers are expressionless. Forget taxis. Spend the extra money and book an airport limousine near the luggage carousel. You pay one fee - no rip offs extra cash for tolls and all that other nonsense you get with the (grossly underpaid) taxi drivers. I see little to no improvement since 2006 and recommend Singapore as a transit point to other Thai cities. Unless you need to go to this airport avoid it.",NA,NA,NA,2,3,4,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,0

There is also wonderful non-stop service to Seoul Gimpo Airport and if you happen to be flying between the two this routing is absolutely a must. You could save 5 hours this way. Sadly that is the only international flight from this by far the more convenient of the airports in Tokyo.

Huge queues at security due to constant landing of widebody aircraft but it never took longer than 15 minutes to clear security as plenty of staff and scanners are available. Never imagined an airport could be so crowded at 2am. The terminal is too small considering how busy this airport is becoming but this has the benefit that all the gates can be reached 2-3 minutes after security. Passports are only checked at the boarding gates. Facilities are limited (ground floor duty free area a few restaurants and small shops upstairs) so a long layover would be dull but enough for a 2-3 hour wait. Plenty of seats everywhere. Toilets inadequate - the cleaners do try but can't seem to keep up due to the volume of pax. No air bridges so a long bus journey to/from the plane seems usual.

On our return journey although we had checked in on line everyone was made to queue and check in again causing very long queues and many frayed tempers as the staff tried in many cases to say baggage was oversized or overweight. We pointed out that the scales already read 1.8kg before we put our hand baggage on there and that was the only reason we appeared to be overweight in fact our bag was weighed on another scale and was only 8.7kg well within the 10kg limit. He then tried to tell us it was oversized until we placed it in the sizing basket where it fitted quite easily! Be aware that you must fill in an embarkation card before checking in or you will be sent to the back of the line to do so.

I have used the airport at least a dozen times over the past 2 years and it has to be one of worst I have ever been in. On inbound international flights you enter a bland and underwhelming building only to be met by long lines at immigration (worst wait is about 2 hours) then you trudge down to the baggage carousel area which has been under construction for 2 years and still has bit of ceiling falling down. Then another huge wait of 200+ people to get through quarantine. Departing flights are just as bad. A cold concrete structure with little natural light and poor design. Domestic security is fairly easy to get through and the Jetstar terminal is acceptable though more seating is needed at boarding gates. International departures again have huge line ups to get through immigration which then leads to a marathon like jaunt of twists and turns to get to your boarding gate - easily a 10 minute walk through duty free shops restaurants that make it the least direct route to boarding gates. Parking is the most expensive I've ever experienced. I read a report that the airport rakes in over $100 million a year in parking. So how about using that money to build a new airport.,NA,NA,NA,2,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

At one point an officer came over to a booth and was chit-chatting for several minutes smiling and laughing. When people asked the officers they said that ""Sundays were always busy"".

Travelled with excess baggage including technical equipment (three boxes) requiring ATA carnet. Immigration area first; strong smell of diesel. Three lines with two officer booths each but possibility to go to booth on different line i.e. possible pushing in. Officer says nothing but takes ages to inspect your passport. Never mind it's a tourist visa. Collected bags from carousels. This is a small and chaotic area with people pushing trolleys into you at speed from all angles. Then customs: with ATA carnet went to area that looked like 'anything to declare'. Waved carnet at officer. He took us directly into a staff area at end of corridor is a customs office. They (old guy and a trainee) dealt with the relevant section of the carnet checked a few items communicated in English took photocopies. Had a cover letter in Russian explaining what purpose of equipment which helped. Were told to come back to the same place exactly when departing. This was pretty efficient. Leaving from DME: Travelling from area of KUNTSEVSKAYA Metro station (i.e. West Moscow) allowed four hours to departure. Orbital motorway anticlockwise pretty quiet at 0615AM clockwise direction was already very busy and slow. Kashira highway going south east to DME also OK. So that part in 45 minutes. Possible to drive to front of the only terminal get (free trolley) and go straight inside building. All baggage scanned just inside building but this was simple no delay. Went to the left (east) end of check in area to get to arrivals showed carnet to a the first customs-looking oficer available. He waved us to the staff area to have the next section of the carnet dealt with. No queues no problem. Documents were photocopied and we were on our way. Then back to check in area (waving carnet at anyone official) checked in personal baggage taken told to go to airline cashier desk (Swiss) to pay excess baggage. Showed checkin clerk the excess baggage receipt then took the three boxes to excess baggage reception. It was scanned and we pushed into a lift and said goodbye to it. Then went upstairs through passport control/security. This was no problem either (got waved into business lane for unknown reason).

The airport is certainly crowded but after a week in Istanbul you realise that is the norm for this city we travelled on public transport at various times and never scored a seat so maybe we were not surprised.

Arrivals apart from a small delay in getting the jetway lined up was smooth and efficient. The area prior to visa payment and passport control is large and airy. Formalities took minutes. The baggage hall is also spacious with an adequate duty free on arrival shop. Being the only flight in or due in baggage delivery was very quick - althouth the angled conveyors do move a bit too quickly for some and I saw several people chasing high speed bags round the carousel! Through passport control there is a bit meet and greet area leading to a pick up and set down area with car parks opposite. Everything was pretty much a straight line from plane to kerbside. Departures is equally impressive. The check in area seemed to have about 50 desks although quiet at 7pm on a Friday night with only two or three flights checking in. Only British Airways has a single line check in system and I can see it getting a bit chaotic for other airlines if things get busy. Again very quick through passport control into a very spacious departures area. being a new terminal facilities were limited to a huge duty free shop (cheap) an 'english style' pub that is fairly expensive at 20YTL (£7.70) for a sandwich and coke a Burger King on the mezzanine level (again expensive) and a small coffee area next to the BA Gate (you guess £2.50 for a small coffee).

Whilst the public facilities at this airport are adequate and clean the catering is a total rip-off. Soft drinks retail at £4 a can (70p at Bristol Airport) and a very basic meal comprising hamburger chips and soft drink will set you back £10 a head! Best to take your own sandwiches and drinks. The Duty Free isn't particularly good value either. Don't forget that you have to pay £10 a head for a 30 day visa on entry to Turkey. So have cash to hand.,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0
stockholm-skavsta-airport,/airport-reviews/stockholm-skavsta-airport,Stockholm-skavsta Airport customer review,Nathan Fotheringill,NA,2008-03-27,As has been noted Skavsta Airport is really Nykoping airport under another name but as long as you factor in the 80 minute bus ride into central Stockholm it is a viable alternative for getting to the Swedish capital. As these 'peripheral' airports go it isn't that bad. On arrival the bags arrive fairly quickly and it was a short walk to the bus. These run frequently and apparently wait for the incoming flights which is important of you are scheduled to arrive late. Three buses an hour leave Stockholm's central bus station for the journey back to Skavsta. Returning to the airport check-in is a bit of a slap-dash affair. There are a number of check-in machines which print boarding passes and baggage tags for both Ryanair and Wizzair flights. However if you have luggage you have to join the bag drop queue which is just about as long as the conventional chaeck-in queue. Most of the machines were unservicable when we arrived anyway. There is catering both landside and airside. Remember that this is Sweden - prices are very steep. There is a small duty free shop and well that's about it really. There are five gates two of which require passing through passport control and are used by flights to the UK. There is nothing the other side apart from a few chairs so you are probably better waiting to go to your gate for as long as you are comfortable in doing so. Overall it might not win any awards but it does the job.,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

guangzhou-airport,/airport-reviews/guangzhou-airport,Guangzhou Airport customer review,Caroline Hood,Australia,2014-01-08,For an international airport that has travellers in transit from many worldwide destinations the facilities here are poor. As with other comments we were also charged $10 each for a small coffee there were only 2 facilities to get a coffee from one time in my life that I would actually welcome competition from someone like McDonalds. We had about a 3.5 hour transit between our flights from Vancouver to Oz and let me tell you there is very little to do! Nowhere comfortable to sit (apart from the floor) coffee rip off (see above) shops were poor with bored looking staff. The terminal stank of cigarette smoke from the indoors smoking area that wafted throughout the terminal. My tip if you have to transit through - take your own cup and tea bag/instant coffee and help yourself to the hot water. If all else fails organise a flight for the next day and stay over at a hotel. Maybe a little more thought for those passengers transiting through the airport would be an improvement especially when competing with airports such as Changi.,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,2,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,0
madrid-barajas-airport,/airport-reviews/madrid-barajas-airport,Madrid Barajas Airport customer review,C Porter,United States,2010-12-28,Its easy to transit between the terminals but terminal 4 and its satellite are functionally lackluster in my opinion. The lines and walks are long everywhere you go. Transiting from the primary terminal to the satellite is a pain. After several elevator rides and several ramps you traverse a crowded security checkpoint with the most impersonal agents I have experienced. Its then another train ride and one long walk through a long straight terminal to your gate unless you are lucky and have one of the near gates. Signage is inadequate in the satellite terminal as are seats. If its a busy time of the day many will be forced to sit on the floor or along a wall. They are also poor when it comes to announcements. I once had 2 completely unannounced gate changes in the matter of 30 minutes. The other terminals are dated looking but more functional. Its not all bad as its a decent looking airport and a good selection of restaurants and other services when you are waiting for a flight. To sum it up its a small airport design stretched out for one of the worlds largest and it simply does not work.,NA,NA,NA,3,3,5,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0

shenzhen-baoan-airport,/airport-reviews/shenzhen-baoan-airport,Shenzhen Baoan Airport customer review,Chris Carroll,NA,2008-03-06,Two terminals (A & B you can’t miss them with 20 feet high letters on the outside of each building). The terminals are connected by a walkway on the second floor (departures level). Both terminals are wide and open with good public facilities and numerous options for transport to Shenzhen and HK Self Administrative Region. Downtown bus No.330 has several stops and terminates at Shenzhen Station and Lo Hu Boundary Crossing where you can change to a train to Kaoloon. These are frequent and cheap and in my opinion are a far better option to taxis who are adept at all the usual airport taxi scams. A golden rule in China is that it’s always better to get a taxi downtown where competition is keener and drivers more reliable not to mention safer. That unpleasantness aside other transport options to HK include fast and frequent (every 20-30 minutes) busses to the HK boundary and onward to a number of destinations in the SAR itself. Perhaps most useful for foreigners are those to Kaoloon including Hung Hom Station (main station) Prince Edward MRT station (Mong Kok) Nathan Road at Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) MRT station. The only downside of these services is that they use the Hong Gang Port crossing which involves exiting the bus for Chinese immigration reboarding and exiting again for HK inspections then reboarding for a third time before continuing your trip. Sounds complicated but it is actually quite straight forward even with a minimum of Chinese. All can be booked at the official desks near the exit doors for both terminals- you will be taken to your bus when it arrives by a uniformed hostess. Never go anywhere with a non- uniformed person as there are plenty of touts looking for a quick buck and you will be scammed perhaps even worse. Other options include the fast turbojet to Central on HK Island and helicopters to HK International Airport neither of which I have tried. As for SZ airport itself food facilities abound and are much better for range and price than almost any other Chinese airport- and I’ve been to quite a few! Terminal B has a Starbucks and McDs (arrivals) and KFC (departures) all with free internet access. The other terminal has a Pizza Hut (arrivals) and a couple of pricy Chinese options in departures. The walkway between the terminals has a couple of Chinese food options which are reasonably priced. All restroom facilities are reasonable for China- again with the smoking but what can you do? BYO paper or take the dispensers near the hand wash area as there is none in the stalls- this is common practice for all Chinese public facilities. Most stalls are squat type but one sit down is usually available for “the infirm” but it may double as a store room for mops and buckets - welcome to China. Don’t tip the staff as it is not a Chinese custom.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0

We flew from London with Virgin Atlantic and to Brisbane with V Australia. It took 2.5hrs to clear customs and immigration and we were only in transit. No signage of how to find V Australia. We did find the correct terminal which advised ticketing was upstairs. (Even though they were both Virgin flights you may as well be on different airlines as no through ticketing). Upstairs was another problem - how to get there - no one in the building escalator blocked off. In the end asked a cleaner who pointed out a lift outside the building tucked in a corner. Once up there chaos reigned and it was another 45 mins before we reached the Alaskan lounge (V Australia). Was too tired to notice cleanliness but surely something can be done about the ridiculous performance of clearing customs and immigration when in transit. We arrived in at 7.25pm and our flight due out at 11.55pm. We did not have much time to spare even with 4.5hrs. Unfortunately we are returning in Jan next year and can look forward to another happy 2hrs in customs and immigration no doubt. Huge queues to go through security after checking in with V Australia.

Once through I attempted to draw cash from one of the ATM machines in the baggage hall.

After queuing for 1hr and 20 minutes to check in we were told our flight was delayed by 3 hours - these things happen and we accepted this and were directed to Gate C23 and given a voucher for refreshments. We went through security and caught the shuttle to gate C23. Refreshment bar was just closing as we arrived and we got pizza and coffee by the skin of our teeth.

After about another 1/2 hour an announcement told us to go to gate 36. Eventually we were piled on to the airport bus to go out to board the plane. We were kept on the bus for about 15 minutes doors kept closed and no explanation for the wait and suddenly the bus turnwed round and we were taken back to the terminal where we were kept on the bus for another 10 minutes before being allowed to get off and enter the building again. No explanation other than 'There is a problem with the Company' was given. Eventually after 4.5 hours of waiting we boarded the plane and took off back to Birmingham. What a farce and to put the icing on the cake when we all went to the Carousel to pick up our luggage we were told that no luggage had been put on the plane. Again no explanation no one at Fiumicino Airport had told us that our luggage had not been loaded.

I came off an international flight and then waited almost an hour in line just to have my passport checked. Then it took 2 hours to pick up my baggage and recheck it. The line was incredibly long. When one man asked the personnel if he could go ahead of the others because his flight was in 15 minutes the lady told him she didn't care but he'd have to ask the other passengers. Of course that led to chaos as he tried to manuever his way through the entire line asking permission from every person. And when other people saw that they wanted to do that too. And then the other passengers started getting irritated and wouldn't let anybody in front (and rightly so). The only part that wasn't chaos was agricultural customs and that's because there were about 3 people including me in this line. I would only fly through here again if i absolutely had to.

The last 18 months this service ahs changed for departure customers you do not get the chance to buy items in duty free anymore you get 30 mins at a Cafe then wheeled to a Gate with Toilets and no place to buy a drink for 2.5 hours before being collected 5 mins before boarding you are treated like luggage. Myself wife and friends have travelled to Thailand twice or three times a year for 20 years and only in the past 3 years needing wheelchair help this is now the last time we get this treatment and you no longer get purchases in duty free (due to staff) we travel to other wheelchair friendly countries.,NA,NA,NA,3,4,4,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0
houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,/airport-reviews/houston-george-bush-intercontinental-airport,Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport customer review,Erich Binckli,Germany,2014-03-12,"Arrived at HIA on 3/10/14 at 3.55 pm from Mexico City in transit to Miami. Only hand luggage boarding passes ok. Huge queue at Immigration (abt. 400 people). Only 40 % of immigration desks were manned. Officials did an excellent job (abt. 3-4 min. per passenger) but due to lack of manpower it took about 1.5 hours to get through. Same queue at customs and later again at Security. Had 2.2 hours for transit but this was still too little and we missed our flight. Management must have been aware of expected volume of traffic and I am at a loss to understand why they did not adequately prepare for it. ""Fast line"" for privileged (paying) passengers at customs is another nuisance. I will definitely avoid in the future.",NA,NA,NA,NA,1,5,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,0

miami-airport,/airport-reviews/miami-airport,Miami Airport customer review,Sarah Sherter,United States,2014-12-10,Out of all the international connections I have made MIA has to be the worse. We had a connecting flight from Belize to LAX and had to clear immigration and customs at MIA. They have a self scanning area for passports but excessive long lines for passport scan followed by another line for an agent to stamp the passport claim luggage to go through custom agent and finally security for the flight. On top of the airport has lack of signage and I felt like I was in a maze. We missed our connecting flight back to LAX as the procedure with immigration customs and security took almost 2 hours. American Airlines gave us even a worse run around to get on standby - I will never connect in Miami again for the Caribbean.,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,0
