air-india,/seat-reviews/air-india,Air India customer review,A Sharma,Germany,2013-04-25,It was a bulkhead seat (17H on 777-300ER) right behind the business class cabin. Seat recline is ok and legroom is good. The seat width however was horrible. First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat. Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side. Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet. It was quite hard to move it into position (joints were hard) and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth! At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell (swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen) and hit my shin quite hard. For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin (and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen). I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function. Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue. Thankfully the touchscreen menu on the personal screen was working which enabled me to watch a movie (not much more as the system response was very sluggish and music browse menu quite user unfriendly to use satisfactorily).,BOEING 777-300,3x3x3,NA,Economy,NA,2,4,2,1,2,1,NA,NA,0

These seats are in the exit row so leg room is not an issue nor is the narrowness of the seats. I've heard complaints about the temperature but that wasn't a problem with the blankets provided. There really isn't much of a window for this row. The side storage bin is a little awkward to reach and can disturb the passenger behind you when accessing. Our return flight LHR to LAX – 747-400 – we had seats H and K in row 25. We found these seats to be extremely comfortable especially with no one behind us.

airasia-x,/seat-reviews/airasia-x,AirAsia X customer review,R West,Australia,2014-01-06,I paid extra for what Air Asia X calls a 'hot seat' with more legroom directly behind the premium economy cabin. The legroom was generous (I am 194 cm and I could stretch out) and the space in front of the seat also made access very easy. However in a crowded plane the lack of shoulder room was very uncomfortable - this airline has nine seats across in its A330 cabin where most airlines have eight. The sense of tightness was exacerbated by the arm-rests on my row of seats having to accommodate tray tables narrowing the available space further. The seats themselves are leather clad and hard; they also lack lower lumbar support. They do have adjustable head rests - a great feature. I've rated the seat overall as a '5' simply because I managed to sleep for about two hours of a seven hour plus sector. I have rated the PTV screen as 1; in fact the on-board entertainment system comes in the form of portable units which can be rented - I didn't try them however.,AIRBUS A330-300,3x3x3,NA,Economy,NA,5,5,3,1,5,1,NA,NA,0

The seats were fairly comfortable, but not comfortable enough for us to really sleep. The arms were really hard and could not be raised because they contained the trays. If the center one could have been raised to make more room it would have helped a lot. I could not really stretch out because of a metal box under the seat in front of me.

When preparing for take off the stewardess didn't even notice the reclining seat. They really don't check properly.

We had chosen seats 52J and 52K bulkhead seats in the first row of the second economy class cabin which did offer more leg room. They are located next to the galley so you get a lot of noise from that area. This did not bother me at all but on a much longer flight if you wanted to sleep may have been a bad choice. The hot towels were very welcome and also the drink service was efficient. When the evening meal was served we seemed to wait ages for the cart to appear at our row. We were offered the choice offered on the menu of Beef or Salmon and then immediately told the Salmon had run out some time ago. Then why offer it? Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service. Just prior to landing the female flight attendant decided to tidy her hair and apply make-up in the galley mirror which took some time she should have done this out of sight of passengers.

lufthansa,/seat-reviews/lufthansa,Lufthansa customer review,Ian Oliver,Finland,2014-07-24,While Lufthansa has better leg room than most it isn't great and sleep in is just awkward. However the A380 does give much more luggage space above the seats so you can avoid putting things under the seat in front which is better. The seats have an ethernet jack and USB port but NO power sockets. Wifi is available at a small price; but using Wifi uses much more battery power in your laptop. Unless you're very lucky with battery life having no power socket is a serious disadvantage especially for cost conscious business travelers - but then again Lufthansa would like to see those in Business class anyway which isn't always possible. This negates the advantage of having Wifi available. The inflight entertainment system has an OK range of films and programmes. You can normally find 4-5 hours of viewing from the selection. The system however is quite slow and the touchscreens very temperamental. If you want more then bring a tablet computer with a long battery life loaded with films and avoid Wifi.

qantas-airways,/seat-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,M Eggleton,United Kingdom,2013-01-03,"This review is for economy seat 48A which is an exit seat if it were a normal seat it would be much lower score (London-Singapore-Melbourne). I think this is one of the best seats to get in economy. You are the last to board and the first to get off. The seat is a window seat so you have the storage thing on the wall to your left to put things in where as if you were 48B or 48C you would have no where. It has part of the door sticking out in front of your left leg so if your over 6'0 you can't really stretch your leg out fully. I'm 6'4 and didn't have a problem with this as you can angle both legs to one side and not obstruct the person to your right and it was intrusive either.. and the best thing is this seat only cost $25 to book compared to the $160-180 they charge for the other extra leg room seats/exit seats (including the two next to you). People say the seats are bad and in August I said this myself I felt they were too hard but for some reason it was fine this time almost like the cushions have been replaced and I really enjoyed the ride. If flying on an A380 with 31"" or less leg room like Qantas you'll want to book a better seat as passengers behind you have no room and can hardly see the TV's quite ridiculous.

qantas-airways,/seat-reviews/qantas-airways,Qantas Airways customer review,David Jones,United Kingdom,2011-05-26,Sydney to London on the A380 paid $20 extra to get an exit row seat in order to get extra leg room (seat 66D) as I am over 6ft 2 tall. My main issue with the seats are that there was hardly any thickness to the bottom cushion of the seat so this made for a numbing 23.5 hours so much so that I was hardly able to sleep at all during the entire flight. I estimate that there was approximately only 2.5 inches of padding between the top to the mesh metal base of the seat. The B747 on the outgoing leg of the journey was a lot more bearable. Whoever gave these seats a Design Award must have had no sense feeling from the waist down or actually sat in them for a very short period of time.

With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins. Unfortunately not. The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control.

My shoulders had to be curled forward like a racecar as I could not flatten my shoulders completely. To exit the seat row I had to bend at a 45 degree angle. The cabin and seat was clearly ageing. The seat base was saggy and as the pocket was saggy it used up even more of the limited space.

As flight was near full having a window seat was a good choice. Seat width was wider than on an A320A330 or A340 and it was a welcome change not to feel so compressed in terms of the seat area and legroom. The downsides however were the constriction from the left side wall tapered inwards from shin to toe and headroom when standing to get out. Cabin felt dated despite the aircraft being younger than 5 years - this came about due to visible cracks in the plastic fittings as well as rather old looking mould on the seat in front and no tv screens anywhere.,BOEING 737-800,3x3,NA,Premium Economy,NA,6,4,2,4,2,1,NA,NA,1

I will definitely upgrade from now on if the price is reasonable. I was fortunate to have the aisle seat on the 4 seat center row and the seat beside me was empty! There was so much more leg room that I was comfortably able to stretch me bad knee out. The seat felt a bit wider too. I believe the food was the same that's served in Economy which on BA is pretty tasty. The only difference was that they came around with a basket of warm rolls tastier than the freezing cold ones you usually get. At the beginning of the flight they gave out warm damp hand towels very refreshing. Only problem was the couple in front of me reclined their seats all the way back the minute that they sat down. The person's head was basically in my lap. Unbelievable rude. I had to ask the flight attendant to request that they raise their seat during meal service or I wouldn't have been able to eat.

This is a problem when eating during turbulence as any liquid will almost certainly slide off the tray - this happened to me! The seat area is very draughty and cold - maybe just the bad flight I was on. The distance between the seat and the window is large meaning several pillows are required to bridge the gap (and support your head). I do not recommend paying extra for this seat unless you are over 6 foot tall and will benefit from the leg room.

eva-air,/seat-reviews/eva-air,EVA Air customer review,B Johnson,United States,2014-01-13,Spent the extra money on Elite Class and was quite excited until I sat down and saw the oversized entertainment box right directly where my legs should have gone. This is for window seats row A. All the window seats (and in K too) seemed to have this same problem. As a result you either have to sit diagonally with both legs on the left side or do the splits with a leg on each side but the problem with this is that the left leg's calf muscle will have the corner of the foot rest jar up into the muscle causing pain after some time. Also when fully reclined it is difficult to get your feet under the seat in front of you. The concept is good but the execution is utterly terrible and I was very disappointed not to sleep for the 10-hour flight because of constantly trying to juggle one of the above two positions neither of which worked.

When we returned home, the person on the phone rudely told me that no extra leg room seats were available - and when I explained that I had an extra receipt showing that I had indeed paid the price - she replied that I would be refunded the money..

This was one flight I couldn't wait to get off of it was that bad. The seat was hard and confining; the leg room stingy. The guy behind me continuously hit my seat back doing what I don't know. The woman in front of me used her seat back to bounce back and forth throughout the entire flight. Why? Because they just didn't have enough room. The space they allot you in your seat is pitiful and painful. Twice I had the cart hit my knee as it was pushed by and several times I had people brush up against me as they walked past because there is so little room in the aisle. Why is this acceptable for air travel? By the time we got off the plane my husband's feet and ankles were severely swollen and he does not normally have a problem with ankle/feet swelling.

united-airlines,/seat-reviews/united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Jaeger,United States,2015-01-28,"I had the most painful 6.5 hour flight from Newark Liberty to SeaTac due to these horrible seats. Everything about them is wrong. The seat bottom is too short the seat back is slumped or slouched even when fully upright and forces short-legged passengers to plant their feet into the floor to keep their hips from sliding forward and grinding their tailbones into the seat. The backs recline too far back to be practical in such an absurdly tight-packed cabin and will interfere with use of tray tables and hurt the knees of tall passengers unfortunate enough to sit behind a reclined seat. The armrests are far too low to be useful at all and dig into the thighs of virtually any average-sized adult. These seats are good only for illegal forms of ""enhanced interrogation"" and nothing else; three days after this flight I am still sore and have small bruises from the crap armrest digging into my leg. I'll do anything to avoid this terrible flight in the future. A general rule for those looking for good seats: Avoid 737s altogether especially the 800/900 series since those planes tend to be utterly crammed to the gills.

The leg room was sufficient for my height and body type (I am 5'8"" and 170 lbs) but for anyone taller or heavier it would be extremely uncomfortable.

The only advantage of flying this A380 is you notice less noise on the cabin. The mood lighting was not that great because it was set only to red and orange LED all the time. My seat was on the upper deck with less seats and less people. I think it is always better to choose such seats.

They have removed all storage in the seats and reduced the size of the fold down tray so they can have the seats closer together. Removing the seat back pocket probably allows an extra row of seats or more. However it means the fold down trays are so small you cant fit anything on it. Not a drink as well as the food tray It also means there is not storage space for any personal items - water bottle or books or magazines. The is a very slim magazine rack high on the seat but it is already full with the Thomas Cook mags. The seats do not recline and have very thin upholstery. The most uncomfortable I have ever been in. For a 4 hour flight from Turkey. I will never fly with them again and would advise anyone to avoid using them. The food was okay but a half portion of what other airlines provide. More like a hot snack. Service okay but they tell you to clean the aircraft before you leave.
